Loving DeOssorio has never let the lack of budget get in the way of telling one of his stories. His "Blind Dead" series started well but had some really laughable moments, such as photos of a small model boat in a water tank for "The Ghost Galleon". In "The Sea Serpent," he reaches the bottom of the pit and takes some notable actors along with him, telling the story of a silly monster that brings terror from the eyes to some water tanks and miniature aquariums. <br /> <br /> A vague opening sequence sets the stage and demonstrates an abortive military mission where American pilots, for some unknown reason, launch an atomic bomb (blatantly caricatured in the picture) somewhere in the ocean at off the coast of Spain. The military commander gives this order from an office that has a prominent American flag and a portrait of a ramshackled Ronald Reagan, one of the few things that makes this movie really look like the eighties. The other two are the hilarious and inept subtitle that declares the year as "1,985" and Sheena Easton's hairstyle from Tyria Power, which would have been pretty cool alongside some ripped neon sweat. <br /> <br /> One of the craziest monsters you'll see emerges from the depths, disturbed by the explosion caused by the bomb. We learned that the wandering atomic bomb killed much of the local fish. Unfortunately for our cast, it has no effect on the Marine Serpent, which quickly descends the coast of Spain into a miniature chaos. <br /> <br /> Now when I say that the monster is unrealistic, I am not exaggerating. . It is not just "sort of" false appearance. I'm sure the filmmakers did their best with the ten bucks that seem to have been handed out, but most of the time it looks like it was made of Crayola markers, a ping pong ball and an old sock. Not only that, there is sinister music that accompanies you wherever you go, music that looks very much like the theme "Jaws" which is a wonder no one has been sued. <br /> <br /> Along with Tyria Power, Timothy Bottoms and Ray Milland is surprised and the dialogue could not have been more daunting. Through a series of plot inventions, our main actors are thrown together on a mission to ... well, I'm not sure what the purpose is. Bottoms and Power have to prove that the snake is real to save their asses (he is guilty of a serpent-induced wreckage, she is locked in the hospice after a sighting). None of this matters, because until the end of the movie nothing was solved. No one admits that the serpent is real and is not even dead. In addition, Power and Bottoms are still in the law. <br /> <br /> As illogical as it may seem, no one but our heroes knows that the serpent exists (despite numerous disappearances, a destroyed lighthouse and a crushed railway bridge), and they embark on a protracted non-adventure to track down and chase the monster away ... do not kill it, since they know they are no match for it. His big plan is to use rockets to scare him. Although its scheme is poor, the snake causes a big explosion in the water after attacking a bridge stand (do not ask), and the giant marine snake is so frightened that nothing disappears. The critical viewer would wonder why the snake was not frightened earlier in the film when it caused some major explosions after colliding with a dock. But it does not matter. He disappears and our heroes are sure to be gone forever. The end. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine the horror the stars felt when they saw the full movie they just worked on. A lamebrain script and a couple of weak reaction shots could never have prepared them for the embarrassment of sharing the screen time with a half-spliced ​​puppet / stop motion beastie. At least the supporting characters had fun screaming and pretending to be swallowed by a giant snake head. I'm not sure what was going on when they did this movie; the monster is cheap but there are some pretty elaborate miniature sets so someone spent some time doing it, not to mention the stop motion animation involved. It's apparently played straight, though maybe the sense of humor in the movie has gone over my head. In the end, the film is nothing more than an easy target for a drunken comment. Watch at a party for best results.
