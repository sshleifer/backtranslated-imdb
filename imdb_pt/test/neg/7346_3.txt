Is not it depressing how Cartoon Network's most violent cartoon is directed at girls? While I'm not watching soldiers being shot and blown up in Private Ryan's Rescue or Band of Brothers, it would be nice if there was a cartoon or at least something on the TV that I could watch to satisfy my violent urges. And something I would not be ridiculed for watching. I've seen a few episodes (I really should be shot for it) and I had to sit in the movie (now, where do I find a gun?), And it's pretty clear that it lost its sparkle after the first few episodes. If you like to see monsters of 500 feet that can destroy huge cities in seconds being slaughtered by children a foot tall, it is a must. But that gets pretty annoying after a while, and with a show like this, even the original ideas become mostly boring. The movie looked like an episode too long (I do not remember any of that), and the villain should have been far more intimidating than a green monkey. This show is a laughingstock. He produces the same basic premise episode after episode after episode, and although he may try to have some mystery and intrigue from time to time, the ending will always be the same - "Powerpuff Girls Save The Day!" Everything is good and good, but everything is very, very repetitive ... I give it 3 out of 10 because it is the only cartoon in the CN to revolve around violence, even though it is aimed at girls, so I will not tune in to ever. I established myself as a fan of war movies and violence and I will not have that reputation destroyed ... 3/10
