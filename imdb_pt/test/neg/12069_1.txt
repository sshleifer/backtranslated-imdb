CAMPING BLOOD <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 (3-D nu-sight) <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> While hiking in the forest near the deserted Camp Blackwood - site of an unresolved murder ten years earlier - four young city residents are targeted by a masked psychopath who kills his guide (Courtney Harris) and lurks in the woods with murderous intent ... <br /> <br /> Low-rent time-waster, shot on a camcorder using the Nu-View 3-D sequential format. There is a plot at least, but the script follows closely an established project (with obvious nod to the likes of "Friday the 13th", "The Burning" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre") without adding anything remotely new or interesting to the formula. Director Brad Sykes - also responsible for similar 3-D efforts as THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES (2001) and BLOODY TEASE (2002) - cites the early work of George A. Romero and Sam Raimi as major influences in his career, but while Filmmakers Challenged With his efforts without a budget, Sykes uses video technology only to imitate his cinematic heroes, resulting in a home movie with delusions of grandeur. In addition to the 3-D format, there is NOTHING here to warrant anyone's attention. Followed by CAMP BLOOD 2 (2000).
