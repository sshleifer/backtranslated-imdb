I usually loved the Carry on movies, but this one is actually pretty awful. There are very few laughs because the whole thing is so forced. There is a lot of flair on the screen and some come out better than others. June Whitfield, Kenneth Williams, Hatti Jaques and Peter Butterworth are fine, but Barbara Windsor looks tired and Sid James is just tacky. Joan Sims does well, but in the case of the normally wonderful Charles Hawtrey it is simply sad. When you think about the sad end of your career, the movie is almost too depressing to watch. The film's homophobia is unpleasant and is a very unpleasant experience. The set looks cheap and unlike other movies in the series, the film is very clearly set in England. The sea side looks cold and there is little attempt to create illusions here. It looks like cheap production. You will be amazed at how miserable you become watching this, especially if you loved the series.
