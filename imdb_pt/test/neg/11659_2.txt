All I can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commentators. This is the city of God that meets the HAPPY DAYS. The bipolarity of the cruel bandit (one minute a relentless killer, the next minute of a Luv diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing. You can approach it in two ways: (1) A realistic and courageous film has become honeyed; or (2) a sappy, ABC-after-school-special with swearing, violence and cruelty to animals. Anyway, it just does not fly, does it? Why then did he receive so much praise? As others have implied, it gets the "vote of conscience" from the west. Show us poverty pictures to contrast with our soft, double-width theater seats and 44-ounce cokes, and let's applaud in the blink of an eye. But - oh - do not forget to wrap your coat, because the bitter pill of reality (tempting as it is) is difficult for us to swallow. <br /> <br /> I'm terribly disappointed that this movie would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are much more deserving movies out there. All I can say is: watch out for any movie that gets prizes (Oscar de Hollywood = sweet and sweet corny, Cannes Film Festival = noisy and noisy advertisement). To find the real jewelry, you will have to work hard for it.
