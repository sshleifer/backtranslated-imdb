Terrible movie. Just terrible. The beginning of this movie is like something out of a bad woman in the prison movie. Then it becomes a version of the B movie of Aliens. B-movie, in this case, meaning the addition of free sex scenes and women in lingerie. Oh, and a lot of the footage is exactly the same as the other two movies from the same company (including women in prison). The only thing that saved this 1/10 movie is that I've seen worse movies. Not many, not much, but worse.
