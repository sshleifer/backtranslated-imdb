Well, I fell in love with it. I saw the box for that in the store, and I confused it with "Girlfight", which I heard was great. In my own defense, the titles are similar, and they remake the art of the box cover, so it looked almost identical. Anyway, to summarize, they have obviously reworked the entire packaging / promotion of the cover to capitalize on the buzz / success of "Girlfight." I popped up and had a bad feeling when they started showing trailers for cheap movies from below for the video, and even worse when a video clip of the movie's main song, which sounded like elevator music and contained raw clips from the movie preceded the feature main. When I saw the first few minutes and Maria Conchita Alonso appeared, I knew I had fallen in love with it. (do not get me wrong, she's a talented actress, but I knew she was not in "Girlfight," the movie I had with the false impression that I was renting). <br /> <br /> So, in addition to being half-deceived and angry not to look any further, the movie was fine. The plot involves Belle, a young Latina who is the daughter of a former boxing champion. One of her best friends is a boxer, who - and I could see it all coming so far ahead of time that it was really a bummer - gets seriously hurt during a match with a middleweight champion called "The Terminator," which resembles a female version of a larger and more pumped Ike Turner. Of course, Belle decides the only thing to do is become a boxer and avenge her friend. She lives with her caring, protective, protective father (her mother died of cancer when she was younger), who happens to be a cop. His love interest, also affectionate and supportive, but protective, is also a policeman who works with his father. Hmmm, both have jobs that put their lives in danger in the line of duty ... imagine what's going to happen? She begins to train and meets a despicable manager who, of course, pretends to care about her, but only wants to exploit her. The hired actor looks like a low-rent Cary Eweles and is so young that he can barely get a mustache. His performance was also very, very bad. I will not even get into the plot because anyone who has seen Rocky, or almost everyone, knows exactly where this movie is going and how it will end. <br /> <br /> This was not quite a terrible movie. Most of the acting was good, and the lead actress was very good. There were good and strong Latino female models. The scene of the final fight left me kind of interested, even though I knew that everything was going to happen long before it happened. The actress who played Terminator did a great job of being pretty nasty enough that I really wanted Belle to kick her a dollar, and she twisted Belle again, though there was absolutely no surprise. My favorite moment (maybe the only time I was not angry about renting the movie by mistake) was when Belle slapped her manager after showing her true colors, yelling at him, and then turning around just to pretend to suddenly. punch and watch him retreat in fear, showing that she's really the only one in charge. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was very, very bad, my main complaint. One of her attempts to be smart was someone discussing boxing saying "size does not matter" and the female responding ironically, "now where have I heard this before?" Other lines that should have a dramatic impact are: "The doctors told me I never stepped on it again!" "Come on, you know you can trust me!" and "Your mother would have been so proud of you." I could go on and on. Nothing you have not heard a million times before in more soap operas or movies of the week. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm being too stingy - the filmmakers made an effort, and I sat down voluntarily ... but only because there was nothing left to watch while I worked out. You could do worse (especially if you're looking for a movie with strong female characters), but you can also do much, much better.
