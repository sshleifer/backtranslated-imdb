Now I know that a lot of black humor mocks typical black things like, for example, golden teeth. But that does not mean they're always funny. Do not be a threat is an example of this. The urban film certainly lends itself to satire. The problem is that Wayans and consorts not only try to satirize the typical "ghetto" culture, but also depreciate valid statements that are made in urban films like Boyz 'n' the Hood or Menace II Society. Personally, I think the creators of this movie should divert attention from the bowel movements of their white masters. Also, the movie itself is terrible. It's not absolutely funny. Jokes are racist. Instead of satirising the genre of urban films, the filmmakers show their views on the "ignorant" urban blacks (ghettos). Now there are some other jokes in this movie, but I believe that this is the main rate. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie sucks and manufacturers should use their talents to make a constructive comedy / satire film. They have examples in Men With Black Hats (which was made before this movie) and Friday.
