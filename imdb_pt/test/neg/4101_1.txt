What could have been a good story was destroyed by the ridiculous scenery of time travel. If something was changed in the past that changed evolution and humans never developed, the time machine would never have been built. If something from the past were brought into the present, it would have no effect on the past. <br /> <br /> I would really like the movie producers to pass their ideas on to a real scientist before finishing the script. Even if you suspend reality and assume that time travel is possible, you have to keep the logic. <br /> <br /> OTOH, Ben Kingsley seemed to be enjoying himself so much with his superior performance. All the other actors seemed to be doing the best they could as well. It was the writing that left them twisting in the wind. <br /> <br /> "Back to the future" dealt with it better.
