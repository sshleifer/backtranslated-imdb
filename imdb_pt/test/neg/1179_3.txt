This movie was really bad. First they did not even follow the facts for that. Half the film was invented and it was more about the cop whose mother was one of Ed Gein's victims. The acting was horrible, except for the guy who plays Ed Gein, but it's not hard to get in the way of playing a weird guy. Although I think it was horrible I gave it a three because they started with real photos of the crime. that was the best part of the movie. As soon as the introduction of the film was finished, the film went down. The writer of this film tried to spice it up, but it did not have to be. The story of Ed Gein is interesting enough without falsifying information.
