Hollywood had a long love affair with fake Arabian Nights tales, but few of these products stood the test of time. Most memorable were the Jon Hall films, Maria Montez, which have long since become the field. This is full of dubbed songs, anachronistic slang, and antics. It is a truly generous crop of corn from Mesopotamia, and almost intolerable nowadays. It was named for its imaginative special effects that are almost imperceptible these days, consisting mostly of photographic tricks. The only excellent and positive feature that survives is its beautiful color and clarity. It is sad to say that of the many films made in this genre, few of them come to the original "Baghdad Thief" by Alexander Korda. Almost any other Arabian Nights movie is superior to this movie. You're a loser.
