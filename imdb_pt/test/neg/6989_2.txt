If movies in which virtual reality characters come to life and all of them are tough men or female eyes look good to you, then maybe this movie is not a total waste of film. Needless to say, the overwhelming majority of people will find this to be an absolute hassle, with little acting talent, let alone a script. Yes, Athena Massey is nice to see, but that's the only positive thing I can say about this disaster.
