I'm sure any legitimate submarine would be happy to embark on the Seaview Uses (yes, SOS ...) Why, you can play basketball on the torpedo court, it's so great. And what about the bay windows in the bow, the best to see giant squid or mined fields that pop up out of nowhere? Did I mention the colored mess with the parrot on the shoulder? And the Admiral's cabin with what looks like a loft? Big sub bleeping ... OK, OK ... will never win any prize for authenticity. And if the sub is laughable, the plot is even worse. Somehow, Van Allen's radiation belts, hundreds of miles in space, "caught fire" will make global warming look like a roast. Pompous Admiral Nelson (Walter Pidgeon), along with his helper Lucius (Peter Lorre, looking appropriately uncomfortable), design a scheme to put out the fire by firing a missile against them. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of intrigue (sic) along the way, with a born-again survivor (and her puppy, too!) two "ladies" who never go out on their own, a passel of "red shirts" which are disposable, and trace holes large enough for Godzilla to go through. Get excited about Seaview being chased into what looks to be 60 miles an hour for another submarine - there's no need for advanced sonars when you can follow 30 feet aft. <br /> <br /> The film goes from one hook to another. other; the reward is so anticclimatic that it does not make sense, certainly not worth the wait 1 hour and 50 minutes. The technical advisor for this shipwreck must have been a 14-year-old boy with a pile of Popular Mechanics. magazines. Worth watching even if just to riff on top.
