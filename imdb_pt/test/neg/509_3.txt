I watched the 219 minute version and have to say dollar for dollar, it's probably one of the worst movies of all time. Now I'm not saying it's the worst movie of all time - but if you look at a cost ratio on how much an average person would like, this is a very, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> They say the biggest factor that makes this a bad movie is writer / director Michael Cimino. Rarely can so much blame be attributed to one person. If he was not so self-indulgent, such a bad movie could have been easily done in about 90 minutes - saving millions for the studio! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a completely unnecessary prologue that should be done at Harvard. The scene is HUGE but completely without context. You have no idea exactly what is going on, nor do you know why students (in particular, John Hurt) are behaving grossly. I find it very difficult to imagine a beginning like this in 1870 - and it seems much more like 1970. This is a half hour when you have no idea what is going on, who are the characters or their motivations. <br /> <br /> The next scene is 20 years later. Inexplicably, the two Harvard graduates (Hurt and Kris Kristofferson) are in Wyoming. So they went to the best school in America and now one is just a law man in the middle of nowhere and the other is .... well, what is John Hurt in the movie?!?! He only appears here and there and seems to be an idiot (the prologue) or a pathetic and senseless drunkard who goes out with murderers - even though he is apparently against them! His whole character did not make sense. They never explained why he was a Brit living in the middle of nowhere (it was impossible to hide his accent), why he bothered to come along with the hired army IF he was so against his perverse plan or why he would risk his life for a cause he did not believe in. As for Kristofferson, his excellent acting and better character definition made his character more credible, though he had moved him to Wyoming. And risking his life for a prostitute made no sense at all. <br /> <br /> This brings the worst aspect of the sky gate. Although the scenes are very long and need to be cut, the worst part of the movie is that the characters were like cardboard. John Hurt (a wonderful actor with nothing to do in the movie), Jeff Bridges and many other big names are there, but you have no idea why. In fact, in addition to Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert (as a prostitute with a heart of gold - well the cliché) and perhaps Christopher Walken, EVERYONE is completely one-dimensional. It's hard to imagine a movie so long that you do not know or understand the characters. <br /> <br /> Much of the film also seems anachronistic. Who would have thought of having a huge skating rink built in the middle of nowhere in 1890? I am sure that just getting the basic supplies in this region in the West would have been very, very difficult - and yet we are expected to believe that trains filled with skates and wood arrived instead of FOOD. Maybe if they had not spent a million dollars building and attending the skating rink, the farmers could have bought food and avoided this war against the stolen cattle !!! And what about the roller-skater guy? What does this have to do with a land war? <br /> <br /> The most obvious problem is that it is a movie where very, very little happens until the great battle at the end of the movie. There are many scenes of dirt and nothing flat. So much imperfection that by the time the battle takes place many members of the audience would have left or are now so hostile to the film that it is inevitable that nothing can save the film. <br /> <br /> As for the final battle, it was done reasonably well, but had problems. First, this little skirmish on the prairie lasted longer than the D-Day invasion !! Secondly, while the details of the actual events of the "Johnson County War" are somewhat schematic, we know that the characters played by Huppert and Kristofferson were never there, as they were both hung BEFORE the battle. Thirdly, I can not believe Cimino actually killed animals throughout the film - especially during the final battle. Although I am far from being a bleeding heart about animal rights, his need to use animal guts and actually kill some of the horses is a low point in film history. Watching and knowing that some of the horses died to get Cimino's "vision" for the movie is very sad. <br /> <br /> Finally, after the great battle, we have an epilogue. Although blessedly short, it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague. We see Kristofferson on a fancy yacht, so we can assume he's finally putting some of that Harvard education to work for himself. We also see a woman who seems to be one of those Kris looked at a few times during the prologue. Most importantly, nothing is said and you have no idea of ​​the end result. I read about it and found that the movie often has the wrong facts. <br /> <br /> Overall, to say that the film is long and needed a lot more issues, it was like saying that World War II was a "little discussion." Well, I certainly have seen much worse, but if you take into account the cost of production, I really think it may just be one of the worst movies in history. <br /> <br /> Finally, when a movie has In this so explicit nudity I notice the parents. However, as no child could watch this movie (even with a promise of sex), the warning is not necessary.
