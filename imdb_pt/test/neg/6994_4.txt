This Harold Lloyd short was not really much; is not one of his funniest efforts. Of course, I never see naughty boys as hilarious. That's what most of this story is, Harold and his wife, Mildred Davis, taking care of their two young children. One is a baby who is constantly crying and the other is a four-year terror that does everything except tear down the house. Letting the child create havoc again and again was not fun for me. <br /> <br /> The best part was the last four or five minutes, when the couple thinks that this great bully (Noah Young) is assaulting their house. Half the time is the pet cat scaring the couple, but overall, this segment is fun with some good jokes for sight, reminding me of Lloyd's other short, "Haunted Scary". <br /> <br /> However, the good ending does not save the whole picture, which I probably would not watch again. Lloyd did many other good things to waste even 25 minutes on this one again. It's not so funny.
