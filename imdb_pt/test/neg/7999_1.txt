Anyone claiming that this movie is a classic ninja movie, must have seen this movie before the middle of the nineties or it was less than 10 years before seeing it. Otherwise, I can not explain this title of 'classic ninja movie'. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes in this movie are simply intolerable. Instead of casting Franco Nero as the ninja, they could hire some experienced martial artist. Either way, acting ability is not important in this type of movie. Nero's evil fighting ability is from some street fighter in a bar. His kicks and punches are lame. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of old action movies with good action. This is just a waste of time.
