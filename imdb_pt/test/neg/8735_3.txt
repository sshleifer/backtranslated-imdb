First of all I would like to state - for the record - that it is incredibly stupid to call his film "Embryo" when the subject exclusively revolves around scientific research on fetuses (both animal and human) aged between 12 and 16 weeks. The embryonic stage ends at the end of the eighth week of gestation and from that moment the unborn baby enters the fetal phase. Okay, honestly, I did not know all of this, but I struggled to research, and that's also the smallest thing the Embryo creators could have done. Do not worry; I am not just stumbling over details or being overly bitter, for there are several other reasons to state why the "embryo" is a major failure. Current science can be considered boring and inaccessible, and therefore science fiction is a cinematic genre created especially to make topics tedious, yet educational, more interesting and understandable to larger audiences. In describing ambitious scientific experiments that go terribly wrong, or space missions that find aliens from evil instead of light years of emptiness, filmmakers are often able to entertain people with spectacular special effects while at the same time teaching little useful curiosities about science. To make a good science fiction film or at least half a decent one, writers and directors just have to stick to one basic rule: do not be boring! If they can not fulfill this condition, the viewer could also read a theoretically accurate book. Something must have gone wrong during the production of Ralph Nelson's "Embryo." The basic premise is potentially fascinating and even engaging, since we are all sensitive in saving the lives of unborn babies. There were also some very prominent names involved in the production, as the main stars Rock Hudson ("Giant", "Seconds"), Diane Ladd ("Chinatown", "Alice does not live here anymore") and director himself was responsible. for the acclaimed classics "Soldier Blue" and "Charly". So what went wrong? Simple. The script is hopelessly boring, clichéd, and the whole thing looks incredibly silly because the setting of the lab and the scientific equipment are clearly too primitive to achieve any medical breakthrough. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson, in a very bad performance, plays a doctor who has no passion in his research work since his wife passed away. When his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy night, his passion returns and he does everything possible to save the fetuses from dying animals. He manages to keep a living fetus, dramatically accelerates his growth process, and trains him to become an extremely intelligent dog. Because his procedure is so successful, Dr. Paul Holliston persuades his friend at the hospital to repeat his tests with the human fetus taken from the womb of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide. The female subject, unexpectedly, continues to grow rapidly, and after only a few weeks she is an adult woman, sweeping and super-intelligent. The good doctor naturally falls in love with it, but the new growth treatment also begins to show horrible side effects ... Absolutely nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the film, plus a lot of implausible and overly melodramatic nonsense. and one or two stunning tricks performed by the dog. That second half of the movie contains some (grotesque) action and suspense, but then the stupidity of the dialogues and the implausible twists have already ruined the potentially fabulous idea of ​​science fiction. There are some really cool scenes, most notably the chess clash between Victoria and Roddy McDowall (in a highly memorable and ultra-nasty supporting role). The grand finale is absurdly grotesque and literally on the verge of ridicule, and it almost seems that Ralph Nelson gave that disastrous final shot because it was the general rule in contemporary thriller and science fiction movies. The last sequence, including the horrible frozen picture at the end, certainly does not fit the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the movie. But anyway, my sincere admiration and respect to the dog and his trainers. An animal with such intellect and talent certainly deserved to demonstrate its tricks in a much better film.
