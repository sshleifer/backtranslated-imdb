Let me start by saying that I love horror movies. Big budget, low budget, big names of actors, no known actors, it does not matter. And when it comes to judging movies, I'm very forgiving. This movie, however, is very bad. <br /> <br /> Actors show little or no emotion when they deliver their lines and the acting is worse than many low budget horror films I've seen. When the actors are killed, you can care less. There is very little gore (I have no idea what movie the other reviewers watched when they say there is good gore in this, because there is not) and the special effects are subclassified at best. They steal so much from so many better horror movies (Jeepers Creepers, Friday, 13th, Leprachaun) and still does not help. <br /> <br /> Luckily I saw this on Showtime and did not really have to pay any extra money to see or squander a spot in my Netflix queue. There are so many better horror films out there and I recommend you see those instead of this big disappointment.
