I heard what people were saying, but I ignored them. Being rushed into Blockbuster I grabbed a copy of that movie and ran out. 45 minutes I was struggling to stay awake. There is some attempt to keep the film interesting, but it was bad. A chase of some sort happens, but it was long and drawn out - the perfect time to snack. By the time this movie ended I did not care about the ending, I just wanted it to end. Coming in and out of my room checking to see if it was over. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a clich√©, the characters and their relationships. The plot twists are predictable, as is the ending. The actors made the best of the really terrible roles. All I can say is: his clothes were cool, but the movie was bad.
