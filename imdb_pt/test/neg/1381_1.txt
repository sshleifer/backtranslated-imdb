In addition to the fact that this guy is a liar, he is also a total idiot and a thief in the comedy community. Once when I tried to watch that excuse for a television show, I think I actually vomited a little in my mouth. I can not help but feel a little dumber every time I see one of your horrible commercials while I'm enjoying great comedy central programs like Reno 911 and American Body Shop. This shows that I am concerned about the continued existence of humanity. It's hard to believe even Joe Rogan can make someone look like an idiot. Please start praying now that the central comedy will notice your mistake and close this show as soon as possible. Have not we suffered enough?
