I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience. <br /> <br /> It's a visually rich movie, but with slow direction, poor plot and two-dimensional characterization. <br /> <br /> I, however, knew this when I entered. I was willing to trust the two gentlemen I went with (comic book experts who know) that the visuals would be out of the ordinary and so were they. Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little dramatic tension or conflict. However, this is a comment that could be made of many artists whose work is transferred to the screen and to whom the direction is given. The pace of the story is lost as the camera falls passionately in love with the beautiful photos. <br /> <br /> I would not have gone anything without the assurance that the style of the film would be worth seeing. I tried with the work of Neil Gaiman, but I am always with the feeling of "emperor's new clothes". I live in hope, but last night was no exception. <br /> <br /> I do not think I can continue with an analysis of Gaiman's work without losing the will to live. Read the rest of the comments and all their faults are eloquently described. I can not understand, however, how he imagined he had any understanding of the mind of a fifteen-year-old girl, nor that what he had to add added to the sum total of human knowledge about growing up and taking on adult responsibility, or changing the relationship a girl can have with her mother. These are the central themes of the film and are treated in an inept, stereotyped way and with no depth of imagination. All the beautiful photos of the world can not compensate for a job that is defective at the core.
