Recap: Simon leads a small team of special agents who specialize in finding and returning missing persons, against all possible odds. Your last assignment is about the granddaughter of a friend of theirs. She seems to have been caught in the net of a particularly brutal criminal and everyone who sought her disappeared. But now the librarians are on the case. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is pure B-action, through and through. The key phrase for this is unlimited supply. There is unlimited supply of ammunition, they do not need to recharge once. There is an unlimited supply of thugs, so the heroes have something to shoot. There is an unlimited supply of breasts, many of them bare, in an attempt (and as always unsuccessful) to distract the holes from the plot. And there is an unlimited supply of bad acting (is it almost as if Erika Eleniak's performance shone in this, and what about it?), And actors who do not seem to care more than salary (and why should they when no one else looks like E as in most B action movies, there is an unlimited supply of bad shootings, but these almost seem to be a ridiculously bad type. <br /> <br /> I think I saw more realistic shootings when I played cowboy as a kid. But again, I also did not expect much, as I could from an action movie called The Librarians - and it actually delivers what could be expected.90 minutes of more or less bad action with some scenes to connect the dots between. I'm not sure I can call it fun, but he has not kept my interest for long. <br /> <br /> 3/10
