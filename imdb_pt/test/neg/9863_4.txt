I am a chess player and wanted to like this movie. The problem is that the content could have been assembled in a 30-minute documentary. <br /> <br /> There were many shots of runners being knocked over and Kasparov looking down the aisle where he won the World Championship. There were other scenes of Kasparov being traced to the departure site of 1997 and told where he was sitting and where Deep Blue was located. This just seemed filling. <br /> <br /> In addition, I did not find it interesting to see in detail where Deep Blue was now and see an IBM technician trying unsuccessfully to 'open it'. What would we have seen of interest in any way - a great little master? <br /> <br /> In addition, the recent game against Karpov. I no longer follow professional chess to know when and where this happened. Would it have been nice to have been told: this was a "just for the money"? Was that part of the world championship cycle? What was the end result? The heart of the movie was played in game two. Could IBM let Kasparov see "inside" the machine? That's where the focus should have been.
