I do not think I can add much more to what has already been said about this movie. However, I can offer a small reminder to see ST-V in the theater. In the last (terrible) scene, when the camera is leaving the camp scene and it seems likely that the credits will begin to roll at any second, the audience seemed to increase in unison. Usually, for a movie like that, at least some tough fans get to watch until the final warning. As people leave, I remember not hearing smiling, cheerful jokes, just low murmurs. <br /> <br /> I remember reading a movie review in the local paper where the critic said it was so bad that only the Trek fans would like it. What an idiot. The fans were the most apt to disassemble it first! <br /> <br /> Worst Favorite Scene: Shooting in a Voyager space probe, through a periscope not less! Space must be a much smaller frontier than we thought.
