I know the original Psico was a classic and redoing was a mistake, ESPECIALLY a remake shot-by-shot. I think this was more or less proven by the rest of the comments here. But there is much more wrong with this movie than just that. <br /> <br /> The first problem is color. The original film was filmed in black and white, but what few people realize is that the original was filmed after the color film was invented. The choice of black and white film was partly a budget concern, but it was also a stylistic choice for Hitchcock. Now, that does not mean that the remake should have been redone in black and white, but the colors in that movie are far too wrong. The most prevalent colors in the film are orange and green, particularly in Marion, which should not be a flashy character. Bright colors make it look like a happy movie, and when horrific events happen in these color schemes, it looks more like a cartoon than anything else and the audience is inclined to laugh instead of screaming. <br /> <br /> Second problem is enlightenment. This is a dark dark tale that should be highlighted by dim lighting, but this remake seemed to not only fail in this, but seemed to go in the opposite direction. Most scenes are very well lit, even when it's illogical to do so because it's at NIGHT! <br /> <br /> Another obvious problem is Vince Vaughn's performance. Yes, he takes the embarrassment and madness of Norman Bate very well, I do not deny that. But there is one element to the character that he failed to show: softness. There must be a certain deceptive friendship to the character, at least at first, which then disappears when we perceive the truth about him. In addition to being a character trait of Norman Bates, this is a recognized character trait of ALL PSYCHOPATHES. <br /> <br /> There are some good aspects of this movie. Some of the performances are great. As I said, Vince Vaughn came very close to making a decent portrait of Norman Bates. Viggo Mortensen and Juliane Moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original, which was a welcome change. Anne Heche may have been atrocious but, unlike Janet Leigh, who was falsely advertised as one of the film's biggest stars, Anne Heche received the latest credit in opening credits. <br /> <br /> I read on the cover of a copy of the Psycho novel that Gus Van Sant claimed was not a remake of Hitchcock's film but rather a new adaptation of the original novel. Now I would like to have bought that book and saved the comment because after watching this movie, that comment is possibly the funniest thing I've ever seen. There was no attempt in this film to disguise the fact that it was a robbery of the original, and it would be far more believable if Van Sant had tried to tell us that he was really a three-ton monkey on the planet Zafroomulax. So many pictures were copied exactly without any real thought about why Hitchcock had composed the original photo in this way. Like the scene where Sam and Lila are talking while their faces are completely covered in shadow. Hitchcock covered the faces of these actors in the shadow because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so that no one could see their horrible performances, not for any artistic or stylistic purpose. <br /> <br /> In other words, my review is as useless as the movie itself, because it replicates something that has already been said. Like everyone here, I recommend that you do not waste your time with this movie and get the original.
