I'm not sure what it is, but there seems to be some curse when it comes to movies about the elusive Bigfoot. There still has to be a movie that cleverly comes close to the subject, not one that creates any real suspense. Both "Legend of Boggy Creek" (1972) and the first film titled "Sasquatch" (1978) became smaller cult classics, but neither was memorable. Both films were targeted at the family audience, inhibiting themselves from actually trying to scare anyone. "Harry & The Hendersons" (1987) was the first big budget film to use Bigfoot, with a fantastic design of creatures of Rick Baker. However, they also chose to target the younger crowd, but this time as a comedy (as did "Bigfoot" in 1995). I waited a long time for someone to approach the subject as a thriller, perhaps in the vein of "Jaws" or "Predator". When I saw this at my local video store, I thought my dream came true. Boy, was I wrong! Lance Henriksen plays a billionaire who heads an expedition to the Pacific Northwest in hopes of finding his daughter when she was aboard a small plane when she crashed into the mountains. The premise is interesting and looks promising. The truth is, it never builds any real suspense. I've never found myself interested in any of the characters, since each of them was very two-dimensional and rather bland. Even the ever-reliable Henriksen seems to be calling her performance. Every time he appears on the screen, he seems bored. It should be like there is no action to speak in the first hour of the movie. As for the creature, where do I begin? I figured at least we'd have a cool monster running through the forest, but instead we got that bald man (yes, I said "bald!") Man with black skin and skin spots here and there. Imagine a cross between "Swamp Thing" and Chaka from "Land of the Lost" and you'll get the idea. Nothing like the work of art on the cover, I assure you. Sloppy editing and careless steering also add to the confusion as half of the time when everything seemed out of sequence, while the other half of the movie was constantly used with those long, slow fade outs (which did not make sense or served any purpose). They even stole the entire P.O.V infrared vision of the creature in "Predator," which just seemed very silly and out of place to be effective. Maybe all of this proves that Hollywood should forget to try to make more Bigfoot movies, as they still have to make one that works. So far, each one has been as scary as an episode of "In Search Of" 3/10
