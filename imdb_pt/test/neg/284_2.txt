SPOILER !! Terrible camera work, horrible writing, nonexistent plot and innumerable tangles. Wonderful performance! Except for Julia Roberts. Whoever misinterprets someone who is going through Julia Roberts, evil. Catherine Zeta Jones is adorable in this movie. <br /> <br /> During the movie, we zoomed in on each of the twelve (!) characters. Twelve is too much, even for a classic like 12 Angry Men. And the problem is that we tediously broaden the characters, when they are all in the same room, doing the same thing. <br /> <br /> Yes, Clooney is eating. Yes, Pitt is eating. Yes, the "Jew" is eating. Yes, the geek is eating. Yes, the bodybuilder is eating. Yes, Mr. Sensitive is eating. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes Yes. Yes. Phew! This happens at least three other times in the movie. Yes, they are all sitting in cars, bored. Yes, they are all being arrested, scared. Yes, they are all being taken out of a prison, depressed. <br /> <br /> But it was only when I got home that I realized how much they "got" me in that. This is an assault movie, right? That's what I went to see, right? But when I got in and put the keys of my car on the exchanger, only then did I realize: NOTHING, IN TRUTH, IT WAS STOLEN IN THIS MOVIE! That's right. It's an assault movie, where nothing is stolen. Oh, they try. They will try to steal some boring document or something, from some guy's house (whatever), and it turns out that it has already been stolen. 20 minutes of my life, wasted. So they try to steal some egg from some museum (YAWN!), And they screw it up and they're stuck. <br /> <br /> So we see how a French fairy face stole the egg even before them, and we have all the joy of "Entrapment" except that this time the person inside the tight catsuit dancing around the lasers False is ... an ugly, skinny French guy. But, in fact, he did not steal the egg either. In fact, our heroes stole the egg, LOOOONG ago, in another film entirely, which would have been a great movie to watch, if they had made that movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, we see a 30-second black-and-white clip about how they stole some college student from their backpack. You heard me ... the bold caper, the ultimate assault - the two-and-a-half-hour accumulation of boring crap - they're stealing a backpack from a college student, as they creatively get into a fight over baseball teams and distract them- and replacing your backpack with an identical backpack? What?? <br /> <br /> Ugh. I'm telling you, this was so bad, I did not even realize how bad it was - how much I had been stolen - until I got home.
