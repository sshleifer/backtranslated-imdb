This movie is not one of those movies so bad that you get angry and crazy because it seems to be so ass and still not quite funny. It's just that there's nothing interesting about this movie. There are no real jokes that make it fun, you just watch for 80 minutes and then you hang up. I bought this on very budget DVD and I'm happy because it's not worth much. This is not one of those movies that is so bad that you can watch it with friends when you are getting drunk / loud and have a good giggle. I did not hate how I hate some movies, but it's a bit annoying, and it's not worth investing at any time. <br /> <br /> The only people who voted 10 in the votes for this movie must have been connected. somehow because I can not imagine anyone really liking this movie other than small children passing the time
