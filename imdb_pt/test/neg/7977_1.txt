I bought this rental return for $ 1.99 in hollywood and overpaid. I did not expect much, but thought it would be something to fall asleep at least. I quickly noticed the very weak plot, the gross overshooting of everyone (no one talks like that except the cartoons), and the seemingly going-up-as-we-go-along direction. I know that the participants of this confusion must be very ashamed of this, and I am sure that this has not helped any career. As for this 35-year-old film, he has now provided a ready answer to the question of the worst movie you have ever seen. <br /> <br />
