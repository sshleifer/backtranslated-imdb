Rozema's 1999 adaptation of Mansfield Park is far superior to this seemingly more faithful film. The 1999 film is insulted by many purists of Austen, but I admire Rozema's work in creating Mansfield Park. It may not be strictly Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, but at least it was well written, beautifully filmed and well represented by a top cast. I do not see how the purists of Austen can be happier with this 2007 version of ITV (and rebroadcast on Masterpiece Theater / PBS). The script is well-glued and dull, production figures are mediocre, and the cast (with the exception of Jemma Redgrave and Blake Ritson) are largely guilty of poor acting. I can not think of a worse miscast of Billie Piper like Fanny Price. His gaze was all wrong (discolored hair and dark eyebrows ??) and his talent simply was not suitable for the material. Sir Thomas looked constipated all the time. Michelle Ryan as Mariah was on autopilot as well as the actors who played the Crawfords (when I think how superior Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davidtz were in the 1999 version, I kind of shook my head). <br /> <br /> I did not see the 1983 version, so I can not comment on that, but I advise anyone who is curious about giving the '99 version a chance. Read the novel before or after and make your own opinion.
