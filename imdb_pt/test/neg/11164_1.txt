I do not know what was worse, the viewer made the drugs, or the stars in this movie that look like drugs. I must believe that this woman raised this child for seven years and never realized that the child was a little dark? I must believe that your mother, your father and your husband have never said it once, hmmm this child seems a little somber? I must believe that when the courts ordered the mother to see the records of foster parents, Lisa Hartman had this look of surprise, when she told her mother, Christopher is kind of black! What ! That was for real, do you think so? So not only did grandma and grandfather seem stupid and stupid, not once did they mention it, but I think we should look surprised and say ... hmmmmm omg he's kind of black! Totally stupid movie, almost an embarrassment even to watch it!
