When I first watched this movie, I thought it would be good, because I had my favorite actor of all time. He gives an excellent performance, although it's pretty obvious he did not have to live more than a half finger to make the job work. He's the only good thing about it, unless you're in explosions and junk dream class American hero (which I'm not). <br /> <br /> I do not understand. How this movie can be so naf. That piece with the little boy being rescued, I mean, come on! You can not tell me that he would have been rescued without the face of the fire wearing goggles (I know he would have been pitch black and you can not see for more than a couple of feet in front of you) and no equipment of breath (he would have choked after 2 minutes!). This movie was just plain bad, okay? <br /> <br /> Why Robert? Please if this is your favorite movie.
