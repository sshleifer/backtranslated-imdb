Wow. Not because of the 3-D images, which were sometimes used very well to provide good deep images, but that bad end! The end of the movie seems to implode in itself. This movie has to be one of the most idiotic movie monsters of all time and one of the most pathetic attempts to explain it. The misogyny of this movie is painful too. If you're looking for a 50's sci-fi movie to laugh at (aka 'bot forder'), go ahead. Otherwise, look for better movies.
