Leslie Nielsen hits the bottom of the pit with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream movie I have ever seen. There is nothing to like about this movie as it is essentially a joke movie, and the joke is not that funny. How many times must we laugh at a man who is almost blind playing the fool? That's not funny, that's just unfortunate. Nielsen must seriously begin to refuse some of these pathetic scripts, and Stanley Tong needs to keep making Jackie Chan movies because it does not get much worse than that.
