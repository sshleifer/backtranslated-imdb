The film "The Tempest", directed by Jack Bender, was published in 2001. He did not make it to the German theaters and neither the director nor the actor could receive an important prize for this film. The film refers to Shakespeare's play "The Tempest," which was published in the late 16th century. The director attempted to create a modern version of this game, but failed. At the beginning of the film, the plantation owner, Prosper, comes into conflict with his brother Antonio about the treatment of his slaves. Antonio sets his brother on a journey and tries to kill him, but with the help of a witch, Prosper is able to escape and runs away with his daughter and a slave named Ariel to a small island near the Mississippi River. For over twelve years he has lived isolated on this island until a chance of luck allows him to take revenge on his brother .... If Prosper is lucky, you have to find out for yourself. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this film is really a poor attempt to create a modern version of the original piece by William Shakespeare. The story of the movie is as confusing as the characters. Prosper does not have the same powers as in the storm ... END OF PART I
