<br /> <br /> Dude, I do not believe in this movie. I watched it through (believe me, I did it!) And the best part was the traillers at the beginning (and I hate traillers !!!!). <br /> <br /> No plot, no performance, nothing. I was watching the movie and thinking, "When will this start?" It never started. How can people spend money and time to do such a crap? <br /> <br /> The "plot": A dog is bitten by a bat and gets angry - Okay, so far no problem, nothing special, but okay. Now the rest of the movie will be - the dog will chase people !!! that is, nothing more !!! Now add to this some of the worst acts / actors I've ever seen, some completely unrealistic scenes (and some really stupid ones, like the child can not breathe and the mother gives him a big big hug to see if he gets better), and a very lame ending, that's it, here you have CRAP ... ops! Whose <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and do something more dignified, like banging your head against the wall or playing chess with yourself. <br /> <br /> ZERO of 10. <br /> <br /> Gabriel.
