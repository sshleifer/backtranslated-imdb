First of all, I'm annoyed, there's no choice of a "0" out of 10. <br /> <br /> I was bored tonight, and while flipping through the channels, I see Dr. Chopper. Without further ado, I decide to watch it, hoping it's just another low-quality horror movie with a plot similar to Cabin Fever. <br /> <br /> Dude, I was wrong ... Dr. Chopper made Cabin Fever look like he should have won countless Oscars. I can remind you, Cabin Fever contains a scene of a country boy making roundhouse kicks off a porch screaming, "pancakes !!", characters who leave their friend dying in a small hut to bleed to death, and Shawn of Boy Meets World mistakenly fingering a hole in a girl's thigh. <br /> <br /> So it goes without saying that Dr. Chopper was a big, stinking pile of crap. It was not even a funny crap. It reminded me of a horror movie I had to do in 8th grade, called "The Campout." Except for the fact that "The Campout" had a better script (we wrote about an hour before filming), better actors, plot, bloody scenes and camera work. I was hoping to get some laughs from a badly made horror movie, but instead I could just watch in amazement as I thought to myself, "Was this done by eighth grade students?" <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible, the events and different subplots were played together and made no sense, and violence and violence were minimal. I liked it like a little stab, people died instantly, and the only weapons the assassins had were small knives ... if you're going to make a horror movie, at least give the killer an insane death <br /> < In addition, what the heck was the point the sisterhood girls trot their promises? Good way to bring some scenes of girls running in their bras, even if they have no relevance to the story. And I must say my favorite line was when the blonde told Dr. Chopper, "I'd like to introduce you to somebody ... my inner bitch." Your "inner bitch" then starts picking up a trash can, throwing it at Dr. Chopper, making mistakes and returning in terror with the killer. Wheww ... well, that was long, but I felt like I needed to express my feelings about how utterly awful this movie was. I know everyone has their own opinions, but if someone ranks this movie above 2, he should be shot to hell ... seriously.
