The horror. The film about the Nazis - the Germans. The baby killers, the young girl rapists ... Why do they repent? What are they interested in doing thousands of miles from Germany? You do not come to mind it? Are the Fascists now good Samaritans? Think, kill, tortured 27 million people. No, of course, they do not want to. They were forced to Hitler, he gave to each of them, and forced to kill: every quarter inhabitant of the peace of Belarus, all Jews, gypsies ... Killing the Slavs. The Facts: At the outset of the Great Patriotic War, when imprisoned by the fascist (German), they were defiant and brazen. We killed you all and so on. Since 1943, when they were taken captive, they suddenly became antifascist and peaceful peasants who were forced to Hitler and personally. For such films should be put to life for the glorification of fascism. <br /> <br /> If you want to see what they did, still went to Stalingrad, so I watched the movie "Come and see" (1985).
