Adenoid Hynkel, a humble soldier in World War I, emerged in the following years to become the relentless dictator of Toumania. He creates an aggressive anti-Semitic war machine and cultivates a bit of toothbrush mustache. Sounds like someone you know? From Hollywood's security, Chaplin uses this platform to exhort Europe to take up arms and challenge Hitler and Mussolini. Given that the United States in 1940 had more than a year of neutrality ahead and no strong desire to engage in European civil disputes (remember, it was Hitler who declared war on the US, not the other way around). surprising that Chaplin could distribute this immoderate polemic. History involves, on the one hand, the vulgar and repulsive Hynkel and the reign of terror over which he presides ineptly, and the life in the Jewish ghetto where every person is friendly, human, courageous, etc. Chaplin is Hynkel and also plays The Jewish Barber, the ghetto's little hero (The Tramp in everything but the name). Needless to say, Chaplin writes, directs, stars, composes music and does the catering. In 1940, the full truth was not yet known about the Third Reich, and Chaplin may be forgiven for having something less than a perfect historical forecast, but even by the standards of the day, he gets very wrong with Hitler. A comedian and a sentimentalist, Chaplin tries to ridicule Hitler by making Hynkel foolish and unhappy. All this is to humanize you. When Hynkel, the soldier not very warlike, plays with the big gun and the airplane upside down, it becomes captivating and not despicable. As a dictator, he inspects the technical innovations of his non-functioning subordinates (the parachute hat, the bulletproof uniform, etc.) and these passages are intended to make us think that real-life Nazis are incompetent and can be left out. In fact, Hynkel's regime is made cute and pleasant by his awkward caravan. In fact, Chaplin's day had already passed when he made this foolish controversy. In the background, he was still a silent screen dinosaur (check out the humor, with jokes like up and down the semi-conscious street, or the pantomime of coins in the puddings). The hero Schultz purports to represent a standard of European decency against which Hynkel can be tried, but Schultz looks more like a operetta character than a Nazi. Is it somehow credible that a Schultz figure (if any) would say to the FÃ¼hrer's face, "its cause is doomed to failure because it was built upon the stupid and merciless pursuit of innocent people"? And how does Schultz get to the cellars of the Jewish ghetto? If he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt, why does he persist in wearing his ruritanian uniform? Chaplin still did not know the horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka, but the Nazi concentration camp he offers us is hopelessly out of order with the somber spirit of the time. As usual, Chaplin thinks in terms of "silent" comedy pieces, loosely attached to the narrative's clothing line. There is the knockout knockout with the assault troops, leading a man to the accompaniment of Brahms, and the balloon balloon (watch the segment filmed upside down). <br /> <br /> Paulette Goddard is the incessantly perfect Hannah. Just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly agreeable, and the Jewish refuge at Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, so Hannah is literally too good to be true. Courageous, challenging, resourceful, hardworking and (of course) beautiful, she is the canary of Judaism in the ghetto cage. "Gee, am I not cute?" She asks after the barber gives her a make-up. Very cute, by far, is the answer. She does not come close to sounding true, because Chaplin made her a caricature. Would not that be wonderful? the speech that Chaplin puts in his mouth is typical of the author - too long-winded, very emotionally nauseating. Jack Oakie is great as Napaloni, the fascist dictator of Bacteria. It brings a commotion brio of comedy much needed for the process, but the underlying weakness of the film remains. If Napaloni is silly and ineffective, how can we fear him? And anyway, the stammering of the early train projected backward is a good chaplinian example of a gag that persists far beyond its comic value. <br /> <br /> And where did the Jewish barber get that immaculate Hynkel? uniform?
