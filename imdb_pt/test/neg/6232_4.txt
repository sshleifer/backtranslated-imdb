as in so many movies of the past, you'd think Hollywood would learn that now, it creates a very disappointing movie, not to mention that the kidnapped victim is alive before paying the ransom. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie wants to remember these basic facts, should it ever happen to one of us. Why the long walk in the woods and a guy in town can actually cross the forest without getting lost? Just an opportunity for some sentimental dialogue that had no meaning in the end. <br /> <br /> I had to hear some of the director's comments in the special features section of the great moves that Redford did in the past, (Sneakers for One) surprised, he agreed to star in such a movie. The director's comments and reasons were weak. <br /> <br /> The best parts of this film was the scenery, I can not wait for the arrival of spring.
