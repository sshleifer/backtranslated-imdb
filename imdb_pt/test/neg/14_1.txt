Some may go for a movie like this, but I certainly did not. A college professor, David Norwell, suddenly gets a yen for adoption. He practically accepts the first child offered, a bad choice called Adam. It turns out that Adam does not have both oars in the water, which, almost immediately, causes incalculable tension and turbulence to Dr. Norwell. This sad story unfolded with one problem after another, all centered on the inabilities and convulsions of Adam. Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor as an adopted child was never explained. Along the way, the good doctor managed to attract a wife to share all the hell the little girl was distributing. Personally, I think both were a beer with less than a sixpack. Ignore this yawn.
