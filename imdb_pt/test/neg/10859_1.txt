I would not recommend this. It was like being stuck in the middle row of a theater, so I could not go out and watch a partial porn movie (except they did not take off their clothes - it was body language and definitely language). I have to say I was ashamed. Filming was very low budget, without a good dialogue. Disgusting. Actors stink except the two best characters who were killed (?) And they were David Carradine and Dennis Hopper. That's what happened to Kill Bill and that old movie with the two guys who set the dessert on their choppers. You know what I mean. blah blah blah. The footage was grainy and only a very low quality. There was no one in that theater who liked this movie, and the people around me were younger and tattooed.
