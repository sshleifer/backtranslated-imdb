Spoilers are plentiful. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> I was completely disappointed, this being my first STREET FIGHTER movie I've ever seen (I dare not get close to the 1994 joke yet). Very little draws your attention on STREET FIGHTER ZERO (ALPHA), unlike most japanimation. The fights are hilarious along the board (Shun versus Zangief was a laugh) and the dramatization is very melancholy, especially at the end, when Ryu has to control everything in his fight against his brother. <br /> <br /> The main street fighter, Ryu, has weakened to a much darker version within himself. Frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother! A gloomy street fighting tournament is held with more than just fighting in the promoter's mind. <br /> <br /> What about the drawing of the artist's feet? Any anime drawn above the stomach is amazing. The smooth nature of the story makes the STREET FIGHTER genre very clever, and puts a lot more emphasis on a character (Shun), who is not even a video game fighter! A character study on more than just the main stars of the original STREET FIGHTER is completely ignored. How many times have you picked up the Rolento? Adon? Face? STREET FIGHTER ZERO does not have the imagination of the video game.
