The beginning of the film is promising. When Jeanne Pollet (Anna Mouglalis) hears the story of the incident that took place the day she was born, which raises the possibility that she is the daughter of a famous pianist, André Polonski (Jacques Dutrone), she began to discover whether it is true or not , and giving the fact that it also plays the piano that is not such a remote idea. Jeanne meets André and his wife "Mika" Muller (Isabelle Huppert) and her son and on the way discover the fact that there are some secrets in this family as much as she herself. <br /> <br /> O.K. We've seen this before and this was done in a more interesting way than here. The character of "Mika" Muller is left without us understanding her motives for her action and she is not interesting enough to take care of her. The piano scenes look fake and the whole sub-plot of the piano adds nothing to the insight of the character, but serves to make the film longer than it should have been in the first place. <br /> <br /> In short, a very disappointing exit from Chabrol, who can do better than that
