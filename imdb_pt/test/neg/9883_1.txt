There were only two redeeming features about this film; the beauty of Bucharest and its architecture, and the way they represented the transformation of the human form into the wolf form. Forget the plot or plot of the book - they are completely missing from this movie. In fact, the only things brought out of the book are the names of the main actors. Even so, you will barely recognize the characterizations. If the filmmakers made a good film, though unrelated to the book, I would not have been so disappointed. Unfortunately, they did not. The plot and story are typical of low budget horror films, the acting is woodworking and the worldly steering efforts. Oh yeah, the way the loup garou bows to his leader is pure hoke. I suppose a nod of recognition is due to the animal manipulators. Wolves were beautiful, well-behaved animals in their roles.
