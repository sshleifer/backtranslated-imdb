I watched this movie, having seen the original "Spoorloos" a few times in anticipation of the final chilling. <br /> <br /> I can not even begin to explain the anger and disappointment that I felt when the ending came and went, and the film continued to have a happy ending. What a waste of time it was to watch this remake of the US ... <br /> <br /> If you have a choice, please skip "The Vanishing" and watch the original Dutch "Spoorloos". The suspense is very well built. You feel the frustration of Rex, in search of any trace of what could have happened to his girlfriend Saskia, after she entered a gas station and never returned to her car. The quest lasts three years, and when he finally gets in touch with the person who knows the truth about what happened to Saskia, he must agree to go through the same thing that Saskia has gone through. The end leaves you speechless in your chair ....
