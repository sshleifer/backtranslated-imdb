This movie was rented for free, I had no misconception about this being a really bad movie. I rented it for Thanksgiving because we ate turkey and the family watched a horrible movie. So you ask, what makes this movie so bad you just gave it 2 stars? Dialogue. The lack of dialogue makes this a perfect movie for a deaf audience. In fact, if you rent this, simply turn down the volume to zero and put any heavy metal CD of your favorite artist. I know you'll have a better time. The plot of this holiday turkey has been so overloaded with technology and geek talk that you need a translator for the narrative. Now for all people who enjoy good science fiction effects ... huh, they're not much better than video game trailers or cut scenes in worse cases. The actors, both, are not much to look at either. They do not say anything during the whole movie. Many of the technicalities will make you laugh like the scene where the hero attaches himself to a missile and shoots the city 70 km away (never showed how it landed). The scene before that we see a robotic sentry shooting at it with a cannon 12 feet away and it loses several shots. We are also told that the political divide between the antagonist and the protagonist is biotechnology (genetically improved beings) against cyber-technology (human beings enhanced by machines), but both seem to be cyborgs or humans improved. What told me it was a bad movie in the video store was the cover that looked like a video game cover and there was only one copy, good new releases have many copies available.
