THE PLOT: A truck driver (Kristofferson) fights with a corrupt sheriff (Borgnine) by gathering his truck companions and forming an unstoppable convoy that stretches for miles and soon creates a frenzy in the national media. <br /> <br /> THE NEGATIVE: The setting of the film is weak and the ending even weaker. It has all the good-ole-boy / trucker cliches without adding anything new in the process. This ends up making SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT look bright and inspired. Kristofferson is very laid back for a starring role and can not upload the photo. Borgnine's character is portrayed awkwardly. At first, it's made to look like a real shithead of a sheriff who turns into a minor gimmick that makes the whole thing roll. So in the end, he's made to be a bit more understanding and even secretly ally himself to Kristofferson, which does not work at all. In both cases, Jackie Gleason is a much better actor for this type of role. The worst part of the film, however, is director Peckinpah's attempts to launch a "serious message" in this silly action movie that does nothing but delay and bomb him. <br /> <br /> THE POSITIVE: The only good scene in any movie is the fight sequence inside the truck stop restaurant. Director Peckinpah gives a funny twist to his trademark 'slow motion' violence and the result is fun. Unfortunately it starts to put all the action in slow motion during the rest of the image until eventually it becomes tiring. McGraw is always a pleasure to look at, but unfortunately she gets very little to say or do. <br /> <br /> THE LOWDOWN: If you read the synopsis of what you essentially 'saw' the movie. The song on which this film is based is very good, but the film does not add anything to it and should never have been done. This is all very uninspired for such a rebel director. <br /> <br /> THE RATING: 3 out of 10.
