The story is about the late business priest Daniel Clemens (Christian Slater), who is looking more closely at a case in which another priest is suspected of murder. The priest denies that he is guilty but at the same time he is not able to discuss the matter because of confidentiality. Enter Daniel Clemens who starts playing cop ... <br /> <br /> While the plot is not ridiculous, everything else is. Let's start with the visual side, cinematography is monotonous, it looks more like a TV series than a movie. The camera angles are boring, in fact, there is not a single camera angle memorable throughout the movie. There are no interesting closeups revealing details. And the transitions of the scene, well, there is not much to say about them, they are not at all smooth, there seems to be no connection between the scenes than the actual plot. Ok, they used a transition with music between two scenes, but there are no interesting visual transitions throughout the movie, dissolution times were used, there was no visual connection between the scenes. <br /> <br /> The annoying visual part could be forgiven if the movie would offer anything else. Unfortunately the film only offers forced woodwork and clumsy dialogue without punch. In addition, the movie suffers audio problems, the sound volume is reduced several times in the film as if the microphones were too far away. <br /> <br /> I do not foresee the solution of the movie. It may be because the film never gave me the opportunity, or it may be due to the presentation, which was so boring that I did not even try to figure it out. <br /> <br /> Put two plus two together and equals a B-movie where 'B' means boring.
