I do not care what anyone says, this movie is hilarious! It combines the somber seriousness of Threads with an anarchic mix of alternative comedy, and the results are a severely somber but outrageously funny satire on the brinkmanship policies of the western and eastern blocs of the time. You have to give filmmakers credit for even trying to overcome the real life madness of "Duck and cover" or "Protect and survive"! <br /> <br /> Imagine someone making a movie based on Dead Kennedys 'Kinky Sex makes the world spin', and you're very close to Whoops! Apocalypse. Add Rik Mayall at his best as an insane OTT SAS commander and you will have it exactly. A fitting piece for Dr. Strangelove, and that's saying something.
