Even a horrible 1 is too much for this movie, everything from start to finish made you cringe. I do not think it would be possible to squeeze over excessively clich√© moments into a piece of mind numbely numb film waste. <br /> <br /> The block of prison cells H finds Thunderbirds, hell until Virgil's expressions were more like life I have not even finished seeing this and I'm here now ... Oh no, the palms of 3 actors and a scenario made by a child with adobe premiere. This is really the end of my phase "I started so I'll finish watching you" <br /> <br /> Oh joy, the credits came to rescue me. (and relax)
