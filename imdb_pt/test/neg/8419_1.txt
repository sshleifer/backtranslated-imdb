I watched this video because I like Malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there. Very disappointing since you can not catch any of the taste or beauty of the island - just the warm, dry and sterile elements. The film was monotonous, boring, completely incoherent from beginning to end, pretentious and devoid of any conceivable plot. You had to be a medium to follow the plot, or the lack of it. He had his moments, of course; but so does the dentist. <br /> <br /> In short, I'd rather endure another colonoscopy before I see this terrible mess again. It was so bad that I really could not sleep. There are some "Eurotrash" movies out there that were obviously made without adult supervision. This is one of them. On the plus side, who is Nadia Cassini? Never before have I seen a more beautiful leg set. She's the only saving grace in this movie. <br /> <br /> Disturbing, too, was the cruel boar hunt described in the final credits. A boar that was released on someone's property (Malta has very few native mammals, all of them little rats, bats, etc.) and then attacked by dogs before being shot. Oh, well - go visit Malta anyway despite this movie - it's a beautiful and colorful island; rich in history and lots of fun.
