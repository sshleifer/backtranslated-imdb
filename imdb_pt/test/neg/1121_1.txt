It makes the fourth theatrical release (what the National Lampoon took the name of OFF) looks like a comedy classic. A complete mistake and a sad attempt to capitalize on a once-proud franchise. Painfully bland and unpredictable ... even for a TV movie! The character Primo Eddie became progressively less fun, from the original vacation when he was young and unique, to the Christmas holidays, when it was starting to get a bit slimmer, to Vegas Vacation, where it was really annoying to see on screen , to be fair, there were MANY things that were annoying to see appear on the screen in that movie!). But this attempt to move the character to leader status is regrettable to say the least. Holiday movies themselves have met an ugly death in Las Vegas, and that hope of reviving even the finest segment of the television series was completely wrong. Chevy Chase and company put together a great trilogy when it was at its height; Now let's just pull the plug and let the title rest in peace. (A small note of interest: The original Audrey Griswold - Dana Barron, the first of four actresses to play the role, including Juliette Lewis - returns to the role 20 years later!
