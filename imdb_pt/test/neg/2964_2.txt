My wife and I remember that this movie is so much better than it is. When we rented last week, we wondered if we were watching the same movie we saw 22 years ago. We both agreed that we were probably remembering the TV series, which, in its one-hour segments, was forced to fill plot lines. This movie leaves many topics loose, as has been mentioned by others here ... basically, the story of each main character is left unsolved. <br /> <br /> However, you liked the title song.
