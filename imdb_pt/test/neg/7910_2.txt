After a humiliating experience on an airplane, Nashawn Wade (Kevin Hart) sues the airline and uses the money he earns to create his own full-service airline. What makes its difference is that it has sexy flight attendants, a dance club on board and nothing less than Captain Snoop Dogg in the cockpit. <br /> <br /> Soul Plane is a very racist comedy, except that it is occasionally funny. Soul Plane was described as an "urban" version of the plane. The problem is that Soul Plane does not even get close to getting the airplane laughter. The jokes on Soul Pane are very offensive and uninspired. I'd be lying if I said I had not laughed since there were some funny moments. However, I was expecting more and left the theater disappointed. <br /> <br /> I would compare Soul Plane to Airplane 2. The latter was just a replay of the first movie, while the first is just a repetition of outdated, crude jokes. There is really no creativity behind the film and there are only a few fun points. However, I do not think Soul Plane is "inferior 100" bad. Now, the film is ranked at number 82 and that's a little rough. I'm not saying that this is a good movie, but neither is it terrible. The race time is only 86 minutes, so it's not very difficult to watch. For stupid comedies, you can do much worse. <br /> <br /> No one in the cast is very good, but everyone seems to be having fun and it helps. Kevin Hart was very annoying as Nashawn. He had some funny lines, but he is a very poor leadership man. Snoop Dogg, who was slightly funny in Starsky and Hutch, is completely disapproved here. Tom Arnold was really bearable and that was the biggest surprise of the movie. The most boring person in the movie was Ryan Pinkston. He was not funny at all and will never be funny. The funniest members of the cast were Missi Pyle and Mo'Nique. They gave the best lines and made me laugh more. In the end, Soul Plane can fit the bill if you're looking for a stupid comedy, but it would probably be best if you just skipped the movie. Overall Rating 4/10
