If this is not very present in all "what not to watch" lists, it should be only because those who maintain that particular list are not aware of its existence, which, in so doing, is the acceptable alternative. I'm not joking, this is a "bad" movie. Joseph Meeker returns from the dead, with various indefinite, indefinite supernatural powers, the more employed seem to be appearing in new ones, increasingly comical and ridiculous (and never frightening or scary ... in general, when that happens, bizarre, and attempts at the first simply do not work, period) clothes and stereotypes / archetypes, and he is portrayed by David Keith (which I respect in ... well, at least Daredevil), doing more often than not terribly inconsistent which might also have to do with the script) and often on top performance. One or two characters have such incredibly annoying personalities that they are painful to watch. The edit thinks it's considerably smarter than it really is (and what on Earth was red-toned for flashbacks?). Cinematography ... oh, dear. Framing, coverage, effective use of angle (which one could be attributed to editing, too, perhaps), please guys, stop me when I say something you've heard about the existence of. With regard to the technical aspect, this is a very bad excuse for something more useful to put on the projector than the film not exposed. But why stop there? The plot is just poor. The basic idea has already been made, and has been made much better than that (The Raven would be one of them). The way it is told is puzzling, and although there is some explanation behind the flashbacks, it still does not satisfy. The pace is almost non-existent. The lead is clearly unpleasant, and there is more personality in a barn door, not to mention that they are also considerably less wood. Kelly Perine and Thomas Ian Nicholas? What in the name of all that is good and just (pun intended) are you doing this? Perine, you were funny before that, at The Drew Carey Show, Nicholas, well, I did not see you in anything that needed American Pie, but if nothing else, you got * funny later, and in those productions, the fun was intentional. Dialogue is ... the less said the better. Language is unrestrained and tends to be stupid. The violence is badly made, and they do not even seem to mind trying to hide it (hinting it may have been the smartest strategy). Characters, do not make me start. Why waste so much energy on portraying uninteresting, sometimes totally illogical events? The more you think about it, the worse it gets. It's neither acceptable as a "bad horror movie," or a B movie (it may well go through the rest of the alphabet, and go even further), it could not scare you into the scariest day of your life if you had a machine scary electrified. I recommend this only to people who want to disprove how bad this is, and do not say I did not warn you. 1/10
