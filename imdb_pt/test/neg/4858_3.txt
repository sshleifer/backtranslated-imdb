This short 22-minute short, from a precursor to the much better "Rock and Rule", features two popular singing mice that are going nowhere. The female rat, Jan, signs a deal with the devil to become a rock star. Then it's up to Daniel Mouse to save his soul. Made in the late 70's, it has all the pitfalls of that decade (crap music, clothes and hair style, terrible folk melodies). This drawing is featured on the second disc of the Rock and Rule 2 Disc Collector's Edition, it also comes with a Making of which runs almost as much as the show itself. <br /> <br /> My notes: D +
