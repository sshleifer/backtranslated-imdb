Parties: The Clonus Horror is not that bad of a movie. I have the MST3K version on tape and it's hilarious, but it's still not the worst movie I've ever done. I'd say it was better than 80% of the movies they mocked. The concept could have worked if they had a better script, more money and decent actors. It could become a classic if it were not so boring and a little more exciting. Unfortunately, it was damaged in production and ended up in MST3K.
