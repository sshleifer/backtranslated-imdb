I was anxious to see this movie, it looked like anybody who had loved it. I was completely disappointed. The acting was so exaggerated. The script looked like the writer had collected 25 different scripts from several films and randomly chosen dialogues and assembled to form a plagiarized script. Spoilers: Has any clich√© been omitted in this movie? There was a violent coup, homosexuality, prostitution, a serial killer, a fire, numerous aspiring godfathers, the main character in love with the prostitute, treason, torture by the police, Hannibal Lechter-style mutilations, I could go on and on. <br /> <br /> Line is like (the godfather aspiring to prostitute) <br /> <br /> "Ben senin arik calismani istemiyorum" (I do not want you to work anymore) <br /> - "Ben calismasam kirayi kim odeyecek?" <br /> <br /> Unreal Scenes: We never saw a single cop during the scenes of the serial killer, but when the main character disappeared, his father was taken by the police and tortured by weeks. <br /> <br /> The only way I can make sense out of this whole movie, is if the version I had scene was severely edited from the original. I definitely would not recommend it, and would love to discuss it further with anyone who wished to do so. <br /> <br />
