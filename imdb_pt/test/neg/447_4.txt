I can not honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow-up to John Landis's classic comedy horror movie of 1981. I suppose you can not really describe it as an original werewolf movie, since the bones of history steal elements of London: An American tourist visits a famous European capital, he narrowly survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague. , he embarks (losing the pun) in a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession, he turns into a werewolf, he is visited by apparitions of his dead victims, etc. etc. and reading the previous line, I just discovered how much the plot has in common with the original that looks very similar indeed. The difference is how much fun and fun is the Landis movie <br /> <br /> With this film based in Paris there are no scenes that really stand out. There is no naked man waking up in a zoo wondering how he will return home without money or clothes, there is no sequel to bizarre Nazi dreams and there is no spectacular climax. The AAWIP tries to be funny, but is there anything more embarrassing than the failed humor? I'm thinking of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone that he has chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two films is that there is no poignancy involved with this dubious follow-up. You really feel sorry for the fate and dilemma of the protagonist in the London movie, here he feels that Andy is nothing more than a cipher going through the literary movements of a script. There are also a large number of visible holes. Is this the first time the Lunar Club has carried out a massacre? If not, then, is not there a large number of corpses with hearts ripped out in the world press? Why the police have no leads? <br /> <br /> Everyone else mentioned this and so did I. Visuals are bad. Look at the bungee jumping scene in The Eifell Tower, it is painfully obvious that this is achieved through some blue screen projection while the werewolf's transformation is done by a very caricatured CGI. I'm not going to put Anthony Waller in the same step as Stephen Sommers as a director who totally spoils a movie because of an over-reliance on CGI (The big problem with AAWIP is the script along with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the movie ). 1981 classic movie), but I would have preferred the Rick Baker-type special effects used for the transformation. To be fair, it is reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget has not stretched so far. But at the end of the day this is a pretty poor horror movie that DOES NOT NEED TO BE DONE AND DOG SOLDIERS is much better entertainment
