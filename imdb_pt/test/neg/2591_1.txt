I'm generally quite tolerant of movies, and very easily entertained, however this movie was terribly disappointing. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie after seeing on the cover that William Zabka was in it (The Karate Kid bad boy) and during this movie I could see that this would be the only reason. <br /> <br /> This movie is a tremendous waste of the talent of the actors. The music and sound are terribly cheesy - I could not believe it from a movie made in the 90s. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie unless you were interested in one of the actors.
