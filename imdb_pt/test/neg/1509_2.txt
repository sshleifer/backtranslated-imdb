Truly awful garbage. This movie does everything wrong except the run time in less than an hour. Gore FX defies gravity and logic. There are no scares. The acting is awful, with everyone seeming to be reading their lines. There is an amazing ending that is just silly, where we find that the things we have seen happen or have not happened. Boy I hate to end the cops! They keep this thing with pictures of people who do nothing interesting (like make-up or talk about what seems to be forever). Do they have to fill in a movie less than an hour long? Ridiculous. The story itself is very strange. I mean, it's just a variation on the movie APRIL FOOL'S DAY, as I remember that movie, and this movie was not that good. The only good thing I can say is that it seems to have been well filmed. Too bad that nothing happens that is very exciting.
