Although the comedies of Our Gang still have their followers, I must say that their attempt to graduate in feature films, courtesy of Hal Roach, was very short. Why did Roach have to choose the Civil War as it is subject with all the racism that would follow? <br /> <br /> The arrogant gentleman Phillips Holmes receives the young orphan Spanky McFarland and his young black friend Buckwheat Thomas after Spanky, inadvertently. exposes a fraud card on a boat. Everything is placid and serene in the Old South and then the Civil War comes to ruin it for everyone. <br /> <br /> But even children can charm the worst in the world and there is nothing worse than these damn Yankees. They just come south and ruin it for everyone. <br /> <br /> Although criticized from the southern point of view, Gone With The Wind made a good case for the cause of the south and the blacks portrayed, although servis that they are out of necessity are still three-dimensional characters. Hattie McDaniel would not have won the Oscar if it had not. The character of Butterfly McQueen, by Prissy, as foolish and empty as she, has any dimension. <br /> <br /> Here is, perhaps, one of the worst racial stereotypes ever produced in Hollywood. The company of Spanky and Buckwheat shows that children get on well, racial feelings are acquired rather than endogamous. It is not the servility of blacks that is objectionable, but there is full acceptance of it. Since that horrible watermelon song, sung on the title credits, General Spanky's message is bad. <br /> <br /> However, he received an Oscar nomination for sound recording, probably one of the few Hal Roach. already left the subject field short. <br /> <br /> General Spanky is far from gone with the wind.
