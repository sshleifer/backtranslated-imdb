The wind. Easily one of the worst movies ever made. The only good that comes from this kind of nonsense is the fact that watching films like this one get distributed makes indy horror filmmakers, like me, trust that my next feature will also be made. I mean, if this represents the market for indy horror, I could make a fortune filming myself taking out the trash for 83 minutes. <br /> <br /> A complete list of what is missing in this movie would take a long time to write. But, the highlites are: no story, terrible acting, horrible cinematography and virtually no editing. The latter bothered me the most. As an editor, this movie made me absolutely crazy because it had almost no editing. Each scene was filmed in a master. They had absolutely no cover. For those who do not know ... "coverage" is recording a scene from various angles to have cut options during editing to make a viewing experience desirable. Yes, this movie had none of that. I'm talking about the simplest of scenes. Example: A common conversation scene between two people sitting at a table usually begins with a master stating who is on the scene and where they are. Then, as the conversation continues, you cut back and forth over the shoulder photos as the conversation continues. You can even throw a shot or two pieces of something on the table, or in someone's hand. Anything. This is the staff of "Film 101". It seems that these people had no idea how the movies work. Every shot was a camera lock. No movement, no cut, nothing. If I was giving a film course, that would be the visual aid to my lesson "What not to do". <br /> <br /> To close, do not waste your personal time. The amazing thing about this movie is that it always marked distribution. <br /> <br /> <br />
