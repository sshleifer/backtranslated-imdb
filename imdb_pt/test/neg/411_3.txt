A rich, EXTREMELY fast book, stimulating, interesting, rich in detail. It's a pity that the film has none of these qualities. not only was the gentle portrait of Tom Hanks or Robert Langdon Laughable but the name changed to key characters, huge deviations from the original story and a faint Irish / Italian Carmalengo accent played by Ewan McGregor, made for the worst book to film EVER . As a big fan of the book's A & D, I had high hopes for a more luxurious film, faithful to the detailed book, where it would begin and end exactly as the book did - leaving me wanting more All the movie really depressed me in the first 10 minutes. What impressed me was how ... sorry! I could not even finish this sentence without laughing. <br /> <br /> In short - Vittoria was the hot token, a second to Audrey Tatou and there were some really cool Alfa Romeos. I recommend reading the book to understand that if Ron Howard should insist on making another book to film, I would be happy saving my Â£ 6.40 for a KFC zinger meal and a few chicken wings - a lot more fun and deeply gratifying!
