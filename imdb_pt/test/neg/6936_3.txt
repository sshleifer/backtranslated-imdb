Eugene O'Neill's 4 1/2 hour game in 1927 hit the screens in less than two hours. The combination of the symbolic dialogue piece with the Gothic melodrama did not age very well and the cast has some difficulty with it, especially Norma Shearer's Nina and Ralph Morgan's Marsden. Clark Gable as Ned Darrell does better, but mostly because he is a rude character, not given to the philosophical reflections of others who fit best in Gable's reach. Once the plot sets in the love quadrilateral and the audience adjusts to the narration, the film becomes more enjoyable. The technique used here for the section is another problem. On stage, the action froze as the actors spoke their thoughts to the audience. Here they are made as voiceovers. You'd think that would work better, but since the action does not freeze anymore, the actors are forced to stop talking and make faces to the camera to match the emotions in their thoughts. Also, it's hard for any movie fan to watch this movie and not think of Groucho Marx's hilarious parody version of "Animal Crackers". Added to these drawbacks are some cuts made for reasons of censorship (Nina's promiscuity is diffuse and there is no mention of her doing the abortion that is more central in the play) and an unfortunate note (uncredited) that sounds like weepie background music of the turn of the century. O'Neill called this film "a horrible hash of attempted condensation and idiotic censorship," and although "Strange Interlude" is far from as large as his later "The Iceman Cometh" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night," it certainly deserved more than that.
