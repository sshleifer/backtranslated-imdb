If Halloween 5 was a cruel joke for fans of the series, that Halloween 6 is a cruel insult. The plot was for all the dogs. Michael is used as an impotent pawn in this movie and he is not at all scary. It reminds me of an overweight alcoholic than the bogeyman who hit the fear in our hearts back to the original. There's almost no redeemable quality on this feature and I'm so happy H20 came out because it would be an insult to fans to have this be fresh in our minds. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 had about 2 aspects that I liked. Having an adult Tommy Doyle in the movie was a nice touch and hooked it up to the original. Donald Pleasance is here (in his last performance ... what a bad movie to end such a good career). When he's on the screen, it makes you remember the good old days when Halloween was really scary. <br /> <br /> That's about it, my friends. The stem sequences are not original. One of them is a blatant drag from Laurie / Michael's chase in the original. The other characters are terribly written and just plain unpleasant. The music, about the highlights of Halloween, even when the film is bad, is tortured in this movie. we have a silly rock version of the stalk / chase theme. What were they thinking when they made this movie? Their biggest mistake was killing Jamie's character (now played by another actress who's not worth mentioning). We watched this character escape from death in two movies. We root for her and when she is dead in this movie you can not help but feel sorry for her and realize that filmmakers do not care when good characters are set in a movie. <br /> <br /> * End of SPOILER * The less said about embarrassment, the better. I wish it did not exist. I suggest skipping this movie, and up to 5, and going straight for the H20, because if you watch this, you may not want to see another Halloween movie again.
