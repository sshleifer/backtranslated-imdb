G & M started a strange couple in Man About the House and went on to amuse the nation on their own sitcom. <br /> <br /> What was the typical small-scale personal charm of couples' chemistry on the small screen? G & M's transfer to the big screen was as terrifying as that of Morcombe and Wise, of the genuis, and countless TV shows. <br /> Unfunny. Unsatisfying and featuring a sick Yootha Joyce who died before the movie was released.
