I had not heard anything about this project until I saw that it would be on, so I watched with a completely open mind. And, of course, the cast is full of strong players. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately. . . it's awful. I do not mean that it is not good; I mean, it's extraordinarily bad - sometimes ridiculously, but most of the time it's boring. Its strongest appeal comes from having attractive people as naked as the US TV network will allow, but it is all provocative and without substance, and having nymphs as supporting characters can not justify several hours of bad TV. <br /> <br /> are two basic problems that the cast can not overcome. First, the script is * awful *. Yes, making changes in the myth of Hercules (which is certainly not a monolithic story in the first place) is traditional, but this version is relentlessly tedious and often changes (and sometimes downright boring), with a terrible rhythm, borrowed bits from here and from there (and various parts apparently belonging to different films), and really horrible dialogues. The dialogue is often unbearably bad, in fact, to the point where you feel embarrassed by the actors. Sean Astin, apparently now typified as second banana, seems especially overwhelmed by one terrible line after another. There is no coherence of tone or atmosphere and little cohesion to the plot. <br /> <br /> Second, most of the special effects are really bad. REALLY bad. Occasionally, there's a bit of decent computer graphics, but most of the time you feel really embarrassed on behalf of the cast. I have no idea what the budget for this project was, but it sure looks like crap compared to "Clash of the Titans" or even "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" and does not even compare very favorably with the old Lou Ferrigno and Italian films of 'Spaghetti' Hercules. Just painfully miserable. <br /> <br /> There are many other problems - the story is unnecessarily complex and can not keep up with itself, and Hercules himself is not presented as a very interesting character. Almost everyone who does not have a European accent tries to fake someone of some sort, which is not merely amateurish and dated, but never really made sense in the first place: the drama does not get better just because the actors use British accents, then everyone. But the terrible script and the equally terrible effects sink the whole thing up straight away. To be fair, "Hercules" was apparently intended as a four-hour mini-series, but truncated (for that display, at least) to a three-hour TV movie. I do not know what they cut, but it's possible that the issues have made things worse. I do not think you could make "Hercules" good by adding to it, but that does not mean continuity, say, has not suffered with network edits. There is no way to watch the US version to see, though.
