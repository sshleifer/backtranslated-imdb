I do not know if I hate this movie as much as I did when I watched it two weeks ago, but if you're expecting the events described in the box, forget it ... it would be a good movie. The great fall described in the box is nothing compared to the descent in total despair that I took when seeing this film. If you've seen the HBO Taxi Cab Confessions, this is the same thing, just fictitious and not even remotely interesting. If you really want to see something interesting about a taxi driver, check out the short 20 minutes they run into Encore from time to time ... it's really worth watching. I've never, ever asked my money back for a movie until I saw this ... thing. Boring, boring, annoying. It offers a unique feature, which is this: lets you decide what happens to each of the passengers, letting your imagination fill in the gaps. Which would be great if you really cared about any of these people. Instead, I found myself screaming on the screen, crying like a child, praying for the end of the movie or for my own death. The cab driver himself (though well touched, considering) runs through the emotions seemingly at random, from sarcastic to sympathetic from enraged lunatic to apathetic. Sometimes it is appropriate, most of the time it is just a display by itself. "Damn, I learned all these emotions in the acting class, and I'm going to use them!" Now that I've been thinking about it again, I hate this movie as much as I do!
