It looked cool from the cover of the movie, but after five minutes we were not sure if it was a homosexual documentary in the history of the west side without any female interest. The quality of the film was poor, and there was hardly enough gang fighting action to sustain the interest of the drunkest person long enough to watch the whole movie. May God have mercy on the souls of the actors and filmmakers, responsible for what I can describe as my new and only reason why I will never want to see (or trust) an Australian film made again. I have to write more then I will say again that the actors were so bad that I'm sure I could make a better movie with fifteen dollars and a box of Trojans. Please do not watch this movie for your own good.
