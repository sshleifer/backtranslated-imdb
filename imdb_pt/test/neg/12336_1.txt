We can see who the good guys are. The Union. And who are the bad guys, a rich man who steals elections and his spoiled son. The filmmaker forces us to see the good of evil. All the characters hate the bad guys so that when watching the movie, this can help us to hate the bad guys. This is the worst kind of movie - manipulative and childish. The plot revolves around a policeman who is between good and evil, and he is trapped in this ugly movie. It's boring and pointless. The narration of the star Keach is very bad. And a good actor, Don Stroud, gets the most out of him, playing the guy nobody likes and does not like. It takes a lot of time for this hole to take off and for the title to assert itself; then, when it takes off, it falls a minute later. Boring. One of the worst movies ever made.
