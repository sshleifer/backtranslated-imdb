Other commentators have described this film as "1950s SciFi classic" with clever use of stock footage and documentary, and intelligent character interaction. <br /> <br /> Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is the classic SciFi of the 50's ... but the SciFi of the 1950's is the most stupidly pestilent. <br /> <br /> Consider that the first prey of the Mantis is a radar station shown first in the air, then on the ground. .. but the station is (air) pictured as on top of a mountain, with snow on one side and semi-clean dark ground on the other side, but when (on the ground) investigators visit the site, it is suddenly in a flat, uniformly white plain, miles from the nearest mountain. <br /> <br /> Consider also the pseudo-scientific babble ridicule of the highly recommended expert who is brought in to examine a huge claw. He says, "Well, we know of one thing ... it can not have come from an animal, because all known animal species have a skeletal bone. Even reptiles and birds have bones." He then says that some creatures ... snails, mollusks, insects ... do not have skeletal bones. Excuuuuuse me? Let's define "animal" here. Not even in the 1950s, someone over the age of six could have this man as a specialist in biology because he clearly does not know what an "animal" is, nor does he have the ability to name several broad categories of animals without bony skeletons. (sharks, rays, jellyfish, insects, mollusks, arthropods, gastropods, sponges, arachnids, echinoderms ... you have the idea.) The characters are cardboard, 2D stock types ... scientist, girlfriend, big monster bad. Nothing here shows any sense of creativity. No pulse, no signs of life. <br /> <br /> There are no witty dialogues, special effects are foolish even for their time, and filming is employed with imprudent disregard for continuity. This is the production of B movies in their worst state, with a production team that clearly could not be bothered to try, even without enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Use sparingly as sleeping medicine or punishment for small children who are easily offended by bad science.
