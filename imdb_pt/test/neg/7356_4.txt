An American family moves to the interior of Spain to live in an isolated house. Regina (Anna Paquin), the teenage daughter of Mark (Iain Glen), who is ill and has some mental problems, and Nurse Maria (Lena Olin), notes that strange things are happening in the house and with her younger brother Paul Stephan Enquist), but his mother does not believe her. Reggie decides to investigate with her boyfriend Carlos (Fele Mart√≠nez) the origins of the house, and discover that forty years ago, the place was the scene of the death of six children. Reggie decides to ask for support to his grandfather Albert (Giancarlo Giannini) to protect his brother against the house and his father. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD expecting to see a good house horror movie haunted mainly because of the names of Anna Paquin, Lena Olin, Fele Martinez (from "Thesis" and "Open Eyes") and Giancarlo Giannini. Besides, I really like Spanish cinema. Despite this, I found a terrible script, a horrible direction and a deplorable performance of excellent actors and actresses. The intention of the story is good, slightly recalling "O Shinning" in some moments, but unfortunately is poorly developed, it is never clear, for example, the reasons and reasons why the American family moved to Spain or the horrible relationship between the members of the family, especially the situation between Maria and Reggie. The direction is confusing, barely trying to use shadows and shadows to give scary effects to the story. I love Anna Paquin, but her expressionless face never works in this movie. Lena Olin is a caricature of the great actress who is; and Stephan Enquist is too weak for such an important role. Only Fele Martinez performs well in his supporting character. I liked the open end of the story. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Seventh Victim" ("The Seventh Victim")
