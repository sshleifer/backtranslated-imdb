Vendor Lenny Brown (Woods) is rapidly losing his ability to sell the proverbial ice cream to the Eskimos. Given the chance to shine in California for a philanthropic entrepreneur, Brown and his wife Linda (Young) live the high life of investments in tax shelters; a fortune they lose when the federal government changes tax laws. <br /> <br /> Seven hundred thousand dollars in the red, and needing a 'boost', the walletless yuppies begin to suck up vast amounts of Colombian march Sprinkle their hooters until they meet hungry monkeys on their backs . After a brief cleaning, Linda's Coca-Cola-induced miscarriage sees Lenny once again moving like a pinball between headers and frowns. <br /> <br /> A contemporary version of Albert Brooks' perverse echo of Reefer Madness, The Boost was overshadowed in the spread of tabloid revelations about an alleged case between Woods and Young, and their tumultuously tumbling . Woods, then fianc√© of horse trainer Sarah Owen (now an ex-wife) allegedly slapped $ 2 million on his co-star for "emotional harassment" during filming, citing night-time Fatal Attraction calls to his fiancee and, in a noteworthy incident, supposedly leaving a mutilated puppet on his and Owen's doorstep. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the lack of chemistry between supposedly loving connections is one of the most depressing aspects of this last journey. Exploration film - the only real passion that Woods demonstrates toward Young is when he's kicking her around the room. The script is also hilariously terrifying, perhaps mitigating Young's almost comatose performance when he listens to "stay with me - until I fall from Earth" to thrill. Moreover, given Woods' dramatic personality, his nervous ancestry loses all credibility when it really seemed that way. Ultimately, the thrust must be seen in the context: in the 21st century, cocaine use is ubiquitous. However, in 1988, with America still involved in a "war on drugs," the nation's own fiber seemed to be in danger - hence one of the most infernal - and therefore hysterical - representations of drug abuse.
