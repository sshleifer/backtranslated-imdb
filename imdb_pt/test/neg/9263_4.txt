This movie is a big hassle. It has an abundance of predictable plots and endless feelings from the start. It starts well with an elegant number, but seems lost in the middle. <br /> <br /> The chemistry of Surya & Jyothika on the screen works very well and a good part by Bhoomika. Why include Vadivelu in it? It totally disappears after a good half hour! Santhanam proves his wit again with the comedy of time. <br /> <br /> AR's songs will surely last for some time. But he could have done better. Whatever the downsides it is still worth seeing once if you feel alone at home or looking for a good time-pass.
