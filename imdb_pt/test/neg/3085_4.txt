I saw this movie right in the middle, undergoing a breakup. It was about 3 in the morning and I was struggling insomnia with a quick snack. It was not that bad at the time, but every time I've tried to watch it ever since, I can not get into it like I did that night. <br /> <br /> At the time I found it handsome and I loved the variety of characters, although they could have done better than the Goran V in my opinion. But the only thing that kept me watching was Heather's character and her sad "engagement" with her husband who did not want her anymore, which made me feel sorry for her and cheer for her at the same time. (Considering I was in a similar situation at the time, maybe that's why I liked her so much.) It's not a bad movie, but you have to be somewhere close to the character romantically to enjoy it, and let's hope that you never are.
