I hate it when people in the movies talk back on the screen. It's one of the main reasons why I stick to DVDs or videos. I saw The Clearing on DVD, but if I had seen it in the movies, I would have to stand up and shout, "He's not dead, you're going to die!" <br /> <br /> The Clearing is another in a long list of horrible movies featuring Mr.Redford. Eagles Legal, Havana, Indecent Proposal, Up Close and Personal, Tennis, Last Castle, and Spy Game. If Robert Redford told me to invest in anything, I would do otherwise. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing you can do for an audience is that. Let's say you're being kidnapped and your kidnapper has a gun. He's been holding onto you for most of the movie. You turn the table over to him and start strangling him. Whatever you do, strangle him until he's DEAD! Do not just strangle him for ten seconds. Keep it! Ten minutes at least. But Bob stops very early, walks away and forgets Mr. Kidnapper until ....... He gets up, finds the gun and holds onto our hero again. At that moment, I wanted Mr. Kidnapper shot Robert Redford. More than a few times. And I wanted to kill him too.
