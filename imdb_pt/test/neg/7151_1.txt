Help, I ended up in movie hell! What a stupid movie this is. There's really nothing good about it. <br /> <br /> Let's spit: <br /> <br /> 1) The story is unbelievably exaggerated: an anti-EU terrorist group is chasing a bunch of guys heading for Western Europe carrying a delivery of transparent bags filled with xtc tablets. And the worst is: they're serious! <br /> <br /> 2) The level of performance should embarrass all faces involved. <br /> <br /> 3) Some money guy decided to let each one speak English for the international market to catch. Ugly advertising ever! The native French and Dutch languages ​​intelligently speaking make all sense, and the result is laughable. <br /> <br /> 4) The soundtrack is totally misplaced and poorly chosen. <br /> <br /> 5) The camera, editing work and effects should be some style style road movie noir, but hardly worth anything and do not want to follow this story (read: anti- story). <br /> <br /> 6) Hidde Maas. The Wildschut hero never fails to convince. A real actor. Normally I would give him an extra point just because he was around. But no, sorry, not this time, I just would not forgive myself ...
