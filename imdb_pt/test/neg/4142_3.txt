This movie was a complete diappointment. There was no development of history. The spectators were thrown into the story without explanation and left to defend themselves by trying to figure out what was happening. The action sequences were very confusing. They were not the Matrix and they were not Crouching Tiger. This movie is best left to cable TV where you do not have to pay to see it or convince a friend that they should hire you and then go and see it. As a big fan of Jet Li, I expected more. How did someone involved with Once Upon a Time in China put their name on this?
