I would give this movie a zero if I could. How could anyone evaluate it above is beyond me. Until I see Rollerball, that was my choice for the worst movie ever in a big studio with a real budget (claiming Mangler 2 or Leprechaun in the Hood as the worst of all time is not saying much, they should be bad) Tim Curry's mother may have needed surgery or something to agree with this nonsensory junk. I'm really not sure what happened here. The novel was great, director Frank Marshall had a solid record with Alive and Arachnophobia (maybe they should have changed the title to 'Africa'), the cast was good and the budget was there. You'd think someone would have bothered to read the script. <br /> <br /> You'd better watch Battlefield: Earth again than waste time with it. Congo makes you yearn for the return of MST3K
