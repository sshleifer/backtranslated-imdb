If you really really like movies with ants building dirty mirrors, eating non-ants and conquering the world with a narration narrative, then this is the movie for you. Basically, some scientists working in a bio-dome communicate with highly intelligent ants (the smarter actors in this film) in an attempt to thwart their plans for conquest and extermination. Throughout the film, the two scientists (and a girl they rescued from the ants) use everything at their disposal (computers, green paint and horrible action), but to no avail. I think they just could not buy pesticides because the movie would end too fast. <br /> <br /> The title of the film "Phase IV" is a mystery. This is not a spoiler, but "Phase I" starts shortly after the opening credits, until you reach "Phase IV" until the end of the credits. Apparently, the director knew the film would be tedious to get through and then put Phase 1-3 throughout the film as a kind of progress report: "Wait, my friend, just one more step to the final credits!" As an episode of MST3K, this was not very good for two reasons: 1) This is from Season 0 in KTMA when they were starting, so the riff is not as good as in the following seasons; and 2) This movie is so bad that not even J & TB can illuminate it. There are one or two Gamera references as they had just riffed 5 Gamera movies. <br /> <br /> The movie has a trick / surprise ending, but I was so happy to get to the end the effect was lost on me.
