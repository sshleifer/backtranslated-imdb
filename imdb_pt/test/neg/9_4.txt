The reviews of David Bryce nearby are exceptionally well written and informative, as they almost say everything I feel about DARLING LILI. This massive musical is so quirky and super-blown, more produced and must have caused disruptions at Paramount in 1970. It cost 22 million dollars! This is simply irresponsible. DARLING LILI must have gotten a green light from a council meeting that said "hey, we got the Pink Panther guy and the Sound Of Music guys ... we'll get that too" and handed him a blank check. The result is a hybrid of GIGI, ZEPPELIN, HALF A SIXPENCE, some MGM 40's song and dance numbers of a style (daisies and sailors!) So futilely old-fashioned they look like musical gruel and MATA HARI. The production is colossal, exuberant, breathtaking, but the rest: the ridiculous novel, Julie looking dazed, Hudson already dead, the moody comedy and the incredibly boring songs that end this spectacular movie annoys. LILI is like a mega musical from the 1940s with some common parts to spice up. STAR! released the year before unfortunately fell and is now being finally appreciated by the excellent film is genuinely is ... and Andrews seems sublime, mature, especially in the last half hour ...... but LILI is POPPINS and DOLLY ruffles and I believe that really killed the mega musical spree of the 60s ..... and made Andrews look like Poppins again ... which I believe was not Edwards' intention. Paramount must have collapsed collectively when it saw this: and with another $ 20 million oozing in CATCH 22, and $ 12 million on a clear day and $ 25 million in PAINT YOUR WAGON .... they had a financial chasm of CLEOPATRA ratios with $ 77 million tied in 4 films with very uncertain futures. Maybe they should have asked Daisy Gamble to see the ON ON CLEAR DAY ...... LILI was very popular in the first launch in Australia and ran in 70mm theaters for months, but once failed in submarines and canes and only ever Arise after that on a night with a clear day like a double Sunday night. Thank God, Paramount has had its $ 1 million simple LOVE STORY movie (yes, ONE MILLION DOLLARS) and the $ 4 million GODFATHER that is also poised to get back $ 77 million over the next two years. for only $ 5 million. ... incredible!
