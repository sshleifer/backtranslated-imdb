Wow, I was very disappointed. I was not really planning to see this movie in the movies, and I would like to continue with this plan. It must be a movie made for TV. I was kind of excited to see this, since I'm a big fan of Fairuza Balk, but this movie did not do it justice. In fact, I'm a bit disappointed with acting everywhere. What a hideous cover-up of Fairuza Balk's tattoos, it bothered me every time I saw her shoulder. <br /> <br /> There was no flow to the film, it was very difficult to get into it. One scene we get angry, excited, we want blood, the expectation increases, so the director takes us to another scene to show the love between Annie and Bobby. It would have been nicer to follow him if it were divided into three comic book comics. <br /> <br /> There was also little logic behind the characters chosen to play some parts. The gangster leaders were skinny, not very credible guys. Matt Dillon, head of a mafia organization? Come on, give me some time. There was simply no intimidation there. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack .. wow. I think this is one of the worst scores I've ever heard. What terrible guitar solos, my god. The sound of my teeth grinding was more pleasant to my friends, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there is one positive comment I would like to make about the film. The settings were well done. I liked the colors, a good job transmitting that period of time.
