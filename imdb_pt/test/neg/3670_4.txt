The cast (and direction) in Undercurrent is tasteless than inspired by this clunker noir that fails from the start to get off the ground. Robert Taylor's wooden style represents an almost immediate stumbling block for highly affected Kate Hepburn and is bad chemistry from the start. <br /> <br /> Na√Øve (innocent and innocent) He falls in love with the handsome aircraft manufacturer Alan Garroway (Taylor) and runs to the altar with him. She soon learns that there is much she does not know about him. As Alan becomes more remote, she plunges even deeper into the dark past and Ann soon finds herself living a nightmare instead of the American dream. <br/> <br/> Undercurrent looks like some Hitchcock plots, but Vincent Minnelli quickly states that he is no master at suspense. Hepburn is not violet and she is difficult to sell to a character more suited to the reticent styles of Teresa Wright or Joan Fontaine. Minnelli never got Kate to desperately put off Taylor's limited abilities as an actor. His attempts appear as silent Gish while Taylor's wide descent into madness takes hold of Bela Lugosi contained. Robert Mitchum completes the confusion as the sensitive brother. Talk about stacking. Director of Photography Karl Freund provides some highly stylized noir interiors, but Minnelli and cast humbly use the atmosphere and tension remains tepid. With Minnelli away from his forte (musicals) and Hepburn's victim role setting her up as a bad Undercurrent suit drowns everyone involved.
