I did not read "A Time to Kill" by John Grisham, and maybe that helped to understand the film better. But maybe not. I have heard that this is Grisham's most faithful adaptation yet, and if this is true, I can see why so many publishers rejected the novel when Grisham introduced it as his first work. "Time to Kill" is one of those movies that is seriously confusing and wants to do a lot of things at the same time. It wants to be a thriller of suspense pleasing to the public and at the same time a movie dedicated to exploring certain social and moral issues.Let's face it, these two types of movies do not go together in Hollywood, which is why "Dead Man Walking" had to be done independently. The story involves a young lawyer named Jake (Matthew McConaughy) to defend a black man named Carl (Samuel L. Jackson) from murdering two horsemen who brutally raped his youngest daughter.the day before the trial of the rapists, Carl hid in a closet in court, and when the rapists were taken by the building, he shot and killed them.To help with the defense, Jack takes the help of a former law student (Sandra Bullock) who proves that his role in that film was totally unnecessary, and put the film for marketing purposes only. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, one of the rapist's younger brother (Kiefer Sutherland) was annoyed that a black man killed his brother and decided to take revenge. All this leads to a front-of-court shoot-out, a kidnapping, a brutal beating and a racial mutiny. I admit that all this caught my attention throughout the film, in addition to the court footage. What I later opposed was the way the film deals with ethical issues and the use of formulas in the plot. <br /> <br /> The main question that the film constantly asks, over and over again, is whether a black man wins a fair trial by a white jury. Of course they can, but that does not mean that the man has to be acquitted so that the judgment is fair. This movie, however, does not seem to think so. In addition, there are several holes in the plot used for conveniences. For example, there is an unknown character named Mickey Mouse who is a member of the Klan and, for unknown reasons, is helping members of the defense team escape the serious dangers of other Klan members. After Bullock is kidnapped by Sutherland and company, and left to die in the wilderness, this unknown person comes and saves her - and we NEVER find out who he is and why he is helping the people he should be terrorizing. Speaking of Sutherland's reign of terror, it's amazing how the police and the Bullock character block him throughout the film. There is a scene in which Sutherland becomes a sniper from a building across the street from the courthouse and tries to shoot Jake as he leaves, firing at one of the guards. Now you think that since there are dozens of cops around, it would be easy to surround and capture the sniper. No such luck. As far as we could see, no one seemed to care that a shooter was still on the loose. Even after Bullock was rescued by Mickey Mouse, she never mentioned who the kidnapper was, nor was she even questioned. Why that? Simple. Sutherland's character was needed throughout the film to add continuous suspense, though logically, he should have been out of the picture. <br /> <br /> In addition to Bullock's character, there is another ungrateful character. He is Jake's assistant, played by Oliver Platt. There seems to be a reason for your character to be in the movie - to provide a number of one-liners to the audience. In my opinion, one-liners show great weakness in "serious" movies when used. This demonstrates that filmmakers are not confident that story and dialogue alone are enough to hold the audience's attention, and then use them to make the audience laugh to reassure everyone who is watching an entertaining film. <br /> <br /> But enough of the little problems in the movie. And the message of the movie here? Of course Carl is really guilty of murder. We saw how he planned for hours to kill the men who raped his daughter. Lawyers argue that it was temporary insanity, etc., that led to his killing. In desperation, Jake asks the jury to close his eyes while he reports the rape in detail as part of his final argument. After describing everything that happened, he adds in a final line ... "The girl is white." We then see members of the jury with tears in their eyes. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, a girl comes out screaming "He's free! He's free!" Wait a minute! Do jurors base their verdicts on their emotions or facts? Above all, why were not there scenes that showed the jury deliberating and what they were really thinking after their emotions had dissipated. I'll tell you why. They could not show deliberation because no jury could acquit a man of such a crime, no matter how much the final defense arguments touched their hearts. What is the message? That someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for a previous crime done to them? <br /> <br /> This film should have had the courage to say that the murder is not OK in this situation, because in reality, there would be an acquittal. But because the dollars were at stake, the filmmakers were more concerned with saving the public's feelings than with presenting a responsible message. If people start killing as a form of revenge, the creators of this movie should be held accountable. What a socially irresponsible movie!
