I found this movie extremely homophobic ... the main character does not know that he is gay until he realizes he likes Barbra Streisand and has a flaccid pulse !!! I was so offended that after the screening at the Toronto Film Festival, I went upstairs and talked to the screenwriter to complain about this movie. This is the kind of film that GLAAD needs to work to have banned.
