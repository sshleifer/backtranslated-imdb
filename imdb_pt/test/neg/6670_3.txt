As I write this, Norman Wisdom is a very confused man who spends most of his waking hours laughing and shouting phrases of effect to his increasingly suicidal nurse. <br /> <br /> In fact, as you read this, he will probably have joined the afterlife and the obituaries will record a nearly 80-year career of hysterical making from the amiable funster with the crooked checkered cap. What most of these obituaries do not remember is how Norman wisdom had already committed a form of suicide in the late 1960s with that frighteningly poor, yet strangely appealing, role in his film career. <br /> <br /> Are the signs ominous from the outside ?? "Tony Tenser Presents" goes the titles. Do you scratch your head? "Where did I see that name before ...?" Well, in the titles of many of the cheapest and cheapest British films of the 1970s, just choose. <br /> <br /> So, is it said? "A production of Menahem Golan". Oh, darling. <br /> <br /> From what I could understand, there follows a combination of Confessions of a Holiday Camp and the Last Tango in Paris. Sponsored by the Southport Tourism Board. <br /> <br /> Norman Wisdom is very versatile in being Norman Wisdom (or a variation of such) here. Even in the trash like this, he never goes out of shape and somehow keeps you watching through separate fingers as he sinks and dribbles all over (clearly insane) Sally Geeson. Tony Tenser and Menahem Golan were among them responsible for some real cinematic horrors, but the fourth scene in the cinematic atrocity was reborn. Sally plays the role of a lobotomized sex toy very well, by the way. <br /> <br /> I wonder if any of the wacky young cats that populate the scenes of the movie party might have thought of themselves in a quiet moment of "Umm?" old Norman + sex + hippies. Get me out of this mess !! "I think it was a payday for them. <br /> <br /> Feeling sorry for The Pretty Things though. <br /> <br /> They probably thought" Yeah! That's going to do for us what Blow Up did for the Yardbirds. "<br /> <br /> And so old Norman's career is over, freezing his balls at Southport. <br /> <br /> I went there once. It was a depressing place.
