The basic idea behind "Dungeon of Harrow" is not all bad. The acting, however, is bad. The lighting is bad. The music is bad. The scenes of torture are without emotion. There is not much there to recommend this movie. You know what kind of movie you are in when the credits say "Special Guest Star" and list someone you've never heard of. It may well say "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln". because there is not really anyone in this movie that you can identify. There are one or two decent moments, especially at the end, and I think the basic outline of the plot may have contained an original idea, but that alone is not enough to keep you awake through that otherwise inept yawn.
