I had never heard of "The Clearing" until I was really bored one day with some friends at the local Blockbuster and caught our attention. The description on the cover of the DVD attracted our interest, but once we put it on the DVD player, the boredom was just beginning. <br /> <br /> The story was dragged on for a long time. It seemed to follow the same scheme of other films that include a kidnapping. The most suspenseful parts were at the beginning of the movie, however. After that, the scheme was followed exactly and this made "The Clearing" not original. The flashbacks were many in number and the sadness of the victim's family did not give anything interesting or increase the nature of the film. And I also thought I did not like the ending, so it probably made me not like the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was not horrible ... it was not the best, however. Robert Redford gave much better performances. The tragic character of Willem Dafoe was the only one I've actually seen develop throughout the story and the viewer only really sees this change in the last ten minutes or so in the movie. The interpretation of Helen Mirren as the wife of Robert Redford was flat and followed the same generic pattern of other films that include a tragic and exciting event. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Clearing" is nothing to rave about. about. Use the movie rental money on something else ... like "Garden State", maybe?
