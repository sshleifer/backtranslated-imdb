This can hardly be called a good movie, it's actually not even close. But I have to say there were some things that made me ... not laugh or laugh, but something like that. The parody of the Resovoir dogs was one of them. The rest is not important enough to be remembered. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was a bit disappointed with this movie. The plot sounded like an idea, but it quickly fell to the floor. The whole thing was just to mess up and the actors where not good for the characters; most of them simply exaggerate. There were also many non-surgical sequences, this was a total waste of film. I realize that this would make the movie about 20 minutes shorter, but that would only make it better. <br /> <br /> Now, with the good and bad things lining up, let's conclude: two out of six toilet seats for this.
