I'm shocked to see so many people giving positive reviews for this "movie". This movie has no redeeming factors. The music is not good, the acting is pathetic, I have a hard time understanding how someone can enjoy this movie, let alone sing their "praises". The idea is horrible, certain scenes linked to the plot (like the continuation of the love story, although the romantic male interest is a SHRUNKEN HEAD) are so bad that I wanted to physically hurt myself while watching them. The fact that there is a scene where a shrunken head flies under a female T-shirt so he can "feel it" And she likes that is enough reason for everyone associated with this movie to die. The link to West Side Story can only be a mockery, since referencing such a big movie in such a horrible movie is just to destroy all copies of that movie. To shorten the story, this movie is horrible in every way. And if I went my way, everyone who likes it should go straight to hell ...
