Well, I'm a big fan and follower of Elizabeth Berkley. I bought this on DVD off of eBay for my boyfriend's birthday. We sat down to watch and it was so annoying. I do not remember laughing once. It's only for about an hour and a half and it seemed to take forever to finish. Elizabeth's great at it. Maybe it's because I'm a big fan of Elizabeth Berkley. If she had not been there I would not have attended, but every time she appeared on my face she would light up. Unfortunately, even Elizabeth could not save this movie. Only the general story and the horrible comedy make it a movie you'd rather lose than waste an hour and a half of your life. It's a very forgetful movie.
