Not even the cuisine of Emeril Lagasse can save this idiotic and disjointed absurd starring Emeril Lagasse as a TV chef of the food channel, who with the help of the team to try to make the show better, poor plot and stupid script play this show down the drain, Robert Urich wasted on the poor supporting role and unfortunately this was his last ever (RIP), <br /> <br /> This is the worst show of 2001 and will be on the list of the worst shows this decade. <br /> <br /> I feel very sad for Emeril Lagasse to have done this sitcom, he even said it sucks. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that they are the same producers of women who made this mess. <br /> <br /> TV Review: 1 star
