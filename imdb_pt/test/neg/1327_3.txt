One would think that with the incredible World War II scenario in Stalingrad, writers would create a script. No. There is no story here! It's like pornography, vignettes of violence interrupted by pathetic, routine and nonsensical dialogues. <br /> <br /> A group of Germans marched around firing and firing. Slowly, there are fewer Germans to march, shoot and get shot. So there are no Germans to march, shoot and get shot. <br /> <br /> Too bad. <br /> <br /> Chilcoot
