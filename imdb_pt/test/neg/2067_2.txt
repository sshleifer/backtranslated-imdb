I'm lost to find the words to express how bad I thought this movie was. The initial precept was promising, but in all respects afterwards it was utterly awful. Let's go through the main points. Plot - good initial idea, but a truly terrible development. There were many points when I thought "no, no one would do something so stupid". The ending was surprisingly anticlimactic. Characterization - all characters were completely bland or grotesque caricatures. I keep trying to think of one that was not - possibly the mother, but that's it. Music - intrusive, inadequate and generally terrible. Direction - totally amateur. Cinematography - I doubt they have heard of it. Camera angles / stability / zoom are usually very bad. I'm totally confused by the way this movie has scored so well. It's the worst movie I've seen in movies for years, if not always.
