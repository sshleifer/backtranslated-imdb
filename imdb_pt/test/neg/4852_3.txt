I've been waiting for the movie to get better, but of course this is the worst kind of escapist movie: a confection of refined sugar that sinks under the weight of its personal importance. The pace stumbles like a legionary stranded in the Sahara. The absence of a good dialogue leaves the stars attractive with little to do but look good on white linen. Irons plays another wealthy charmer who had a touch of the sun. Kaas is a nice singer, but not much of an actress. Fortunately, the script does not usually call her to move away from the microphone of the jazz club. All harmlessly relaxed, beautiful and unnecessary characters take turns chewing the scene with an air of tired sophistication. The whole exercise appears as an endless advertisement for Ralph Lauren. <br /> <br /> If you are over forty and believe that Francofilia is the key to sophistication, you can confuse this piece of cardboard with a baguette. Well, if you liked this movie, you probably felt smart about enjoying Godard's Lead of Love, and may even have gone through Le Divorce without shrinking.
