I love the so-called "blaxploitation" movies and I've seen dozens. Some such as COTTON COME HARLEM, SHAFT and HAMMER have excellent production values ​​and are very entertaining, while many others are very cheap and silly but still fun, like DEATH FRATERNITY or COFFEY. However, DOLEMITE manages something rare for the genre - it's just cheap and silly and not a bit of fun! It's like blaxploitation done for very, very stupid people. <br /> <br /> Years ago, I saw a takeoff in the Dolemite movies on "Mad TV" and unfortunately the real DOLEMITE is not any better. Like parody, acting is simply atrocious. Rudy Ray Moore has all the charm and charisma of a piece of balsa wood. He can barely read his lines and his "karate" is a joke - with his kicks obviously missing the target again and again. As for the rest of the actors, many may be even worse. My favorite was the FBI guy who could not even remember his lines and really struggled to get them out - but they did not even bother re-filming those scenes! In fact, much of it was inept that I had trouble figuring out if the film was meant as a joke. <br /> <br /> If you think that despite the horrible action and action that there is something worth seeing about this movie, you are wrong. Even for the perverts who are expecting to see some skin, they will be disappointed. The naked women in the movie really look like bad luck prostitutes and there is nothing remotely sexy in their flabby bodies. I think looking at the old nude - REEEAALLY nude old people - is not worse than looking at these "ladies". And as for Rudy Ray, he has "man boobs". No black superhero or anti-hero should be so naked !! For God's sake, put your clothes on for people and come up with a script that does not appear to have been written by drunks! <br /> <br /> FYI - Apparently there are sequences for this movie! ! I can not imagine them, so you just need to find someone to review them. I've seen PLAN 9 OUTDOOR SPACE, OUTSIDE SPACE ADOLESCENTS and ROBOT MONSTER, but I do not think I can see another Dolemite movie - they're so bad!
