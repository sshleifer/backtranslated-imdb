Mr. Brento wonders if this film was produced by the same who produced the TV series Dragonball Z. Of course not. <br /> <br /> This is a Hong Kong real action movie based on the first episodes of the original Japanese drawing (which was also based on a comic series). And I really do not know if it was produced under license from the creators of Dragonball ... <br /> <br /> However, the story of the monkey boy with special powers is an old tale known throughout Asia (in Japan , the boy's name in the tale is Songoku, in China, it is Sunwukong, in Korea is Sonogong, etc.) and the story in Dragonball has a lot to do with this tale. <br /> <br /> By the way, as I said, this movie is based on the early episodes of the Dragonball series (which was followed by Dragonball Z, although I think the US version had a different aeration order). And all the scenes related to sexuality were also contained in the original cartoon series (without much emphasis and much insistence on it!), But because of their comments, I can assume they were completely removed in the American dub. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I agree with you about overcoming the film and about how poor this adaptation of the original drawing is. But maybe that's why no one can forget after watching ...
