As' Singin 'in the Rain', 'Cover Girl' has a trio of two guys and a girl. In Cover Girl, Phil Silvers (Genius) is the comic relief. It corresponds to the funny part of Donald O'Connor in 'Singin in the Rain'. In Cover Girl, Gene Kelly's love interest is Rita Hayworth and in 'Rain', Debbie Reynolds. That's where the comparison ends. While "Singin 'in the Rain" is a classic American musical film, "Cover Girl" is the incarnation of mediocrity. The story is not too complicated. Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth is a dancer at Danny MacGuire's cheap rental nightclub in Brooklyn, Rusty decides to attend a Cover Girl contest sponsored by John Coudair, who played an unsuccessful play for Rusty's grandmother years ago. feels scorned when Rusty starts appearing too late for rehearsals at the club and decides to close the club and go on the road entertaining the troops along with his helper, Genius, at the last minute, with Rusty.At the altar with Noel, she realizes the error of their ways and runs back to Danny, they live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly has the less developed part of the film, is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love with Rusty. Courage and Wheaton act like teenagers obsessed with Rusty and Phil Silvers offers a completely goofy, but bland, crap. The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworth's performance is the scene where she gets drunk. u with her in real life. Anyone who has read her biography will find out that she did not like Hollywood, who lived in a normal family life that she could never reach but eventually started drinking and wiped out Alzheimer's disease in the last years of her life. <br /> <Almost all Cover Girl songs are outdated and not very well tuned. Gene Kelly has only one really great dance number and this is the scene in which he dances with his "alter ego". Earlier, the trio has another number that is a pale precursor to 'Make in Laugh' from 'Singin' in the Rain '. <br /> <br /> The boring thing about 'Cover Girl' is how Rita Hayworth is placed on a pedestal. A few decades later, Raquel Welch had the same problem. Both actresses later in their careers always tried to find scripts that showed their acting abilities. They wanted to be known as "actresses" and not "pinupas girls." Unfortunately, Cover Girl is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.
