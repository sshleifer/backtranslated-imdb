The plot in Petites Coupures certainly left this spectator perplexed. In the space of 48 hours, Auteuil's character has an affair with a teenager, loses his wife's affection, tries to seduce Scott Thomas, is rejected by her, will grope yet another female character in the back of a car and finally is shot by his problems. <br /> <br /> *** end of the spoiler *** <br /> <br /> wha ??? <br /> <br /> The only saving grace in this movie is Kristin Scott Thomas. Similar to Charlotte Rampling, she seems a * natural * to star in French cinema. My hope is that one day Fran√ßois Ozon will be able to put her in a part where she can show her true talent. <br /> <br /> There are some excellent French films such as the remarkable Le Colonel Chabert begging for a DVD release. this is the gut that is chosen. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one. zzzz ..
