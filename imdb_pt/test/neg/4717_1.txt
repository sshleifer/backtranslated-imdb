Do you know those movies that are so indescribably bad that you have to laugh? Mestiza was not one of them. Which sounds good, right? But no, it is not. It is not a bad attempt at a horror movie that is fun to watch because it is lame, or not well represented, or it has bad special effects or anything like that. No, the half-breed is just annoying. They did not even try to be scary until the last 20 minutes. It's just kids running through the African bush and taking stanzas out of elephants for the first 75% of the movie, and not even funny. The last 20 minutes, however, are HILARIOUS. I have no idea what happened, but it was a lot of fun to see that CGI leopard rip out the throats of all those white guys I could not distinguish anyway. If you're in the mood for a bad horror movie, do not rent this because you're going to sleep before you go for the fun stuff. If you accidentally rent this movie, I would recommend fast forwarding to the end and would ignore any scene that happened in daylight. You will not miss a thing. You have no idea which character is or exactly what is happening, even if you observe the whole past.
