Wow, well, do you know those shocking things they use in hospitals to make your heart race again? I needed one for my brain after watching this movie. It literally took me almost 4 hours in total to watch because I had to take a break and restart my brain for semi-normal functionality from time to time. I mean that this film will soooooo slooooow is ridiculous, say that the script had about 10 pages of dialogue would be generous. They just do not speak !! And while talking is not everything, and I admit there were some scenes where only the music was needed, and the music is great, which was probably the best part, but then I would listen to a symphony or something and forget the movie. So many people give great criticism and, for their time, I would say that the special effects and the filmography are very good, but as for the acting, or the lack of it, it only needed something more, no sex or sex, etc. ., swearing is not even necessary, but a little more thrill, these guys were like stones, just sitting there with long faces. All in all, if you need something to calm down, just play the movie, do not even start at the beginning, if you've seen it before, just start anywhere, lie down and relax, it will put you to the right sleep.
