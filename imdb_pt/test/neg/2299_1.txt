When my mom went to the video store to rent a movie for the night, my sister and I learned a lesson, to always accompany my mother in the store! In fact, the only reason she chose it was because Colin Firth was in it and she * * * thinks he's a good actor! <br /> <br /> It starts with some beautiful veiws of Africa and then it goes down and down And down and down. After this film, I was very surprised that Colin Firth had gotten as far as he could, since this meaningless movie could destroy any actor career. <br /> <br /> The story is about a divorced woman whose son is trying to make her look like a man named Matthew Fields whom he met while impressing his friends over his big house. <br /> <br /> Nimi's divorce does not like Matthew at all and is dating the local vicar who does not like his son John. ... and the same with him! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if you disagree with me and I hope you have not offended you, but for all the people who have not seen this movie, I leave you with a word of warning, do not watch this movie! !
