Seated in a large armchair with a huge book on his lap, the only Bela Lugosi looks at the camera, and in a terrible voice that sounds as if he is mocking a reading of Shakespeare, openly: "Touching constants in unknown things, (laughs), surprising, because they look new (Lugosi's eyes now bulging, brows raised and scorn in his mouth, continues). most are not new, the signs of the ages "(leaves a glimmer of clarity, accompanied by the sound of thunder that continues to snore for an astonishing 86 seconds). <br /> <br /> And so begins what is arguably the worst movie "This movie almost defies description," he said in semi-docudrama style with an invisible narrator explaining the plot ... as it is ... the story revolves around the vicissitudes of a man named Glen (Ed Wood, Jr.), who dresses in a cross way, hence the reference to Glenda .The film has no real structure, instead it consists mainly of a random assortment of vignettes that may ... or not ... relate to Glen or with the reason for the travestimento.A long sequence consists of an unknown woman squirming on a sofa, followed by a man whipping a woman in what we now call S & M. <br /> <br /> So in strange moments , Bela reappears for no apparent reason, and babbles more idiot dialogues. "When he is wrong because he does right, and when he is right because he is wrong; pull the rope, dance to it. "Huh? About twenty percent of the film's visuals consist of archival footage, accompanied by a VO that relates to the motif of the story but not to so we see filming of: bustling city streets, freeway traffic, a booming flock of buffaloes and a playground full of kids.But it gets worse.In a cross-dressing movie, we have 58 consecutive seconds of stock footage of a smelting furnace making hot steel, and 84 consecutive seconds of World War II battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Even the simplest items are unsuccessful.In one scene, we see a newspaper headline that says " Man Nabbed Dressed as Girl. "Under the title, which was clearly pasted or glued, the article is about ... taxes.In one of my favorite scenes, a woman appears off-screen:" airplanes, because it is against the will of the creator, "in a voice that sounds like she just inhaled helium. <br /> <b r /> Except for Lyle Talbot's performance, the performance is uniformly horrendous. Production design is cheap and monotonous; (but you have to love this tacky wallpaper). The issue is sloppy. Most of the background music is suitable only for 1950s style lifts. Black and white cinematography has a lot of contrast. And the costumes look like something that came from a thrift store. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that it makes "Plan 9 From Outer Space" look like "Citizen Kane" in comparison. I do not know how anyone could make a movie worse than "Glen Or Glenda" by Ed Wood. But, fortunately, there is Bela Lugosi in it. Every time he opened his mouth and stared at the camera with those big bulging eyes, I fell to the floor, laughing.
