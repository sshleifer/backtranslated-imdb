Fabian racing enthusiast (like Tommy Callahan) smokes, drinks and faints while juggling seductive brunette Annette Funicello (as Francie Madsen) and blonde Diane McBain (as Annie Blaine). Complicating issues are Warren Berlinger (as Eddie Sands), his father Jan Murray (as Pete Madsen), who encourages reckless drivers. The performance of Funicello's cow eyes is sometimes pleasant; however, his drunken driving scene is disconcerting. "Thunder Alley" delivers more NASCAR excitement than its predecessor, "Fireball 500" (1966) *; Be warned, it is not much. A wild party scene, featuring some mild strip tease, is the low highlight of the movie.
