I saw The Greek Tycoon when it first came out in 1978. I found it extremely annoying. I thought it was no better than a travel diary except for one thing: for the first time in my life, I realized why it would be good to be rich. See the scenery of the yacht Aristotle Onassis and take a look at the lifestyle of the rich and famous opened my eyes. To paraphrase Martha Stewart: It was a good thing. Funny, I do not remember the sex scene. I had not seen the movie since it was on the big screen and I found the love affair with the memorable lover this time. Maybe because I was younger and single at the time, it was no big deal.
