"Fate" takes Walter Sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has strange similarities and connections to his life, all based on the number 23. As the story unfolds in real life and in fiction, Sparrow needs to discover his connection to the book . and how the story will eventually end. <br /> <br /> The Number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. The film failed on many different levels, which is quite disappointing because it had so much potential. The script was probably the worst part about it. It was full of silly sequences and laughable dialogues that did away with the mood of the movie. It seemed that the screenwriter had a good idea, he just did not know how to develop it to stretch more than a ninety minute run time. The second half of the movie had few ideas, the turnaround was pretty obvious and the ending was horrible. Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies of all time and has redeemed himself a little with Phone Booth and a few other movies, but The Number 23 reminds me that he is still capable of making a cigarette. He has the film drenched in style but he just can not get a good focus. He moves the film in a slow and awkward rhythm. It changes from reality to what's really happening in the book, which quickly got boring. The real book in the movie titled "The Number 23" is a terrible detective story and the public gets stuck listening to Carrey tell what bored me to tears. When Carrey finally finishes the book, we get stuck watching him rushing to try to solve the mystery. At this point the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We are impatiently waiting for the film to reach its horrific end and an unconvincing explanation before celebrating that the film is finally over. <br /> <br /> The acting was mostly average and quite forgettable. Jim Carrey was clearly sleepwalking through his performance and he did not even seem to be trying. It was completely on top in some scenes or just a lot of wood. His narration was a complete hole to listen to and he did not put life into his character. Virginia Madsen did her best with a limited role, but she needs to choose better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty bare, just like Danny Huston. Overall, The Number 23 was a horrible thriller that offered more laughter than suspense or excitement. Overall Rating 3/10
