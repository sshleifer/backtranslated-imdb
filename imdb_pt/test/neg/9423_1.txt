I was told about this movie from a friend who saw late at night during the week He told me it was so bad I had to see it! So I went on an auction site and bought the movie. This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. That makes you laugh when you should not. Terrible acting and terrible plot. Plus, he does not look like Michael Jackson at all?! <br /> <br /> I still recommend buying this movie as one of the funniest things you've ever seen. Van Peebles is a joke in this movie. <br /> <br /> Robots can not bluff ... PSYCHE! <br /> <br /> I have to say that the special effects are really incredible ... PSYCHE! The DVDs were probably even when this movie came out, but if I had my way, it would be straightforward for the VHS release, yes, people are so bad!
