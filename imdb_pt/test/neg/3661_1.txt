My girlfriend and I are really into cheesy horror movies. Especially those with a lot of unnecessary nudity. When we saw the case cover for this movie in the blockbuster we thought it would be a perfect movie for the night. We started watching it, since I did not expect it to be great, but I thought at least that would interest us. 20 minutes into the movie, we realized that the pace would not pick up and that it was an incredibly annoying movie. We tried to get into it, but the plot made little sense even after reading the back of the DVD box over and over again. The film was filmed very dark and it was very annoying trying to figure out what was going on at every shot. Each violent scene was very difficult to understand, and you can never watch the violence you're waiting for. This is definitely a film without a reason that was filmed badly and very prolonged. Each scene was about 20 minutes of the same thing and I felt I got the point after the first 5. Go to this movie and re-watch another film from Freddy or Jason and you will be much more content.
