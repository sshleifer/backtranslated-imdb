This movie was absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot could have been made to work if the film had been written better. The acting was one of the worst I've ever seen. I was very slow and made me want to leave / unplug the movie several times. I watched the entire movie in the hope that the ending was worth it, but it did not. this movie I think should be ranked in the negative numbers. (In my humble opinion)
