Starring Tomas Milian and Manny Perez? 'Washington Heights' is a low budget drama set in a Latin Quarter in New York. <br /> <br /> A young comic artist (Manny Perez) wants to flee his Latin neighborhood. When his father is crippled by a thief's shot, the young man is forced to run the family hold. <br /> <br /> The film was shot on a budget (low resolution video and bad audio) with discrete actors. The plot flowed well for 85 minutes, but the last 5 minutes were terrible. We are not sure if Perez and his girlfriend stayed together and if Angel ended up in jail for the shootout. <br /> <br /> 4/10
