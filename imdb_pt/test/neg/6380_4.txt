This show has shown that it is true that the Democrats are in power. He never led the world in IQ, since anyone who believed he had intelligence was programmed to think in a way (which is a scary thing). <br /> <br /> Comedy Central moved this and it became older. since the Democrats took power for a reason - because now, when Democrats get in the way - as often happens with Republicans - Stewart does not take any more marijuana shots at them. That's why the ratings for this and the spin are falling. <br /> <br /> Basically, most of the humor is now curse or swear words, Sarah Palin jokes - that all the reviews that comedians are saying now. The facts to confirm this speak for themselves. Jay Leno's show, which does the same kind of humor, is about to be canceled. The ratings for Letterman & Conan and the programs that follow them are down. <br /> <br /> So Emperor Stewart is not alone. The problem is that if any of them start criticizing the democrats in power, they can increase the audience quickly because the best mood is always at the expense of those in power. The Bush years proved this because the ratings for this show & Colbert, & Letterman & Leno were bigger there. <br /> <br /> O'Bama did one thing, proved that these shows have to be willing to risk and rip people into power if they want to thrive. At this point, the Daily Show & Stewart is giving in, but maybe they might get lucky and have Palin elected as the first female president in 2012. Then Palin's stunned jokes will become strikers.
