Mentally boring, totally predictable and, in the end, simply laughable. That pretty much sums up the disaster that is Indecent Proposal. Beginning with a decent premise, the whole thing just falls apart and becomes a complete mess. Basically, the story boils down to the question "Would you let your wife sleep with another man for a million dollars?" Here, of course, the answer is yes because otherwise we would not have a movie. Frankly, we would have been better off if we had not had a movie. <br /> <br /> Our couple (and financially disturbed) is played by Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. They go to Vegas to get rich. Yes, this will work. Anyway, a billionaire, played by Robert Redford, likes the woman and makes the offer of a million dollars. For one night with his wife, he will give them financial security. The aftermath of that night is what the movie really is all about. Unfortunately nothing in this result is the least entertainment. The script is so predictable that you can tell the lines of the characters before them. The performances leave a lot to be desired. Harrelson would be better off with the comedies, since this serious attempt to act completely loses the target. Anguish is not something he seems capable of portraying. And it's safe to say that Demi Moore will never have to make room in her home for any Oscar. Why is she a movie star again? In a part that should be full of emotion, it does not transmit any. Only Redford escapes practically unharmed. He is appropriately slimy but smooth and clearly the best actor in the group. But he can not save this movie. Horrible script, lousy performance, slow pace, zero entertainment ... Indecent proposal is absolutely horrible.
