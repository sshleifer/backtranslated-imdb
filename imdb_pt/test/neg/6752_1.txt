they should make terrorists watch this video as torture, not just the disturbing final scene where tying and beating a woman with mental problems is apparently a source of comedy. about half an hour would convince even the most fundamentalist to shed the seeds instead of waiting another minute for that disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible. I rented it because a friend said it was hilarious, only to find out he was talking about the fanatical director making the comment instead of the movie itself. I think if you find funny unrestricted arrogance, you'll enjoy this. It seems to be true that he keeps talking about girls that he "hit", being the most tasteless example when the lead actress appears onscreen. <br /> <br /> In fact, CJ Stacy was the only good part of this movie - his charisma shines like a diamond in this horrible pile of manure. This apparently is the only film she did according to the IMDb, I hope she is involved with theatrical or indie pieces, as I think she has the talent and natural beauty to really be an asset to any production.
