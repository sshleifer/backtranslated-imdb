My first post on IMDb has to (unfortunately) warn others not to waste time with The Cavern! There is no story, character development, scares and no good enlightenment. It does not make any sense. If you like to act badly, people running through small portions of caves, jumping cameras placed at bad angles and people screaming while the screen is in complete darkness, you will love this movie. I could turn off the lights in my house and shout too, and I would not have to pay for the rent. The only thing that scared me was that someone actually made such a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> ... one of the worst movies I've ever rented.
