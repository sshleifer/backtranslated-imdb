The first official release of the World Wrestling Entertainment movie division is a horror / slasher film called "See No Evil," starring Kane, one of his great fighters known to have an intimidating presence, blunt movements, and one of the most back complicated contortions in wrestling. And let's not punch here; While this movie is being promoted as the greatest horror film ever (especially by WWE), it goes without saying that after seeing this movie, I can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all time. <br /> <br /> "See No Evil" sees a group of juvenile delinquents sent to a hotel so they can clean up. Of course, a monstrous killer (played by Kane) is also living in this hotel and we all know where that goes. Without revealing much of the plot of the film, this film has all the look and structure of a horror film from the early 1980s with most of the cliches intact but without any of the scares these films accompany. And that's the main problem with "See No Evil". He tries many of the tricks implicit by his predecessors in the predictable genre; veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the tricks ahead of time and even those who have seen only a few movies must tell what happens next. It's too generic to be scary. <br /> <br /> The film is bloody undoubtedly, but it's just for the purpose. The dark atmosphere instilled in the film gives rise to this sense of terror initially, but when you reach the end, it somehow feels displaced and becomes tiring quickly. The death scenes do not look as bloody and horrible as ridiculous, though some of them are quite inventive. <br /> <br /> And the acting in this movie is pretty bad too, as the main characters are not developed enough to matter to us when they eventually get cut. Some can not adequately portray fear; they just scream and cry in a futile effort to thrill. So when they die, that only adds to the comedy because you do not care enough about them, you just consider them the equivalent of the Red Star Shirts to the Monster Kane. <br /> <br /> As for Kane, he simply portrayed his character from the film in the same way that he portrays his wrestling character, only he uses axes and hooks instead of hellfire and sulfur. There is no doubt in my mind that Kane can be a great accessory in the horror genre. He has the appearance and the presence for it; he just needs a better material (specifically a script that is not written by someone who writes wrestling programs) to work on. <br /> <br /> Now, despite what may seem like a harsh criticism, I really enjoyed the movie. It's one of those ridiculously bad movies that you just can not sit back and enjoy. My main complaint with the film, once again, is that it is simply an exercise in filming bloody deaths and has no scary or shocking moments. I liked it, but I liked it because it was easy for me to laugh at some of the moments that should have been scary in the movie. If this happened because it should be so, the film would have been rated higher. But that did not happen. He laughs because it's a B movie and it does not help that the director's previous experiences were pornographic films and music videos; not exactly tricky things to target anyway. However, I enjoyed it tremendously. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind a fun B movie or funny horror movie, I recommend "See No Evil". If you're a true enthusiast of the genre, I'd wait until the DVD comes out before you take a look. Everyone else should probably go see something else.
