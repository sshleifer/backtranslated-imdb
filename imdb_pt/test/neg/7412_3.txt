Well I read the other reviews. He did not think it looked good, but he decided to record it anyway. Maybe not so smart to read all the poor reviews before watching this movie, because of course I would be realizing the same strange things. Excessive fade use for black, some weird camera angles and crosscutting dialog for different conversations with the same people that happen at different times! But realizing everything I thought to myself: Well, that would probably be very annoying if everything happened chronologically. The conversations are not so exciting, but compelling. And the constant shifting to black after really short scenes really does seem like the story is rapidly advancing also the interesting part. Ignoring the boring parts. At the end of the movie, it gets a bit exciting too. Will they survive? <br /> <br /> So, I really liked this movie? No, not really. The director had some interesting ideas about how to keep the audience from getting bored while he tried to introduce the characters. But he is exaggerating. It gets annoying and sometimes confusing. This was apparently only the second film he directed, so maybe he will learn and do really good things in the future. And if you're sitting there (in the future) reading this asking if the now famous second film directors are worth watching. Well, if he's good in the future, sure, look at this crap and imagine how he managed to make a third. Otherwise, this movie is not worth watching unless you are very keen on making movies, and you want to see a way to cut through the obligatory boring introductory scenes into something watchable.
