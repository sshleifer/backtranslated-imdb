"Crimes of Passion" is a film that is disappointing in most cases. Where should I start? The plot? It is hopelessly simplistic and full of gaps. The direction? It's a cheap B movie. The acting? Bobby, Annie Pots is not convincing as "frozen wife" Amy, and it's just Kathleen Turner (above average), and John Laughlin is absolutely terrible in her role as "well-meaning-husband-of-a- Antony Perkins (excellent) who achieves passable performance brands. More specifically, Antony Perkins does a great performance as the perverted Reverend Peter Shayne, while Turner succeeds in portraying the roles of sexy China Blue and the fragile Joanna Crane. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Turner's and Perkins' performances alone are insufficient to help get a top score of 4/10. Watch if you want to see Turner in some sensational scenes (although, even with that account, the movie can easily be compared to your "Wild Instinct" competition, for example), otherwise avoid.
