Lucille Ball tries to look 30 years younger than she really was in that poor excuse for a musical. <br /> <br /> The film features some of the worst choreography ever seen with the constant threat that Lucy could sing her bourbon voice at any time. Lucy's total lack of talent as a singer and dancer sinks the film before it can begin and, aside from Lucy's inveterate fans, no one can really like him. Bad costumes and designs of cheese sets do not help. More proof that Lucy was no good at anything but stupid faces. <br /> <br /> Directed by Gene Saks.
