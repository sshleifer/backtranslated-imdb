Frightmare begins with a horror movie icon killing a director and then his servant before he is put to rest. This icon, which has some of Christopher Lee's qualities to it, continues to haunt those around him when a group of horror film society students steal his corpse from the mausoleum he is in. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes are: well filmed, good writing and lots of potential for killer chaos. But the film creeps in the middle (though fortunately not as much as "House of Death") and never gets that initial energy boost right away. <br /> <br /> Many of the deaths are confusing as they seem to make people fall scared when they see a floating coffin or other strange things. Twice we see poison gas being used. But the box promises that this star of terror will be the embodiment of all the monsters he has played. Boy, is this advertising false, unless he spent his career playing annoying old men who take naps and watch "Matlock." <br /> <br /> The general principle of the film is decent: children of terror society steal a corpse from a dead icon. A modern equivalent (digging up Vincent Price or Peter Cushing) would make a great movie. Maybe a remake is in order, if that is not very disrespectful. Sometimes the theory does not appear so well in the application, and this film offers this example. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming quality of this film (beyond the beginning) is the brief appearance of a very young Jeffrey Combs. I saw him and thought, "That's Jeffrey Combs," but I felt I was wrong, for the box never mentioned it. But surely, Combs was present. (A note to filmmakers: mention Combs on the cover of the DVD, you'll sell more copies if you're fooling customers.) If you're a die-hard Jeffrey Combs, check out that starter role. Otherwise, I can not offer this as a great selection for a marathon of horror films. Let me suggest "Intruder" or "Popcorn," as both are quite decent and will stand the test of time.
