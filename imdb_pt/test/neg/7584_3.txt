Qualified professionals live in an exotic and dangerous location. They get drunk every night. They smuggle opium. They leave pigs on parachutes. They fly under impossibly dangerous conditions. They dress strangely and act strangely. They are iconoclastic, outrageous. They violate all the rules of command and despise their employers in the CIA. They are irreplaceable. <br /> <br /> No. It's not "Only Angels Have Wings" and it's not "M * A * S * H". It's an uncomfortable mix of the two that, unfortunately, seems more silly than funny. <br /> <br /> It is aimed at shock, fun and education, but it does not really reach its goals. <br /> <br /> As for its shock value, well, we're used to it now, are not we? Is it really shocking for anyone that a group of avid pilots flew on secret missions in Laos in the 1970s? No, it's not shocking. It's not even educational now, under our current circumstances, when it would be interesting to know that some paramilitary tour was not buried in a file called Toucher's National Interest, Defense. It's all right. So we have been wiser and we are neither so shocking nor so stupid. <br /> <br /> The problem, in this case, is that the film depends on those same qualities in order to amuse it. Without it, the movie implodes. A group of drunken, shaggy CIA pilots are sitting in a cat house, picking up the girls, firing lights with a muted pistol, killing lizards with it. Ask rookie Robert Downey Jr., "When you act like that, does it mean there's something to celebrate?" Another responds, laughing, "No, that means it's night." This can be funny if we expected renegade pilots to be as correct as the rest of us. If we do not, the joke, like the movie, falls flat. <br /> <br /> There are action scenes naturally. Everything that can happen in or to an airplane in flight happens inside or in an airplane in flight. People fall out of them, luggage is thrown out of their hatchways, engines fail, they suffer damage from AAA, are shattered during landings, but we have seen most of it in other places, often better. <br /> <br /> Some may find this funnier than me, and the acting is very good. Robert Downey Jr. is especially effective as the straight man. Check out the other reviews and if they describe a movie you may find appealing, then, by all means, watch. There may be some laughter that escaped me.
