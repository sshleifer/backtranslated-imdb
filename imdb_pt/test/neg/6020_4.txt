STAR NOTE: ***** Saturday night **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning * Danny (Honey Raido) is a solitary worker who tries to get on with his job and be a good father to his two daughters after a confused divorce from his mother (Maxine Peake). But after a fight with his daughters at a workers' club, he uses a trip to his dance class to take a look at Louis (Colin Salmon) and his gang of tough men who train in the gymnastics / free weights section of boxing and train in a stronger and more assertive person. In a short time he took Louis' philosophies to heart and joined him as a nightclub porter when the 1980s album comes into action ... but when associate Sparky (Scott Williams) tries to make a sideline in the drug trafficking, everything turns pear-shaped. <br /> <br /> As Robert De Niro once said in the movie The Bronx Tale "there is no tragedy greater than the wasted talent." The Clubbed writer had a good idea and a talent for turning him into some kind of film ... but without the ability to, it seems, put it all together into some kind of coherent film. Like a brummie, some of the film locations (especially a scene at the end of the outside of the Ring O 'Bells pub in Moseley!) were very easy and fun to watch ... but the The somber appearance of cinematography is really a misfortune. Some really poor acting, for example main actor Raido with an indecipherable accent that is all over the place, and a hammy script with some flawed dialogue are biggest problems for the film though. More established actors, such as Peake and even television's favorite Neil Morressey, are sidelined for very small pieces of support, while Raido and Ronnie Fox's disastrous lame villain takes center stage. Williams makes Sick Boy, a poor man, from Trainspotting, leaving Salmon and Shaun Parkes seemingly the only artists with integrity, as excessive blood-spreading violence (making it a common trend for Brit Flicks!) Takes over. Truly a missed opportunity. **
