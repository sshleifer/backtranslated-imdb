ALERT: This review contains the top SPOILERS. Do not read if you plan to see this movie. Judging by the amount of votes this got (my vote was the fifth) few people know or care who Mimi Lesseos is. Well, in the late 1980s, professional wrestling was pretty decent. An all-female federation called Ladies Professional Wrestling Association was opened. It was a great league, and Mimi Lesseos was one of the names on the list. I always thought she was one of the best people the LPWA had in terms of playing ability and acting ability. Unfortunately, the LPWA closed in the early '90s, so it seemed natural for someone as talented as Mimi to start an acting career, right? But surely there was an alternative for things like that? This movie is really bad. As it was happening, I kept comparing it to an underrated movie called "Survivor Quest", this movie alone does not have everything that made "Survivor Quest" enjoyable. <br /> <br /> When I started the tape, I went to Fast forward through the preview to get to the flesh of the tape. At first, I was not paying much attention, but then realized that the preview was for a movie starring Mimi Lesseos. "Oh," I thought, "this is another movie Mimi must look for. 'But as the forecast dragged on, I realized it was a preview for' Beyond Fear! ' You know you're in trouble when the one preview at the beginning features the movie you're about to watch! The plot of this thing is quite normal. Lesseos plays a former kickboxer who is living with the guilt of hurting an opponent / friend, so she focuses on her second career, which she shares with her friend Sammy: being a desert guide. On this particular occasion, she receives a troupe of three couples. Two of the couples are there just to take up space. You think a couple, a Caucasian husband and a Korean wife, will be exploited, as a problem appears between them in the middle of the film, but is ignored in favor of repeated jokes about bears in the forest, which constantly scare the Korean wife. . The joke is funny the first time you listen, but it certainly is not for the ninth time you do. The third couple is painful to watch: it consists of Mr. and Mrs. Page. They swap insults from one side to the other, and Mr. Page uses his video camera for the art of voyeurism when he's not busy making cruel jokes at his corpulent wife like his typical American couple! Before the walk, Mr. Page is spying on two stupid guys and his prostitute. One of them accidentally kills the prostitute and discovers that Mr. Page has recorded. Then the danger begins, as the two guys accompany the group on their journey, and we wait and wait for them to finally do something. When that happens, it's a fiasco. <br /> <br /> You can not blame the cast. They try as hard as they can with the material they have to work with. The main culprit is director Robert F. Lyons, who needs to re-play small parts and stay out of the director's chair. Lyons begins and interrupts the scenes on such a sudden and sudden subject that you begin to think that he was suffering from dyspepsia throughout the filming. There is even an incompetent moment when a wide daylight scene with the bad guys is passed between some night scenes. Then there is the sound department. Music and background noise completely dominate the dialogue so you have to move your ear right next to your TV's speaker. Do not hit your head on the screen! It is not worth listening to the poorly written lines. Speaking of poor writing, Lesseos receives some credit as a co-writer. The few interesting developments between the characters are often abandoned by photos of bad guys or bad jokes. Early on, Lesseos hits a thug with a pocketknife, so not once do you think they are in danger of the two stupid thugs. When the bad guys finally have their butts kicked by Lesseos in a well made and long fight, our entire cast has a huge laugh together despite the fact that one of them was shot and bleeding everywhere. Yes, everyone is happy in the end. All but the poor souls watching the movie, wishing the good old days of glory when Mimi performed in the wrestling ring. Zantara Score: 4 out of 10
