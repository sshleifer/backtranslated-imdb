Now, do not get me wrong, I love seeing girls half naked moving. It is part of the fun of a Moroccan restaurant: to admire the belly dancers. But it does not do much of the plot. <br /> <br /> My first big problem is music. I get the feeling that when Ann Rice wrote "The Vampire Lestat," the Cure was more the style of music he would have liked (though I may be wrong). I know the current "gothic" music may have seemed like a good idea, but they did a horrible job of incorporating it. Lestat was an actor with presumably a very good voice. That they chose Jonathan Davis to be their stage voice is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Second, and someone said that, mixing two very complicated books in a low-quality movie is a bad idea. "Lestat" could have been a movie by itself, and very good if done correctly. I honestly do not think "Queen of the Damned" lends itself well to a movie. Although I would love to see a film that incorporates a creation story, there's a lot like saying that, "inaction" in the book so it's a very interesting film. And the recount they did very badly. Now pay attention to you, I have not read for a long time, I always thought that "Lestat", "Tale of the Body Thief" and "Memnoch the Devil" were much more action packed and would have made better films. I know a lot of people (hey, I included) who likes lots of vampire crap who thought this was absolutely the worst of the genre to be a great movie. I tend to agree with them there. Aaliyah had a good body though.
