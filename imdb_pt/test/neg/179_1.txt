Beavis and Butthead made this movie? It's so bad. Truly an unequal and unfair picture of "bad" versus "good" in the wine world. You have noticed the filmmaker trying out any of the wines from the prominent guards of individual wines and terroir. The work of the camera is vertiginous at best, while content can put you to sleep in no time. This is not insightful journalism. What I got from this film was that the filmmaker was struggling to emphasize wine globalism by showing, for example, that the Mondavi family owned wineries in all parts of the world. Okay, that's a good start. So how do these wines compare? Does the Mondavi Napa taxi taste your Italian wines? We never find out because nobody in the movie comments on this. Instead, there are many insinuations about Nazism and fascism. Well, these things do not grow grapes. Hmmm
