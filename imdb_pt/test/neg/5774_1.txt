And unfortunately, me too. ANY movie that is based on a bad pun as your tagline or your title should be relegated to the $ 2.00 pot, but we decided to try a second consecutive bad movie for movie night. We had a winner in "House of the Dead" - go with that if you want a laughable movie. <br /> <br /> A witch jumped into the water after being set on fire by Mr. Miner. Some guy slapped the forest. And that same guy got a new girlfriend right in front of his old one. I do not remember much. The last third of the movie was totally tasteless, and we were all waiting in agony to the end.
