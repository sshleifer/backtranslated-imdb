Okay, it was really good ... but better photo? Please do not even close. Munich was better, Capote was much better, good night and good luck was much better ... Brokeback Mountain - well, it should have won! Academy voters seem to act like the current Democrats - please just a little of everyone, but do not dare to take concrete positions. That's why we have a complete idiot in the US office. <br /> <br /> This has been the worst presentation of AA ... and forget 1987 ... since long before that. Hollywood is so afraid of the bottom line that it can not be defined as "straight". Many voters apparently did not even see Brokeback Mountain. Stay real and stick with it. <br /> <br /> This has been the most pathetic year since I've been in the mid-60s and I was only two. <br /> <br /> Wake up, whoever you are. Hollywood is mainstream, and that's what happened to the Box Office in 2005. King Kong, the latest Star Wars movie, another Batman movie, a reissue or whatever of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, and much more in 2006. <br /> At least there were better original photos, ie Munich, but I heard this before, Capote - great; Katherine Keener should have won, although now we know that Reese can sing like Cash / Carter, etc., Syriana was a much better image than Crash. This movie was made, since the beginning of the 1960s and we have to make the best movie? What a horrible Oscar night and a horrible year to end in 2005 and another annoying year in 2006. At least the best movie BAFTA went to Brokeback, and the horrible music it won? Pathetic. I think there are only about 20 years left, like America or the USA, before someone walks in and changes things a little. Maybe it's China, since they have so much of this country ... or India, because they have all the high tech jobs and they are the biggest democratic country in the world. <br /> <br /> America has become the land of fat, the pathetic and the stupid. Garbage can be found in more places than Florida, West Virginia, South Dakota and the Midwest. <br /> <br /> Drive-through a local McDonalds or Burger King for the love of God. Order everything you want until you have a heart attack. Put yourself out of your misery.
