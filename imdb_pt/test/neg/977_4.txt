I put this vehicle from Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy, and Murphy in particular the first time, but having seen it again recently, I can see that it has some very funny bits. <br /> <br /> In no way say that this is the greatest comedy of friends of all time, but really what can you do with the already exhausted subgenre? The director, Tom Dey, tried to make this a satire of the comedy and media clichés. At the beginning of the film, the cable executive asks, "How is this different from Cops?" When Chase Renzi is launching the idea of ​​a reality show that deals with De Niro's character, Mitch Preston (boring boring name ). That was when I saw in a new light that I had not noticed previously. <br /> <br /> The idea is to show all the elements of the comedy of friends and put a twist on them. De Niro's reluctance to star in the show and associate himself with Murphy is well on all the cop movies you can imagine. You might say De Niro is really asking himself, "Why would I do another movie playing a cop?" Chase Renzi is portrayed as a Hollywood farce, but if you look at the opening scene again, she's just doing it to save her job. She somehow sees the ridicule of what she's doing, but she wants to succeed despite it. One line says it all: "Who does not want to be on TV?" Maybe this is reading a lot in what is essentially a lightweight movie, merely adjusted to entertain, but it does take a little twist that I had not noticed before. <br /> <br /> As for Murphy. You have to applaud him for looking ridiculous. Trey wants to be such a bad star that he's willing to sell everything he comes in contact with. Murphy was a big star and maybe it was a nerve that everything is so fleeting. <br /> <br /> The plot with the gun is, of course, very annoying. The action sequences are nothing special, except the final, which took a lot of effort from both the cast and crew. One thing I noticed about the villain is that he is dressed like a pop star of the 80s. George Michael comes to mind and this contributes to all the media. <br /> <br /> So, I destroyed the first time, but what the heck; If you're going to do this, why not point out just how ridiculous it really is and De Niro and Murphy had a great chance to do that.
