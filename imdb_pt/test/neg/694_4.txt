Why the powers that continue to cast Jennifer Lopez in unbelievable roles? She was excellent at Selena, and very good at Money Train, who both put her in roles where she could basically be herself. However, roles like this only draw the line. I could never see Lopez as an FBI agent (see Out of Sight for this not remarkable performance) but as a psychotherapist? Give me some time! <br /> <br /> Basically Lopez plays the psychotherapist mentioned, who is involved in virtual reality experiments in which she enters the minds of her patients to help them solve their problems. When she enters the mind of a serial killer in a coma to help save one of her victims, she breaks all the rules to try to break the insanity of her inner mind. <br /> <br /> Lopez's performance here is typically below average. I can not get over the shrill sound of a voice she has. She's not Julia Roberts, but she still appears on the screen as if she believes she's on the same playing field. Well, she's not even in the same stadium. Of course, she is a very sexy woman; however, this is not going to take a movie, and certainly does not carry that movie. With someone else in his role for this movie, it would have been great, especially if it had been chosen by someone who could give more credibility to the character. <br /> <br /> All that said, this movie is visually stunning. . The colors are fabulous and the plot is not a bad thing in a B movie. The audio here is great too. This movie earns some points for the rather original plot and main points of how it looks and sounds. Unfortunately, the cast of actresses and bad players overthrow some points. <br /> <br /> My rating: 6/10
