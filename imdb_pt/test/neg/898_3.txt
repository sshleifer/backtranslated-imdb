I did not get much Barnens O ?? It's one of the strangest ones I've ever seen. Was the soundtrack quite unusual too? written and performed by Jean Michel Jarre - makes the film stranger than it was. I have to admit I was almost going to change it and watch another instead, sometimes the movie looked just plain dumb to me, or boring? or confusing. Are there any sexual references in this movie? through them they are also a little messy. Probably the only phrase I'll remember is "When you're alone, can you control things"? and "I'll show them" - or something. Was the boy in that movie obsessed with the idea of ​​not growing up? "Last summer as a child," he thought once? and he certainly lived to the fullest. So, if you have a few hours to spare, can you watch this movie? but you will not lose much if you do not.
