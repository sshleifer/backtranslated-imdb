This is a doozy. Dating back to 1949, Scene of the Crime often plays more like a Coen Bros movie. in the 1940s and filmed in black and white, except that the writer's ear for pastiche here is not so well adjusted - perhaps this can be seen instead as the forerunner to the Oscar-winning Road-Perdition. Frankly, it's a wonder that this film is not considered a classic by film teachers and critics everywhere, considering how much it offers in terms of excessively articulate Mannerist emotions shrouded in false meaning (much like the grandaddy of all these films of "false art"). Citizen Kane, or anything from Murnau. MGM is usually a studio that does nothing wrong in my eyes, and I think any story, any atmosphere, even "brave realism," can only benefit from grotesque superstarry. You could say that I am a disciple of the Minnelli school. But it takes a light touch to write a tough dialogue with the tough guys on the Dashiell Hammett track, a provision perhaps to allow one or two scenes to pass without a phrase like "Watch out, Mr. Wiggly, or you'll have thirteen fish to fry and no small wormies to catch them. "I did more than that -" Mr. Wiggly "unfortunately made the cut - but believe me, the dialogue is just that sullen and riddled with non sequiturs. Even the wife of the main cop, played by Arlene Dahl, speaks as if she had a moon-shaped scar under one eye and the Christian name Rocco. By the time Van Johnson delivers his badge with the phrase "I'm sick of death and murder," you'll wonder how the writer's fixation with ornate literary devices - in this case, zeugma - could have been misinterpreted as "street." <br /> <br /> For those who have outgrown The Naked Gun, this is the funniest movie cops and thieves ever do.
