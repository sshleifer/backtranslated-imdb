The best thing about the movie is the name because it describes the plot and the acting. At least they can not say they did not warn you ... More or less like the button labeled "Do not push this". <br /> <br /> Segal must have run out of things that move like planes, trains and ships, but the plot remains the same. Under the cover face he fights slowly but still beats like 40 kinds of mercenaries and does not even blink when this happens. What surprises me is that Segal is now as big as a barn and the thugs still can not reach him in a hallway with a machine gun and 50 clips of ammunition. Where do all those bullets really go? The only redeeming feature of this film is watching Nia Peeples beat Ja Rule (real name Jeffrey Atkins does not sound so punk) on the floor. I could spend days watching that woman kick her foot over her shoulder ... especially wearing such a costume! It was just a bonus to see Jeffy kick himself, and it's fun to expect one of those kicks to really fall off. Sorry, it's just the moment we get stupid, tough guy, can not let rappers out of the movies. PLEEEEEASE! Who invented the idea? I doubted he was the one who decided that Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore would pass as spirited athletic angels. <br /> <br /> The only surprising twist in this movie is that they do not do the politically correct thing. and have Jeffy come in and save the day. Undoubtedly, if Snoop (also known to his mother as Calvin Broadus who again does not sound so cool when you refer to him as Cal) was in the movie, he would play some signs on her and probably save Segal's life or something.
