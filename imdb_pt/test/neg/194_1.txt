This movie is an insult to the piece on which it is based. Claude's character was deformed beyond recognition, leaving a painful performance that does not even vaguely resemble the original plot. Shame, shame, shame. They also cut a good number of the original score of the change in the context in which the songs are sung. This distorts the air of the film and makes the viewer aware of how it should be to shake as the writer of this play gives Hud a wife, turns Sheila into a rich and spoiled girl, characterizes Claude as a cowboy and kills Burger sending him to Vietnam. If someone is not familiar with the original storyline, I assure you that this is not a bad movie for you to see, but if you want to see the original or is, as I am, a die-hard fan of the classic piece, you would do your best to avoid the film altogether. One really should stick with one or the other.
