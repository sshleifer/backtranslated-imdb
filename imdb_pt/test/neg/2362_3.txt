This extremely noble Blaxploitation / Kung-Fu hybrid was released in my country by a questionable DVD label that usually speaks only occupies with the transfer of pure crap to disk, so it was not exactly a favorable herald. Several other titles have been released in the same series, such as "The Black Six", "The Black Gestapo" and "The Black Godfather" and, judging by all its low ratings and negative reviews, none of them belong to the elite of the years 70 of Blaxploitation. , nor. "TNT Jackson" is a very bad movie, completely without a significant plot, but with many laughable fighting scenes and a horrible performance to compensate. Apparently, Roger Corman? Never too embarrassed to make some easy money? appointed two of his most loyal acolytes to quickly invent a simplistic story that appealed to fans of Eastern Kung Fu films and contemporary Blaxploitation films. The result that Cirio H. Santiago and Dick Miller created was "TNT Jackson"; the tale of a black cat who travels to Hong Kong in search of her missing brother. She quickly discovers that he has been killed by a criminal network of drug smugglers and swears to avenge him. Mrs. Jackson gently infiltrates the underground and finds macho pimps, helpful undercover agents, many fierce Kung-Fu fighters. Only one thing is certain; they all want a snatching body piece from TNT in one form or another. I sincerely doubt that the concepts in the film are more elementary than that, but ?? unfortunately - all other aspects are also bad. The battle scenes are long and, in addition, pathetically staged. Jeannie Bell and the other poor suckers strive hard to look menacingly and take a difficult position, but eventually all they do is kick in the air and stupidly walk through the rooms. The cinematography is horrible, the soundtrack is very disappointing (what happened to soul music?), The few dialogues are poorly written and performance performances are inferior. Speaking of which, Jeannie Bell is undeniably a beautiful woman, but she still can not hold a candle to Tamara Dobson or Pam Grier. There is only one really good and memorable scene in "TNT Jackson," meaning the famous battle of the hotel room where Bell, entirely naked except for panties, repeatedly turns the light on and off while kicking the hell out of some henchmen. Funny scene ... I still have not figured out whether it's thanks to the ingenuity of the light switch or Bell's perfectly shaped breasts.
