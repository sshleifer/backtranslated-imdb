Desired as light entertainment, this film is indeed successful as such during its first semester, but then succumbs to a script that quickly knocks it down. Harry (Judd Nelson), a retired thief, and Daphne (Gina Gershon), an aspiring actress, work as showroom mannequins in a department store where one night they are late to leave and are locked up, where they testify, from his glass observation point less than protective, an apparent homicide occurring on the street. The ostensible killer, Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local sculptor, returns the next day to observe the mannequins, as he realizes they are the only possible witnesses to the violent event of the previous night, and when one of the posing pairs " ". , the fun begins. Daphne and Harry report their observations at a local police station, but when the detective who makes a crime report recalls Harry's criminal history, he becomes skeptical. There are many ways in which a film can become banal, and this manages to use most of them, including a mandatory bedroom scene in slow motion of passion. A low-budget case filmed in Vancouver, even the procedural aspects of police are displayed mechanically. The always capable Gershon tries to do something of his role, but Mancuso is incredibly histrionic, bizarre, when he attacks his lines with an obvious loose rein. Although the film falls into the absurd, director of photography Glen MacPherson prefers not to follow the same way, while it installs with the camera and illuminates some splendidly realized compositions in which a spectator can concentrate without ignoring the holes of plot and senseless dialogues. A well-crafted score, appropriately based on action, is contributed by Hal Beckett. The aforementioned dialogue is initially somewhat new and presented nicely by Nelson and Gershon, but in a subsequent context of imperfect continuity and logic, predictability takes over. The direction reflects the lack of original ideas or points of view, and post-production failures put the work further behind than should be expected for a basic thriller.
