While I'm not a woman, I can enjoy a girl's movie if it's good. But this is beyond evil. You have the story of the book, the girl is getting divorced, the boy with problems shows up. Magic BOOM happens and her demons are banished when she realizes that her life has a new purpose. <br /> <br /> Now, as long as I can believe that this kind of thing can happen, I'm not an idiot. That would not happen on a weekend of geriatric mess, that would take time. However, here the producers know they have only 1 hour and 30 minutes, so they force the changes of the two to happen, I suppose a night of hammering and a night of grandpa and grandma going on like dogs in heat can be enough if You believe romances were the gospel ... but most people do not. <br /> <br /> Now, if that is not enough ... the producers have reminded you that a girl movie must make the viewer cry. Well, they tried to make you cry with the two old people getting stuck with this because of failure ... so how could they beat you again? Because I know, we're going to kill one of the characters for no good reason, except that a random death will surely bring a tear to the eye ... and now let's the teenage daughter magically join the broken-hearted mother for no reason beyond fact that would be good (completely unreal, but who cares). <br /> <br /> So you got it ... girl meets boy, boy meets love, death meets boy and mother cries ... what movie - NO.
