I knew it was going to be horrible, but not so horrible !!, as it is one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen, nothing happens! All the characters are boring, and the story is stupid and incredibly annoying !, plus The ending is especially unsatisfactory! The only reason I rented this crap, because I'm a big fan of Michael Dudikoff, however, it's wasted here, and it seems extremely bored and shows no emotion than ever !, and I applauded aloud when the movie is over It's as if the movie had no plot and was nothing, and Ice-T is awful (even though he's good on some things), but Dudikoff and Yvette Nipar had no chemistry together. There is a scene that the director tried to make emotional but he failed miserably as Yvette Nipar did not really show much emotion, however, there is a decent car chase scene, but that's not enough for me to recommend this horrible movie! but the dialogue is atrocious. Avoid this movie as if the plague did not happen, please avoid and trust me, you can thank me later. The direction is awful! Fred Olen Ray does a horrible job here with shoddy, ridiculously cheap camera jobs, horrible parts, terrible angles, laughable use of movies and keep the movie at an incredibly monotonous pace. The acting is terrible! Michael Dudikoff is not even close to his surprising habitual self, he seems extremely bored, and shows no emotion, his character is also extremely annoying, since I can not believe he signed for this piece of garbage, he also had no chemistry with Yvette Nipar (Dudikoff still rules !!!). Ice-T has almost nothing to do and also seems bored, and he did not convince me at all. Hannes Jaenicke is not very good here, he had a somewhat weak character, I did not like him. Yvette Nipar is beautiful but it was really terrible here, she did not show much emotion, and had no chemistry with Dudikoff, and as a result I did not give a damn about her character! Art Hindle, (Owen Marsh), Kathy Harren (Katharine Marsh) and the rest of the cast are also bad. Overall, please avoid like the plague !, Fred Olen Ray and Steve Lathshaw should be ashamed of themselves! BOMB of 5
