If this film is an accurate display of J. Smits' acting skills, I think he made a big mistake leaving the television. Did not he watch movies starring David Caruso, especially "Cold Around the Heart"? Along the lines of acting ability, what about Mary-Louise, she did much, much better. Yes, it is a terrible script, improperly edited and totally devoid of continuity, but skilled actors can and have overcome similar obstacles. A big disappointment.
