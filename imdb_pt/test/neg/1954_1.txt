I remember when I first heard about Jack Frost. I was on Video Ezy in Miranda with my family in a monthly video hiring tradition. It was at this time that I had the courage to venture into the horror section of the store. Navigating through the various titles, I finally found Jack Frost. The cover was enough to convince me that the film was beyond my viewing pleasures. Years later, the film disappeared, only to be replaced by the inevitable, but unnecessary, continuation. Once again I ventured into the horror section and took the case just to come to a conclusion: would the movie be scary? but not intentionally. Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Assassin The snowman (a good title) follows where his predecessor left him. Sheriff Sam is looking for advice after his ordeals and Jack is now in the form of antifreeze. To escape his past, Sam and his wife go to a hotel on the island where he is in the company of a wide variety of horror movie stereotypes, including big-booty female models, thick-headed sports athletes, and Caribbean officials. However, Jack is released from his liquid tomb and is back to his icy methods. He heads for the island and continues to kill anyone who proves to have an impressive death. Only Sam can stop him. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that this is a straightforward movie for the video, so it's bound to be bad. But this is terrible, even in the eyes of other films. The work of the camera is bad, using a camera that would make a novel look majestic. Half the actors seem to have gotten out of a porn shoot and the other half seem to have come out of a nursing home, but in fact they have come out of an asylum. There is an extensive use of special effects used in the film that tends to switch between bland puppets and CGI that can be improved by a baby, and the death scenes are mostly off-screen showing little of what happened to the unfortunate , but deserving victims. But the film is more memorable because of a killer like "There's something that needs a little stuffing for Christmas" and "I know you've officially declared yourself to fuck!" Ultimately, the whole purpose behind a movie like this is to make a popcorn movie for the Friday nights of boredom and even fail at it. To make a sequel to a movie that was a poor slasher with a concept that a child would find unbelievable must have taken some nerves of steel? or a total frontal lobotomy. For director Michael Cooney? Thank you for wasting my time. For everybody? avoid like arsenic.
