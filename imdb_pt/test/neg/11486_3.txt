Throughout the history of cinema, there have been some films that have deceived the viewer, such as the "fear of the stage" of hitchcock, "opens the eyes" of alejandro amen√°bar, "the game" of David fincher and that "absent." for starters, I do not like this kind of movie, I feel like someone is trying to pull my leg. <br /> <br /> In addition, after seeing this movie, it is not known what happened. Confused movie. "the brilliance" of kubrick may be a better or worse film, but it is definitely more honest than this load of pretentious and dubious situations. technically good - perfect photography, fair performance and so on, but the script is so bad I wonder what the producers saw to continue and film that crap. <br /> <br /> And this movie comments that the three guys who wrote the script (calparsoro, loriga and quiroga) are lost in the cinema trying to make a masterpiece - or trying to do something to satisfy their stomachs, waiting for projects more personal.
