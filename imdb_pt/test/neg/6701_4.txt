Last night, I attended an exhibition of Badland with my cousin. We got a little excited when we discovered that the director / writer, the producer (his wife) and several cast members were also present and that there would be a discussion and questions and answers after the movie. But once the film is gone and the credits have started spinning (and the film has not really been edited well enough and is too long), my cousin and I, without consulting each other, immediately get up and leave. We found out once that we started talking outside that we were feeling so angry that not only did we not want to stay in the discussion, but we could not look at the cast and crew that were near the exit and whom we walked to soon after. we leave <br /> <br /> I discovered that the roots of my anger were planted during the scene in which Jerry cuts his daughter Celina's palm with a large knife so that her blood can be used to leave. a false trail. It was inevitable to connect in my mind the physical pain he inflicted on his body with the emotional pain he inflicted on his spirit by murdering his mother and two brothers in his presence, sparing her and taking her with him when he ran away. I've pounded my palm before (accidentally); even a rather shallow cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive, and it is too slow to heal if you do not keep it still because you keep opening it trying to go about your life. But after a short period of time with only a narrow band of cloth tied awkwardly around the palm of her hand and a scene with a large band-aid, it was as if she had never been cut. My anger has reached its peak - I will not ruin this moment for you - in the final scene of Celina. <br /> <br /> I was angry because Celina is by far the nicest character in the movie (the actress portraying her is good); I was and you can not tell me that a good screenwriter would not know this by immersing himself in both his physical and his emotional pain; and the writer, treating Celina's emotional pain so arrogantly and with such disrespect, also treated me, the audience member, in an arrogant way and with total disrespect. <br /> <br /> Of course, the script has moments of tears for Celina, and some dialogue that tells us that she is suffering, somewhere, somehow. But by now we the public are feeling so manipulated that we're done. The manipulation begins very early in this film, when Jerry's family dialogue explains to the audience that Jerry had psychiatric problems. Rule one, writers: Give credit to your audience. Let them do a good creative job on their own. Tell the story; Do not tell us everything we should think and feel. We do not like that. <br /> <br /> My cousin also knew she was having trouble with the film early on in terms of dialogue, when Jerry and his wife had little to say to each other, besides f *** it, f *** That, f *** you. Some couples actually find themselves in relationships so bad that the f-bomb ends up being another word out of their mouths. But it's like watching comedians who damn much. Some of them are really funny; the curse is auxiliary. But some of them replace humor by cursing, and this writer, to bring the metaphor to its conclusion, is not Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> This husband and wife team has boldly chosen to deal with a terribly complex story with a terribly complex complex. characters. But they do not seem to have realized that the meaning of a story, especially complex, will vary for each member of the audience. Telling success stories requires attention to important factual details, not working desperately to interpret the meaning of the story to the entire audience. <br /> <br /> I've worked with Vietnam veterans for five years, I've heard more stories than most, and I'm always happy to see released movies that bring their stories to a wider audience. It is important, at all different levels, that we listen to them. But I'm less than thrilled that this storyteller has decided before the movie even started Jerry's story and start spelling for us with a very heavy hand. Next time, pay more attention to detail.
