it seems that if you are going to post here will be a rating of 10 stars, no one seems to ever like anything, well, I'm honest, some do not like it, but here we go, ray ray show is just awful. !!!!!!, this show reminds me of the beautiful snl character whatever she had a cuisine - whatever show. I must say I liked Rachel on the food chain for $ 35- $ 40 a day but I'm sorry she did not have enough life experience to make her day interesting on a daily basis, give me ham on the street, anthony bourdain , interesting people, but most of all I find annoying, she actually told a member of the studio audience to "shut up" yes in a joke, but shut up is shut up, and who cares about their stories pet, sorry Rachel you were canceled !!!!
