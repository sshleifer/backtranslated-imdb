I do not know how this DVD made its way to my collection - my wife suggested it was one of those "3 for £ 20" deals at a street store. The thing is not worth 66p, how much more £ 6.66! Having invested heavily in it, I felt it my duty to watch it to the end, just to make sure it was just as bad all the time - and it was. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was horrible, the story The line was impenetrable (I still do not understand what the hell was happening, despite having read the synopsis), the camera work was disjointed and hopeless, acting was wooden (not helped by dialogue). <br /> <br /> In fact, there were no redeeming features - no, not even the lovely Sandra Bullock, in whose brilliant subsequent career that pile of impurities was probably sold. She must get her agent to buy all rights to him and bury him as quickly as possible. As the last amusing example of the director's ineptitude, there was a scene where the young leader is talking to his father. ex-army aide while driving. This was the clearest dialogue in the movie - no motor noise! I look forward to engine cushioning technology eventually making its way through the pond in British cars!
