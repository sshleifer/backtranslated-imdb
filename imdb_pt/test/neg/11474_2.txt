Bad Mau Mau. How are movies like this made? Badly written, poorly represented; I could go on, but why bother? As an aside, note that the first names of the characters are the same as the actors who play them: this is an undeniable thing that no one on the set is interested enough in their role of bothering to learn the names of someone else's characters!
