This movie was annoying. Much like Underworld, just less interesting. It's not much of a werewolf movie or even close to a horror movie. The main couple was annoying. I did not care about Vivian and Aiden. And there was so little character development that I did not care about any characters in the movie. The plot was thin paper. The transformations were basically zero. I liked the wolves themselves, I might as well have made a documentary about wolves, I would have liked that better. I would not recommend this movie. I did not find it amusing or interesting. It just creeps and everyone is a boring swallow. This movie could win a prize for how not to make a werewolf movie.
