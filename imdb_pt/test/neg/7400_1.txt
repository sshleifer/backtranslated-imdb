Bloody annoyance! You can not get into issues like these with TV budgets and some smartass director who can not tell the difference between a Lanc I, II and III. All silly cliches are well in place; in character and on the human level the story is so schmaltzy and unbelievable that it hurts. And all those responsible are thrilled by the brilliant ratings. Technical details: trash. Lancs flying so close would have kicked each other from the sky to the dozens. Night fighters of single engine that attack the line to the rear: ridiculous. As I said: created by a director I bet I've never heard the name Lancaster before that project and some kids who turned Lancs into ducks. But these are minor things compared to the overall mediocrity of this movie. Although it may be very hard, I daresay it hurts the memory of those who died on both sides. TV shit, entertaining the dumb masses who do not care anyway. Shame on those responsible. Use your brain next time. And enjoy the profit you made from it.
