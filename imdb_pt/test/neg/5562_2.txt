Yes, absolutely terrible, And this comes from someone who loves bad movies - but there is a limit. I like all kinds of horror / suspense movies, and I have seen a wonderful work of European filmmakers. Broceliande unfortunately is not among those wonderful pieces of footage. Camera work is worse than amateur. It's not the kind of MTV camera job the videographer needs Ritalin, which many filmmakers use to camouflage their lack of talent. This is simply bad frame composition and terrible image composition. The acting is ridiculous when it is not fully two-dimensional. The dialogues are artificial and unnatural - even more so than his usual horror / suspense film, which focuses on pseudo-mysticism. I think what struck me most were the horribly choreographed fighting scenes at the end of the movie. These were bad enough to be ridiculous. I've seen what a small budget can do, and this can work wonders. That was just a bad movie. Very, very sad.
