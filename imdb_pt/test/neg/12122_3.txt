Mystery of low budget. A shot comes out of the darkness and a woman is seen running from that direction. A young architect Jimmy McMillan (Chick Chandler) discovers a corpse that disappears. The hurried woman, Mary (June Clyde), is attached to the scene of death; but it is McMillan who has to try to solve the case to avoid serious suspicions. Suspects are six store owners near the crime scene. The whole atmosphere of Film-Noir; but not exactly the real thing. This flick brings together just enough to be a decent low budget mystery / drama and is a good escape. Other players include: George Meeker, Michael Raffetto, Milton Wallace and Rebel Randall.
