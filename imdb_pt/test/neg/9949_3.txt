As I sit down and think of Poison for the Fairies, I realize that I may not be fair to the movie. My rating of 3/10 may have more to do with my disappointment with the movie than its actual quality or entertainment value. Based on the plot description, IMDb commentary, and IMDb rating of 7.6, I would have made sure I had stumbled upon a little known gem. Unfortunately, that did not do much for me. For some reason, Poison for the Fairies almost made me sleep. <br /> <br /> Poison for the Fairies is the story of two young women in 1965 in Mexico City. One of the girls, Veronica, is a compulsive liar and tells her friend that she, Veronica, is a witch. The other girl, Flavia, is so naive that she believes and is frightened by everything her friend tells him. That's really about it. In reality, nothing happens and the film creeps while Veronica tries to terrify and dominate Flavia. One reviewer from IMDb described him as "the scariest movie in 80's Mexican cinema." My comment ?? if that is the case, there may not have been many horror films made in Mexico in the 1980s. Another commentator wrote, "See if you want to be scared." My comment ?? Are you sure we're talking about the same movie? My opinion is diametrically opposed to these examples that I have given. For me, it was monotonous, uninspired and poorly represented. The framing of the scene is especially annoying, since director Carlos Enrique Taboada never shows the faces of any of the other characters. Veronica and Flavia carry on long conversations with members of their families and their teachers, but in fact we never see the faces of these people. It's a boring trick.
