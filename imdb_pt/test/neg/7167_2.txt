'Book II' is not a movie, it's a sermon. This nauseating, sickly, and almost unbearably tedious flaw probably functions as religious propaganda, but has no entertainment value other than a few George Burns jokes. Louanne plays a girl who is invited by God to put together an advertising campaign that will make people believe in him again. No, really, that's the story. It is a heavy load of old cobblers who have much religious "self explanatory" religious waffle, but almost no decent dialogue and certainly a complete absence of anything that comes close to magic or charm. 'Miracle On 34th Street' this is not. Suzanne Pleshette breathes a little of life into this rancid puddle of fast-setting concrete, but the pudding-headed script and the gargling performance of the annoying Louanne quickly send her into the fiery depths of you-know-where.
