Oh gosh. This was possibly the worst movie I've seen in years. I mean, what else can be done with the old story of the "woman inside the body of man"? was full of clich√©s, for example, the nerd coming in his own sequence, the "boy" getting what's coming up to him etc. I'm not calling these spoilers because anyone could guess what happens !! the only thing she had was Laura Fraser, who gave an average performance. and as for the "dream" boy, this was the wettest play of all time. even the bad guys were instantly forgotten. <br /> <br /> terrible movie.
