Review: Nunsploitation movies. They've been around forever. Some that come to mind are the Mexican devil worship film Alucarda, Night of the Demons 2, The Convent and, of course, Dante Tomasellis Desecration. We can not blame someone for trying to exploit a religious / sacred image and twist it to make it scary. If done correctly, it works. Here comes the latest addition to the subgenre nunsploitation simply titled The Nun. <br /> <br /> The story is about this group of girls who lives in a Catholic school. In this school there is a nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls. The girls who act in self-defense against the abusive nun accidentally kill her and decide to bury her and not tell anyone. Going forward 18 years later and the nun is back in search of revenge for those who killed her. <br /> <br /> This film was produced by Brian Yuznas Fantastic Factory. You know, the company that makes horror movies in Spain. Need a reminder of the type of movies this company produces? Well heres a small reminder: Arachnid, Darkness, Romasanta: Werewolf Hunting, Rottweiler. You get the picture. About the only really good movie that this company produced (in my opinion) was Stuart Gordons Dagon. That's it. Oh no, wait, I believe they also produced Christian Bale's excellent vehicle, The Machinist. But that's it. So when I consciously rented this movie, I knew I would not watch anything that was good for the mind. Still, with all this mental preparation, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> One of the only good things this movie has for it is its smooth look. The film has great cinematography. It does not look like a cheap horror movie. The movie special effects were good, with The Nun being able to travel through the water. Well, this was an image that lent itself to some cool fx moments that sometimes scratched out extravagant territory, but sometimes they were cool enough to watch. I dug that scene with the nun shooting people like a bucket of water. It's not a particularly deadly move, but it did look cool. There are some gore's here but not much of that. One particular scene involving the death of an elevator was cool, but unfortunately the movie reached its peak with that scene. And it was only halfway. After that, nothing really cool happens and the movie deludes itself into an incredible borefest. <br /> <br /> The movie turns out to be The Nun appearing every now and then to give us a scare, it would kill someone and then CUT! We go back to the characters talking crap, going through rooms, opening doors, you get the drill. And I personally hate it when a horror movie turns into this. People opening doors and entering rooms. Boring! And when the characters speak their terrible dialogue. In a particularly stupid scene, a character decides out of nowhere that the nun turns to flesh and blood whenever she's in the water, so that's how they'll try to kill her. And everyone says just OK! And everyone devises this plan to kill the nun in a water tank. Now, who gave this guy that information and why others just gave it away as a guarantee? Who the hell knows, but its scenes like these that make the movie look stupid. <br /> <br /> And another thing that bothered me in this movie was the fact that they used Spanish actors that a very thick accent. When they try to speak English it is very difficult to understand what the heck they are trying to say. I'd rather have them dubbed it, so try to figure out what they're saying and get frustrated. The fact that this DVD did not have English subtitles also did not help. <br /> <br /> So in conclusion, this is a movie that has some cool visuals, nice sound effects, but a terrible and terrible script. I think this just shows you can have the biggest budget or the best special effects but if your movie has a bad script with terrible characters and situations that your audience can not connect then you still have a bad movie. Such was the case with The NUN. <br /> <br /> If you want to have fun with the evil nuns, rent any of the movies I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Now as for the makers of this movie, they should go say ten hailstones and light fifty candles to their saint of choice to see if they will be forgiven for making this movie terribly sinful. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5.
