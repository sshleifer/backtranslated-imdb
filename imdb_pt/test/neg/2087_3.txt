Just Desserts was, I must say, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was terrible and even the plot was laughable. I gave him 3 out of 10 instead of 1 because I like to laugh at excruciating movies. My expectations were not high to begin with, but it turned out to be harder than I expected. I thought it might not be that bad when it started, but as soon as the name of the competition - The Golden Whisk - came up, I started to change my mind. Everything went downhill. The only thing I liked about this movie, apart from laughing at the absurd plot and dialogue, was watching them cook. However, being a movie about confectioners, there were minimal scenes in which they actually baked anything. I would recommend watching the cooking channel instead of this movie. You get to see more food being prepared, and you avoid the pathetic headlines. However, if you love flamboyant love stories, which is sometimes fun, go ahead and watch.
