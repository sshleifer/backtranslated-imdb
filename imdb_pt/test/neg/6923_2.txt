Writer / director Brian Burns has obviously seen some romantic comedies, and seems to think he's discovered the formula for success: many filming in New York (preferably in winter), allusions to old Hollywood movies (especially musical), nice musical soundtrack . Unfortunately, this is merely offset by Burns' lack of talent as a writer. (The great mystery of many writing directors who make independent films is not why they can not continue with big studios, but how they get any support for their films.) Usually our interest in comedy romantic is motivated by the main characters, but the couple in this movie simply has no appeal. This is not the fault of David Krumholtz or Milla Jovavich; his characters are poorly written. What we answer in such classics as When Harry Met Sally or Annie Hall or older films like His Girl Friday are peculiarities and flaws of the main characters' personalities. Without the ability to create individuals, Burns gives us a special post-school inspired by Men are from Mars, women are from Venus. <br /> <br /> As anyone can see, Burns, as the successor to Woody Allen, is beyond me. I did not laugh once during this movie, and the screen is full of echo chamber dialog ("I want to paint the city in red.") Do you want to paint the city in red? He has no business writing to live. In one of the first scenes, we see the girlfriend of the actress from Krumholz filming a TV sitcom. It's the only time in the entire film that the dialogue seems right; perhaps this indicates what the Burns talents are for.
