I know, it's a movie. But when it comes to portraying real life (in any matter), it should be as faithful as possible. I'm sorry, but "El Misterio Gal√≠ndez" is not as accurate as it sounds. Neither is the Dominican Republic represented as it really is. In fact, I was shocked to see that the filming location for Santo Domingo was actually Cuba. And incredibly, Cuban-themed movies (Havana, The Lost City, Bitter Bitter, The Godfather II) were filmed in Santo Domingo! So what happened here? Why did they film the film in Cuba instead of D.R.? The Spanish dialogues with the Cuban accent are horrible! Those are not Dominicans! At the historical level, Galindez would never have been hanged. He could very well have been shot, beheaded or died of the inhuman torture he was receiving. Then he threw his body into the Caribbean Sea. But Trujillo would never have ordered death by strangulation. His sick mind would not have allowed it. <br /> <br /> The performance is not delivered as expected. Harvey Keitel looks like he's just waiting for a paycheck. I prefer the lead actress in "Deep Blue Sea". The rest of the cast would have been excellent in some Cuban film, and the same goes for the selected filming location. <br /> <br /> I suggest "La fiesta del chivo" (The bode feast), the bestseller. the author Mario Vargas Llosa, directed by his cousin Luis Llosa. It's a bit more realistic with Dominican history. The character of Trujillo is very well portrayed, and the Galindez incident is dealt with very briefly in this film.
