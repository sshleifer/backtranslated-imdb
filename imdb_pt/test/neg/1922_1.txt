*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** HERE ON THE LAND / (2000) 1/2 * (of four) <br /> <br /> "Here on Earth" by Mark Piznarski holds the record for a film containing the most recycled material in 96 minutes. Literally, all artifice, cliché and element of familiar plot are somewhere here; there is simply nothing original, original or new about it. God, what a dying movie to sit; I wish I had seen the movie during the launch last year, so it could have won the worst list of my year. This is the kind of movie in which the story becomes instantly obvious and comes down to the opening credits, and worst of all, it takes itself seriously. "Here on the Earth" is clearly one of the most horrible and painful movies ever to come. <br /> <br /> "Here on Earth" is a teenage heartthrob movie, so it should contain some of the Hollywood movies. more esteemed young people who are attractive and inexperienced enough to accept a role in a movie as bad as that. Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett fit that description and take on the lead roles. Klein plays Kelley, an arrogant and insolent student with a rich dad (the number one cliché). He must graduate as a class orator and attend Ivy League College in the footsteps of his father (Stuart Wilson). This defines the "I do not want your life" cliché in which the father tries to control the life of his son while the son resists rebellious. Play Kelley's late mother who committed suicide some time ago. When his father brings another woman home, he brutally questions his intentions (the cliché "no one can replace the mother" counts as number two). Josh Hartnett plays Jasper, a character on the opposite side of society. for Kelley. Her family owns a local restaurant. Enter your long-standing love interest, Samantha Cavanaugh (Leelee Sobieski) a waitress at the restaurant that covers her sister (who has no purpose instead of controlling the next scene) when Jasper and Kelley act like childish idiots running their cars and (oh not) colliding with the diner, causing it to explode in flames. (Conflicts between rich and poor will count as cliché number three.) <br /> <br /> The battered car chase leaves Kelley and Jasper in peace for a planned and plausible conflict. They get in trouble with the law, but as this movie feels the need to exist, the local judge orders them an alternative to the time of service: they must work together to help rebuild the cafeteria. <br /> <br /> The two boys work hard over the summer, growing strong and getting a nice tan. Samantha's eye catches Kelley and romantic sparks fly. Jasper is jealous but wants what is best for his true love (cliché number four). Her parents (Annette O'Toole and Bruce Greenwood) disapprove of her little romantic triangle (cliché number five), but she continues with two Jasper moments without a second thought. His father is also the local sheriff, which is surprising (tells the melodic cliché number six). The romantic feelings invented between Kelley and Samantha count as the number seven cliché. But Samantha's relationship with Jasper is never defined, so how can there be some romantic tension? If the film will induce involvement in choosing Samantha between the two youngsters, then we need to see the two characters on both sides. The film portrays Jasper as a distraction to his "legitimate love," Kelley. Of course Jasper really loves her, but it's also clear that she does not love him back. This absolutely eliminates the romantic tension at the beginning of the story. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski does not hurt here; however, her charm and performance do not fit into a two-character character like Samantha. John Hartnett is also right for the role of Jasper, but the film gives him nothing to do but fight with Kelley. Chris Klein manages to make a good name for himself here; he passes much of the shirtless, sweaty and overloaded film. Unfortunately he does not show his ability to act, perhaps because he has very little. The support cast is much more talented. Bruce Greenwood provides the best performance in the film but does not have close enough screen time to save anything except a few brief moments. I also enjoyed the performance of Stuart Wilson, who fits perfectly into the role of a wealthy father and controller of high social status. <br /> <br /> So we leaned over the problem on Samantha's knee exactly one hour and ten minutes into the film (another spoiler ahead). What is this, she has a serious incurable disease (another trick in the photo, about the number eight). His terminal illness brings the two young competitors together as friends, well, at least I think that's what the movie was intended to show, that the loss of a loved one by two enemies can bring the two together (cliché number nine). Klein rehearses his orator's speech to demonstrate that his character is more than a superficial stereotype, but we have seen this many times before I prefer a rich character rather than a deeply sentimental one that hides real feelings (cliché, hum, was ten)? The conflicts between Kelley and Jasper are desperate and empty; a comment "their mother" unleashes a fight while they rebuild the establishment. There's a retreading of "Armageddon," while Samantha and Kelley spread out in a fierce, horny open field as he slowly runs his fingers around his body, naming areas after American cities (why not call that number eleven). The film uses alcohol as a means to increase romantic tension: an intoxicated Kelley makes a fool of himself after fighting with Samantha's boyfriend, Jasper, but the next day he recites desires just to dance (cliché number, oh no, I I'm losing count.
