From the title, the tagline, the summary of the plot on DVD etc ..., I expected something at least a bit epic, with historical fiction and the novel competing to thrill it; was what they did in Last of the Mohicans, for example, and I think they did a great job. Maybe I have very high standards for this movie and have not given it a fair chance. But the bad scenario was OK (how could they not create something more beautiful when they had such landscapes to work?), The two lovers had no chemistry whatsoever, and the plot was so predictable that it seemed to have been drawn. in 5 minutes by a child of twelve years old - and not very imaginative. Nouvelle-France is a love story set in a historical time full of events. But the story of the Nouvelle-France is hardly a secondary note, and the love story is banal and fails dramatically to make the viewer care about the fate of lovers. Surprisingly, the only good parts about the film came from something completely unexpected and unannounced: the relationship between Marie-Loup, the heroine and her children (a natural, an adoptee). If they had focused on their family and forgotten the love story, it would have been a much better film. Marie-Loup's parents should have been given more time on the screen and character development, politics in Britain should have been more than a three-minute scene with almost no connection to the rest, the rotten bad should have been more developed or removed from the script completely (why hire actors like Vincent Perez, Tim Roth or Jason Isaacs to abuse them so badly?) Bad work in general.
