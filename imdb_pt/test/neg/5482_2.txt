They are only 2 stars because they put a lot of work into making this game look good. I played many good and bad games and I think this game has the dullest story I've ever been forced to listen to. The best thing they could have done is to let you skip the conversations (but no, you should hear them talking for 10 minutes) and keep doing the same things over and over again. Go up the building, save the citizen, go kill some guy. IT'S ALL THE SAME THING! Ubisoft should really hire someone with some imagination. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of the Prince of Persia series (first 3). The story was good and you wanted to know what happens next all the time. I do not even hate Prince of Persia 4. But I think anyone who was in charge of developing the Assassin's Creed story should be banned from writing anything else for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> Boring story and same missions over and over again! If only one of these two things were good, the game would be worth playing.
