Originally, the spiders were planned as a four part series, and it shows. I do not like serials; they are typically ridiculous, complicated, and banal. This is no exception. In the first part of the Spiders, "The Golden Lake," a rich adventurer thwarts plans for a gang of criminals - the Spiders - to steal gold from the Incas. A silly love triangle follows, with some action from cowboys and Indians. The sensationalism and the exoticism of this did not amuse me. <br /> <br /> One can legitimately trace the themes of this two-part series to Lang's later and superior work. And the film production is better than in other shows I've seen since, including 'Les Vampires' (1915). In spiders, the camera is not so static, and this movie is fast, fortunately. Dyeing and lighting are also appropriate. None of this is remarkable, however. It is almost indecorous, however, in how close this series resembles Louis Feuillade's series; the criminal gang dresses and behaves like those in 'Les Vampires' - just the names and, to a lesser extent, the situations have changed. <br /> <br /> For additional comments on The Spiders series, see the web pages for this.
