The director / leader, Larry Bishop, tried a lot with the Hell Ride. The movie wants to be daring, witty, provocative, weird, biting all of it, apparently in a Quentin Tarantino / Rob Zombie style. But he is not nervous. References seem forced. The dialog box tries to be smart and fails. Humor is never funny. Nice attempt to set a harsh tone, but we'd have to worry about the characters or the story to be remotely successful. <br /> <br /> What's left are cool Harleys and pretty girls surrounding a lot of tired, old and out of shape "bad boys" in what seems like an attempt to make a modernized Western Sergio Leone. If this movie can make new generations interested in movies of the 60s and 70s, praise for it. But by itself, it's rather boring and irrelevant. I believe there is a place for style over substance. But this movie is not that.
