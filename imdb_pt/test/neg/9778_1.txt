I lost $ 5 renting this complete piece of junk. Dr. Zack is the most unlovable main character I've ever seen. The movie was full of EVERY cliché you could imagine and did not contain a single ORIGIN of originality. There was the typical sexism portrayed by strangers, all guys had those "very proud to take advice" attitudes that are as obsolete as Grandma's Christmas fruit cake. The concept and the killings were really cool, but they miss all the news once the monster is revealed. (read SPOILER at the end) Nothing else is really revealed, the ending is the biggest excuse you ever saw. I predicted everything before it happened, including who would die and how. Dialogue is lacking, and that is a euphemism from afar. There are mostly just random shouts, thoughtful looks and heavy sentences. The actors are just GOD AWFUL! I do not want to talk about this movie anymore, it's making me angry. I just wonder if the director still watched when it was done. <br /> <br /> (SPOILER ALERT !!!! SAVE 5 DOLLARS!) The monster is just a bunch of ants that "evolved" so now they need bones so they can move, (forget the fact that that this serves no evolutionary advantage and that the ants killed anyone who was available, although the film acts as if they were killed out of necessity. from the lead idiot killing the ant mother (a big bubble thing), which destroys all the other ants. Too cliché eh? He almost fainted in the end because of a sudden emotional attachment to the thing of the mother that surpasses it. Give me some time.
