Piece of crap that only Full Moon Studios could do has a bunch of college kids, getting free in an old hospital without anyone knowing, like a demonic creature with two faces (the whole thing is not visible because of incomprehensible lighting) passes by the walls killing every member that has a certain sheet of paper with old marks. Someone among them (it will not be too difficult to prove, but a little twist is so little revealed and minimally executed that you will simply sneer) is the brains behind who the beast kills and must be revealed before they kill everyone. /> Cheap, bad acting mess has a "Is that there?!" kind of weak end that will leave you exasperated because you just wasted your time. Tanya Dempsey, who failed to break through a wet paper bag, has heroin roles as the newest member of the student group named Clark. Oh, and the title refers to the sound the beast makes before it attacks the next victim.
