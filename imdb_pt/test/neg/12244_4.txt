With so many horrible movies, this is, unfortunately, a breath of fresh air for the genre. Compared to the classics like "Airplane" or "Naked Gun", this is horrible, but compared to recent films like Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie, this is very clever and original. Do not get me wrong, however, this was not a good movie. I laughed a few times, and there are some jokes inspired, but any reference to pop culture falls flat on the floor, just like most of the jokes in the movie. Lambeau Fields (David Koechner) was a bad Coach in the past but now he is brought back to teach college football, and this time he will do a good job. His wife (Melora Hardin) is feeling distant from him and his daughter is dating a great football to annoy her father. Sounds from several recent movies come on the scene, as well as lots of visual jokes and uninterrupted stupidity. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the movie are the jokes that are not based on references to recent movies. Parodies of Radio, Rocky, Dodgeball, Friday Night Lights, Invincible and many other sports movies are not funny at all. It's mostly the smaller gags that give a few laughs, like a scene of bizarre laughter, or a chewed-up joke of chewing tobacco. These little disposable laughs can not carry the film, and in the end, it's hard to watch. The last 20 minutes are tiring to sit on. <br /> <br /> The characters are amazingly developed for a movie of sports spoofs, but I'm sure the characters were built on clich√©s of the genre. However, they are not so bad. David Koechner can take the lead actor out of a movie. Too bad they gave him so much bad stuff to work with. Matthew Lawerence has a great comedic timing in a role not always as comical as a football player who dances ballet with a father who is dressed cross-legged. Carl Weathers completes the cast once again playing in an under-par sports movie (not the Rocky movies ... Happy Gilmore!) Overall, this is a silly comedy. Sometimes it's funny, but more often than not, it's just too boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 90 min. PG-13 for language, sexual humor and drug humor.
