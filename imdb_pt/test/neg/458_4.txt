After the turning point of NIGHT SHOULD CUT, Robert Montgomery (for the most part) got into his best films and performances: HERE COMES MR. JORDAN, WERE AVAILABLE, LADY ON LAKE, WALK ON PINK HORSE, SAXON CHARM, JUNE BRIDE. Even some of the failures he encountered were interesting enough to still be watched (RAGE IN HEAVEN, MR. AND MRS. SMITH). But Montgomery wanted to do more and more production and direct the job. In 1949 he did what would be his last film performance - he played Collier Lang, a selfish movie star who is dragged to help authorities investigate a young girl's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Apparently, my view of this movie is a minority view. Most of the opinions given are favorable about this. I thought it was a boring and boring script, with Ann Blyth's groupie heroine not very attractive as a character. She admires Montgomery as a star, and it "helps" when he is called in to help the authorities, but after a while I discovered that there was no chemistry between them. The script was also devoid of much fun, though Montgomery and Roland Winters tried. The only thing I remember to this day is that Taylor Holmes is Blyth's rich dad, and he's an admirer of Winston Churchill. So he always dresses like Churchill, and we see him wearing a wide-brimmed hat, smoking a big cigar and painting (Holmes's bald head helps in disguise). That was the most memorable joke in this movie - it's not a real memory. <br /> <br /> Montgomery entered the beginning of the television and finally gained the attention and the respect that always deserved in films. His last contact with the cinema was his direction of the GALLANT HOURS about Admiral William "Bull" Halsey, starring his friend Jimmy Cagney. It's a much better movie than that. For his global film and television career, I'm going to give this mediocre movie a "4". That seems generous to me.
