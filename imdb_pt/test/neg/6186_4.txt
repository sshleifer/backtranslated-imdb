Coltrane and Idle are members of a bank robber gang who crosses the leader during an assault. They hide in a school of nuns and disguise themselves properly to avoid detection of the mob and the police. A lot of catholic humor and clowning, but the script is a bit skinny as are the laughter .. There is a good shower scene though ... on a scale of one to ten.
