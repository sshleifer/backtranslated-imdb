I would have liked to put 0.5, but unfortunately I can not. Who could write such bad scripts (I saw the film five seconds and knew the "bad boy" would be Sutherland - he needed to pay his taxes, when you see how good he was in the Redford movie, "Ordinary People" and others! ) Although I did not like that, but I had no choice, I saw the film in French, but I know that listening to the real voices of Sheen, Sutherland and Hamilton would not have changed things except perhaps making it more pitiful. <br /> <br /> What makes me sick is that people make a living doing these bad things (I forgot to talk about Mr. Waterson, away from the Woody Allen movies he used to play <br /> < (I'm not talking about the real titles with Connery (please, it's the end of the holiday, wake up!).
