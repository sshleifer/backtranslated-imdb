I got sucked in by the big names. Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles, Burt Reynolds and the fact that it is an independent film. Unbelievably slow start: 35 minutes, two sad songs and a spoiled robbery. I did not care about the characters, and the plot never led me to pretend it could be realistic. I can not believe this is what makes it to the screen. I loved watching this movie because it looked so good when it was over.
