Before you begin, let me take something from my chest: I am a big fan of John Eyres's first film, PROJECT: SHADOWCHASER. The film, a level B movie by THE TERMINATOR & DIE HARD, may not be the work of a cinematic genius, but it is an extremely entertaining action movie that has become a cult hit (& spawned two sequels and a spin off). Judge and Jury begin with Joseph Meeker, a convicted murderer who was sent to Death Row after his capture after the so-called "Bloody Shootout" (which seems to be a bad name for a series of murders?) Meeker kills three people while attempting to rob a store of convenience), being taken to the electric chair. There is a fun scene where Meeker talks to the priest about living for sex, but knowing his true love (who was killed during the shooting), expressing his revenge for the person who killed her ?? Michael Silvano, a football star who spends his days watching his son Alex playing soccer with his high school team (and ends up harassing his son's coach). But once run, Meeker returns as a daydream (or as Kelly Perine calls it "a hamburger without the fries"), whose sole purpose is to get her revenge, which basically means to make Silvano's life a misery. <br /> <br /> Let me point out the fact that the judge and jury is not a real horror movie. It's a supernatural action movie, with Meeker chasing after Silvano, using his ability to change shape (which makes David Keith dress up as an imitator of Elvis, a French chef (with an accent as bad as his mustache), a drag queen, a clown and a comedian stand-up), a shotgun that fires explosives and an invulnerability to death (although this does not prevent Martin Kove from shooting Keith with a Desert Eagle), to pay Silvano back for killing his wife of Meeker. Director John Eyres does not seem interested in characterizations, focusing only on action scenes, which the film has in abundance. But that's the main flaw of the movie, since there's nothing to connect the action scenes together. The acting is surprisingly good, with Keith performing best, expertly supported by Kove, as well as Paul Koslo, who plays the successful cop. Kelly Perine is annoying as the taxi driver trying to help, but it worsens the situation.
