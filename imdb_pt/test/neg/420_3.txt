Personally, the book was a very well written, incredible and exciting piece that was not brought to justice for the film. Watching the movie at 12:01 am to see what parts of the book were left out frustrated me, since it affected the "different" result of the movie. There was something to be desired in this film, but in spite of everything, it lacked a plot. <br /> <br /> For someone who has NOT read the book, I could see how this movie would be seen as inviting and entertaining with its controversy and suspense. However, for a dedicated reader who read it seven times, I did not see the strong connection between the two: both the movie and the novel. <br /> <br /> Missing major characters (such as Maximilian Kohler) and abrupt turnaround in the plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the preferred, the plot of the film was slightly spread, leading to a different take at the conclusion of the story. Hassassin was also portrayed as an ordinary white man compared to the novel in which he was portrayed as a Muslim; His motives in the book are predominantly based on his ties to the Illuminati; however, in the film, his motives are money-based and seemed more like work than a personal tie with the task at hand.
