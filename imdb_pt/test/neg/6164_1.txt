Unfortunately House of D is simply awful, with a ridiculous plot, terrible writing, some mediocre acting, and in fact almost everything else is unsatisfactory. <br /> Tom flees from NYC to somehow survive as a solitary child in Paris, and manages to convince the beautiful Parisian girl that he eventually marries that he is French despite a misunderstanding of his language. She is shocked when years later he reveals his "secret" to her! Riiiight! <br /> <br /> He then "presents" his tale of disgrace with his own son, and on which we must believe he thinks it's just the greatest birthday present a father can give his 13 year old son. If only these things were so easy! David Duchovny criticizes his wife Tea Leoni in the role of his mother and attacks again. Leoni makes me laugh like a comic book, but she's just wrong for this role. <br /> <br /> One of the problems with this is that none of the characters are friendly. I just did not care what happened to either of them. I'd rather have Robin Williams and his trademark "child in an adult's body" fall into a hole in the Village, but unfortunately it was not meant to be and we had to endure his playful performance all the time. The daughter of Anton Yelchin and William Zelda was not bad but I suspect the criticism that others are giving to them is simply because they were not even close to as bad as everyone else in this movie. They were not great, let me put it that way. <br /> <br /> There are so many silly and planned aspects in that film - Erykah Badu, the bike, the Catholic school and its team of idiots, the conveniently stupid characters, etc - that this review would last forever, so I go finish saying that House of D is a very bad movie, and I'm almost embarrassed by Duchovny. <br /> <br /> What really bores me is how I got so strongly encouraged by "friends" online to see this that I traveled a long way to do it. <br /> <br /> I would not have been so upset that this movie was so bad if I had just lost a few hours at the local cinema, but instead I wasted all day, and discovered that my so-called "friends" are stupid or dishonest, because this is a horrible movie!
