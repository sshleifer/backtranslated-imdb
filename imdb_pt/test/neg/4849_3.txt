This is the kind of movie that makes you question your admiration passed by a particular director before you stop and remember that there are very few people whose body of work does not contain some clunkers. <br /> <br /> Launching the films of Lelouch is of utmost importance because it puts the viewer in such intimacy with the characters. The actors have to bring real screen magic to live up to the intensity. Otherwise, it's just hollow. <br /> <br /> None of the actors in this movie had such a magic, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons and Patricia Kaas fell far short of expectations. Irons is a talented actor, but he was wrong in that part. Adorable rogue did not suit his strengths. His trademark charm also hit a fake note for me here. Iron's personality is too decadent to fit into a love story of Lelouch. <br /> <br /> Although I hesitated to miss any opportunity to hear an English accent, I also think an American actor would have worked better on this story. Function. So many of the songs that Kaas sings are so intimately identified with the particularity of the lyricist in particular that seemed a bit discordant, so to make Jeremy Irons represent the love interest - even if of course it did not really matter. It still spoiled the flow of the movie somehow. At least for me. <br /> <br /> Of course, it would have to have been the right American. I think George Clooney would have been great on paper. And he would have brought the magic of the canvas into swords. Brad Pitt could also have done a great job delivering his special combination of charming and daring. <br /> <br /> I was also very disappointed with Patricia Kaas. When I read about her, I learned that she has a hugely successful career as a singer and many fans, so what I know, but I found her presence on screen as a very annoying singer. She was actually a much better actress in her speaking scenes than she was a singer in the scenes where she had to play and sell a song. Nothing she sang moved me. She was pleasant but bland. <br /> <br /> In contrast, someone like Kate Hudson, who is not a professional singer and only has the French voice trainer, would still have handled this part a million times better. Not to mention all that impressive French talent that could have been tapped. It was painful to see Patricia Kaas occupy screen space when there are so many charismatic French actresses who could have been chosen. <br /> <br /> Music was so important in this movie that it could not work without music running. And as Kaas did so little about it, the film never had a chance. <br /> <br /> Lelouch sealed the fate of this movie when he climbed Patricia Kaas. JMO
