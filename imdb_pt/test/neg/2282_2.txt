I was extremely disappointed with this one. Having just read the wonderful story of Oscar Wilde, I expected at least some of the magic to translate on the screen. Well, there were none. This version played like a condensed and dumbed-down Reader's Digest movie. Not only did he feel rushed, he was banalized and needlessly re-written. Main characters and plot points have been changed or completely removed. I appreciate the difficulties in trying to bring a novel to the screen, especially in what may well have been a limited budget (TV), but there is no excuse to turn a great story this way. I highly recommend reading Wilde's story about the depravity that exists even in the most beautiful exteriors. But I can not advise anyone to rent this farce.
