This is by far the worst thing I've ever seen in the movies. My uncle's home movies have more talent in them than this crap. <br /> <br /> The plot summary is basically that these twin boxers are playing a survival game with a man and his private army on some island. The man has a very cheap paper mach√© looking for hand. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious in this movie. There are scene changes in the fall of the hat. For example, for at least 30 seconds, we see a guy humming a song to himself, which adds NOTHING to the movie. This has the worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life, I do not think this movie could get any worse than it already is. I would describe it as a desire to be chuck Norris action movie went wrong. And I hate chuck Norris.
