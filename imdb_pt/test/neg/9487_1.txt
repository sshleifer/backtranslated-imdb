I saw this movie and I did not care about this movie anyway. I would not think of going to Paris because I do not like this country and its national capital. I do not like learning French anyway because I do not understand their language. Why would I go to France when I prefer to go to Germany or the UK? Germany and the United Kingdom are the nations I tolerate. Apparently, the Olsen twins do not understand the French language like me. So I will not bother the trip from France, no matter what. I could very well stick to the UK and meet single women and play video games if there is a video arcade. That is all.
