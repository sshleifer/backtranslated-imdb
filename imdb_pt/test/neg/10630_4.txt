I am a big fan of Amy Adams and I have been for many years. I'm also a big fan of musicals. With that said, this is not a good movie on any level. It is very annoying and the overall performance is very poor. Amy Adams is clumsy watching the show with Scott G. Anderson due to the fact that she is in another league when it comes to acting. All performances come out as very amateur. The musical performances are enjoyable, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Scott G. Anderson is just a bad actor! I assumed he was put in this movie because he has a great voice, but that's not the case. He has a medium voice and sings on the key, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> I think I can see why Amy Adams made this movie with the singing element that I just wish she had not. I could complain about other poor elements of this movie, but I'll leave it at that.
