1st seen 4/30/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Waters): Corny Waters musical comedy with some funny scenes and good parts but did not make a whole experience worthwhile. John Waters directed this full parody of the music of the fifties scene with Johnny Depp in the lead role. This movie is very similar to what he did with the spoof of the 60s entitled "Hairspray", but this one is not as effective. Some of the songs are catchy, some of the characters are interesting in their peculiar way of Waters, and the portraits are good, though sometimes exaggerated. The plot is similar to the movie "Grease", where there is a good group and a bad group. The guy from the bad group, Cry Baby, wow is a girl from the good group. The good girl then joins the bad group, but once Cry Baby hurts her, she returns to the good group. This just sets the end, where Cry Baby tries to win her back. Now, a difference that is expected in Water's films is that the bad group does not look so bad all the time and the good group acts as if it has a pole above your-you-know-what. I definitely saw this in Hairspray as well. The crazy and the goofiness are not much fun in this movie, and this leaves us with the feeling that the film could have been much better. The main appeal of the Johnny Depp character is that he is able to make a tear roll down his cheek (so his namesake) at various times and causes women to fall all over the place for him. This is overused and the baseline is that the movie is OK but not so good.
