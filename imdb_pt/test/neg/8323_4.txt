An appalling offense to Welles's memory and genius, this self-indulgent meaningless set of improvisation on a grand subject should have been kept in store along with several other unfinished Welles projects that no one has ever seen. Now we know why! To add yet more insult to the previous injury, the appalling English language dubbed by amateur American dubbing actors and even by the great man himself only increases all sloppy errors in storytelling and construction. It's as if every weekend some good-hearted Spanish spirit gave Orson some pesos, a 35mm camera and some negative films remaining from some other production and told Welles to go out into the Spanish countryside and continue photographing everything and everything. until the stock of the film is gone. It is true that if Orson had actually cast this film instead of the famous Jesus Franco, he could have thrown out 85% of what he shot, but we will never know. Since Welles never had time to edit his own work here, and somewhere along the way he or his heirs sanctioned someone else to do it, he is not entirely innocent of the disaster. Those who wish to prove that in their early days Welles was the luckiest man of the young, because he surrounded himself with John Houseman, Herman Mankewiecz, Greg Toland, Bernard Hermann, and Robert Wise need no better proof of their adult inadequacies than this mess. of a movie. In his sad old age, Welles could do anything when he needed a few dollars or pesos, even selling his artistic soul. The devil certainly got what he deserved with this one!
