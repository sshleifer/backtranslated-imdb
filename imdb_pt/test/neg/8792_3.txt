It is painfully clear that all the effort in this film was directed to cinematography and very little attention to everything else. The most obvious mistake is the miscast of the entire female cast. Many of them are very experienced and capable, but they all seemed out of place, and having an amateur director certainly did not help. The story is a very common geisha story, and the characters behaved very inconsistently, making it extremely difficult for me to connect with the heroine. <br /> <br /> The theme of this movie is "modern prostitution," but it was nevertheless annoying as Tsuchiya's main character Anna continued to speak as a member of a biker gang while everyone spoke in old Japanese to this scenario. This film has very beautiful vibrant colors, similar to Zhang Yimou's "Hero", but viewers can easily say that it is filmed in a cheap and elaborate set. <br /> <br /> The two sequences with Shiina Ringo's songs were great. , in the middle of the movie. I really did not like their music before, but they fit perfectly into this movie. Although Ninagawa Mika is a complete failure as a film director, she has great potential in the production of PVs (video clips). <br /> <br /> I believe the story was made very clear because the director could not focus on the development of the character, and Tsuchiya Anna is not convincing as an Oiran. If this film had been directed by a well-known director of Jidaigeki with any other known actress in Japan, it would have the potential to become a masterpiece.
