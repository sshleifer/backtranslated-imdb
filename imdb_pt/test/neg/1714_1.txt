This movie (even calling it film is an exaggeration) is ridiculously awful. Usually a big fan of Eric Roberts on "B" movies, this tragedy of a movie makes me question his true influence on the B list! And Charlie, please come back to the hope of a rebirth of the murder of diagnostics instead of this ... you can not blame the sweet of the nameless eyes (uhum ... members of the beauty pageant) for participating in this weak film , but you're a former TV star! Gather. Do not even get me started on Stuart Pankin. For the good of all that is good, Stuart, you should have seen that this was not necessarily a real movie! Bryan Michael Stoller exemplifies absolute genius only in the fact that he was able to deceive anyone to invest in this image (money or time). <br /> <br /> Really, this was not parody or spoof movie, although it tries in a 2nd degree. Mainly, it is poor writing and acting and camera work and editing and .... well poor everything. I watched because I read an article in a magazine about the involvement of agent MJ and my interest was hit due to the process in which he was involved. Now I wonder if the only reason they show it from the shoulders in the movie is because he, like at trial, appeared in pajamas and barely lucid (wait a second, he was actually really considered lucid? ... I digress). And agent MJ? Is it the best they could come up with for a name for your character? Sheez What an amazing piece of originality! Or maybe that was funny? Putting the Marriott in the movie was a nice touch at first but exaggerated and annoying after all said and done. <br /> <br /> Spare yourself from the sadness of watching ...... do not say that I did not. warn you.
