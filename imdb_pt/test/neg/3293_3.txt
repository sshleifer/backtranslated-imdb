This show drives me crazy. This goes against everything a family should be, even if it's a comedy. The show is to follow Dave and Vicky Gold (Michael Rapaport and Anita Barone) while raising their three teenage children: Hilary, Larry and Mike. A good premise for a comedy yes, but that does not mean it will be a good show. <br /> <br /> I think I've never heard of parents to kids and vice versa. The only conversation that seems to be in the program is the control of children by their parents and by sex. I know that intercourse is usually a subject spoken by teenagers many times, but it is raised in almost every meaningless episode for this. The only episode I was watching involved the parents giving their daughter Hilary a car, not once do you think they are related in any way by the way they talk to each other and how the parents talk about how Hilary is like "yours slave". "<br /> <br /> The show fails more at the level of comedy.I did not laugh at this show once in the countless times I tried to watch it, and I am a person who has given films like Animal House and Dumb and Dumber Michael Rapaport is a great actor and why he chose to ruin his career by making that piece of dirt appear beyond me. <br /> <br /> Parents, make sure your kids never and I want to Teenagers, you're probably going to laugh about it just for the cheeky sex references, but nothing comes out of it and then you feel a little empty. 1 1/2/5 stars.
