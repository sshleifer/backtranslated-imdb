You've seen the same tired, clunky cliche of comedy stories, characters, stories thousands of times before - only this stands out in sucking more than others. First and foremost, there is not a single character in this program that is even remotely enjoyable ... especially that of Michael Rapaport. Dave Gold is by far one of the biggest assholes that ever graced a television screen ... disgusting comes to mind. If in real life a father was so unpleasant, cruel, and often unsuitable to be a father ... fratricide would be his only option. To call the other character stereotypes would be very complementary. If these characters ended up in life support, the line to pull the plug would take years light. As this show ended a full season, much less 2 is a mystery. FOX cancels "Arrested Development" and keeps it in the air ??? You tell me the terrorists are not winning.
