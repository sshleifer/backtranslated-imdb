Lots of flames, thousands of extras in battle scenes, lots of beautiful scenery. I do not think the plot endured such a vast expense. History could have been told much more effectively and been more valid psychologically if there were not so much machismo in production. Chinese movies tend to be so in my experience. and I think that slows down the movie.
