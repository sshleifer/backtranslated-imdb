What a giant pile of smelly milking! Gods where even start with this? <br /> <br /> Well, mix up acting crap (including an annoying bloodthirsty woman who talks like she is) chewing painfully on some ice cubes or b) I just woke up after having undergone extensive root canal surgery ), an edition that seems to donate that the celluloid was cut and spliced ​​through the use of a grinder, a truly choreographed martial arts action, a script that was apparently written for a two-year and some of the most heinous and intrusively loud background music already committed to any movie and hey presto you have aka Death Machines The Ninja Assassinations (although note that surprise, surprise? Actually there is no real ninja anywhere to be found in this farce!) <br /> <br /> In It sums up, if ever there was a cinematic equivalent of a particularly vehement dysentery, then surely it must be! Avoid at all costs!
