A classic rubbish! Basically, what we have here is a story about a couple of American teenagers (a man, a woman both beautiful, of course) who seem to be psychically attached, because each time they both fall asleep, they can inhabit each other's dreams. express the innermost desires ... think that Mills & Boon finds X files and you'll be somewhere near the mark. In fact, it's more like an unfortunate hybrid between one of Ed Wood's famous B movies and a particularly silly episode of Melrose Place, so kitschy are the special effects and so amateurish is the acting. The actors who inhabit (I would not say in action) this movie say their lines as if they were reading from tips cards and pouting when they should be showing an emotion, and this does not come as a big shock (or loss to the industry) that since then they have disappeared into obscurity. The whole thing is just a ridiculously misleading mix of styles that do not match, and the end result is an intriguing curiosity that will undoubtedly be absorbed by film suppliers who are so good in years. come over. I'll probably be the only person who has ever commented on this movie, but if you're reading and see, please come back, it's kind of lonely around here ...
