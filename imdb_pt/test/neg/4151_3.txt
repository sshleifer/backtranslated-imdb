My wife and I never went into the movie. We thought it was the way to sloooowwww and for many legends. I understood that they needed them for Vietnam, but it took them a long time to get out of Asia. She wanted me to give up. better. He never did yes, they had a hard time trying to get to America, but I wanted to see him looking and meeting his father. Not in the end but forming a relationship. I mentioned it was love slllloooowww.I to watch a film to feel good not sad at the end.I know they do not do many good movies now days.I think action movies are the only ones to see.I have rented a lot of netflix and now blockbuster, maybe 20% are worth the worth seeing. I do not know realism or facts just a movie that is fun and makes you feel good. Gary
