Eddy Murphy and Robert De Niro must be a combination that results in a great comedy. Great expectation often leads to disappointment, and this proves to be the case. <br /> <br /> When Eddy, as a police officer, spoils a drug trade being made by Detective Robert, they spoil everything so badly that they end up doing a live action reality TV show. Logic is not a great component of this movie. The super gun they spend the second half of the chasing movie confirms this. A twelve gauge machine gun that leaves large holes in metal plates and three will destroy a house in about a minute (without reloading) is more fantasy than science fiction. A five-pound gun, firing hundreds of shots a minute without any retreat, is certainly the weapon of the future using the technology of the past. <br /> <br /> Of course this movie was designed for adults and children, so if you are somewhere in the middle, this is the movie for you.
