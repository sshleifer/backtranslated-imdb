I have not reviewed the IMDb before, but this documentary is so overrated that I felt compelled to vent. I would not even have finished watching if I was not a guest in someone's house. The film was poor on many levels: First - the Treadwell video was invented. The more I watched, the more he seemed to be acting like a desperate person to be famous rather than acting out of conviction. <br /> <br /> Second - The others in the movie, with the exception of Treadwell's parents and the airline pilot was as artificial and tacky as him. God, they looked artificial. Third - Treadwell's mission to protect the bears does not even make sense, as he did more harm than good by making bears accustomed to human presence. I believe that Treadwell really loved the bears, but there is a lot of research indicating that his efforts were wrong. Sometimes we have to sacrifice our pleasure for wildlife to really help. <br /> <br /> Room - The entertainment value of the movie was not half of other wildlife movies such as "Penguin March" and "Winged Migration." The filmmakers, in my opinion, did a poor job of sequencing scenes and gave little incentive to continue watching. As a person who loves Alaska, bears and other wildlife, I would love to see more people dedicated to the preservation of our wild lands. I hope your efforts are less people-centered.
