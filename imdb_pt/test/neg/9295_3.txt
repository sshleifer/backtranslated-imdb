**** Contains Spoilers **** As a Rachael Leigh Cook fan, I watched this show finally show up so I could see it. I recorded so I could watch it several times, and there is something about this show that really bothers me! <br /> <br /> I recognize that this was a movie made for TV. Not only that, but it was made for Lifetime, which is a channel that I despise. Because it was made for TV, I can ignore the huge holes in the plot. I can ignore the sheer lack of character development in Ally Sheedy's character. I can ignore the fact that George C. Scott and Rachael Leigh Cook, both very talented actors, were definitely not reaching the best of their abilities. I can look beyond the fact that the character of Don Diamont was so cliche, that you knew that when you saw him, he was the villain. I can even ignore the obvious error in the timeline (she is raped during the winter break, and more than a year later she has her baby). <br /> <br /> The most important thing I can not do is this: There are two trials for the custody of the child. In the first trial, custody is awarded to the child's parent because he is "best educated, educated in a community college, and has a full-time job." In the second trial, the judgment is reversed because the judge feels there is a lack of evidence that Emma (RLC character) is an incapable mother, and custody should not be taken from the primary caregiver and given to someone with no prior interaction with the parent. judge. kid. The problem is this: nowhere in the course of these trials is the fact that a thirty-year-old man raped a 15-year-old girl and made her pregnant! Whether it was a rape or not, he had sex with a minor! Would not that be taken into account when the judge was choosing him for custody because he is a "mature adult"? Mature adults do not have sex with minors! <br /> <br /> It's not the worst cable movie you'd see, but it's not a great show either. ** outside of ****
