"The Yellow Tomahawk" (1954) by director Lesley Selander places Cheyenne against US Cavalry with hard Rory Calhoun in the middle, as the suede Indian batsman who has to take the survivors to a safe place. This United Artists western was photographed in color, but the TV screen that Turner Classic Movies exhibited was inexplicably black and white. <br /> <br /> The action begins with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of "Black Spurs") deluding several Indians and riding to talk to his old friend and boss Cheyenne, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of "The Good, O Bad and Ugly "), which is killing in his mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that his Cheyenne are ready to destroy a nearby cavalry fort because it violates a treaty the Indians made with the government. On his way to inform Major Ives (Warner Anderson of "Objective, Burma!"), On the impending Indian attack, Adam discovers a beautiful wooden nymph who, seductively, treads water on a lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle from "I, Jury") is another of those silly women in westerns who bathe naked in the middle of the Indian country without a care in the world. Castle seems to be genuinely naked in her bath scenes, perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this predictable western. Of course, Major Ives dismisses Adam's warning of Fire Knife until the commander notices that someone has invaded his ammunition depot far from the fort. This is one of many questions that the screenplay by Richard Alan Simmons leaves unanswered in this 82-minute dining room. Why would the cavalry bury its ammunition in a secret place in the desert, instead of keeping it in the fort's quarters? As soon as they have made this discovery, the Indians attack, overthrow the hero and leave him as the sole survivor. Before this attack, a pair of white gold miners enters the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of "Stalag 17") brings his partner with an arrow in his chest. While Adam is getting hot water to help remove the arrow, Sawyer, the greedy, shreds the pit deeper and kills his helpless partner. Later, we learned that Sawyer and his partner had hit the gold. The issue of the dispersal of gold also goes unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have a final pow-wow and Fire Knife requires that Adam deliver Major Ives or they will all die. Naturally, Adam refuses and the Indians begin to cut the whites. James Best in a supporting role as a knight gets an arrow in the back for his efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a Mexican beater chased by a sexy Indian maid aptly named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno's "West Side Story") and Robert Bray's "Lassie" fame is briefly handy as the official evil of cavalry Kate planned to marry. The biggest surprise in this common western scene in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who killed Indians, women and children in the infamous Sand Creek Massacre, has kept a secret that he is a Native American too! Ironically, the tense arc that Fire Knife takes for friendship to Adam at the outbreak of hostilities is what our heroic explorer uses to kill the stout Cheyenne warrior after he ran out of bullets. "The Yellow Tomahawk" concludes in an ambiguous note. The survivors arrive at another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives give their respective reports on the subject to an army general, but we never learned the outcome of that meeting. Is this artistic ambiguity or yet another unanswered question? Producer Howard W. Koch is unrelated to "Koch's" Casablanca-based chopper. Ultimately, "The Yellow Tomahawk" is one of the many pro-indigenous westerns that appeared after "Broken Arrow" (1950), where the Native American is seen as a noble savage unjustly treated by some, but not by all whites. Selander, who made dozens of westerns during the '50s and' 60s, makes this smaller western bear tolerable, despite its thin characters and family problems. Calhoun stands out from an above-average cast as the man always on duty, and it's worth looking for Castle good-looking for his feminine charms. Peter Graves plays a possum as usual in most of his early roles. In fact, Lesley Selander did a more satisfying dramatic version of this film the year before called "War Paint" (1953) with Robert Stack. In fact, Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno became regular on "The Rockford Files".
