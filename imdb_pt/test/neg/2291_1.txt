In fact, I feel that having my review is a word. My friend, whose opinions I almost always trust in movies, especially horror movies, warned me not to rent this, no matter how tempted, bored or desperate to see a new horror film, because it was a complete waste of time. Unfortunately I have not talked to him in a while, and I was in a hurry to pick a movie, and I thought, 'what the hell, how bad could it be?' Why do not I learn? What was I thinking? Did I think it would magically be a better movie while sitting on the bookshelf for years waiting to be rented? <br /> <br /> The 'plot' concerns a guy who edits movies for some company. Your boss is an idiot. The guy who had the job before him went crazy and blew himself up following pre-credits, so for some reason the boss chooses nerd 'Ed' for the special design of splatter movie editing "Loose Limbs." He never says what Ed should edit, but I guess that does not matter. Ed gets annoyed with some of the clips, working on them alone in this house that the boss decided to transfer it for no apparent reason. He asks his boss if he can stop or make another project, but his boss does not care. He begins to go crazy slowly, supposedly watching the clips, and wants to carry out the bloody murders in real life. Or has he been like this all the time? Please note that I am making this plot look much deeper, interesting and coherent than it actually is. <br /> <br /> We do not care about the characters, or we have any sympathy for them, or even hate the bad guys. The plot is actually very annoying and predictable. The splatter is not even so horrible or creative - this is NOT worth renting just to see the blood because what there is is not interesting or original. <br /> <br /> All 'tributes' to Sam Raimi just come out as really bad ripoffs, and no one in the movie is as handsome as Bruce Campbell, so you can not be distracted by it. I think a "Dead Dead II-Dead by Dawn" poster is only prominently displayed in a scene in the hope that Sam Raimi will be flattered and will not consider any kind of legal action. A trained chimpanzee could have written a better script. Every time I hear phrases such as "Are we having fun ... yet?" (which even Bride of Re-Animator could not do without making me shudder) I began to feel like taking some kind of deadly weapon. Characters appear out of nowhere without explanation, wandering only to be killed. This could be nice if the movie was both fun and entertaining, but that was all I could do to avoid going through most of them. Fortunately, I chose to pay some bills and balance my checkbook at the same time the movie was being played. Trust me, this did not require my full attention, I still felt like more than 90 minutes of my life were wasted just by having it in the background. <br /> <br /> I do not watch, no matter how tempted you are, you will hate yourself for wasting your money. Fans of horror will be completely disgusted at how incompetent he is. Even those who have not seen many splatter movies should stay away as there are so many movies out there that you could rent that are worth much more. If you want something brainless, low-budget and fun, rent something else. Complete loss of time without redeeming qualities. Be smarter than I was at the time and do not be fooled by the "Attention - Not for the faint of heart" in the box. You've been warned! <br /> <br />
