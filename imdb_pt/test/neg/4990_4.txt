They did it again: they took the title from an old show, then destroyed nostalgia for boring "re-imagined" things. The 1960s cartoon was one of the funniest of its time, a humorous satire of superhero comics. The character was designed as half way between animal and human, in the same way that Mickey Mouse is. Here they wear a real beagle; is the same as making a Mickey Mouse clock with a real mouse. <br /> <br /> Most of the clever ones who did the original funny show are missing in this movie. Instead, we have a clumsy former police dog who is even dumber than Cad. And some pet owners who add nothing to the story. Cheese effects (the talking animation is embarrassing). Unsatisfactory script A stereotyped dwarf playing Simon Bar Sinister. The guy in the bass box they hired to give Underdog a voice is painful. You would think they would have at least an Impressionist voice to bring the humorously distinct voice of Wally Cox to Underdog. But not. There are at least some affectionate references to the source material (such as rhyme lines), which raise it to 4. Only small children who love dogs may like this. Everyone should get a DVD of the original cartoon series. Notice this only in desperation.
