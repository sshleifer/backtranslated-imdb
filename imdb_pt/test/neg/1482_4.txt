I was Stan in the movie "Dreams Come True". Stan was the friend who worked in the factory with the main character and ended up having his arm crushed in the machinery and was shouted (where was the ambulance?). The acting in this film was largely quite poor, with most of the local actors. from Fox Valley, Wisconsin. I saw the movie on the big screen. He played 2 nights in 3 theaters and it was something special to see on the big screen. I may be partial, but overall, I enjoyed it. Also the soundtrack was the Spooner band, which later became Garbage. My brother, Steve Charlton was also in the movie. He played with Swenson the man who comes to the door of crutches to talk to the police.
