The only reason I did not give this movie a horrible rating is because I feel it was such a horrible movie in every respect that it deserves at least a 2/10; for not trying. The plot is the least of your worries when you're slapped in the face with top language and scenes like 'the pit of the song' in a frustrated attempt to shock and disgust. Seen as the main objective of this film is to shock and his main body have not achieved this, the final scene disgustingly manages to erase the memory of this shockingly useless film and fulfill its goal of being the dirtiest film ever. A very low budget film, terribly represented and the dialogue is shockingly bad. <br /> I give 0/10 for real !!!
