I do not really know why, but I watched this with a sense of anticipation. Unfortunately it was misplaced. In the first place, this is not horror, it does not scare and (unless it was worse than I gave credit - which is possible) does not try. It's a useless comedy and the fact that I smiled meant I gave it 2 and not 1. This movie shows the Gremlins in a really special way, I can not say that I've ever seen a movie that devotes itself more to it. Very, very bad - avoid.
