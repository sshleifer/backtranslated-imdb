This seems to be one of Noel Coward's lesser-known films, and it's easy to understand why. Taken seriously, it's not a bad movie, but there's nothing good about it either. Nothing much happens throughout the film, it's simply the story of the ill-fated affair of Chris and Leonora, and Barbara's reaction to it. The only thing that keeps the movie interesting is the fact that we already know that it will end badly for one reason or another due to the first scene. Strangely, there are many perfect opportunities in the history of the conflict, yet none of them are used. For example, it would have been much more interesting and believable if Barbara had disagreed with Leonora, but instead the two remained on good terms during the film. Barbara's notion of being betrayed by her friend was not exploited-in fact, she did not even seem to feel betrayed by her husband; she even encourages him to go on holiday with Leonora. Similarly, Chris's two secretaries at his clinic, Susan Birch and Tim Verney, who are also close friends of Chris and Barbara, are never forced to take sides. In fact, Tim flees from the conflict telling Chris that he likes him and Barbara very much. Despite the strange lack of conflict, the biggest flaw in the movie is the fact that we do not care if Chris ends up with Leonora or Barbara. The personalities of the two women are indistinguishable anyway, so we do not know which one is best suited to be with Chris, and in addition, Barbara's permissiveness gives the impression that she barely cares for the case. Also, I found Chris and Leonora's relationship somewhat unconvincing. I can ignore the ridiculously short period of time when they fall in love with each other, because that's so common in the movies of that era, but even then the relationship seemed superficial. Coward's character was too austere and cynical to be the object of Leonora's affections. It reminds me of the socially inept genius Sir Earnest Pease from the movie "Very Important Person" - I'm sure the two would have done well. Chris's coldness and austerity made his love for Leonora seem insincere. I think Coward should have done it and given his share to a younger man - how come I was constantly wondering what this young beauty saw in a middle-aged man, half gloomy, almost without emotion and bald. Despite all my criticisms, the film still manages to be interesting - it just is not very convincing. The fact that neither character is particularly well developed gives them an enigmatic nature, which is somewhat intriguing. The Astonished Heart is certainly worth seeing, but it's a flawed movie piece.
