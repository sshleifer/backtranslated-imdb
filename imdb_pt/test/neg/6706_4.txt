BLOOD RUNNERS <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.66: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and White) <br /> /> London, 1840: While trying to formulate an anesthetic solution, a dedicated surgeon (Boris Karloff) becomes addicted to narcotics and is blackmailed by local bodysnatchers. The recent success of Hammer's Wrest of Franklin (1957), THE BLOOD RUNNER of Robert Day is a strange blend of historical drama and theater from Grand Guignol. Producer Richard Gordon has attracted Karloff from Hollywood - where his film career has stagnated in a movie routine B (VOODOO ISLAND, FRANKENSTEIN, 1970, etc.) - by a pair of shocking shocks in which good men are frustrated by circumstances beyond their control. . In GRIP OF THE STRANGLER (1958), he played a novelist who faces a horrific secret while investigating a series of murders in recent history, while in CORRIDORS OF BLOOD, he is a drug-addicted surgeon who is the victim of a gang of criminals planned by the pub owner East End Francis de Wolff. Less a horror film than a melodrama with macabre embellishments, the film protects its commercial bets by including a series of bloody emotions (an open leg, a face destroyed by acid, etc.), but the narrative is motivated mainly by the altruistic quest by Karloff. of an anesthetic formula that will alleviate the terrible suffering of patients during surgery. <br /> <br /> Produced under the title 'The Doctor from Seven Dials', the finished film was unpublished until 1962 due to the indifference of the MGM distributors, at that time, Christopher Lee won a prominent credit on the screen, despite interpreting a small but significant role as Resurrection Joe, a sinister cockney thug who carefully murders selected clients from de Wolff's squalid pub and sells the remains to local doctors. . Lee filmed this glorified performance before THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN catapulted him to international stardom, which explains his limited screen time, though his intense performance is one of the highlights of the film. Adrienne Corri (VAMPIRE CIRCUS) stands out as Wolff's partner in crime, and there's a feast of familiar faces in supporting roles, including Francis Matthews (DRACULA: PRINCE DARKNESS), Betta St. John (THE CITY OF THE DEAD), Finlay Currie and Nigel Green. Superb art direction (by Anthony Masters) and cinematography (Geoffrey Faithful).
