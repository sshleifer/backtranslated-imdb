This extremely low budget monster movie revolves around a group of surveyors exploring an abandoned gold mine to see if it's worth reopening. They are trapped behind a cave and discover that they are at the mercy of a strange, viscous creature that seems intent on knocking them down one by one. The word that came to my mind when I watched this movie was "desperate." The script and acting are terrible, the effects of stop motion monsters were unintentionally funny, and since most of the film happens underground, the sets sound convincingly a logistical nightmare. All that was said however for some reason I felt that this film did not fail for lack of effort but perhaps from a lack of budget, experience and / or lack of creative inspiration. The whole thing came out as if it was a college project or a first amateur movie, I have a certain amount of affection for movies like that, even when they completely miss the mark. I guess what I'm saying is that I give a B for effort and a D for real results, not insultingly bad as some monstrous low budget movies I've seen but still not worth seeing unless you have a lot free time in your hands. I'm voting for 4.
