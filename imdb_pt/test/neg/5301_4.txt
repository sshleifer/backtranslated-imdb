I really liked Get Shorty, but this movie was completely disappointing as a sequel. First of all, Travolta does not look like Get Shorty's Chili Palmer. He merely measured this performance as he did in all his latest movies. He totally is not good or has the mobster's presence on him, which makes you cheer for him throughout the movie. It seems Travolta got out of bed and decided he was good at acting in that movie. The plot was not exciting or clever, there really are no highlights that happen, the only thing reminiscent of entertainment was watching Christina Millian perform and The Rock was funny. But anyway, in short, this movie was rubbish and I had to force myself just to get through it.
