A desperate attempt to make a sci-fi thriller "film-noir", but the film is insufficient. No plausible plot, some of the main actors were a joke (NOT Lars Good, he's cool!). I liked the "Bandwidth Maximization Access Restriction". I finished at first, but I went home feeling like I had lost two hours of my life ...
