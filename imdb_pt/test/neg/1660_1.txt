You've thought, like after watching a horror movie with a group of friends, "Wow, that's so cool! We have to make a horror movie ourselves sometime soon. I bet it's not as difficult as it sounds" ? Well, that must have been what went through the minds of the young brothers Campbell in 2003, presumably soon after watching "The Evil Dead" by Sam Raimi or a similar independent horror classic. This "Demon Summer", however, is so bad that it's embarrassing! These young amateur filmmakers obviously love the horror genre and know their classics, but that hardly makes them talented. I have seen many bad movies in my years as a terror fanatic, but this honestly ranks as one of the biggest crap ever made. And it is very sad to be with that open heart, because all the cast and team clearly had good intentions. There is virtually no script. A pair of thugs simply steals a mysterious book from a homeless man and, while reading some excerpts from it, one of them turns into a heinous demon that begins to kill members of all different groups of teenagers: idiots, hot Catholic girls, drug addicts and troublemakers . It's about it, except, of course, for all the compulsory cliches, like the hot girl falling for the biggest jerk, etc ... The performances are really painful to hear and none of those annoying teenagers use mimicry! They stand there until the script says it's their turn to interact. I hate that! Some of the make-up effects are remotely decent, but not yet spectacular, and the soundtrack contains some of the most terrible punk songs of all time. This movie should never have been released ... I can well imagine that it must have been fun to be part of the production, but it is totally stupid and does not have the slightest element of ransom. Not a bit of amateur nudity, damn it!
