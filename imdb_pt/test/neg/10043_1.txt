Although the premise of the film seemed unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the movie, I could have stopped there and continued on with my life. She gets some interesting comments and reactions from her subjects, but not enough to add to the film's validity. <br /> <br /> I also felt that she went a little too much with many things. If a guy said a filthy remark, grabbed her or made some disgusting gesture for her, I'd say go ahead, bring him down, he's a pig. But what bothered me was that she walked around revealing clothes and was surprised when the guys looked at her and gave a damn about it. <br /> <br /> I think somehow she forgot that being attracted to other people is a part of human sexuality and a big part of who we all are. The boys look at beautiful women, especially when they dress provocatively, just as women look at men when they are wearing a tight tank or shirtless. <br /> <br /> Some women may hate me for it, but I hope not. I have a lot of respect for women. I was created by one. I also come from a Spanish family and we are very matriarchal. My grandmother has been the center of my family for years, but I really do not feel like it did anything to help women's rights and what the filmmaker himself said, some women were offended by his project.
