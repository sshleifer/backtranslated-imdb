The first thing you should realize is that this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Love Affair at the end of the decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne or the two remakes that followed. It's not nearly as good as these movies. In fact, Bogey is the second judge to Dorothy Mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out she's living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial adviser. Hale Hamilton. It's a shock to Mackaill. She considers a career in show business as a form of income. <br /> Bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and is designing a state-of-the-art airplane engine and is looking for investors. Mackaill is willing to do it, as well as enjoying what he sees in Bogey. Considering the cynical roles that Bogart later made a specialty, it's a bit disconcerting to see him as such a highly moral and selfish character. in case of love. The party does not dress well with him. <br /> <br /> The love affair is the second feature of your B program, nothing too special about it.
