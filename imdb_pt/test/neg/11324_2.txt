Wow, I swear this never happened to me before ?? I just watched "Golden Temple Amazons" yesterday and I no longer have the slightest memory of anything that has happened in this movie. This is how this movie is brilliant, I think! So far I only remember being drawn to watch it because of the incredibly attractive DVD cover, showing a torrid drawing of a voluptuous Amazon preparing his bow to shoot at an unspecified target. I'm often fooled by attractive DVD covers? especially Jess Franco's? and yet I have not learned to resist even after literally hundreds of terrible experiences. Oh well?? After reading the other user reviews, parts of my memory have returned, though I still suspect of confusing this movie with another Jess Franco masterpiece I watched the day before, namely "Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro" (and , yes, that one had an incredible DVD cover as well. <br /> <br /> "Amazon Golden Temple" opens with a possession of warm white African Amazons. <br /> <br /> I am aware of the contradiction but do not blame me <br /> Killing the parents of a frail young woman because they were invading the territory with the intention of stealing the gold treasures of the temple.Many years and hormonal changes later, the girl returns to the jungle to get revenge.It is accompanied by a band of despicable adventurers who are less interested in the act of revenge, but do not mind bringing some gold home. "The rudimentary premise is obviously secondary to the whole display of sweeping female nudity and gratuitous offense. The other unnamed Amazons are all Franco's regular choices and willingly walk with their breasts proudly displayed. You'd better admire all those perfect feminine curves, since the rest of the "Golden Temple of the Amazon" is a boring and incompetent mess. There is almost no violence or action and no less than half of the film is pure thing, pieces of National Geographic documentaries edited in history and that sort of thing. The incredible DVD cover would definitely be a great addition to your collection, but opening the box is totally useless.
