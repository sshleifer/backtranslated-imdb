The protagonist of this sex-filled chat, Mel (Ethan Hunt), notes on several occasions: "She deserves more than that!" The "she" he refers to is Ginger, played by the beautiful Brandy Davis, who in fact deserves more than that. Cognac deserves better than this movie, its script lame and Mel perverted. A guy who goes out to watch his dream girl having sex with another man, even in the virtual world, seriously does not deserve her at all. An A- for the simulated sex scenes, an F for the screenplay.
