Too bad Mike Meyers chose this for his dramatic debut. This movie seems to have been assembled by a committee that could not decide whether it was a comedy, drama, suspense or science fiction. It starts out a little playful, then gets darker, and in the end, apparently shortly after one of the main characters has been killed, the whole family is in the yard laughing at something. It is totally strange and impossible to tie together. The acting is extremely uneven, with older professionals dedicating their attention and then younger and less experienced actors seem to be in a high school play. This film has shown me that it is probably harder to make a good movie than is evident from the truly professional experience we see in the early art houses. This would be a good movie for a film class to analyze. Plot, character, theme, consistency - they are all defective or missing in this movie.
