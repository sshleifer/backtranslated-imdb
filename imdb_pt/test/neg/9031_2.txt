"Escape from Hell" is not made with enough art to disguise what it is: exploitation crassa. Direction and writing are sloppy: for example, the camera work during the fight between Cintia Lodetti and Ajita Wilson is so bad that you can barely understand what is happening; also, if the drunken but good-hearted doctor had not killed the principal, the guards would never have followed him and the girls after the escape - the "false plague" plan worked well until then, but he just had to ruin it. this. I would have given this movie a 4 out of 10 (the sweaty lesbian scene is not bad and Christina Lai has an incredibly beautiful face and body), but a particularly disgusting scene of abuse forced me to cut 2 more stitches. It is clear that some patients take this as a recommendation. After all, one thing even more disturbing than this movie is that some people actually gave positive reviews!
