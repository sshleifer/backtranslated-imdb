Beethovan Lives Upstairs is a very bad movie. In my World History class, our teacher made us watch this movie and Amadeus to be able to compare the two composers or something. We watched Amadeus first and it was a very good movie, but when she made us watch this movie directly after that, I could not believe what I was seeing. The acting was horrible, the costumes were ugly (those of the boy were especially ugly and feminine), and the cinematography was type z. My friend compared it to a home movie without the date display in the lower right corner. I understand that this was a Canadian TV movie and it probably cost $ 10 to do, but, please, they could have done better. I saw some good TV movies in my time, but this was not one of them. The most important thing I do not understand is why my World History class could not just watch Immortal Beloved or something. How is it possible to compare composers when the film Amadeus, for Mozart, and Beethovan Lives Upstairs, is given to Beethovan? It is not possible to do this when this is the film's choice for Beethovan. I give Amadeus an A- (9 out of 10) if anyone wants to know, but Beethovan Lives Upstairs gets an F (1 out of 10).
