"It may contain spoilers." Unfortunately, Lou Costellos' latest film has the distinction of being a little better than Abbott & Costello's latest "Dance With Me Henry" film. This movie is not all totally terrible, it's a fun career break. Dorothy Provine is cool to see and makes the film a bit bearable. You can not blame Lou Costello for this, because a large studio released this, which meant that someone had to give birth to "green". In my opinion, Lou Costello was overcoming the problems of his own loss of his son a few years before and the unjustified attacks of the IRS. If you look at the last 3-4 Abbott & Costello movies, you may notice that the magic has disappeared. Check out "Dance With Me Henry" now that is a painful movie to watch.
