I really wanted to like this movie for all sorts of reasons - the subject is inherently interesting and is probably the main issue facing the world today and has released fascinating works (eg, Linda Grant's when I lived in modern times) usually on the Side Israeli fence. Also, a guy I like told me he thought it was the best movie he'd seen all year, so with such a recommendation ... HOWEVER, I actually found myself napping in points! I admit I was tired and the movie seats comfortable but I found a lot of hard work trying to identify with the characters. Once I heard the idea that it was a series of vignettes, I went with her, but it did disappointingly a drawing show instead of a movie. I liked the concept of a quasi-silent containment scene in contrast to those utopian moments - the sexy girl, the red balloon, and the Muslim ninja fighter. But personally I think the movie has been sensational. I'm not telling narrative and plot is everything (definitely is not), but even a little more dialogue would have helped.
