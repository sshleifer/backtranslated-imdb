Another tiring annoyance of Anthony Minghella, who seems to thrive with these big swollen superproductions that take more than two and a half hours to do what any reasonable filmmaker would do in ninety minutes. <br /> <br /> The centers of history in Inman (a sleepy Jude Law), who set out for the Civil War having just begun a kind of romance with Nicole Kidman, the Daughter of a Preacher, who recently arrived at the picturesque city. The story goes back and forth between Inman's trials and tribulations in the war (ie guess boys and girls? HELL !!) and Kidman's judgments and tribulations at home (which are, very predictably, incredibly boring). Renee Zellwegger appears on Kidman's farm to help Kidman retrieve him after Kidman's holy dad dies of uncomfortable illness of character. Zellwegger acts all clumsy and bossy in this style of Granny Clampett, dispensing enough from Tough Love and Homespun Wisdom to turn the stomach even from Touched By An Angel's hardest observer. <br /> <br /> This movie is simply excruciating. Avoid it as the big swollen absurd Oscar-bait Bogus Pretentious Literary Adaptation that is.
