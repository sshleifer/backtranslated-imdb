Experienced John Light (as John Elias) goes from Stanford to the young and successful tycoon of the Dotcom era. But Light's sneaky success may last little, with partners like the ambitious Jeffrey Donovan (as Robert Jennings). Mr. Donovan used to lie down with Light's girlfriend, Megan Dodds (as Lisa Forrester). Donovan wants Light to know that excessive drinking and casual sex do not have to end in college. After reading a sex session on the Internet, Dodds shines. He can also lose the Internet empire "Digital Dreams"! Unsuccessful veterans attempting to lend dramatic gravitas include Mia Farrow (as Anna Simmons) and Hal Holbrook (as Tom Walker). Ms. Farrow looks sweet with her lollipops. <br /> <br /> Purpose (21/02/02) Alan Lazar ~ John Light, Jeffrey Donovan, Mia Farrow
