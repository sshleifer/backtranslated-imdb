This movie is full of sentimentality, unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me shudder and irrelevant material. Why introduce Rachel, for example? She has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to allow her "Follow me" truck to run freely and crash into Dorinda's fence. This has to be one of the most stupid sequences among many in the movie. Another is at the end, when the aircraft (either a B-26 or an A-26? - both designations are used in the film) is left with spinning props and no shims in place. That serves the plot, of course, but revealing it would be to commit a feared spoiler. As it is, the aircraft would have begun to tax without control. The ending (again, avoiding spoilers) involves a lot of talk - like the early sound films of the 1930s with all those final discourses. Here Dreyfuss just babbled on and on. The end also incorporates other radical violations of the aircraft protocol and some improbabilities / impossibilities that I will not describe. What a monotonous and disjointed effort!
