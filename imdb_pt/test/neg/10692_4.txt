I was so eager to watch the documentary self-immolation of the brain behind Boondock Saints, one of the most aggravating and senseless movies I've ever seen. But the creators of "Overnight" - friends (ex?) Of the mentor in question - also need to learn how to make a movie. Several nasty remarks, screaming obscenities on the phone, and enjoying alcohol make Mr. Duffy look like a putz. But that gives no idea why the guy got a contract in the first place, what his creative process or vision - what is Boondock Saints? How difficult is it to meet Patrick Swayze? What are these strange institutional machinations on which our disgusting heroes are caught? As the film does not attempt to answer these questions in a coherent way, it does not end up having any discord about Hollywood either. So, who cares?
