A special unit of four police detectives is handing out justice uniquely in Los Angeles in the 1950s. Nick Nolte plays Max Hoover, the unit's lead officer and his partners are played by Michael Madsen, Chazz Palminteri and Chris Penn. Also starring are Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly and John Malkovich among others. An impressive list of names. Unfortunately, this is the only thing that seems remotely impressive about this movie. <br /> <br /> Our story begins when young Allison Pond, played by Connelly, appears dead in a remote area of ​​the city currently under development. Our band of four detectives is called and it is immediately obvious that Nolte's Max Hoover will have a very personal interest in this case. Soon we will find that Allison, in addition to knowing Hoover well, was also involved with some very important military and government types who may have reason to want his death. But who exactly was involved and why exactly did they want this seemingly harmless woman to be dead? Hoover and the team set out to find out. Sounds like an interesting premise, but unfortunately it does not get anywhere. <br /> <br /> Despite the impressive set of names, the performance here leaves much to be desired. Nolte is exaggerating, Madsen looks incredibly bored, Palminteri and Malkovich come out as caricatures, Penn has almost nothing to do and Griffith is annoying as can be. By far the best performance is Connelly in all very fast flashback sequences. The dialogue throughout the film is forced and wooden. The sense of drama you would expect from such a mystery is completely lacking. Nothing dramatic really happens. In fact, nothing seems to happen for most of the image. Instead, we just walked toward a somewhat ridiculous and incredibly disappointing climax. When the "mystery" is solved, you can see yourself saying, "Oh, come now, is all there is?" But it gets worse after the mystery is solved, we have a completely ridiculous and unbelievable action sequence. And yet we are made to suffer even more when another horrible scene, poorly performed and totally unnecessary is addressed at the end. And then, fortunately, it's over. And not a little too soon.
