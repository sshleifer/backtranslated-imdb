Woa, talk about horrible. Do not waste your time. I wish I had seen the other one use comments first. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, I did not watch the whole thing. It was horrible too. The worst and most scruffy dialogue ... I could go on and on. But what really made it unacceptable was the direction. The poor actors. You can not even know if they have any talent, because they not only have pathetic lines to speak, but the director did not give them any action. If you check out the director's filmography on this site, you'll see why this movie did not stand a chance. <br /> <br /> That would not even be good as a TV movie. <br /> <br /> Ouch!
