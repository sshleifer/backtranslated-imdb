Harrison Ford plays Dutch Sergeant Van Den Broeck of the District of Columbia Police Department. He tries to catch the bad guys, but does not do a very good job. When we meet him, he's trying to get an undercover and corrupt cop. Kristin Scott Thomas plays a New Hampshire senator, Kay Chandler, trying to be re-elected. She is running against a candidate who has a lot of money. The last thing she needs is the death of her husband. She is a politics, she can not be bogged down by feelings. <br /> <br /> This story moves slowly and painfully. I was looking at the clock every five minutes wondering when it would end! The story is lost in details that the director, Sydney Pollack, did not have to put. We do not want to know about Dutch police investigations. They give some tips to the politicians and the spin control they make for the campaigns. After watching the movie, I'm still wondering why they got romantically involved. No one else regrets? Do not you need more than two weeks to consider going horizontally with another person? It was good to see the actress, comedian, Chicago native, and Bonnie Hunt's former student. Her role is not necessarily a comic relief, but she was the only person I wanted to see more of. Do yourself a favor, wait for it on video if you want to see it.
