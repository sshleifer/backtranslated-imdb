This story had a good story about four elderly men who share a deadly secret about a young woman they met 50 years ago. After all this time, the young woman returns to take revenge on the men. This story occasionally made me doze off during the movie in the midst of the grueling music of the elevators and the constant thunder storms. But it's worth waiting for in the end when we discover who the mysterious woman is who continues to torment the old in her dreams and interfering in the life of a young man. What I liked the most in this film was the suspense in which the young woman appeared to the men shortly before her death. The special effects were something. Every time I heard her calling, I'd think "not that face again." But it was a good movie, I just wanted the pace was not so slow or the acting was not so tiring. And what I also liked about the film was the 1920s flashback, very authentic as were the costumes being original.
