"When a Killer Calls" is an unusually nasty slasher film with some very unpleasant and bewildering sequences. The decision was clearly made to try to profit from the remake of "When a Stranger Calls", practically putting - almost word for word - the phone call sequences of that film. They seem very forced. <br /> <br /> In addition, the filmmaker commits the main (but very common) sin of making heroin friends repulsive. So for the beginning of the movie, we really like it and we are rooting for the nanny (a good believable work by Rebekah Kochan), but then she has joined teenage friends and the weather is ruined. <br /> The kind of movie works, but probably much more unpleasant than you'd expect, so be warned.
