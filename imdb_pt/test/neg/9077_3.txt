Bronson took the money and ran with this movie; he must have payments at home like me! This low-budget movie made in Mexico reminds me of some of those Italian-smelling seas. I heard, I do not know if this is true, but companies make these films in foreign countries for tax purposes. I believe that because why else would they make this movie, it sure was not to make money. We had a lot of those stinking Canadians because the government gave tax breaks to create a movie industry. I wonder if that compensated in other countries like Canada. Anyway, back to the topic that this movie is poorly done in all respects, I believe they grabbed Charles Bronson to sell this stinky; that dead body at the end seems very false. 3/10
