I recently rented this promising miniseries, I did not even know they adapted it for television. I was really looking forward to it since Icon's book is one of the best spy thrillers I've ever read. What a disappointment it was. The plot just vaguely resembles that of the book, the characters are completely wrong and there is a terrible acting. A shame really. The story behind Icon is perfect for the silver screen, but I think television budgets are not big enough for a decent adaptation of this spectacular book. <br /> <br /> Forsyth deserves much, much better than that. Avoid and keep the book, which is a must read.
