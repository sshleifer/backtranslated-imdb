This film is about the complicated friendship, romance and deceit between two men and two women during World War II. Many efforts were made to make "The Edge of Love" look like the right period. . However, I find this effort too excessive, particularly in terms of the color tone. Most of the first half of the film is processed to have a strong bluish tone. It is difficult to distinguish who is who in this tone. <br /> <br /> Another downside is the extravagant use of the image split lens. There are many scenes that have three or four images of the same thing, like three smiling faces of Keira Knightley or four pairs of arms in a hug. This simply makes the film confusing and difficult to follow rather than artistic. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it's just boring. The way the story unfolds is by no means engaging. The unstable character of Sienna Miller is annoying. In fact, all the main characters are annoying and unpleasant. Keira Knightley's accent is impossible to understand, becoming an impediment to understanding the plot. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend avoiding "The Edge of Love," unless you watch a movie just to enjoy great fantasies, good scenery, and enlightenment.
