The worst Korean movie ever! The plot is ridiculously complex, unbelievable, and the film does not create a single shock. He builds suspense well enough, so leaves you agitated, providing no shock or jumpy moments. Whenever there's a chilling moment, you're not bothered by it, you're still trying to figure out who's who and what's going on! It's something like this: a modeling company recruits 4 people for a modeling career. but the owners are not what they seem, they have model dolls from around the world and a strange girl is seen walking about the place and the owners do not have recognition of a girl. It turns out that everyone is there for a reason and that's the most I could understand. The end is a mess of murders and you do not know who a doll is that is real and who is dead! I do not recommend fans of Korean / Asian horror films.
