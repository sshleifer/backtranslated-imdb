This is awful, you just could not believe it. The score is annoying, the footage is bad, for example, sometimes you see the cameraman's shadow appearing on the faces of some actors. The quality of the film is really bad, it looks like it was made in the 1920s. It's terrible. There is a bit of blood in the beginning and in the film, but always very dark. No blood no effect. The director did a better as Blood Rites. But out there is a follow up of the man, because looking to find this cheap movie is not that difficult, but you have to pay hard earned money for it. Surely this will be in my top ten of the worst horrors of all time, I do not know if I would call it horror. There is a lot of talk, you will get blood thirsty after watching
