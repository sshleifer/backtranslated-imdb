I watched the cut of the director last night ... glad it was free rent, even a dollar would have been too much for me to pay to watch this attempt at "movie noir". Anachronisms (modern phones) were annoying to me, not intelligent, looking more like budget constraints than anything else. The "non-traditional" cast also seemed disturbing to me. If I have to stop following the story to ask myself "what the hell is the black girl / drag queen doing there?" so the storyteller failed me. Again, not clever in my opinion, but annoying and annoying, and very final project of the film-ish school. And for God's sake, if you're going to shoot in black and white, at least use some of the techniques used in old movies that get the most out of having no color. There was no use of nuances in lighting, no shades of gray, no depth, no texture ... just black and white ... boring!
