Without actually giving my age, I first saw this for over 20 years when it first came out on video (maybe it was a beta ??) and I was old enough to drink (badly) and maybe I had had some because I remember thinking how great this movie was! I've seen it sober and I have to admit it's a really bad movie. As mentioned in other posts, the plot is absolutely ridiculous and the bad acting ends up getting worse. It's a bad attempt to fantasize that teenagers can also be "Mavericks" (although I'm surprised to find out that it's actually being released at the same time (approx) of "Top Gun", and does not really mean being a poor imitation) it's worth it - I watch myself watching if it's on and I have time.It's one of those movies you watch because it's so ridiculous and desperately trying to take itself seriously.Like that other "great" movie - "Moment by Moment "with John Travolta and Lily Tomlin ... do not make me start doing it!
