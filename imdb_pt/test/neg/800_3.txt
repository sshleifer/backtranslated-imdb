A box with a button offers the couple the opportunity to be financially free, but the cost is the life of someone they've never met. This is a very tedious movie to watch. Richard Kelly, who wrote and directed, decided to make a movie without any payment. You are taken on a slow ups ride, one after another with little revelations at best. At certain times, I thought to myself, this will have great meaning in the end, but nothing happens. The film leaves only one thought: "This story could have been told in 30 minutes, without all the absurdity extended." I hope you avoid this horrible movie and keep your sanity in doing so.
