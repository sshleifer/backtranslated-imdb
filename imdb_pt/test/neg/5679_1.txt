You just can not touch NRFPTP! The new crop is horrible. Jokes are not funny. Some members of the troupe make me want to stop watching TV together. Lorne - you let your creation go down through the bathroom. The guests are sometimes good, the bands are mostly junk. Weekend update, Seth has to tell the audience when to laugh .... Seth would get a proper reception at a cafe in Baghdad though ... Make sure Andy goes with him ... The show has about 10 jokes as a whole and they just keep on going over and over again. Even segments that obviously are not funny. Offensive people have become the name of the game, but they can not do it right. Just offensively. I'm so disappointed with what happened to the show, but now I also know it's safe to go out on a Saturday night!
