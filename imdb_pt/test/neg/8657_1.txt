The Yash Raj movies are so funny, whatever works they still are called the best house production? <br /> <br /> Watching Bhatt movies working they copied the formula, bikini and everything else by pitching actors like Uday and Tanishaa <br /> The movie is so horrible that it makes you shudder <br /> < the jokes are so bad and horny that makes you slap Uday reminds a gay plus a monkey <br /> <br /> Tanishaa resembles an idiot <br /> <br /> The director thinks that we are all idiots Arjun Sablok takes the audience to be granted Music is a saving grace Camera work is good <br /> <br /> Uday Chopra hams like an idiot Tanishaa looks like Kajol in K3g if Kajol was annoying then Tanishaa It's worse, the rest is fine.
