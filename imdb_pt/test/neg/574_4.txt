"The Love Letter" is one of those movies that might have been really smart, but they've wasted it. Focusing on a card that wreaks havoc on a small town, the movie has a cast of stars with nothing to do. Recently, Tom Selleck and Alice Drummond co-starred in the super-hilarity "In & Out" (also about a small town upset), in which both were great, but here they seem to be getting drugs. all over the place. I can not say what the people behind the camera are trying to do here (if anything), but they sure did not do anything. How tragic, that a potential revolt of laughter has been so painfully wasted.
