I know this movie was shown on local TV when I was a kid, but I do not remember whether I watched it or not; seeing now, considering how forgettable it is, I still do not know ?? so I counted it as a first preview! There were several films featuring the title character, a creation of visionary French writer Jules Verne; (1961; Vincent Price), MYSTERIOUS ISLAND (1961; Herbert Lom), CAPTAIN NEMO AND UNDERWATER CITY (1969; Robert Ryan); MISTERIOSA ISLAND OF CAPTAIN NEMO (1973; Omar Sharif). <br /> <br /> This version is starred by the Oscar® winner, José 'Ferrer. However, even if the premise itself is not half bad? Awakened by animation suspended in his submarine, "The Nautilus," and meeting in modern times, Nemo takes all of his ingenuity to help the US Navy defeat the megalomaniacal scientist Burgess Meredith ?? so easily emerges your most childlike adventure yet! For example: five seconds in the movie, Meredith's assistant? wearing a steel mask? complains that "the world will be ours!"); equally hilarious are the zealous gesticulations of the equally adulterated dwarf whose task is to dismiss the Professor's all-important "Delta Beam" - and the android-type minions aboard Meredith's ship that never seem to do much? ! <br /> <br /> Ferrer manages to maintain his dignity everywhere, but Meredith is a shame (in what is virtually a retread of his penguin characterization of the TV series and BATMAN movie of the 1960s) where the budget was so tight ?? mainly invested in bland production design and poor quality special effects, no doubt, and both evidently influenced by STAR WARS (1977) ?? that apparently they could not even afford him a decent costume (he looks positively idiot wearing a tie on a submarine)! The supporting cast includes Mel Ferrer (playing a saboteur in Joan Fontaine's vein of another Irwin Allen production, VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA [1961], and engaging in a bragging routine with her namesake inside the Lynda Day George (unsurprisingly, she is the only female character around) and Horst Buchholz (as the King of Atlantis ?? for some reason, Nemo is obsessed with locating the famous Lost Continent). <br /> <br /> By the way, having been reduced from a three-part mini-series to theatrical display, the film obviously seems hectic ?? although it is still possible to discern where one episode ended and another began.
