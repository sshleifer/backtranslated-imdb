I really enjoyed "Candid camera" with Dom DeLuise and was surprised to see that after the years Suzanne Somers became the co-star of the show. But that was the only positive side of the show - the whole studio, the introduction, the hosts - all gave the word "pompous" a whole new meaning. <br /> <br /> Well, that would be fine if the materials were not so cr * ppy - I mean come on, the best you can do is show some men who have trouble getting ketchup off the bottle, Suzanne Somers walking with the Halloween basket in July, ice cream that sells only vanilla ...? I saw few episodes and every time it was horrible. They were posing as if it were the biggest show of all time and then they fill the time with such monotonous scenes that I really felt ashamed to watch. Even the people in them seemed bored and that can not be good.
