That's all I can say about this movie. It's DBZ ... like Tree of Might and The World's Strongest, really ... does not fit the timeline for the show, although it's supposed to be placed just before the start of the TV series. The action is pretty cool overall. The plot has a good enough base, with a good record setting why these guys hate each other and everything. Very good in general, there ... The problem is ... there are a lot of really weird things. I mean, really weird stuff. Like The Strongest in the World, there is a very, very strange song that could only have been created in a drug-induced haze ... disturbing is the fact that Gohan, while singing, is practically drugged. Creepy. The villains are weird and comical ... more than the normal DBZ type - this looks more like a Dragon Ball movie than a Dragon Ball Z movie. In general, it's fun enough, but .. just ... weird.
