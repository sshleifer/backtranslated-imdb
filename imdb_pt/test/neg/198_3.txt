When a friend once criticized me for my first movie (a very bad video case), I argued that it could grow; Orson Welles' first film, in fact, was even worse. He challenged me that it could not be, so I got the LaserDisc Criterion from (I think) CITIZEN KANE and played HEARTS OF AGE. My friend lasted only a few minutes before admitting the point. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of humor in this short but it is basically as pretentious as (and perhaps a collegial answer to) BLOOD OF A POET and other avant garde films of the time. It's what it is: a succession of images with a vague theme, and unless you really enjoy any footage of Welles (with heavy makeup to start with), that's not even worth tracking.
