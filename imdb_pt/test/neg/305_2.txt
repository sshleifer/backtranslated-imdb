The premise of the film was very promising - a kind of gay film type Napoleon Dynamite. And to be fair, there were some funny moments and funny lines, but it really was not very good overall. The script and the dialogue seemed like a local production of sketches, full of cliches and scenes that were predictable. <br /> <br /> However, there was enough that was fun, that I stayed around to see how it ended, since there was suggest that something special happens in the end. But it looks like either the movie ran out of money or the writer ran out of ideas because the ending is extremely abrupt, almost jumping directly from what appeared to be the main conflict in the film for the final credits. <br /> /> Overall, it was very disappointing, but not completely unwatchable ...
