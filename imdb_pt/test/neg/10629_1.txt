I rented this movie because it supposedly happens at a jazz club - you know, those cool and cool places you can find late Saturday night. Well, there is not an ounce of "cool" in this ridiculous movie. The score is silly, the original songs are horrible, the singing of the two main actors is continually out of tune (at best) and unprofessional, the plot is no more complex than "boy meets girl", the performance is laughable and the Only decent cinematic moments are the shooting scenes. The scenes of the jazz club feature exaggerated dialogues suffocated by over-agitated organ music. This Francesco Joey should keep his day job (unless his daily work is helping with the movie scores). Is it possible not only to get my four dollars back, but also to have my therapy sessions paid for? This movie, oddly enough, is so bad, you might want to watch it. More or less like driving through a bad accident - you just need to look at least once. Just put the ear plugs ready!
