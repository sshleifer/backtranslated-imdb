From the beginning of this film, with "The Lost Boys" pulling out the opening sequence, the bad wire work and even the worst end of the dialogue, this movie was in the rhythm of a snail. "The Covenant" was highly recommended by some of my co-workers, who I am convinced were making a joke with me. At least I hope that is the intention and their taste is not so bad! This movie did not last much longer than an hour and a half, but it felt much longer than that. The story was so basic that it could have been summed up in about 15 minutes at most. They could have at least filled the rest of the movie with some fun magic or fighting scenes, however someone decided, (maybe the director, but I do not know if anyone actually "drove" this movie) that he would be filled with a few shots of camera "badly executed" and senseless scenes of the "boys" swimming and entering bar fights. About half way through this movie I thought maybe banging my head against a wall would be more fun, and partially to get rid of that horrible dirty feeling I had to continue watching. . So I hit my head against the wall, and I enjoyed it more than the movie! I watched all the way to the bitter end, hoping it would eventually offer me more pleasure. No, my efforts were rewarded with "How about I make you my Whee-aytch!" I vomited and then just felt embarrassed by the screenwriter and sorry for the poor actor who had to hand over such nonsense. The acting really was not as bad as other critics seemed to think, but even the most talented actor failed to save that job, and the work worked out, got on my nerves! I give the movies a chance, even the bad ones, because they usually offer some kind of fun, and this was not the worst movie I've ever seen. After it turned out I felt like watching the movie "Stealth" again and WOW was much better this time around! Oh yeah Point case, do not bother with this movie, really do not do it. Watch a few episodes of "Charmed" and watch "The Lost Boys" after having a decent amount of alcohol, and you will be a much better person. If you fall into the same trap I did and watch "The Covenant", make sure you keep all the sharp objects away, away from yourself, you will thank me for it.
