Stinger begins '3 Months Ago' on the SS Newark submarine where genetic experiments went awry and the crew member is brutally shot down by large, murderous scorpions ... Go to 'Camp Pendleton' a few months later, where General Ashford (James Cagnard) Williams (John Miranda) of his mission to board Newark and help geneticist Dr. Carly Ryan (Michelle Meadows), before anyone notices, a group of scientists and Marines are in Newark and are shocked to discover He mutilated corpses of the crew , plus Dr. Mike Thompson (Casey Clark), which does not make much sense. It's not long before the scorpion attack, the first to fall is Lieutenant Williams, so Sergeant Sam Harmon (Christopher Persson) is promoted and takes responsibility for bringing everyone to safety and ending the threat of giant scorpions forever .. . This co-production of Sweedish America was directed by Martin Munthe and he also dealt with cinematography and I thought it was an uninspired creature trait, strictly by-the-numbers. It's early for the new year and Stinger is the first genetically modified monster / creature / insect film I saw in 2007, I hope things can only get better ... Mat Nastos's script is incredibly clich√© and catches all that. other films, most notably Aliens (1986), lets see that the isolated location in this case is a submarine, there is the assembled team of hastily including one who chews a cigar throughout the film, there are scientists including a blond swede one to try to explain everything and evil money by grabbing the corporate villain who puts the mighty dollar above human life and the final ingredient being the monster / alien / insect or whatever, in this case there are lots of big scorpions running around, but are are not used in a unique or imaginative way, so they may have been locust killer. Yes, it's all here, unfortunately Stinger is not an alien if you understand what I mean. It's a long touch in over 100 minutes and it's extremely predictable, although it moves at a reasonable pace and as a dumb creature feature you could do worse, despite what many say about the IMDb ... <br /> < director Munthe does not distinguish himself, it is not scary, there is a lack of atmosphere and the action scenes are bland and bland. There are not many scorpion attacks and it's almost an hour before any meaningful action occurs, the special effects are at the bottom of the scale, but I've seen worse things for sure. I mean, that does not mean that the effects on Stinger are good, but I've seen worse. There is not much blood or blood, there are some mutilated bodies, some heads decapitated and someone is torn in half. The only intelligent and entertaining moment in the whole film is when the naked Swedish scientist asks her lover to turn her on talking about all the money they will make with the scorpions ... However, there was a moment that made me moan and plucking my hair in its stupidity while a guy tries to fix the circuit of the submarine and turn on the lights by squeezing the power supply / computer boards with a hammer and it works too ... Technically Stinger is at best average, and there are endless amounts of dark corridors that get monotonous. Stinger was shot in Stockholm, Sweden if you're interested. The acting was bad and there is nothing more to say. <br /> <br /> Stinger is not a great movie and it's not a great horror movie either, I can not recommend it, but I've seen worse. If you liked Stinger (unlikely), you might like movies with similar themes, like "Giant Scorpions in the Loose," as Sting Sting (2001) or Scorpius Gigantus (2006) (as well as improbable).
