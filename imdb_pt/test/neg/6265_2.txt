Stop me, if you've been hard on it before, some cheerleaders, your trainer and some guys are trapped inside a hut in the woods when an invisible killer kills them one by one. It's a shame for me, after I totally canceled Jim Wynorski after the horrible "Busty Cops" (it had been a long time since his last really good movie was "Hard to Die" 1990), I still for some reason have my hopes one alleged sequel to "Slumber Party Massacre".
