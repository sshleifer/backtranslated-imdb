I'm not one of those people who whine every time a movie based on an old TV show is released. Instead, I usually go out and see (if I watched the program) and try to stay nostalgic. But if someone feels like they're running down old-fashioned movies, this is Exposure A (so you can actually say something more than just "McHale's Navy"). "Mod Squad" is sad, tiring and lethargic. At least the original series was full of anguish long before anyone knew that teenagers could be so melancholic, making it innovative. This is just tedious. Claire Danes is cool to look at, but she does nothing but move and peek around spying on the bad guys. The acting of Giovanni Ribisi in this film is that Droopy the Dog searches for an hour and forty-five minutes. And Omar Epps looks like he wants to get away from the set, but the script's sclerophobia trapped him. Of course, production is good, with the now seemingly mandatory action series opening nightclub "rave" and shootings galore. Oh, and the children scream and get angry with each other and with their superiors too. It's like deciding to use the Scooby Doo Mystery Machine to go on a family vacation to Hollywood with your teenage children that you and your spouse know they need heavy therapy and prescription drugs. I really wanted to like this movie, and there were promising moments, but the next scene would suck his life. You can hit another remake of Spelling, "Charlie's Angels," anything you want, but at least that movie knew you wanted to have fun with yourself. "The Mod Squad" makes you wonder where was the inspiration of the original series.
