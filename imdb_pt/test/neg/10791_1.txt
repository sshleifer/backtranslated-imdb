This story is about a safari in Africa that meets a guy called Trent - who convinces them to look for a tribe of white babies. Of course, they become Amazonian warriors and capture men. The rest is quite predictable. <br /> <br /> This film has everything you would expect in a film about South Africa - the substantial use of often irrelevant films, films of animals that are NOT natives of the continent. (such as Orangutans, Moose, Coatamundis, and Ground Hogs), a dark-skinned white actor playing a bad and native performance (especially Trent - a handsome man with the balsa wood personality), comic relief (sounding like Chico Marx) a guy dressed in a gorilla outfit and white bikini womens with perms that are supposedly fierce jungle warriors - as a tribe of angry female tarzans. It seems, my guess is that the movie was made for less than $ 49.95 - including cost development and payment for renting the gorilla suit! But what I did not expect was a IMDb rating of 4.9. This is bad but not so bad considering that this is a problematic production in every possible way and there is no conceivable reason for the movie to be so loud! Now I'm not saying the movie is not worth seeing - it's overdone and stupid enough to make a nice view - particularly with friends. Just do not expect anything like a professional or competent film. <br /> <br /> Finally, here's a little bit of the dialogue of this jungle classic: <br /> <br /> "Oolama likes strong white man.Oolama wants strong white man ..." > <br /> "oonga-bunga" <br /> <br /> "me-te-tonga .... no, .... keeel ('kill') man"
