You know, I was very surprised watching this movie. It aired during the day once when I was sick, and having nothing else to do, I kept watching. This is by far the worst movie ever! But to my surprise, I kept watching. I sat there saying, this is terrible, but I still have not changed the channel because I was so much fun with how bad it was. Maybe it was the guy who looked like Big Survivor tone or the terrible mustaches and Mohicans that these characters had, who kept me watching. However, the girls were not half bad, but if that's what you want, there's much better. Oh, and there are "NINJAS" and "PAJAMA BOYS"! <br /> <br /> So if you like ninjas, bad interpretations, hilarious (and terrible) dialogs, and two twins five feet tall and killing everything seen, then this movie is for you. It's so bad that it's good. However, I just had to give it 1 out of 10. I could not have put a 10 on top with the Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> ENJOY !!!!!!!!! :)
