One of the scariest movies I've ever seen was Carrie (the first!). Now, as in other movies, they totally ruined Carrie's franchise with The Rage: Carrie 2. From the beginning, the movie moves like geriatics in a beat-up van. There are hardly any scares and this movie is filled with all the various high school stereotypes (ie the soccer athlete, the cheerleader, the followers and of course the black nailpolish using misfit). Another sad thing about this show is that you know what will happen the moment you see the opening credits. Of course, of course, girl gets humiliated and then turns into a mad psychic killer ... yawn ... <br /> <br /> I've been there. Done this. <br /> <br /> Even the actors seem to have been forced to make this movie. Emily Bergl is as frightening as a cabbage doll while Jack London ... let's just say I did not pay to see the piece of wood. In addition to the actors, the flasbacks serve more to irritate than to connect to the first movie. <br /> <br /> In short, if you can broadcast objects around like Carrie, then, for God's sake, get out of that theater ......
