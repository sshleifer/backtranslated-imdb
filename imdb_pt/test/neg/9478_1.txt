Exactly what the world needed - another superficial film by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. This movie conveys horrible messages to girls everywhere, with a stereotypical experience of "junior high". They make learning anything look completely taboo. I can not stand the fake French accents, or those guys on the mopeds running around that eventually "fall" for the twins. Why am I putting everything in parentheses? Because everything is stereotyped. The twins even complain about not having a stereotyped grandfather. They should be happy to have a grandfather. How does this fit into Mary-Kate / Ashley's mold? This has them fixing a single guy who (sigh !!) IS NOT THE FATHER !!!!! Yeah, guys, they actually have a mom who pops up for five seconds. I have not even sat down for thirty minutes and I can tell you how it will end. This movie is so unfortunate that it makes Miss USA seem like an academic bowl. Same.
