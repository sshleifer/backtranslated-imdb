A supposed stupid comedy that revolves around a serious misunderstanding, including (but not limited to) a confused prostitute with an exchange student, beating girlfriend, a girl who adores a gay guy and the straight man who loves her and gossipers. None of the following is funny or even amusing. The Lampoon Nation used to be hilarious in the past. Now the name is sadly synonymous with crap. And this is no exception. I used to think that Topenga was kind of cute when she was in "Boy Meets World," but it looks like she let herself go (and yes I know she has a name but she does ANYTHING else that's worth it, she's going to stay like Topenga) <br /> <br /> My notes: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kati Lohmann gets topless; Boti Bliss relies on a double body (BOOOOO !!!)
