This film had great values ​​of production, good lighting, costumes, set design, cinematography and acting. But somebody, somewhere, took the script and replaced all the dialogues by little letters writings. I felt my IQ losing points whenever a character spoke. <br /> <br /> Did they do it on purpose? Was this just an accident of Brain Dead Studio executives? At this point, we do not know. <br /> <br /> All I know is that this movie was a big mistake from start to finish. We can not even see how the squad became a police force, so instead of any character development, we have what looks like a leftover 1960s TV movie. Or ever. <br /> <br /> Find the writers, beat them with a stocking full of coins. Everyone, good job, but read their scripts next time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
