What? - that's it? Does the city sheriff (John Agar) blow up the mutant gorilla with a dynamite hidden in a mannequin? I just wrote this? I just saw this? With The Wildcats' instrumental, "Night Fright" is a movie that never deserved to be released in 1967. The apex of the gorilla was well over, and anyone other than Ray Corrigan in a suit monkey is just asking for trouble. Rephrase this in black and white and set the story about thirty years earlier and you would have at least a 4.0 rating on IMDb. But unfortunately, this should never get a chance to see the light of day. Oops, there's another quirk - you can never tell if it's day or night in history, since they seem to be interchangeable. <br /> <br /> I'll give it to you, some of the early malt stores looked like they might have gone on the air as Coca-Cola commercials. Thinking about it now, these were probably the most beautiful and brightest scenes in the picture; Coca Cola must have paid for them. If they had seen the full movie, they could have been better served to prevent it from being released.
