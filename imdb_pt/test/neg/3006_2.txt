If this movie had a point, I never figured it out. A very depressing film, which is supposed to be about the final evacuation of the residents living in an area of ​​a dam on the Northfork River in Montana. The problem is that there is not a Northfork river in Montana. There are several northern forks, but they are branches of other rivers that have been divided into forks north and south. <br /> <br /> The opening scene of the film is a casket dangling on the surface of the lake, but the scene is never tied. in history and the viewer is left to speculate on its meaning. But much is left to speculation of the viewer in the film. Another example is when a staff of the dam responsible for evacuating the residents arrives at the dam's headquarters, another group of people are leaving. Some almost inaudible remarks are made about these people, which makes no sense at all and there is no accompaniment in the film to explain them. <br /> <br /> The film is trucidated in several stories and the film keeps changing back and forth between stories which is quite disconcerting. And the stories are strange. In one of them the occupants of a property refuse to be evacuated because they are living in a house that is built like the Ark of Noah. <br /> <br /> Another meaningless story revolves around a sick orphan who is dying and somehow he is sharing his presence with a house full of ghosts and in an orphanage with a priest at the same time. If anyone can find out what the ghost story was about the author must have explained to them. <br /> <br /> The scenery was austere and the sun never shines. There are snowy mountains in the distance. I think the goal was to set the mood. The time period is defined by the fact that the evacuees drove all Ford sedans from the 1946-48 era, although events should have occurred in 1955. The performance was mediocre. When I saw the billing for this movie, I said Darryl Hannah was in the picture. If she did, I did not recognize her, but I suppose she was the ghost lady.
