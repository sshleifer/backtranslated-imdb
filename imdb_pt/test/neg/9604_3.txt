It's all right! A sci-fi / horror / action B-hybrid directed by Jim Wynorski and in the final scenes we could see a cyborg with a disfigured metal head killing several people! As with any Wynorski movie, it plays a lot of crazy ideas and subplots that lead nowhere. But "Storm Trooper" is more like a two-movie movie for the price of one. On the one hand, we have the drama / suspense part (so the movie begins) with Carol Alt killing her incredibly annoying and ungrateful husband (a plot that simply leads nowhere). And on the other hand, we have the part 'cyborgs escaped in a fury', the 'Night of the Living Dead' style. With Carol and Cyborg being the only ones trapped inside the house and a bunch of OPs / bounty hunters playing zombies trying to break into the house. Needless to say, this movie is not up there with the greatest. Zach Galligan (from "Gremlins" -fame) is especially painfully bad and Corey Feldman (in a little supportive test) is again completely wasted on this film. Wynorski even rips one of his films here, since I'm 99% sure that he used some footage from his previous movie "976 EVIL II" (the scene with the truck that exploded and the motorcycle). Yes, it's not so good and so much fun. This is strictly only for Wynorski fans. And I'm one of them, in case you do not know.
