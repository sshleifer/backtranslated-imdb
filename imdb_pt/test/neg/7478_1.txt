For a while, when I was in the middle of a job, I had a habit of watching all the nightly talk shows. For a while I had a good selection: Conan, Leno, Letterman, Ferguson, Kimmel ... <br /> <br /> Until the time of 1:30 in the morning. The time between Conan and X-Files, on SciFi. And the only show at that time was (and curiously still is) Carson Daly. <br /> <br /> His show intrigued me at first. Young, dressed casually and with the modern pedigree of an MTV presenter, I thought Carson would bring a younger aesthetic at night. I could not be more wrong. <br /> <br /> He does not have comedy time. His jokes are clearly bland, and his monologue is a painful case of self-conscious babbling. I began to think that he simply was not able to deliver comedy (and I'm sure he's not), but it's become obvious over time that the writers in the show must have had this for him. The writing was stupid and very exaggerated and the satires were terribly bad. And at the end of the show being in the studio, the writers made Carson drink alcohol on set with enthusiasm at every gig, a cheeky fellow smiling with emaciated cheek to emaciated cheek as he made his way through interviews. <br /> Zero interview skills. None. He tries to be friendly / talkative, but ends up being rude and rude. He talks too much. He cuts off his guests. He asks them rude or embarrassing questions - if he can find a question to ask them. And as someone pointed out, the guests literally look at him or squirm in their seats, clearly uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Now the show has come out of the studio and looks like it was filmed in a practical camera. Still, Carson refuses to accept NBC's suggestion. At one point, Carson did not even get a camera man, he had to shoot for an episode! Wake up, Carson ... this calligraphy is everywhere. <br /> <br /> I see that the show is produced by Carson. I can only imagine that is the reason why it is still in the air, it pays for itself.
