This show lasted most of the 1980s, and had its moments, but the plots were generally weak and usually painfully bland. <br /> <br /> Terry Scott and June Whitfield were wasted on this sitcom, both deserved better, but He provides some good memories and I found myself smiling in some repeat scenes. June Whitfield's talent for comedy is allowed to shine from time to time (when she's not being a surprise to Terry) and she's really smart. <br /> <br /> The 1980s is the last decade in which you'll find this kind of middle class, middle-aged comedy and many people remember it fondly, but I'd rather remember the decade of alternative comedy and of Spitting Image's scathing satire.
