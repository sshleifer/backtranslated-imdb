Tacky, but mildly entertaining early '90s soft core comedy features Xena (Sarah Bellemo), Luna (Tamara Landry) and Sola (Nicole Posey) as three teens from outer space. Xena's parents went on vacation for a few days. After some persuasive persuasion from her friends, Xena agrees to take her father's spaceship for a ride. The end result? They end up running out of gas into space and land on the planet Beta 45, AKA Earth. Meanwhile, teenagers Dave (Michael Todd Davis) and Jerry (Ken Steadman) have come to California to stay in the summer with Dave's Uncle Bud (Joe Estevez), a beach-bound homeless man. The three end up finding our three space girls who walked away from the accident without a scratch. Uncle Bud is about to be expelled from his beach cushion, which will soon be doomed, thanks to Sally (Linnea Quigley), who lives on the hilltop and used to relate to Bud. She is also a bikini mogul and is trying to win a $ 30,000 bikini design contest ... just what Bud would need to fix her property, so the girls decide to try to win the prize for him. And that's about it, people. Knowing that the fine plot of paper was just enough to sustain a feature film, the filmmakers subjected us to the scene after scene of endless beach parties with thousands of extras spinning their semis bodies in the scorching sun. Oh, and let's not forget about sex. There is a lot of it. Before continuing, I need to put this movie in context. It was released in 1993, long before the advent of softcore labels like Surrender Cinema and Seduction Cinema. Compared to these newer, bolder and more explicit films, the 90s softcore movies certainly look a bit soft. When Beach Babes From Beyond first appeared in 1993, Torchlight Entertainment's Full Moon was announced as the launch of a label that specializes in "mature public" films. Needless to say, times have changed. This particular film genre has shifted from some smoking but brief sex scenes and fleeting glimpses of full frontal nudity to extended sex scenes that occasionally threaten to venture into the realm of hardcore. Looking at Beach Babes From Beyond again after seeing him in his 93 'release, it is safe to say that if this same movie were made today, there would be much more emphasis on sex scenes and less time spent plotting and dialogue. As for the sex scenes themselves, they tend to get hot and cold. Our three space girls do not waste time getting comfortable with the boys that night. So each couple has a soft core scene, complete with slow-paced, irritating work and very dark lighting. They really are not that horrible, and are amazingly graphic in some spots, especially the scene between Xena and Jerry that happens in the back of a trailer. But the only sex scene that really leaves a lasting impression, and makes you be surprised at its overall intensity, occurs early in the movie. Sally is participating in a topless photo with three models posing in a pool. All the actresses in this scene are beautiful beautiful, but Nikki Fritz stands out from all the two due to its enormous presence. Remember that at this point in her career she still had to achieve the kind of huge popularity that would soon follow. She posing naked in a pool leads to an unforgettable fantasy sequence where she shows her body with soap in a bathtub and then again when they move away from her bath. Walking toward the bed toward an almost naked guy pumped in wait, we started a complete scene of complete nudity with his almost heart-shaped back and perfectly shaped back. It is good that Nikki's back is as muscular as she is about to have a good workout. Nikki spends the next couple of minutes completely naked with a handsome guy in a variety of positions in a scene that is filmed in a completely different way from the other three lovemaking scenes. No dark lighting or boring slow motion here ... just two actors in a huge bed with no sheets and blankets that seem to be barely working. Nikki's ecstatic body language only proves that few other actresses seem to enjoy filming sex scenes as much as she does. It's really the only time that Beach Babes From Beyond actually delivers the goods. But even without this spectacular scene, I'm slightly recommending this movie just for the fact that it's quite watchable and never bland, thanks to an incredibly energetic and compelling cast, many of which would appear in several direct video features for the remainder of the decade .
