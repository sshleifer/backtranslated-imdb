Unfortunately, a boring movie and obviously the only way to see it is the public domain bootleg release that is so blurry and dark that sometimes you have a hard time doing what the screen is. The main actors are a nuisance. The man spends most of his time on the screen trying to appear indifferent, charming and sexy, totally forgetting what the film is and that he is a murder suspect because of some lady who made him goose-bumps to begin with. The lady herself simply walks the film, being dignified if she is not busy looking cute. It is a very poorly written, never interesting or witty thing. No good camera work, no memorable soundtrack, no glamorous actress or atmospheric scenarios. It just scratches the surface of the genre, and nothing happens if you miss this movie totally wrong.
