This movie is an absolute disgrace! I liked the original airport, and I can not believe how the same people could produce this twaddle nine years later. First of all, the acting is bad. The original had actors who had made quality movies (no disaster) before, but this one uses actors who have already made the circuit of disaster films (Blakely, Kennedy, Wagner). In addition, Patroni, George Kennedy's character, seems to be promoted very quickly. He is now the protagonist in the film, but his character is not strong enough to carry him: he lost the charm and humor of Airport (1970), and the character is now boring. Did I mention the plot? Is it any believable that someone sends a missile after the Concorde? NOT!!! There are also many loose ends; scenes that have no relevance to the plot. The scene in which the hot air balloon lands on the tarmac, the thief's pursuit at Charles De Gaulle airport are two such scenes. Both would be interesting - if they had something to do with the real story. There are also many unanswered questions: Why does Patroni open the window and fire a flag on the other plane? Why does Robert Wagner's character kill himself? (It must have another stupid and costly way of "Why is there no investigation after the missile nearly explodes the Concorde?") Why are the projections so bad? It seems a missile is following the Concorde, although it works well When the plane lands in Paris) Why does Patroni think he is in a flight simulator (when he becomes the Concorde) Why does he receive a hero in the cockpit of the plane after terrifying the passengers? ending so poor, if it can be called an end at all? Given the unidimensionality, no one seems to notice it. The blessing given to the young couple on the plane by the girl's trainer is shmaltzy, the man who The saxophone is annoying, and the woman with bladder problem is simply nonsense. The scenes in which Susan Blakely is lying on the roof of her conservatory, and when she tells Wagner that she still loves him they are horrible. this movie should have been the climax of the anticipated three films from the airport: instead, it is a waste of time, money, energy, celluloid and diabolical "talent", sub-asshole, complete and total !!!!!!! Remember when Patroni asks the French pilot if he "landed on his belly"? This movie certainly makes the flop on the belly, and lands on the pointed nose ...
