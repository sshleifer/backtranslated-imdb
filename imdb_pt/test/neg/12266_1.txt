within about 5 minutes in the movie the first fight scene I was watching I could only help but I pointed out the lack of tension in the scene as the cameras crossing back and forth actually show that he had no idea what he was doing , in fact the soundtrack shows the best. I'm not a low budget movie and you will not get the top 40 songs, but at least you'll get songs that accompany the scene that is not that difficult to perform, well, if I saw it, I'd be happy to let you know. the script was so poorly written that now I'm a little surprised the direction of the guy wrote this piece of beep, I'm going to give the person a 10/10 and that went to the DVD cover because if I actually saw "before watching this" in a store and it was like 10 15 bucks I would have bought, why well, if you look at the hood this really well done you turn around and you see that it actually won awards. now this is a very misleading thing because even at a small film festival I would never believe in my life that it would gain anything I could say is "wow, if that were the best, I would not want to know what the crap is at the film festival was like "movies that are so bad only has a good use and that is for an aspiring filmmaker to use as inspiration films as these are better tools than good films because with good movie that you almost know of, there's a good chance you do not make such a good movie but if you use a movie like that you can look at all the things that the director or writer did wrong so you do not commit the same mistakes, and you have the added advantage of looking at this movie and saying that if a piece of beep sound like this can be done then there is hope of someone out there
