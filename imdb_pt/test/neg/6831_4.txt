I'm usually a fan of Bruce Willis, and although he plays the cold-hearted professional killer, I found him the most attractive character here. That said, your character makes such a mess in his professional activity, it's amazing he has not been caught before. The plot is thin to the point of being absurd. The ending was no less irritating and insulting by the fact that it could have been predicted from about 20 minutes in the film. <br /> <br /> ** spoilers follow ** In Hollywood morality, the good guys always win, with some casualties along the way, and the bad guys die, or at least they're on their way to justice to the end. The breath-taking insult of the film is how our IRA terrorist, who somehow became a caring and sensitive character, begins to move into a new life. Just like his former terrorist playmate (who is now a loving wife and mother). <br /> <br /> Who is the biggest villain? The first (and, as far as we can tell, unrepentant) terrorist, or the hired killer? I do not see much choosing between them - in real life, or in the movie. <br /> <br /> This is the poorest movie I've seen this year.
