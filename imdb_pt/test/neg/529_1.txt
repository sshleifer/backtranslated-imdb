Simply awful. I'm including a spoiler warning here just by including a joke from the movie - there's nothing else to spoil, since it's already rotten. This scum was made during what must have been one of Sellers's "For a few dollars more" periods, when he was involved in any crap for a few dollars. I had seen this as a 15-year high school student in 1972, and I hated it then. No need to preview it again; after 35 years I now remember as one of the five worst movies I saw as a child. As I recall, Sellers had more of a continued participation than a leader here, but even his presence could not soften the rancid jokes, the lame plot and the childlike replica. An ongoing issue revolves around the use of his fingers by Sellers: in one scene, he raises his hand open to a group of doctors and, folding his fingers, lists the groups for which there is a hospital - the inmates, the nurses, administrators, etc. - until only his middle finger is left up, to which he says "... and patients!" Har Har. In another scene, to avoid costly laboratory tests, he dips a finger into a urine sample and places it in his mouth to check for sugar, then urges the inmates gathered around him to do the same, which they do. He then warns that he has put his middle finger in the urine but sucked his index finger and advised them to pay attention. Hee Hee (The only reason I remember this, and this movie, and I'm writing this review, is that a friend told me an even more stupid version of this 'joke' today). If you like this, you'll like it. If not, see 'Hospital' with George C. Scott (released the same year, 1972) for a genuine and wonderful black medical humor. Better yet, read Samuel Shem's "The House of God," and if you can, see the unseen version of the movie (please make a copy and send it to me - I'd love to finally see it).
