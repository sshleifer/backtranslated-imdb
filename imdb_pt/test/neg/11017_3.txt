I really wanted to like this movie, however, after a few minutes of fun, I could barely smile. I agree that there was no chemistry between the two leaders and the other characters were clich√©s. The script totally wasted the talents of Bud Tingwell and Kim Gyngell. <br /> <br /> It should be said, however, that there was a lot of laughter around me and even a handful of applause in the end. Maybe I just could not identify with that enough. I'm happy to have bought cheap tickets.
