Uhhh ... so, do they still have writers for that? Maybe I'm picky, but I like a little dialogue with my movies. And, as far as horror movies are concerned, only a small part of the character's development will suffice. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, The Prey offers neither and if you think I'm hyperbolic, you just need to see for yourself. Scene after scene, we just have standing actors, seeming helpless and clumsy, abandoned by any sense of script. Out of calling each other's names as they separate in the forest, the only cases in which these people say anything substantive are when a character explains Orion's constellation (clearly plagiarized from Funk & Wagnalls; another recalls an old bonfire tale that has nothing to do with the plot (wait, what's the plot?) At other times, The Prey actually has the audacity to film their characters with the boom microphone far enough so that we can not hear exactly what they are saying. So we have whole scenes where the actors are muttering! Deliberately! Seriously, I've seen more dialogue in a silent movie. It's as if the filmmakers sat in a bar somewhere in Rancho Cucamonga at the height of the 1980s madness and one looked at the other and said, "Hey, I have a great idea for a bloody gag of decapitation. all the resource around it ". And well, they did. <br /> <br /> To be fair, The Prey probably had some kind of writer on board. I mean, someone had to write down the sequence of scenes and label the diaries. However, I am totally convinced that this movie does not have an editor of any kind. There are glaring pauses, boring tableaux and zero sense of rhythm throughout. Filmmakers do not have anything else in the script to film, so they fill the run-time with exhaustive taxonomies of the flora and fauna that inhabit the forest where our crazy and crazy teenagers are being sliced ​​and chopped. These creatures are all shot in the light of day, directly and without any attempt to photograph the atmosphere. If it looks like a science movie, it's because it is. I'm sure this is all nature show footage? All that is missing is a muted narration by some National Geographic alderman. More thrilling footage was graciously spared from the cutting room floor: a scene in which two men discuss cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches, and another scene in which a supporting character walks away in a banjo for what seems like a whole minute and a half! A minute and a half! This is too much banjo to commit to celluloid to get, let alone insert into the final cut of the movie! All right, everyone! Brevity and conciseness are the true victims of this massacre. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film takes a little steam (comparatively) in the last 25 minutes, in which much of the carnage is condensed and where a "Jackie Coogan" makes a fun presentation as a furtive park keeper and silly (this was his last paper, if you can believe it). And there are some good bloody moments, including a throat rip and the aforementioned decapitation. The make-up used for the killer (Carel Struycken, also known as "Lurch" of the Addams Family films) is also quite effective, and makes him look like a strange hybrid of young Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. Also, if you like freaky and straight endings, you need to check out how they involve this puppy. Normally, I love movies that are at that level of ineptitude, but the first three quarters of The Prey are so endless and boring that they pretty much ruin the rest. Overall, this is an extremely pale and tedious subject, and although it is not all that bad, it should only be seen by weak slasher experts. Why do we do this to ourselves, anyway?
