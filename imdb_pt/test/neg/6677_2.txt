After consuming the "Human Pork Chop" and digesting it properly, I felt prompted and obliged to inform prospective viewers that chewing this product is NOT FUN and their substance is LOW nutritional value. <br /> <br /> Nature of this movie, the following will be a WARNING rather than a REVIEW. This is the first time I wished, that there is a "I-do-not-care-to-evaluate-this-movie" button on IMDB, because the only reaction to this boring part of GARBAGE is stagnation and indifference. Each possible rating would do injustice to all other items listed here, a "10" is out of the question, "1" may persuade some readers, that this is one of those cases where "it is so bad that it is REALLY bad and this it's kewl! ", and" 5 "is unsatisfying too, people may think, that's a clip of Okay and that's fine if you want to have some fun, which is not ... Honest to God, it's not even one "10", a zero or a 5, is nothing, a black hole, A UNTILLY WORK CONCEPTED BY AN EMBRYO. I bought the region 3 DVD which was cheap ($ 7 !!!) at least and good picture quality, I bought mostly because of the positive and promising comments posted below my own entry. Oh boy, would I be DISAPPOINTED? This movie is neither shocking nor disgusting nor unnerving nor ... not laughable, not too serious to be ridiculed, but it's still serious enough not to be comical. An amateur effort truly without passion. The only sequence I found is when two laughing thugs put an ugly dog ​​in a bag and hit a brick wall ... but even such a cruel premise only leads to a bad execution. The scene below is unrealistic and filmed without any sense of suspense, suffering or humiliation - the feces look like they are painted in a swamp! There is a carnage scene at the end of about 85 minutes, when three men dressed in plastic raincoats (a setup found on the cover of the DVD) begin to get rid of the female body. It reminded me of "American Psycho" and "Shallow Grave", now these movies are worth watching and true works of art. <br /> <br /> Let's be REALISTIC for once and do not rush into making a myth of all Asian-wannabe-horror film, as it seems to happen lately ... <br /> <br /> If you is looking at some oriental horror, then try Danny Lee's masterpiece of the same title (in English) "Ba Xian fan dian zhi ren rou cha shao bao" (Pork Chop Human) is from 1992 and has - not without reason I could add - was compared to "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer". There is also a similar film telling the same story of another film crew called "René dou dou fu shang" ("There's a Secret in My Soup") from the same year, a kind of rival production. It is available as a 3 DVD region and by more regarded as superior to "Peng shi zhi sang jin tian liang". I could add a few more words about special effects ... what special effects?!? ... there are some severed limbs, they look awful - in a wrong sense - probably "Made in Hong Kong". <BR> This is about all the information I can share on this subject, I hope it is useful ... ENJOY YOUR MEAL!
