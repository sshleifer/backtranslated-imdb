I usually love Jackie Chan movies, but this one was terrible. There are only 2 or 3 fight scenes, all according to the normal pattern, more or less. The bad thing about this movie is that it focuses a lot on the chase / car race. Car chase is not so bad (though not as exciting as fighting), but car races at the end are exceptionally boring. Basically, it takes all the things that make a Jackie Chan movie a Jackie Chan movie and leaves out everything except Jackie Chan. Even the traditional outings at the end do not have your usual mood. <br /> <br /> I suppose to some extent this has been aggravated by the fact that I have seen one of those awful dubbed versions. I usually try to see the subtitled version ... I wish I could understand Chinese. <br /> <br /> I've only seen a Jackie movie worse than this and that was one of his first Hollywood movie raiders that did not go so well. <br /> <br /> Avoid, unless you are really curious or a motor sports lover.
