I started watching this movie on t.v. a few weeks ago, but gave up after the first 10 minutes or so. At first the person in the witness protection scheme located on an isolated farm gets nervous with his outside guards placed, and then asks the guard inside the house if he can make a phone call - only to find out that the line has been cut off. Shortly afterwards, Roy Scheider, as one of the witness's killers, appears and executes the witness and his wife - over whom Roy Scheider's character properly picks up the phone on the kitchen wall, dials a number, and then says: It's done ! Enough for me!
