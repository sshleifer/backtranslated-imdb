... I have little choice but to employ it at least once during my Respite review. Among other things, what defines the claim is, in my opinion, a lack of emotional sincerity on the part of the author. Breath seems made with a very artificial and self-conscious intention to be artistic, symbolic, spiritual, provocative, metaphorical ... even mythical. But fortunately, for all true artists, there is a formula predisposed to achieve artistic beauty and depth. Stunning natural sites (yes, those remote parts of southern Italy seem exotic even to most other Italians), beautiful actors and a few fun, brave and spontaneous presentations from a handful of attractive children will not lift a movie without substance as well as a beautiful succession of images. However, this insincere, vain, and ultimately hollow, film attempts to be art, succeeding only in a very limited way, perhaps in some cases by accident. I admit that the conceptually pompous ending has a certain visual poetry. However, it is my conviction that this was achieved in a way that had more to do with the beauty of the Lampedusa sea and the strong symbolic power of bathing and water (linking it to something mythical, mystical, religious, archetypal, etc. .) than with the talent of Crialese. <br /> <br /> Valeria Golino is gracefully histrionic and affected in her performance as Grazia. For a mentally unstable woman of humble and provincial origins, she certainly has an elegant wardrobe. Her flattering flowing floral dresses and attractive sun-kissed beach hairs could have graced the pages of any Vogue summer edition. The fact that she was a "crazy" could have, in a sense, only been an elegant addition to her behavior and fashion appearance - that was how her "condition" seemed to me to be. Golino's two-dimensional stereotype of the innocent, natural woman-child misunderstood and oppressed by her backward community was tiresome and irritating at worst, leaving me immobile and indifferent at best. I agree with the London critic who wrote that mental illness is very poorly served by the cinema - throughout the film we never felt Grazia's illness and we have no idea what is really wrong with her (besides being a tiresome stereotype of a "free spirit"). We do not know why she received injections and is forced to consult a specialist in Milan. This generic way of writing mental illnesses is one of the main indicators of the general shallowness of the film. Another insulting aspect of Respiro is the singularization of its location. I struggled to find out whether this film should be set in the present or the past, since it aimed to make even a recognizably retrograde part of Italy (by comparison) look a dozen times more cowardly and more conveniently primitive than it really is. Again, this smells of superficiality and a complete lack of sincerity on the part of Crialese. Some non-Italian viewers will cheerfully rejoice in the picturesque backwardness, with the cliché of the possessive and macho macho Italian as if it were a commonplace, so eager to continue to see my country as a culturally lost people in the 1950s (the question I would like to ask David Ferguson, the reviewer from Dallas, Texas is as follows: is the mentality of YOUR country stuck in the 50's? Not? OK, so why should it be mine?). Unfortunately for those who still want to see Italy in such an anachronistic way, this aspect of Respiro is really ridiculous and false even in the eyes of the Italian spectator. The subtly incestuous tension between Grazia and her eldest son was as tiresome and predictable as the macho routine of Fabrizio Bentivoglio. I especially hated the scene in which Grazia joins her husband and friend in a man-to-man joke over a bottle of beer, to the embarrassment and dislike of her husband. According to this film, it is not the place of a woman to participate in a man's conversations. Ah, but our "lovable" "free spirit" is too good for this place and does not understand the oppressive and unwritten rules of the Lampedusaan patriarchy! This scene not only represents something as false, as it should be enough to discredit the credibility of the entire film. He also gets completely the wrong side of the culture he strives to describe, clearly showing that it was written without a clear understanding of the place or its population. I would defy anyone who knew contemporary Italy to say otherwise. <br /> <br /> For a truly accomplished contemporary Italian director, someone who, in my opinion, deserves to be listed among the greats of the Italian film past (which, unfortunately, is not not the shadow of his former self!) , look no further than Gianni Amelio - especially Lamerica, Così Ridevano and his latest, La Stella Che Non C'è. Unlike most contemporary Italian cinema, unfortunately derived and stagnant, Amelio's is a new and independently creative voice. Despite my overwhelming criticism of Respiro, I am more than willing to believe that Crio's latest Nuovomondo, now aired in Italian theaters, will be worth it. I therefore look forward to enjoying it, although it is not too shocking to me if I do not (considering my feelings for Breath!).
