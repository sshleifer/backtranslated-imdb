<br /> <br /> In Japan and other parts of Europe, the new technology is allowing filmmakers to bypass the closed shop in the Hollywood mainstream and avoid Ed Wood as visible values ​​of low-budget production to produce appealing films. It's a shame that in the UK we can find examples like 'Avatar' (name of many video games) where brain-dead attempts are made to imitate so many movies - and console games adored by teenagers without a girlfriend - which are cheap cliches photocopies are plentiful like kangaroos fed testosterone. Check out some of the synopsis: "Set in futuristic London, 2024, tells the story of a team of virtual reality virus exterminators facing the Internet virus." <br /> <br /> Go back and read this quote again - avoid giggling - and try to find a unique idea in it. That must have seemed like a sad, tired concept in 1993, it does not matter in 2003. Ah, but there's more - the 'definitive virus' has already caused aircraft crashes, infected the air traffic control center, etc. It was developed by a "child genius" and manifests as a meager, athletic, asshole imitator with an imitation of Lara Croft who makes a great line of growling and cod martial arts coming out directly from the playground - the living product of teenage fantasy. Oh, and she's accompanied by 'Predator' as sound effects to emphasize her remarkable powers. <br /> <br /> The whole thing has a 'futuristic' vision of striking originality - the Lloyds building leaked with AfterEffects to look a little green. The budget really shows - what it should not today. All in all, a meaningless mess of cheese, ham and cliché that Roger Corman would have left on the court floor in his most shameless and desperate moments. It is a shame that such an alleged labor of love has released nine minutes of wasted celluloid. <br /> <br />
