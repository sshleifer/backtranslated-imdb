OK - I gave a "3" just because they obviously did not have the money to make this movie, but I feel like it might deserve the "2.3" rating when I got here. Actually, I'm helping to increase your rating, despite being bored for the last hour and a half. I will save the "1's" and "2's" for the higher budget pieces. At least the creators of "Rise of the Undead" have not lost so much money. They managed to waste 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The movie is very claustrophobic for me. The whole movie happens in the same building, in dark rooms and corridors. With a setup like this, there should have been more character action or development, but there is a lot of nonsense talk. I have not met any of the characters. There's a schoolgirl and a goth girl, but we never find out much more about them. Neither character looks really lovely. <br /> <br /> Terrible movie made with zero budget. No scary special effect. No suspense. Nothing really interesting here, folks. I admit that I downloaded it from the internet. It was free, but I'm throwing away. <br /> <br /> Sorry to the filmmakers. Better luck next time. This is more like a soap opera than a zombie movie.
