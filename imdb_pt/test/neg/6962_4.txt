I approached this film with the understanding that this was one of the worst movies ever made. I sat down to watch with that mentality and was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> It's not good at all. Not so good; in fact, it is very poor. However, it is not as bad as I was led to believe, for a long time. It is quite ineffective and, of course, as a cost-cutting measure, many filming is put into service, many of which have no apparent relation to the narrative. <br /> <br /> What it is, however, is an intensely personal movie made by a man who evidently did not have the skills or the funding to do his idea justice. Before you cashed _Glen or Glenda? _ Out of hand, examine your own artistic skills. I'd love to be able to draw, but anything I try to sketch comes out like stick men. I'd love to sing, but all I do is scare the kids. <br /> <br /> Wood had an idea and unfortunately he did not have what it took to make it work. However, this was an incredibly daring film for the 50 Puritans, no matter how exploitative or incoherent it may seem at first glance.
