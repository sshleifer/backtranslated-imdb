A cute idea to make Dionne Warwick do the vocals for this film adaptation of Jacqueline Susann's best-selling book (Ã  la "Doll's Valley") ... although it's really too bad that this person does not have Neely O'Hara de Patty Duke to stake the story. "The Love Machine" is incredibly tedious. Even the ultimate fight (with an Oscar as a fighting driver!) You can not save him. Dyan Cannon looks embalmed with his heavy pancake make-up and tricky fall (though his small tan figure is a beauty to behold), John Phillip Law is a block of wood in the lead, David Hemmings sexually embarrassing like a flamboyant photographer. And where is Robin Stone walking in the end? Is he traveling to the seashore to pick up some sailors? After Cannon had emptied his manhood, it would be a safe bet. In that case, "Love Machine - The Final Episode" may have been a more interesting film. Certainly better than this yawn inducing snooze. * 1/2 of ****
