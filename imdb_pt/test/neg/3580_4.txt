'R Xmas is one of the only movies I've ever seen, where I can almost say that simply nothing happens. I felt like I was watching a middle-class couple drug dealing with a child, walking around, eating, smoking, talking (excuse me, I swear) for most of the movie. And I can not believe I'm missing the point. I think this film was well-directed, well-represented (though the husband's performance was pretty much wood), and the constant feeling of impending doom around every corner certainly kept the viewer involved. But when the dust clears, his left with zero (just a boat-load of fades). I did not want car chases, gun violence, beatings, etc. In fact, I am full of violence. But, my God, let's at least dig deeper into all these characters (let's meet each of these corrupt cops a little better - not just show them pictures of street thugs). Why the dialogue so youthful? Everyone spoke as if they were in high school. I believe that even this side of our human race can say something different from fu_ _, sh_ _, etc. The rhythm and plot of 'R Xmas' I found quite interesting, but the execution was simple and simple-empty.4 / 10
