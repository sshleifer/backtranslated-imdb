I have loved Tim Burton in the past. I loved Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands and even Mars Attacks. But I hate this movie. The fantasy drama scenes at the beginning were the kind of sloppy and indigestible things that used to haunt the historical drama 25 years ago. So there were all the head-cut scenes that left me cold, and that's the kind of thing that should mean something, I guess. Yes, there were some beautiful bare trees and foggy nights, and the knight jumping from the tree was a beautiful special effect, but overall the film was just boring and meaningless.
