Nothing to watch here. Everything was done (and better) before. Who cares about this woman - deficient in every way - as a mother as a wife and as a friend? In an instant, when she might have taken the higher path - she jumped into re-dependence with both feet and held her breath - for a better reason than "me too!" If she was not the pretty, young person she portrays on the screen - but it looked more like the real human wreckage represented by our family members, neighbors, and friends who actually suffer from addictions, we changed channels in a nanosecond. /> <br /> This movie starts at the bottom and goes down the hill. Nothing redeeming, no lesson taught-nothing edifying at all. None of the main characters evokes sympathy, much less empathy. (Well, maybe the snake.) I would have enjoyed it more if I had closed the door on my hand. Who needs nonsense like that?
