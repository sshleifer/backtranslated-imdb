First of all I want to say that I lean liberal on the political scale and find the film offensive. I was able to see all the disgrace of a movie. This movie brings a bass to original ideas. Yes, it was original, so my 2 stars instead of 1. Are our movie writers so uncreative that they can only do this? Acting was horrible and the characters were mostly immovable. The protagonist of the story did not have good qualities. They made her some kind of bad guy and I did not see any of it. Maybe I missed something, I do not know. He was the most realistic, relevant character in the movie. I did not shell out money for this crap. I almost wished PETA would come to the rescue of this horrible and offensive movie and make a protest. Disgusting is all I have to say more!
