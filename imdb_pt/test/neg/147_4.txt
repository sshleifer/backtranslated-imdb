I usually enjoy watching Laurel and Hardy, but this is obviously one of the movies they did while they were on their way to becoming a successful comedy team. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple, and is mainly based on a joke; How strange are the Kilts and the Scots. And that is all. Okay, there are some other jokes, but I did not find them very funny; they are outdated and (I think) were not much fun when the movie was released. <br /> <br /> Still, the film has two of the most charming faces in history, and they get the best out of the movie. embarrassing story (which I hope has been filmed without an appropriate script) and the setting is cool to look at. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, watching this only applies to fans of Laurel and Hardy, other people should stay away from it.
