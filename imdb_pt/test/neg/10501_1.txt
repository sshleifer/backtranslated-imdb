So this is the worst movie you'll probably see. It's up there with "Crossbones" and "Southern Comfort," but if you're a bad movie fan like I am, this atrocity of a movie will be the most fun you've had in years. Why does the camera make old school kung fu noises when zooming? Why does that random guy fill a commemorative plate in his bag? And who is he anyway? Why do vampires shoot when they die? What is it? Highlander? Dracula McCloud? Who cares! Just laugh at that. This movie has no continuity, no plot, nothing, actually. Ron Hall's range of emotions is always off. He looks happy when he should be sad, angry when he should be confused. The rest of the cast could not get out of a paper bag. Special effects ("Short bus" kinda special) are randomly placed and are never needed. Most scenes are illuminated with a table lamp if they are lit. Mel Novak has AUDACITY for looking off camera for his line, and is not even edited. They just keep filming. In fact, half of that movie is not even in the movie. It's 1/2 movie, 1/2 sony hand-cam. For most of the movie, it looks like they left their boom at home. This film has not only a few holes in the plot, it's a minefield of confusion and mental pain! But I love it! Thank you Ron Hall, for this cinematic abomination. I went out and bought because it's so funny. ($ 1.99 on Amazon, and I was in a hurry delivered!) <br /> <br /> "I have guns! I have guns! I have guns!"
