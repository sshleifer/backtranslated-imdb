I saw this movie on the Blockbuster shelf and thought it looked cool. The DVD case attracted so many great actors and I asked myself, "Why did not I ever hear of this movie?" So I turned the case over and saw the director, Lee Tamahori, and so the answer began to be explained. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to defeat the idea that a great cast is equal to a great movie, but more importantly, I think it should explain why this movie is so terrible. Okay, the script is horrible and full of one-dimensional characters. This is the worst role I've ever seen Chazz Palminteri play and I'm surprised he would do something so ridiculous. However, underrated and talented actors should earn their money. Palminteri plays a one-dimensional police detective who is as dumb as a mafia gangster in a movie. He, along with lead detective Nolte, the simple but simple Michael Madsen, and the late Chris Penn (whose role along with Madsen was completely discarded) form an elite squad of LA detectives tasked with ridding the city . of gangsters sometime in the late 1930s or '40s. The film presents this squad as law enforcement officers who break all laws to ensure that those who think they are above the law do not operate in their city. At the beginning of the film, the police officers attack a local restaurant, pick up an alleged mafioso (William Peterson) and take him to a place called Mulholland Falls. They throw it off one of the cliffs on Mullholland Drive and this should demonstrate how serious these guys are in ridding the city of crime. Whatever. This was nothing more than a cheap excuse to use a low quality title that is designed to make you think of Los Angeles and its famous sites. Somewhere later they find Jennifer Connelly's corpse and the plot begins. <br /> <br /> For the direction that was nothing less than amateur and LOW! In addition to the fact that the characters were B movie quality, overcoming people like Treat Williams, the guy who plays the police chief and the terrible Daniel Baldwin are just a few highlights that made this movie look as if Lee were the first movie of Tamhori. There is not a good performance in the film, plus maybe Melanie Griffith, which some may argue was the worst of the film (she won a Razzie for this movie). In the end, it was her character that was not so good and she really did not have much to work with. <br /> <br /> As with any bad movie, it all starts with writing, and this script was not a jewel. The plot is simply formulated based on the creation of the next scene and never takes into account the motivations of the characters. The way the characters behaved was unbelievable. Cops taking the law into their own hands is believable under the right circumstances (see LA CONFIDENTIAL), but in this case it seemed like these guys could get away with anything, including murder, and never bothered to clean anything. I think we, as a public, assume only that nobody has seen anything and that people do not ask questions. Everything about the story is predictable and it is so well fed that we understand everything that will happen for a long time before the characters do. However, this does not make us feel clever, but it annoys us how stupid the hero is, despite the fact that there are no heroes in this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, the best part of the film was David Grusin's great track. From the beginning, he invoked one since CHINATOWN, which quickly disappeared when I realized how incredible everything was in the film. It did not surprise me to know that that made eleven million dollars at the box office. What I'm going to say is that it's worth watching this movie for a few laughs. Nick Nolte's acting is like an unsuccessful junkyard dog and I laughed every time he tried to be serious. I also almost fell to the ground on each of the slow-motion plans used in the movie (I think there are three with one during a key fight scene). When you have to use slow motion in the heat of a dramatic moment, you clearly have some problems. So, even with my negative reviews, I will recommend this movie just for the purpose of provoking laughter, that is, if you enjoy good movies like LA CONFIDENTIAL.
