Do not believe in hype. If you have high hopes or anticipated this movie to any degree, you may be disappointed. Even the hilarious and talented Steve Carrell can not save this silly and misspelled espionage film. For the purists (fans of the original TV series), this movie bears little resemblance to the original characters and influence. Agent 99 and Maxwell (except for their names) are simply not the same characters. There are several references isolated from the original but not enough to convince this fan that it is something more than a faint shadow of the TV version. For those who are not familiar with the original TV series, you may not be disappointed, but chances are you will get bored. There are some cheap Hollywood political shots too (really pathetic and oh so typical for an election year). We left after the first hour and we were not alone. Some left after 20 minutes.
