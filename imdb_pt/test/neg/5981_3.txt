What a waste of a great cast. I thought I'd take a look because it seemed like a good comedy with lots of well-known actors. What turned out to be a useless collection of intertwined and boring stories about various characters with minimal connections to each other. Characters that start looking like decent people, but end up having no nice or interesting features between them. Calling her comedy was also a stretch ... the only thing that made me laugh was the music of Jack Black, who was basically Tenacious D. I expected something big to happen, but I ended up with nothing more than 97 minutes of my life Wasted. .
