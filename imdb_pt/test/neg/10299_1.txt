Without a doubt, the biggest waste of film of the year. This movie is poorly structured, sadistic, cruel and full of unpleasant characters. In addition, and perhaps the worst crime, it is uninteresting and very predictable. As Bill Pullman's character scribbled on the photo changing the word from "evidence" to "violence," I had the whole plot planned. There are no surprises and there is no reason to see this crap. The only rescue feature for me is that I saw this thing for free on my HDNet cable and did not waste any money. I would really be angry if I had paid to see in a theater. <br /> <br /> Anyone who labels this thing as a thriller really needs to get out more. A horrible and horrible movie in every way.
