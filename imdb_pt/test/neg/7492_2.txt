What rubbish, is not there really part II? If this movie really ends the way it was done, everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed. This movie is nothing close to a movie like Outbreak, which was actually quite a decent movie. This movie was rushed hoping to be able to earn a few easy bucks. I started watching the movie with the assumption that it would be bad, but I never imagined it would be that bad. This movie was no more than a way to explore the fears of the American people for profit! If you have not seen this movie, do not bother. The film is full of underdeveloped characters and little acting. I really hope the production of this movie has been only a few weeks. To stay away! Do not be fooled by the hype!
