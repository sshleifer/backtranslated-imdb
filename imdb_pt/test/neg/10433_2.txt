When I think of a 1970s movie, that's not what I think. I do not want a monotonous and unique soundtrack of Robin Trower; I want a soundtrack punctuated with the 40 best chewing gum songs of the day that synthesized the 70's. Generic karaoke-style disco music during the dance scene was especially annoying. The acting (if you can call it that) was a lot of wood, and it just seemed to read the script in monotone. The quality of the film and the camera work were horrible; the obscure dialogue, the script seemed to be played without much thought and the plot was thin, if not nonexistent. I can not believe people are giving the high ratings I read here. Basically a forgettable attempt, poor in re-creating a beloved era of the past. Two stars is all I can do. Sorry guys.
