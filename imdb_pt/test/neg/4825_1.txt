I think this program is a load of junk. All they do is argue and bump into each other on the other side of the face and they call it acting ?! These people get a lot of money for it and most of them can not even take action to save their lives. Also, the story lines are terrible and after watching it for a few minutes, I'm bored with it. I like the way Harry Hill takes Mickey from his TV show 'TV Burp', and. the weak joke "Princess and Pea is not exactly Shakespeare, is it?" which had Sonia and Naomi in stitches. I do not see how funny this is. I think this is a waste of everyone's money for their TV license so this can be shown 4/5 days a week. Is not nothing better than that?
