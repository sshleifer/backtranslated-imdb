2 deadly and bland girls stay at their uncle Benny's beach house, which is incredibly bland. Uncle Beeny does not like to party. But guess what? the deadly and bland girls have one, as you guessed, a bland beach party. If you did not catch the not-so-subliminal message I'm trying to convey. First, you're an idiot. I'd rather watch a team of naked gelatin watching game between Bea Aurther and Cameryn Manhiem VS. Rosie O'Donnell and Jessica Tandy. This movie, and I lose the term freely, is simply SO bad. <br /> <br /> My notes: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kristin Novak and Charity Rahmer go topless, Iva Singer shows breasts and buns
