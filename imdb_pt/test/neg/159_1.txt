This movie fails all accounts. For starters, it is pretentious, striving to be "meaningful" and failing miserably. The script was banal in the extreme, no one at any time said anything remotely interesting. It was impossible to care about any of the characters. Knightly was a waste of time, while Sienna Miller was just a waste of time. The part about the soldier who went to war was a cliché even before the movie that Atonement used. The use of World War II as a backdrop was itself a cliché ... the bombs, the shelters at subway stations etc ... employed to import some of the much-needed drama. Why anyone thought for a moment that this movie was worth doing is completely beyond my comprehension. It was another case of "let's make the costumes look authentic, no matter the story, the script or the acting!"
