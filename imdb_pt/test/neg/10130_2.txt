That's what the Disney Channel shows for kids who are dumber than the posts. That serves them well. Not funny, acting is the worst I've seen in years, there are more stereotypes than actors, and everything about this show makes you moan and roll your eyes. Do you want to know why? Not only is this show a waste of airtime, the actress "Selena Gomez" looks like a pig. Jake T. Austin's character needs some Ritalin. David Henrie's character needs to visit a strip club and be wasted. In addition, the program writer is inconsistent. In one episode, the security guard is called "lord" by one character and referred to as a woman for everything else. <br /> <br /> Hello? It's called revision and editing. Do it someday, Disney. <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen the promo of the new "four-part bloodsucker saga"? Disney wanted its own version of the Twilight thing against Harry Potter. Except a million times lick. The Wizards of Waverly Place Movie? Think about it for a minute. The family is leaving on vacation and the 16-year-old daughter wants independence from her parents. The SAME PATH from the Proud Family Movie, etc ... <br /> <br /> The worst is all the Emmies and ALMA'S. And the majority of the public is a little from the age of 4 to 13 (and there are no teenagers in life). How many years? before Selena Gomez showed her tits? <br /> <br /> And the Disney shows are crap ... the hacking writers ... show the shows.finding the minds and wallets of today's youth.
