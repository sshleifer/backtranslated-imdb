There is a fantastic song in Killjoy 2 that talks about how clowns are usually really cool and fun, but Killjoy is a killer. I do not remember the song in the first movie, but when the singer Olimpia Fernandez sings 'Killjoy, yeah Killjoy 2', it seems the 2 may have been added to this awful sequel. The movie is much worse than the first movie and that was really bad. This time, the cast, including the normally excellent Debbie Rochon, gave up trying and director Tammi Sutton does not create tension and presents only a monotonous and constant film. Images of the Full Moon produced this during the 'Urban' phase, none of which was very good, but none as bad as here.
