John Sayles, what did you do? <br /> <br /> "Silver City" had moments when I could see the glittering hope of a good story, well-designed characters, thought-provoking dialogues. And then those moments would be quickly covered by layers of poor writing, clumsy direction and abysmal acting. I really love almost all the work of John Sayles, but "Silver City" is awful. <br /> <br /> I have the impression that Sayles may have worked at the beginning of a good story involving illegal work and industrial work. plot lines of corruption, but then he rushed and arrested the secondary plot satirizing the Bush administration for him. The two stories really do not connect with each other, and the weaker elements of the political theme dominate the first 3/4 of the film, causing me to lose patience with the whole affair. <br /> <br /> The other major flaw is the performance of Danny Huston. His dialogue in each scene is delivered with a smile emblazoned, regardless of his suitability to humor. I hated this guy until the end of the movie, having reminded me of all the bad actors in all the high school plays I've ever seen. Not having seen Huston in anything else, I do not know whether I should blame him or blame him more for Sayles. Regardless, he is the unfortunate focal point of a very unfortunate film. <br /> <br /> Until the last subtle and final scene, I was disappointed with "Silver City". Sayles at his best, or even Sayles, mediocre, can be so much better than this movie. See ANY other of his works. This is not even worth renting.
