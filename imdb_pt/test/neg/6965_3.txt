There is a part of me that would like to give this movie a high rating. Considering it was done in 1953, it is a very brave film about transvestites, approaching the issue in a very serious and sympathetic way (and offering the viewer lots of information on the subject) and trying hard not to stereotype. The film clearly shows that transvestites are not homosexuals and that, in addition to wearing women's clothing, lead a relatively normal life. He deals with the pain of not being accepted into society - the plot revolves around a cop (Lyle Talbot) trying desperately to understand the issue because of the recent suicide of a transvestite. So, you have to give everyone involved with this movie credit for taking on such a controversial subject (in the context of 1953). <br /> <br /> All this said, I'm also sorry to say that this movie is absolutely terrible. In attempting to portray the pain of Glen / Glenda (Edward D. Wood), the film turns into nonsense (and sometimes surprisingly - again given the sexy fantasies of the time) that make the story very difficult to follow. The performance is wood at best. None of the dialogues are real; the actors seem and sound like people reading speeches written by others. And - worst of all - it was no use having Bela Lugosi in this movie. This was another of the increasingly embarrassing roles that this poor man took in the later stages of his career. "Pull the strings, pull the strings," Lugosi's poor character (called The Spirit in credits but who actually looks more like a mad scientist) kept on crying. And nothing he did really seemed to have much connection with the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> For artistic merit, the film does not deserve much more than 1/10. However, for the courage involved in just putting it out, I'll give it a 3/10.
