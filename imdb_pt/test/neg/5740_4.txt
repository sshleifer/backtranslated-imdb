I suggest that in the future any movie made by the SciFi channel and later released on DVD should say that it actually was made by a channel like that, because I would not buy those things if I knew that. Not that this was bad, but when you fade to commercials in the middle of the movie, it ends up spoiling the flow of the movie. This, in turn, makes the film more boring. This had an interesting story, however, the lightweight and extremely generic soundtrack distracted one from the movie as did most of the bad actors, with the exception of Dien and Linda Carter. The story, vampires are in the offense in South America, of course the rules of vampire films are not in force, which are generally not in any of the vampire movies I've seen lately, except for the Blade trilogy. Group of soldiers are sent to battle, the team is sent to meet with the team and to track down the ex-wife of one of the soldiers ... why she is not only his wife, who knows how this part of the plot really goes no where. Still we got an interesting boat ride some nice jungle landscape and lots of blood. This fact, however, does not save the film from being rather abrupt in its presentation and really bland at times. I do not know, maybe it was cgi blood, and smoke and what they have to do cgi now, even though the old effects look better and do not cost much more. I mean cheap Italian zombie movies could make a bullet hole without cgi why can not we now?
