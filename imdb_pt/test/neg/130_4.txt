From watching the trailer, the movie looked very interesting. The production of the film is also very good - it looks like they had a good budget and did not look like a cheap movie. The acting ranges from good (Joe Morton as Professor Simon) to OK (Kelly Overton as Eve) to bad (James Haven as Don). <br /> <br /> The actual content and plot of the film is weak. The film begins as if it could become interesting and ends with a poorly executed twist, disappointingly boring. Watching the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes of the movie would have made this movie OK, but everything in between makes it an absolutely boring watch. It's as if they make a short film and then try to force it to last for over an hour, filling the medium with an hour of filler. <br /> <br /> If you want to waste a good hour and half of your life, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay away from this extremely annoying movie.
