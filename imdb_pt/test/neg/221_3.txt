I'm so angry to the point that I usually down to make comments with spoilers but in this case I'll make an exception. The first scenes of this movie are weak and so when they get to the meat and potatoes of the movie that sucks. This is a movie that I did for the bad guys because the captain-save-the-day was unbelievable and there was no connection with him or anything to make you like him. The lead actor gave the weakest performance and Laurence Fishburne or Matt Dillon failed to save this movie. Sometimes there are eye openers or great moments in a movie that can not be that great ... this movie has none. If you are looking for a movie to watch while nothing peeked your interest ... do not choose this ... save your money.
