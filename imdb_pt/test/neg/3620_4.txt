I'm not going to lie and say I do not watch the show - I do. BUT it has many, many failures. 1) The boarding school is perfect. The drama is at least. Everyone is so cool to each other, you know. Let's take a look at reality. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE that ANY school is perfect like the PCA. Free Laptops for Everyone. Big dorm room. Mini fridges. If there were such a school in real life, hardly anyone would be a virgin for one. Two, everyone there is so rich, and it's weird as no one has anything stolen yet. 2) Really unrealistic characters. First things first, who in certain minds speak as they do. They talk like a perfect teenager would. Second, Logan Reese (Matthew Underwood) is an extremely rich "hot" teenage boy. My question is: why is not she almost a girl in this school on top of him? He is rich and "hot" nowadays all these girls would be after him, even if he was an idiot. Besides, Chase is the dumbest of them all. He is this shy teenager who claims not to be in love with Zoey, and overreacts to everything involving Zoey. She must be blind not to see him in love with her. Come on, Nick. I know you can do better than that. Please..
