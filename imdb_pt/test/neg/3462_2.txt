Okay, where do I start? I saw a screening a few weeks ago and was shocked at how bad this movie is. Of course, if you just LOVE Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres (bad acting) and you think they are the best TV shows on the air, then you will love this movie. I personally really like George's work and he is very talented, but comedy is not his forte. Some people are natural in comedy and I'm sure he's great and funny to work in person but comedy, he can not pull it off on the big screen. It was a cute movie, but would I pay $ 12.00 to see? H & LL not !!!! Now that I have seen it, I would not recommend anyone to spend their money. George, my friend, I love you but please do not do any more comedies? This script is missing a lot, great concept, but it just did not.
