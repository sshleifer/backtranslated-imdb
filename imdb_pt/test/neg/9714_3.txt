The only reason I watch this little-known Irish film was the question of Mike Myers having played a normal and dramatic character. Well, he could and his acting was very good, but unfortunately that was probably the only good thing I can say about this movie. At first, the film follows the life of Mickey, a 12-year-old orphan who lives with his brother and sister with his somewhat eccentric grandmother. Despite a strong language, it looks like a family movie, but after a while, it becomes clear that Pete's Meteor is hardly suitable for the drama of young audiences. And the worst is that it's a drama with so much ridiculous and even totally implausible plot. One absurd plot turns into another and all the time does not make much sense in the events on the screen. I suppose when a life drama needs a meteor or whats more something that looks like even more ridiculous spiritual content that is a pretty bad sign. The characters are not much better than a story. Despite all his troubles, the young Mickey is by no means a nice character, but of course we should somehow care about him and even feel a strong sympathy for him. Does not work Same thing with other characters. They are mostly ridiculous as the story itself with the title character (although he was not the main character) as the only bright spot. By the end of the movie I still had a strong hope that there is something behind all this improbability and absurdity. Unfortunately, even if the story writer had such intentions (and I'm sure he had) in the film they are hidden and practically imperceptible under such a strange script. Note: 3 out of 10. Those who are interested in seeing Mike Myers as a theater actor can watch Pete's Meteor for that reason but the rest of the viewers will probably be deeply disappointed.
