For any Nickelodeon fan who used to watch the network in the 80s and 90s, there was always something good. You had fun presentations like "You Can not Do That on Television." You've had odd but good shows like Pete and Pete. You still had drawings that taught morale like Doug. But just like Disney, Nickelodeon has fallen on the brink, limiting its demographic to shallow preteens and giving us poor excuses to present new, innovative shows. As I tried to watch Zoey 101, I just shook my head in disgust. <br /> <br /> The scenario could not be more false than this. Each character attends a boarding school called the Pacific Coast Academy, boasting everything a spoiled child wants. A sushi bar, laptops everywhere, flat screen TVs in every room, nice dorms to hang out, etc. The kids at this show are rarely seen in the classroom and it seems like there are no real teachers. It looks more like a place you would spend on a nice summer vacation, instead of working and studying while getting ready for college. <br /> <br /> The characters were also a factor that discouraged me. Each episode consists of boy problems, situations they have caused, and problems that must be solved. Each character is a stereotype. Zoey (Jamie Lynn) seems perfect in anything she does, and each of her friends asks for help when they feel they are in grave danger. Just getting her to have no other side. I already went to school and I can say that nobody is like that. Chase is dumb. Logan plays the tough and arrogant guy. Quinn plays a nerd who is highly unrealistic in what she does. Michael is an idiot. Lola is a clone of Nicole. Dana is well, a difficult person. Why not use some originality? Something that is unique to these characters and unlike other personalities? Is stereotyping the best that the creators of this program can create? Instead, these actors are dull personalities with the sense that there is a lack of creativity involving their roles. There is nothing here to be surprised or surprised. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but the show is clearly meant to target teenage children, facing a stage where they must evolve from being a child. be an adult. During that time, they must learn to study on their own, make their own decisions and do what is right for them. Zoey 101 does not contain any of these values. In this case, we must believe that looking good and having a stereotyped personality is all you need to succeed. I'm sorry, but that's just not true. People can not expect things to be delivered to them, like the actors in that program, and let those things stay there. If I hope things in Zoey 101 happen in real life, then I would be living in a fantasy world locked in a dream house. Nothing in this program refers to those facing health and money problems. Nor does it relate to children who want to learn something meaningful. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, Zoey 101 is a show done by Nickelodeon that just falls flat on the floor. It displays a horrible message to the kids and I think the show itself is simply inappropriate for them. Of course, it does not have morbid violence, but it teaches everything to make a kid act and look stupid. A horrible show, and it must be forgotten with the rest of the rubbish that Nickelodeon has been doing for the past few years. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10.
