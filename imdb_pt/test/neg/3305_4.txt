Bad news for anyone wanting to shoot a full parody of a Lifetime Network movie - the creators of A Deadly Encounter have done it, albeit unintentionally. All Lifetime tropes are there-a divorced mother in danger from an unbalanced pursuer, an unreliable ex-husband (who, of course, betrayed her while they were married), and a police department that rejects her complaints, The. defend himself. Especially jaw-dropping is the scene in which the heroine, after suffering a break-in and attempting to murder her mother for her seemingly omnipresent pursuer, decides to relieve stress by going shopping! Having seen firsthand the harassment of a co-worker by some idiot she met in church, I know that chasing is not a joke, but it certainly is in this movie.
