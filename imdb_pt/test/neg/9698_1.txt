NBC got a chance to make a powerful religious epic along the lines of "The Ten Commandments" and "The Greatest Story Ever", and instead they chose to make some cartoons that looked more "Waterworld" than any other thing. I do not remember a biblical passage where Lot turns into a pirate and attacks the ark, nor do I remember one in which Noah's son develops a serious friendship with an orange, nor do I remember Noah being a madman and crazy who acts like if he were commanding a naval fleet and running around shouting nautical terms like "hoisting the mainstay!" This was possibly the worst marketing decision in history. Obviously, most people watching this would be Jewish and Christian parents with their children, so why make the film so offensive to these people? If they were intentionally trying to offend you, why not advertise it that way and at least wrap it in the right audience? I hope they make a REAL Noah movie someday, one done with seriousness and thoughtfulness, one that really draws people together and makes money. Until then, do not waste your time on this crap.
