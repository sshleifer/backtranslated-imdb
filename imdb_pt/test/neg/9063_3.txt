As a serious marathon runner, I was seriously disappointed with this movie. Your target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon, or novice marathon runners. Following the stories of two first-time marathon runners, a veteran, an injured runner and two elites as they prepare for the Chicago marathon, the film devotes most of its attention to a newcomer whose story is, for lack of a better word . , boring. While I enjoyed the brief glimpses of Deena Kastor's training sessions, the brief history of the Boston Marathon and the marathon in general, let me emphasize: These were brief !! Watching some Joe Runners get ready for a Saturday race with their water bottles and talk about how they see the marathon is not inspiring, and the undeniable clich√©s about achievements and smiling runners will make you wish the movie was about one hour. If you are a marathon runner for the first time, this movie can give you a sense of "I can do it". For anybody else, run away.
