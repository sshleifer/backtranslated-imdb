The original Australian Kath & Kim is brilliant. Why do American producers need to redo and ruin another classic show? Remember the original version of "The Office" with Ricky Gervais was an absolute masterpiece, and there was no need to redo it. The producers said that the British humor of "The Office" and the Australian humor of "Kath & Kim" would not translate into an American audience ......... WHAT ??? So, basically, they're saying that Americans are too dumb and stupid to understand the jokes, so they need to redo the shows with exaggerated jokes so that Americans can understand the humor. The original Australian version of Kath & Kim is fantastic and very funny. Avoid the American version like the plague !!
