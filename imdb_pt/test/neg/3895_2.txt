I admit that I did not pay much attention to everything that is happening in this film, but to be honest, I do not think it mattered. Basically, local advisor Sidney Fiddler (Sid James) convinces incompetent Mayor Frederick Bumble (Kenneth Connor) of Firecombe to hold a beauty pageant to enhance the city's image. They face opposition from women's liberationist Augusta Prodworthy (June Whitfield) trying to sabotage the contest, but they have advertising agent Peter Potter (Bernard Bresslaw) and the owner of Palace Hotel, Connie Philpotts (Joan Sims). Hope Springs (Barbara Windsor), Paula Perkins (Valerie Leon), Dawn Brakes (Goldfinger's Margaret Nolan), Debra (Sally Geeson) and Ida Downs (Wendy Richard, EastEnders). When girls have cat fights, they attract regular residents, but after a while of some funny innuendo and William (Jack Douglas) having super-active contractions, she finally reaches the competition, and it's only after I could not be bothered. Also starring Patsy Rowlands as Mildred Bumble, Peter Butterworth as Admiral, Joan Hickson as Mrs. Dukes, David Lodge as Inspector of Police, Angela Grant as Miss Bangor, Arnold Ridley as Advisor Pratt, Robin Askwith as Larry, Patricia Franklin as Rosemary, Jimmy Logan as Cecil Gaybody and Daddy's Army, Bill Pertwee, as Charles Hawtrey had obviously left the Carry Ons, but where is Kenneth Williams? I suppose that, seeing Babs and the young lady, beautiful Pauline Fowler in a bikini, but for the sake of comedy, that fails miserably, and the excessive use of swanny whistling only gets on her nerves. Very poor!
