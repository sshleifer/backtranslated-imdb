Having broken into a secret database file to combine DNA sera, federal agent Frank Poo (Andy Garcia) learns that the only person who can save the life of his son is a psychopath, played by Michael Keaton. However, when a serum transfer at the local hospital goes awry, a Mr.Poo needs to do everything in his power to make sure the madman stays alive in order to make the transfer inevitable. By the way, his name is not really Poo, I just feel like calling him. Despite the original concept at hand, this is an implausible and tacidly uninteresting action thriller. I've never been a big fan of Andy Garcia, and if my charecter here is not so affordable, this movie ends up getting worse. sequences are treated rather disappointingly, and the ending is lousy. Having made a great villain in Pacific Heights, Keaton's psychopath villain here is a disappointment, providing a very funny and charismatic madman to be deplored. Brian Cox is also wasted as firm and outspoken Garcia.
