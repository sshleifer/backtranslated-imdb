The TV show was walking slowly and the "eccentric" characters were sometimes annoying. Only through the miracle of the rapid advance did I get through the first 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The article indicates that it is some kind of comedy / mystery, but I have not seen much either. <br /> <br /> If you really catch up after the first 2 hours, please let me know because I doubt I'll watch the rest without a recommendation. <br /> <br /> This review should be without spoilers, so I will continue in a vague way without spoiler. I found the two main characters uninteresting and unfriendly. I found myself asking, 'Would a normal adult do this?' The man with the lawnmower looking out the window was annoying and when the male lead interacted with him, he looked pathetic. Would a normal adult accept someone as annoying as he?
