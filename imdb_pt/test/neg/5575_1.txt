This has to be the MOST movement I've ever seen !!!!! It was not just annoying, it was "gagging me with a spoon" dumb. Where did you meet the actors ... at the corner of a street? Who made the special effects ... Maaco? For God's sake, I could have made a better movie with my cell phone. And if that was not bad enough, you even had extras at the end of the movie so we could see just how stupid the actors are in real life. Anyone who has done the makeup for the aliens ... must have spent $ 5 at his local used clothing store and called one day. And who in the world wrote the description of the movie on the back of the DVD should be filmed. PUHLEEZ !! It is not even 1/8% of what is described. That description is just to suck people in to buy, rent or pay a ticket to see it. No wonder there was never a trailer for it .... ya would have kicked them all out !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Bad Actors ... $ 5 <br /> <br /> Special Effects ... $ 5.50 <br /> <br /> False Fire .... $ 1.89 (lighter) Past Time Watching This Movie .... total waste! (I should sue you for my time watching)
