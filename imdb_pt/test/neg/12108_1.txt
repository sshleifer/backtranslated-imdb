If you wish to have a truly traumatic experience then this terrible movie (if you consider calling it so) is for you. A movie worse than the postman, sizzle Beach USA, Batman and Robin, Kazaam, fair game ... well, you get my point.This movie directed by the French television sensation Patrick Sebastien (Jerry Springer with an IQ of 25) can really be considered the worst movie ever made. I hope that Troma or someone in America distributes it, so that the u.s.a can feel the French stench that it is worth.
