Carlos wants to mock affirmative actions, racial stereotypes and related topics in his program, which makes him very much like Judge Thomas. He is there because of his race and then the denigrate. He can supposedly make fun of endless Mexicans because he himself is Mexican, and I would also claim that he can get away with mocking the mentally challenged because any layman may say that he is not the sharpest tool ... although he is definitely a tool of some kind. <br /> <br /> He is a comedian who, even with a team of writers, can not muster 3 minutes of genuinely funny material in a 30 minute show. I can not think of a single comedian who is regularly on TV and that Carlos can hold a candle except maybe Larry the Cable Guy (not surprisingly, he also has a show at Comedy Central to attend exactly the same audience, no doubt. <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen the big names, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, etc. Talk about comedy, you really feel the amount of work and thought that involves developing an interesting and funny comic voice All this work has been completely ignored by Mencia, his comic voice is partly stolen from other better comic books and partly hidden by his propensity to shout his racist and ungraceful snort.Mencia's show is loved by some "at least I do not suck this bad crowd" I firmly believe him to feel better about his speeches about the doldrums of society, unfortunately Carlos and his fans are part of the problem not the solution on this topic.
