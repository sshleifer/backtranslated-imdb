CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in Australia. An American by birth George Greenough surfed and photographed himself, friends and recently, dolphins, in Australia for 35 years, all using several invented cameras that he either moors in the back, on the boat or on the boat. In the mid-1970s, he joined the editor of Surf Mag and filmmaker David Elfick to create this visually interesting tale about this life and photography. The 75-minute CRYSTAL VOYAGER feature is the result. Even in the 1970s, the audience was a bit perplexed by this film, neither with a surfing film nor with a surf film, because George swims on a children's zippy board, not a real surfboard ... it made up for George's tedious droning (occasionally dry or fun that was really funny .. like almost getting on fire or falling something) with a spectacular power 'you're there' sliding through a wave that lasted 23 minutes, all ready for Pink Floyd's music. In 1974, when the Sydney Opera House opened, it also contained a cinema. Crystal Voyager was reserved as a photo of the artistic OZ and by default became a success: as the opera tickets cost much more than a movie ticket, the audience would gather to see this film as an excuse for Sydney Opera House '... so the film saw the business as a low-budget attraction for locals and tourists who wanted to tell their neighbors that they had seen a show there. This created this myth that the film was a big fan of fans and that the reputation was spreading. As a result, he joined the fancy cartoon FANTASTIC PLANET and had a race manned by the UK and Europe as a dual feature. I ran into a movie theater in the '70s and the audience was a bit puzzled by all of this. Recently George emerged from the Lord Of The Flies style with another well-photographed maritime adventure called DOLPHIN GLIDE which offers spectators a swim and swim with the wild dolphins of Byron Bay. It's a 20-minute eccentric short with an even more eccentric 20 minutes' like George made 'short. Each was greeted with a collective yawn by the media and the pub in January 2005 ... all that makes CRYSTAL VOYAGER a 'you had to have been there' by accident all those years ago. However, on a special Oz Surf night at an open-air cinema last year 2000 people appeared .... but after 2000 appear every night to see anything there during this summer season ..... then the damn thing broke another office compulsion box. How many really liked it is very open to debate. Again, they were more than likely to be simply baffled by this crazy movie with an astonishing reputation. Elfick, however, since 1975, has entered a stellar career as a major producer and director of many Australian and international films. Look for NO WORRIES or STARSTRUCK or UNDERCOVER or COB PROIT FOR FENCE or LOVE IN LIMBO for clear applause and gifts in your achievements. George, however, is still floating around somewhere far away and looking for something more to film or drop a camera.
