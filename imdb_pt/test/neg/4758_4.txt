This sparkling romantic comedy is based on the kind of story I loved as a teenager, but now I find it quite unpleasant. In the case of attachments from May to September, undoubtedly, what is in the mind of the eldest is lust or inability to face the reality of aging, or both. And the younger one is probably looking for the kind of father she (or he) did not have as a child. These underlying agendas seem more pathetic than romantic to me now; there is also something predatory about them. Dick Powell seemed a bit embarrassed - as he should have - in interpreting the older lover in this idiotic story. He was, at age fifty, trying the role of a thirty-eight-year-old man dating a teenager. But the young Debbie Reynolds was a knockout - beautiful and bold and full of vinegar - as a seventeen-year-old misbehaving presented as a kind of "gift" to the morally honest and honest writer as a subject for him to study. His witty performance twisted a better rating than this movie would deserve. Anne Francis was chosen as the beautiful but fragile bride of Powell, and skillfully dealt with her small role. <br /> <br /> Some of the dialogues were a lot of fun, too, so it's not a total waste. <br /> <br /> 5/10
