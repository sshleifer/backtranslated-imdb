Oh wow, the character shares my name first name! User! This movie is as bad as the first, if not worse. Well, at least there's a real octopus in this movie. An actual octopus that makes a better look in this movie. As good as it may be, "Longer" acting is pretty dry and hard to sit on. Just so you know, when this ninety minute movie ends, you're not only free from your couch, but you also get your ability to breathe back. Not only that, but you realize just how stupid you are and then commit suicide by realizing how horrible life is after watching this movie. Really, this shows how scary movies are desperate today, more crap like this is being held and where the hell the real masters of horror are lately? This movie should have been the last straw, so we can bring back the cinematographic geniuses of horror movies, which could make some modern horror movies and GOOD REAL ones, this movie bites.
