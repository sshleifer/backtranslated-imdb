Due to the rather dubious plate tectonics, Japan begins to slip through the sea. Initial predictions say it will take about 40 years for the country to be submerged, but a dishonest scientist adds some more dubious science and determines that it will take less than a year! The government thinks he's crazy, but the evidence soon begins to take his theory out. <br /> <br /> This great budget disaster film follows the formula of several Hollywood films of the late 90s (I presume I have not seen any of them), with the scale of disaster and tragedy bringing the nobility of the spirit human (well, Japanese) in acts of heroism and sacrifice, and proving the power of love or something. that is to say, it is as naive in its psychology as in geology ... we all know that half of the population would rape and sack the minute they thought the police were on their backs, and the other half would only panic and be useless. /> <br /> The movie has some very good special effects, but it is not as smooth or expensive as a Hollywood equivalent production would be. It's at least as nationalistic, humorless and self-conscious as the Hollywood movie, and it probably has even worse acting. She has the evil and hot girl of Battle Royale as one of the leaderships ... but she is not at all bad, and is therefore much less hot. <br /> <br /> The movie is very long in 132 minutes, and it gets worse and worse as it progresses towards a conclusion that I was in danger of vomiting. I certainly did not care at all whether or not Japan sank halfway, and well before the end I was trying to think of ways to speed up the process if I found myself in this real situation. <Br/> <br /> But, it has good special effects, and Kou Shibasaki is still very hot, so I magnanimously give ... 3/10.
