A Chinese gang attacks and erases another gang at the beginning of the film. Unfortunately, the patriarch of the winning family is killed in the process. Strangely, and for no discernible reason, the gang asks for a volunteer to blame the massacre and he leaves until the police decide to stop investigating. Now, as a man alone is responsible for about 50 deaths is beyond me, so sending this guy away just seemed silly, but that's the plot. Later, when this man comes home, betrayals and schemes have taken place - leading to nearly an hour and fifteen minutes of killing without stopping. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a Chinese martial arts movie with a lot of plot, then you should probably skip this movie, as its practically uninterrupted action and practically no plot or character development - even when compared to other martial arts films. I would estimate that 80-90% of the film is fight scenes - endless and reasonably well done fight scenes using knives. Again and again and again, fight scenes! If you want a movie with a body count, maybe running for hundreds, how people are cut, kicked and cut, then this is the movie for you. The problem was that at the end of the movie literally there were no people to kill and the movie really lost my interest! In the background it is not, but if you want to see only emotion and action, then this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> By the way, this film is set in the contemporary and no one thinks of shooting the hero until the end. And, when they FINALLY do the logical thing, it's too late and the effort is very, very bad! Logical mistakes like this and woman suicide (why ???) make this one kind of movie "turn off your brain".
