Stars: Hayden Pantierre. <br /> <br /> There have been so many movies that have exactly the same plot, and this is just a poor rehashing of it. The white girl of the populous moves to ethnic school, does not fit, soon accepted. The originality is nonexistent in this, nor even the laughter. He uses so many poorly executed old jokes that they are annoying. I do not know why they think it's a good idea to make video sequences for mediocre movies, but it's not. With that said, the good points are that all people are very competent actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> My rating: * away from home. PG-13 for Sexual Language and Humor.
