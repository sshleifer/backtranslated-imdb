I read all the other reviews that made this movie a great movie. I have not seen anything of the excellence that has been stated. I thought it was long and boring. I tried twice to watch. The first time I slept and the second time I got six minutes from the end and gave up. I suppose it was mostly my fault coming in with great expectation, but I did not think that would have ruined the movie completely for me. The movie was just bland. There was nothing spectacular or unique about it. The plot was not half bad, the action sequences were non-existent, the dialogue forced and the film continued forever. I would not recommend watching this movie.
