I'm used to being patient with movies because I generally think it usually pays off. But some works take boredom to new levels and enter the realm of provocation ... "Last year at Marienbad" comes to mind. Well, "Pola X" is not "Last year in Marienbad". I can count on one hand the number of movies I've come out with over the years. "Pola X" reached membership in that group in August. In my defense, I think I made a valiant effort to keep my ground - hoping things would change. However, I finally threw in the towel within less than 90 minutes - quite respectable under the circumstances. "Pola X" does not even come close to keeping the promise of Carax's previous work. After a hiatus of 10 years, this must have been very bitter for him. Melville is still spinning in his grave!
