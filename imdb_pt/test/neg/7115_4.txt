Just an hour ago I finished watching this, my friend. As fans of Dragonball, we think this movie is so bad that it's good. We'll say one thing: without a sixpack beers there is now way you can survive through this movie. This movie should be seen with many Dragonball fans to laugh at. The best character in the film is Lord Horn, his makeup, his laughter and his behavior, an unforgettable experience. What we liked in this movie was the fact that the island of Turtle Man was the same as in the cartoon version. We believe that the only character similar to the cartoon is the Turtle Man. He is also a sex maniac and kind of an idiot too.
