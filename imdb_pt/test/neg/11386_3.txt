Somehow, this documentary about Miles manages to include very little music and no full music. Although Miles appears in the film, 95% of the interviews are from other people, not from Miles. There are huge chronological gaps, many aspects of your life (your child prodigy, your drug addiction) are ignored or covered up, and you will learn little about what made man and his contribution to music so innovative. Skip this.
