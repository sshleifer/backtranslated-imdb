I really despair of women when they discuss this joke of a program as if it were intellectually engaging and promotes female liberation and independence. This show is the biggest insult for women alongside all these libidinous hip-hop videos. If talking like a bunch of reckless teenagers with over $ 100 in upscale restaurants, buying unnecessary clothing unnecessarily, and jumping into bed with the nearest man on the spot is considered powerful, the fate of Western women may be doomed as we speak. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> In addition to the harm it causes to the female sex, Sex and the City IS NOT FUN. Not once was it funny, captivating, exciting or original. Episodes are displayed monotonously. Each character is factory-produced mannequins that behave the same way in every episode. None of these superficial and unattractive women has evolved. Perhaps the worst is the main character Carrie Bradshaw. In addition to looking ghastly, his penchant for overanalyzing relationships is worthy of pity. On top of all this, the show portrays men as a bunch of sloppy sloppiness who can not commit to healthy relationships. Even when there is a decent man, he is somehow painted as a villain. The total lack of empathy for men is clearly the work of some "progressive" pseudo-feminists. <br /> <br /> The saddest part of the whole show is that these women live unhappy and unhappy lives. Any intelligent woman would never envy them. It's a banal show with even more banal characters. The NYC tourism council must hate the way this rubbish is showing its otherwise fine city! Luckily this train accident is over! Desperate Housewives is seen as the appropriate substitute for SATC. While DH can be quite exaggerated, at least it exploits women in more multifaceted ways. Also, treat men with more respect and it's really fun!
