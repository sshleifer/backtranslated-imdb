Why would Burt Lancaster allow himself to play a poor schnook that ends up being undermined by the femme fatale Anna Dundee, played by Yvonne DeCarlo in 'Criss Cross'? The same reason why Robert Mitchum lets himself be cast as another loser who falls for the femme fatale Faith Domergue in 1950 noir, Where Danger Lives. Perhaps both felt that it was a good way of showing that they had "reach" as actors - that playing against the type, the usual role of "tough guy" for which they were known, would enhance their image as actors who could play a role. . But the problem was that roles like Steve Thompson, the pathetic love lover on Criss Cross, did nothing to improve Lancaster's career. Not only is Lancaster completely misfiled in the role of a Thompson note, but there is something intrinsically unpleasant (and I can say, pathetic) about the protagonist of the film in the first place. <br /> <br /> "Criss Cross" is an endless slow motion movie. Among the many unnecessary scenes in the film is in the beginning: the flashback that tells of the confrontation of Thompson with Dundee of Dan Duryea in the nightclub. Everything that occurs in this initial flashback is explained later in the picture: the illicit affair between Steve and Anna, Steve's tense relationship with Martinez, the cop, and his bad blood with Dundee. If director Siodmark felt compelled to start the film with a flashback, why not keep it under three minutes? I think it would have been more effective. In Criss Cross, it takes a long time for the protagonist to compromise and get out of the 'ordinary' world of the first act. This is the scene in which he is "passing" and "bumping into" Anna in the nightclub. And notice how Siodmak spends so much time going back and forth between Anna dancing and Steve looking at her? In addition to the cross-cut, he also spends a lot of time focusing on Esy Morales and His Rhumba Band than moving the story. Until the Second Act crisis, the story drags on with Thompson having several encounters with Anna and then drowning his sorrows in his usual irrigation hole. In the middle of the Second Act, he discovers that Anna has run away and married Dundee. It is becoming clearer at this point that one of the central weaknesses of the film is that Dundee is never on screen. during most of the second act. There are no clashes between Thompson and Dundee during this time and we get the rather uninteresting machinations between the two doves. In the end (and Anna 'explains' this later to Steve), the reason for which she left was not Just because she disappeared for eight months, but also felt the pressure of Steve's mother, as well as direct threats from police officer Martinez, which implied that he would take care that she end up in the Women's Detention House. Anna comes back to Steve because she realizes she made a big mistake with Dundee? It turns out that he is beating her and she is now afraid of him. <br /> <br /> One of the silly refrains uttered by more than one character on Criss Cross is that you can never hijack an armored car. But everyone is so surprised when Steve points out that this can be done if it is an 'inner job'! You would have thought that Dundee would have known about Steve's "profession" as an armored car driver and would present it beforehand. But of course Steve has to make the proposal that Dundee do not kill him after discovering his affair with Anna (if they are so afraid of being caught, why Steve and Anna meet in their apartment where Dundee can find them so easily) . ?) I really liked Finchley (played by Alan Napier), the 'brain' of the operation. Dundee is so dumb that he has to hire this ex-alcoholic teacher who charts the assault on a map. Oh, there is the question of looking for the ingredients to build the gas pumps used during the robbery and of course Finchley is also good at it! <br /> <br /> The only really well done scene in the entire movie is the armored car. theft. The editing was very good, as it showed the increasing action of an assault that went wrong. As gas bombs explode, the brutality of the gang is shown in relief as Dundee assassinates the innocent Armored Car Guard. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film is as prolonged as the rest of the film. Why does it take so long for one of Dundee's henchmen to kidnap Thompson? There's that nurse, so the fool is waiting outside, so he walks in and pretends to be a friend, Steve falls asleep and finally after he wakes up, the fool kidnaps him. <br /> <br /> When Steve finally meets Anna at the house, we wonder how Anna got her hands on the money. Did she somehow steal from Dundee after the robbery when he left for dinner? This is never explained. Even worse, Anna suddenly becomes the femme fatale out of nowhere. Rather, his selfishness and attraction to Dundee can be explained by his perceived rejection at the hands of Steve and Martinez's threats. But after returning to Steve because she is afraid of Dundee, she will inexplicably see him when he is most vulnerable. Just as there is 'instant coffee', you have 'instant femme fatale'. In "Film Noir - An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style" by Silver and Ward, the authors hailed "Criss by Cross" as "one of the most tragic and appealing of film noir." I beg to differ. To have a tragedy, you need characters that have great depth and, to be convincing, you need a story that is plausible. Criss Cross has none. It is an overestimated "B" movie that somehow found itself in the pantheon of art noirs. Once again, the herd mentality triumphed in the evaluation of the old images.
