Me and a friend rented this movie the other day. At first glance, it seemed to be another teen movie, which was also what we expected, being fans of simple horror and comedy. <br /> <br /> It looks like the movie is designed to disappoint the viewer as much as possible. It accelerates quickly into something that holds a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it never gets off the ground. We'd been watching for something that seemed like an hour, when I finally half-asleep, I managed to say, "Man, this movie sucks." It was only 35 minutes, actually ... Cara nodded. <br /> <br /> The problem is: the movie just is not funny. It was, no doubt, supposed to be funny, but it failed. He failed in a way that made me sad. That kind of reminds me of myself. I had the potential to be anything I wanted, and instead I ended up watching cheap horror / funny movies all the time. I pity the creators of this film from the bottom of my heart. It's so sad. All this potential ... and nothing.
