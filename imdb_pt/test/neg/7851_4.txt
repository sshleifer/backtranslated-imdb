The German actor Paul Muni, who never wanted to see a scene he did not want to chew, is "blackface" to play a humble Mexican immigrant who lives in Los Angeles and works in the world. If this shocking vehicle reminds someone of Al Pacino's minstrel performance as an uneducated Cuban in the remake of SCARFACE, do not be too surprised. The characters are very similar, and both are very surprised when the script asks. Hispanics everywhere should be very offended by Muni's overzealous performance as this giddy Mexican living the American dream, and the consequences will be condemned. I think Benicio Del Tororo's grandfather was not available. Bette Davis, young and bleached, plays one of Muni's love interests; she eventually goes mad for the sake of Mr. Meh-hee-can Muni. An absolute hoot, Davis is the only reason to watch this racially offensive claptrap. There is an absolute delirium near the end when Muni asks the girl of his dreams to marry him - a white procreation girl with one of those excited accents, similar to the 1930s scenes that Hollywood loved so much - and she calls him wild and crude, of "a different tribe". Muni immediately becomes Mr. Hyde and pursues her to an untimely death. In the final scene, a repentant Muni tells his sober-faced priest that he is returning to his own people, his own kind. End of the film Finis That's all she wrote. Muni would have hired a generic Mexican as a driver to study the speech pattern and physical habits of this exotic creature. Yowza!
