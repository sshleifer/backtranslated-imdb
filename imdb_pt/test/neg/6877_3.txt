Here he is. A new horror icon for the new millennium. Better than Freddy. More dangerous than Jason Vorhees. More evil than Michael Myers. Hard to believe, I know. But his time is here ... <br /> <br /> Ray The Prick. <br /> <br /> Yes, the antagonist, Ray, is a complete idiot. This is partly because of the naughty things he does. Also because he has a scar (oh, scary) on his face. But mostly because Ray The Prick was milked. <br /> <br /> Yes, Ray does not channel evil. He does not even become accursed, not even by a voodoo spell. No, Ray The Prick was milked. As DeNiro once said, "You can milk anything with nipples." And Ray was milked. Of evil. <br /> <br /> How do you order the harm you ask? Snake nipples, I reply. Snake nipples. <br /> <br /> Why do you ask Ray? Because he's an idiot, I say. Capital P. <br /> <br /> Watch out for New Line Pictures' extravaganza titled "Freddy Vs. Ray O Prick." <br /> <br /> Do you think your new savior of terror was Jeeper The Creeper? Well, not anymore, because Ray The Prick is here. And I'm scared. <br /> Pity about the quality of the film without atmosphere, PG-13, not original, because Ray is a star.
