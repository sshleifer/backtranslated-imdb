There is a special paradise reserved for people who make the world laugh. Next to Chaplin, Stan and Ollie, the Marx Bros. space and ..... (fill in your own special favorites) should be made for everyone who is connected with "Airport 80 - Concorde, the Movie". Robert Wagner, in particular, exceeds all expectations, giving the comedy performance of a lifetime. I never would have thought he had this in him. The only way he could have been funnier would have been to have worn a red nose and a swirling bow tie. British spectators will recognize the fat Cannon and Ball pretending to be a Russian athlete, a good trick if he could have gotten it, but, tragically, he could not. I have a 14-year-old more athletic and almost as funny labrador. . George Kennedy - bless him - has a part that requires him to speak and move at the same time, and my goodness he triumphs! Brow wrinkled with effort he utters a timeless dialogue, each word affectionately polished in a sheen like Coward's. Only once in twenty years does Hollywood make a movie like "Airport 80". Every year hard work and struggle, sweat, tears, lessons with Lee Strasberg, living out of suitcases, born in a trunk etc etc, everything comes to fruition. A work of art is created that will last as long as there are films and machines to show them. I think I'm ready for my medication now.
