What could have been a great movie about the late poker pro Stu "The Kid" Unger turned into a disappointment. <br /> <br /> You can tell the filmmakers that they were working on a short sequel. expenses. Everything seems filmed on the cheap. Timelines looked a little out of me. <br /> <br /> The participation of Michael Imperoli of the Sopranos was also a bad choice. He looked too old to play baby-faced Stu, he looked very healthy to a cocaine addict (if you look at the filming of the 1997 WSOP Main Event, the real Stu was so skinny and he had practically no nose a lot of cocaine) so he wore those sunglasses to hide them), and I kept waiting for Adriana to come and scream "Chris-tu-phur !!!" <br /> <br /> They also ignored the fact that he had a son from the previous relationship of Angie who committed suicide in the late 80's. <br /> <br /> Every time I saw Vincent Van Patten appear , I kept thinking he was going to announce "Show songs coming out of Stu's head." as it does in the WPT. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for real Stuey scenes, check out ESPN Classic because they've repeated the 1997 WSOP Main Event from time to time. Or try YouTube. Avoid this movement as a bad beat.
