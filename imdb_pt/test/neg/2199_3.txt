"The Net" is one of those movies that will not stay in your mind until the next hour. Well ... Only if you keep thinking how bad it is. It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable waste. One of those adjectives I used above is the reason that made me add 1/2 a star to what I would have given. So it's a case of "so bad, it's good"? No. It's a case of "so bad it's laughable". <br /> <br /> Bullock in a very bad performance (surprise!) plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time. She works from home, has no friends, and her neighbors do not know her. Suddenly she finds herself involved in dangerous situations, after her colleague dies and the same thing happens to her. Her identity, bank accounts, etc., etc., etc., are all erased, and she is now Ruth Marx. The conspiracy involves even the government and ... Wait! Have not we seen this before? Yes, thousands of times. "The Net" tries to be modern, to be the picture of the 90s, showing the computer as a villain. Great deal! It's a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes. Take the scene of the boat accident. I just laughed when the camera started to slow ... <br /> <br /> What makes it even worse here is Sandra Bullock. How horrible she is! Has she ever made a decent movie? "A Time to Kill," fine. But she's still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face movements in each of her photos. <br /> <br /> The advantages and disadvantages of the computer have already been shown in "2001: A Space Odyssey", the best, most intelligent and complex film ever made. No need to compare "The Net" with this, is ...? <br /> <br /> The only reason to see "The Net" is to laugh, as I said, and see what it has tried to be. The results, well, are a shame. <br /> <br /> DELETE this movie from your mind!
