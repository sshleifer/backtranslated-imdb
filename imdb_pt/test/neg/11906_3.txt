There is a certain irony in a parody of the Gothic genre being transformed into a confusion of cliches by filmmakers who either had no idea of ​​the purpose of the story or simply did not care. All the features of his common family movie are younger siblings - a grumpy teenager who does not want to move, unfriendly parents unable to see the apparition and, of course, a romantic subplot. The film has very little in common with Wilde's original story, which was written largely to ridicule the melodramatic gothic novels that were the fashion of the day. If Wilde saw this version, he would probably laugh-and of course he would write a parody. We can only hope that the children who attended this mass-produced paparazzi have finally discovered the intelligence and brilliance of the original version.
