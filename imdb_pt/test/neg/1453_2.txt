This is a very strange product from Hollywood. Apparently, it was not well tested because the actors who have filmed the credits were edited completely out of the film, which means that a rushed job was done. It seems to have been ripped from Demme's normally competent hands and simply thrown away. On the other hand, it is so totally devoid of substance that perhaps nothing could save it. It does not have a real center, narratively or in time. Although I say that the race time is 92 minutes, it seems like I remember having finished abruptly, around 80 minutes. It was over before it even started. It's practically laughable. <br /> <br /> The merits of the "Matthew Modine image" were as illusory as the image of Luke Wilson is now.
