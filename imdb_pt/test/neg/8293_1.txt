This movie spends most of the time preaching that is the script that makes the film, but apparently there was no script when they shot that loss of time! The trailer makes it a comedy, but the film can not decide whether it's a comedy, a drama, a novel or an action movie. Press releases indicated that Shatner and Hamlin made this film because they loved the script (what were they thinking?). If you like William Shatner (I see), see "Free Enterprise".
