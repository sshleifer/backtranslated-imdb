The only reason I rented this movie was that Val Kilmer rarely appears in a bad movie. There is, of course, a first time for everything. In many ways, this film proves that aaters are not as easy to do as we think, especially by foreign directors. The only one that went unnoticed was probably Sergio Leone, but even his films lacked something indefinitely innate in our American psyche and panacea. American actors in Clint Eastwood and Henry Fonda helped. I can now see why they changed the original title from "Summer Love" to "Dead Man's Bounty". That in itself tells me that the producers and the director had no basic understanding of a western except for those common scenes of shoot'em up and violent themes. I suppose we can say the same thing about the American directors who try to make a Polish film while failing miserably in the process.
