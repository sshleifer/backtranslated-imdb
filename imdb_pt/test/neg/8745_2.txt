I suppose you could say that this movie has a grain of potential, but nothing more, because the kid made the filmmakers ruin everything. The plot is almost incomprehensible, the rhythm is lethargic and the acting is pathetic. And what the hell is a commercial mouse? Worst of all is that the climax of this film is the anticlimax of all anticlimax; Also, the title does not look even remotely accurate. The only redeeming feature of this movie is the beautiful dark-haired woman ... well, the blonde was beautiful too, but she was annoying and not as pretty as the brunette. Anyhoo, as with many movies, this is one to be seen only on MST3K.
