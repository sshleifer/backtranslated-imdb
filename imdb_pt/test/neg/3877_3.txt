I do not care about sequences; sometimes they are better than the original. However, often the originals are best left alone ... especially when you can not duplicate the cast. One of the big reasons for "The Magnificent Seven" was such a hit was the very popular cast. <br /> <br /> This is hardly the "magnificent seven," when only Yul Brynner returns as one of the members of that famous group. group in "The Magnificent Seven". With six of the seven faces absent and replaced by lesser-known actors, it loses its appeal quickly. In other words, with the exception of Brynner, these guys have no charisma! This is a kind of sports championship putting on the field all but one substitutes. <br /> <br /> Brynner is good, again: fun to watch, fun to hear with that deep and distinctive voice of him, but the story, not just the rest of the crew is lame. This movie should never have been made. In the original, we care about the "seven"; here, we could not care less.
