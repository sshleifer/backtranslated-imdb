If it were not for Colin Firth, the movie would be ready for the trash can! So foreseable, so silly and so badly acted !! Only Colin Firth, as always, shines through this mess as a single light at the end of the tunnel! <br /> <br /> The worst was the performance of Jennifer Rubin, for sure! Maybe it was because of this script (did they actually write one or were they made "on the way" ???). <br /> <br /> To sum up a long story: <br /> <br /> It's a must-see just for Colin Firth Fanatics (like me), since he's incredibly sexy and good quality (fighting this script " mentally challenged "). These minutes of Colin-Screen-Time make up this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Do not spend too much money on this, though. Try to see or get as cheap as possible (an auction or something like that) and then stick to the scenes of Colin Firth. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film can be dangerous to someone's mental health.
