I am atheist. For me, history and truth mean a lot. <br /> <br /> This movie is made after a novel published in 1921, which is still being updated to this day as if it were a history book. Well, it's not. The film is about the version of the novels of the 50s. Some actors were GREAT, but that does not cover the plot. <br /> <br /> In short, the man invents a super bomb so God and his friends can hold a court to see if they should intervene. The analogy of the devil persecutes man, and for defense we have the spirit of man. What is the spirit of man, anyway? And why was the first accused Adam? Eventually, you just get US Christian propaganda in a 5th century history book of the time. Although other religions are mentioned, only European Christianity is exploited. <br /> <br /> First, we have the history of the caveman. Women are thin stereotypes of damsels in distress. The true cave women were as strong as men and equally resilient. Difficult times, difficult life, adapt and survive. All this is diluted by mid-century stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Next, we have the first pyramid building in Egypt. Today we see a different story and we know that there were far fewer deaths and ordinary citizens at work as well. The loss of the aforementioned amount of many lives in the process would have been a national disaster and no one would later try to defeat it. As if there was only ONE pyramid building. <br /> <br /> The part about Moses and a true god was as if the Spanish Inquisition was asking well. The Inquisition itself was never even mentioned in the film. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Helen from Troy's cruel evil was so vile that I did not see why so many were interested In her In reality, they were only soldiers, following orders from commanders, who were "discussing" a political power issue. She was just an excuse. <br /> <br /> The story of Cleopatra was that I saw that this film was imprecise and full of propaganda. Here the brother was very young. She was not poison-obsessed, polite enough to restore library contents, and politically competitive to drag Egypt down the earth. <br /> <br /> The part with Nero and the prayer of the Christians in a cave were disgusting. Yes, Rome was burned down. Yes, there was persecuted Christianity. But the way they portrayed it was as if the Colosseum was built and there was no Vespasian to rebuild Rome. Attila, the Hun, appears suddenly and then we jump to King Arthur. Crusades are mentioned with a minimum of bloodshed. And there is no mention of the crusades east of Russia that ended in an ironic battle. The knights went home and began to amuse themselves for fun. MANY things are put up as if there was no pluming, hygiene and internal plagues. <br /> <br /> So they cover Joan of Ark, where she always has lots of makeup and looks like a prince. Territorial policy was replaced by an unjust court. The sidesaddle alone on a stool makes me wonder how anyone could go here. Burning here, I wanted to scream "Hura! Now die! Special cheap effects, where is the fire?" <br /> <br /> By the time they mentioned Leonardo, I was getting tired of the movie. Columbus, Spanish slaughter of America, shouting at Queen Elisabeth "kicking the Spanish armada" and so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> The only reason I wanted to see this movie was the fact that it was the last with all 3 brothers Marks. And all they got was the scene with Manhattan and Indians. Fun, but no more than a smile. <br /> <br /> The witch hunt is briefly mentioned as well as the plagues (after rebirth). When they begin to portray revolutions, things spoil powerful and anarchists. The US revolution was haunted by the French revolution. Oppression and incompetence are bad, but you can not just blow the path of anger, you must replace it with something. So they replaced the French monarchy with the new French monarchy. So we have Napoleon and his ambitions to go to India by land. But they substitute their motives for unity and bind it only by the title of "Emperor." The conquests in Europe, defeat in Russia are ransacked for Waterloo. <br /> <br /> The US civil war, the wealthy English inventors (Tesla not included). "Mr. Watson, come here, I want you" almost made me laugh for teenage reasons. Technological hard work was diluted until the final discovery and misuse of comedy. <br /> <br /> Eventually, after 85 minutes, we arrived at world wars and organized crime, but none of its horrors. Adolph's words "I invade Russia. This is my last territorial claim" was hilarious. It was his last territorial claim. <br /> <br /> To build the suspense, God puts a countdown clock to the Last Judgment on the "wall" for the final words. Can not all the powerful stop the universe for a second? There was no need for the chase speech, but the defense made one last pitch. <br /> <br /> Finally, we see the man of tomorrow as the ultimate defense. Apparently a paradoxical man, because the bomb was about to go today. His toys are a music box in the form of a gun and a pencil box sword. Now is this so wrong? Pens and pencils have attracted so many gun designs that their death count exceeds the atomic bomb. And making music from a gun? Eluded selfish generals make music from the fire of the weapon. So the man of tomorrow is already a monster. <br /> <br /> As I see it, all the defense had to do was blame the devil as the real conspirator for the end of man and case closed. And honestly, compared to all the barbaric things that our ancestors did centuries ago, we are very human in painless traitors these days. To sum it all up, I'm going to cite only the "Jaynestown" episode of "Firefly": "It's my estimate that every man has a statue made of him was some kind of son of a bitch or another. about you, Jayne. It's about what they need. "
