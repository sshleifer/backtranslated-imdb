This is so overly cliché that you will want to turn it off after the first 45 minutes. The beginning is very interesting, with a fair going on and someone is dead. This movie would have been better, set in this configuration. <br /> <br /> So, Jill Johnson is a depressed sprinter with boyfriend problems. I do not see the point of adding your separation with your boyfriend occurs in any of the events of the story. <br /> <br /> Since Jill came home late, her father sent her to take care of Mandrakis in his glamorous house in a deserted lake. The children are asleep and the maid is cleaning, another empty house next to the son who is in college. OK. <br /> <br /> After about half an hour walking around the house alone, she has some problems. Ooh, scary. Which your friend comes to the rescue, to come with a couple of high school lines about "love" and anything else. The friend leaves and goes to her car. Then she gives up the keys. Uhhh ... then the music! DumDumDum ..! She fumbles to get them and gets into her car. Which, of course, does not begin. How cliché is that? So ... she disappears = D Jill, alone again. UH. (Most of this movie is with her alone, so there is not much dialogue) So more trouble, she calls the police. Who says they can not help you, but call back if she has more problems. <br /> <br /> So, she suspects that her boyfriend is calling, or her boyfriend friends are calling. They were only once. How should this be so scary? Oh, and did I mention it? Your friend just came in the caller ID and a scary man voice pops up. She gets all scared and shyt. <br /> <br /> Yes, then skip this. She sees that the light in Mandrakis' son's home continues. Then she runs through the forest with music as her companion and enters. Bleheh. <br /> <br /> IT'S SO CRYING I WANT TO CONTINUE !!!!!!!!!
