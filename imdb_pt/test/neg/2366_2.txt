A good old boy movie is almost mandatory for moonlight, car chases, a plot that has a vague resemblance to the "plot" and at least one very pretty girl in the country, barefoot in short shorts and a low top. The pretty girl is here (dressed in designer jeans) - but the country prerequisites stop there. Jimmy Dean is a natural as a sausage spokesman, but as an ex-tough sheriff, he appears quite fast. Big John is great, but he is not convincing with the "bad" part of his nickname. Jack Elam, with his messy eyes, is a joke, as usual, and Bo Hopkins plays that same part for decades; Ned Beatty also does her part in a small role ... but there is NO HISTORY. It smells more like an episode of In The Heat Of The Night than a movie. Cornpone cornball with easily predictable feeling. Perhaps the most glaring problem with this film is Charlie Daniels singing the theme. You know the one; became famous for ... Jimmy Dean.
