The director looks like a good, solid man. Your parents are struggling with the same problems that we all deal with. They deviated from each other. They loved each other. They misunderstand one another. And the poor public has to go through ninety minutes of what is possibly the trials and tribulations of one of the more boring families that have ever left Long Island. <br /> <br /> There are few interesting options in this documentary - music is banal, filming is uninspired, and the story is the same that unfolded on every Birch Street in every city in America. I do not want to sound too harsh - rarely has a more well-meaning documentary been made. The director is the kind of man you'd like to be friends with. You just wish he had fought so much by presenting the material as his parents did keeping their marriage alive.
