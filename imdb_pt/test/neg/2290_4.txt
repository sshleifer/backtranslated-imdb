It's not as bad as some people say ... This is an unofficial Bond movie and a remake of "Thunderball" written by Kevin McClory (co-producer on "Thunderball"). Well, the cast is very interesting, Maria Brandauer is a great villain, Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera are like the "original" Bond girls, plus Rowan Atkinson and an Edward Fox, who looks really refreshing "M" Role. In fact, the whole movie is refreshing and gives new impulses. Sean Connery makes this again confident and charming, except that he seems a little too old. But alright, he's the original Bond and it was great to see him again in this role. The sites are also typical - Bahamas, France, etc. The only thing that really fails is the musical score, the song "Never Say Never Again" is O.K., but the theme song is missing. All in one, a good attempt to make a difference from Roger Moore's comic and silly movies like "Moonraker." Only if there was another story, "Thunderball" was a great movie and did not really need a remake
