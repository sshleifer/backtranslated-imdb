My god how bad this is. Who is this impostor pretending to be Ali G? Avoid this at all costs. It replaces the clever and multi-layered satire and humor of your show with humor down and out of the bathroom. <br /> <br /> This was obviously an attempt to make him known in the United States before launching his show there on HBO. One commentator here argues that we did not judge the film about the merits of the show because of the difference in the media. While it is true that the standard format of the program could never have been transferred to the cinema, Sacha Baron Cohen could have guaranteed the clever use of his comic style in a more conventional movie plot. Instead, we have this mess, which in all honesty has nothing to do with Ali G, except for the packaging. <br /> <br /> Terribly disappointing. Go look for the DVD from Innit, Aiiii or Bling Bling for some real Ali G.
