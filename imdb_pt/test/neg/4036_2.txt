I had the terrible misfortune of having to see this "movie b" in its entirety. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is --- save your time and money !!! This has to be the worst movie b of all time, nor should it be called movie b, more like a movie f! Because he fails in every respect that makes a good movie: the story is not interesting, all the actors are paper thin and unconvincing, have a bad direction and the action sequences are so fake that it's almost funny. ..... almost. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of shit from a line that no respectable person could find fun at all. <br /> <br /> This film is supposed to be aimed at men, but all women are so unattractive, especially that old wrinkled thing that comes to an end. They try to look sexy in those strange and horrible costumes and they fail miserably !!! <br /> <br /> Even some of the most ridiculous b-movies will still give you some laughter, but this is too painful to watch !!
