Even Disney is guilty of dairy cow disease, following the bustling success of The Love Bug in 1968, the mouse house was replaced by Herbie Rides Again, Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo and Herbie Goes Bananas. No sequel capturing the charm and harmless appeal of The Love Bug in '68, we find race driver Jim Douglas and his helper Wheely Applegate, joining Herbie at the Monte Carlo Rally. Of course things out of the race begin to take over priorities, they mingle in a diamond robbery and Herbie falls in love with another car! Car stunts are naturally nice and easy on the eye, and it would be rude of me to really vent poison on such a friendly piece of fluff, it is just that the movie goes nowhere fast and in person now I can see it for the coin motivated piece of work that is. Still you get to see Herbie take a shower, thwart the bad guys and of course dance for the woman in your life, then something for everyone I think ................. 4/10.
