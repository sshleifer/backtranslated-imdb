Exploration of abysmal pulp adventure in the jungle woman genre. Lousy audio, thankfully, obscures idiotic dialogue. And it's very interesting for a movie about people who do not speak English. There is no adventure to be found here; is a jungle adventure with cliffhangers and a wildlife attack that happens in flashback. <br /> <br /> Three pale-faced doods roam the African jungle and find warlike tribes hungry for men. These wild women only advanced out of the Stone Age to invent make-up, shoes, and underarm hair removal technology. Despite their desperation for "hus-bahnd," the ladies insist that they will fight the men and burn the weak. <br /> <br /> The only thing of interest, as if there was any doubt, is the assortment of young women dressed in cleverly crafted animal skins like the bathing suits of 1951. A lot of wrestling and bad dancing mixed with stripless 1950s stripper moves. No nudity or considerable violence. On the other hand, you may be humming the native song for days.
