This is horrible movie. is passed dumb. First, the only thing the twins care about is how they look and what boys like them. they are in the 7th year. not to say I'm a prude or anything, but sends the wrong message to girls of all ages. being beautiful and popular is not everything. but that's what the twins make out. The plot is even worse. the girl's grandfather is the ambassador (sp) of France. He has a co-worker taking the girls around Paris and they meet two "handsome French boys" with motorcycles. They sneek off to meet the boys start to really like them ETC ..... they know a supermodel in the process and they go around paris with strangers who they think are cute. Need I say more? this movie can be cute for children 8 and 9 years old. the twins play losers who want boyfriends. does makes the wrong idea for the girls. the movie itself is not great either. I would not recommend this to anyone. I give passport to Paris 2/10
