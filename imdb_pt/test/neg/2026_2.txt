The beginning of the narration sounds like 'The Wind' may be a rather intriguing film, but as the story unfolded, I knew it was from there. The main things about this movie that exploded were the terrible acting works that all the main characters did, (except for some scenes involving the internal turmoil of Mic), there was a total lack of character development and absolutely no point for the plot - What were the writers thinking? <br /> <br /> Michael Mongillo won two 'horror / science fiction' awards for 'The Wind'. THERE IS? What was so scary about this movie? ANYTHING! Except for the bad video scenes of Moreno 2, the rest was more 'made for t.v's suspense' - nor would it need to be edited. If you want a much better movie about 'murder among friends' rent 'Shallow Grave' instead. <br /> <br /> 'The Wind' * / *****
