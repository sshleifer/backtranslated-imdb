Absolutely inane film starring Abbott and Costello. Even our little kids would grow angrier with this whole mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> Abbott as Dinklepuss. What a look he had on his face. Of course, he had to be part of this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Did anyone realize that Costello's mother in the movie sounded and looked like Fay Bainter? Fortunately, for Mrs. Bainter, she was not in the movie. <br /> <br /> There's really no enthusiasm for the kids. The jokes, if any, are quite obsolete. Some of the songs are well done, but the lyrics are ridiculous.
