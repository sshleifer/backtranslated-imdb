I'm a fan of bad horror movies of the 50s and 60s - movies so ridiculous and silly that they're good for laughing. So because of that, it's only natural that I choose this movie - especially since, with John Agar, it was pretty much guaranteed that it was bad. Unfortunately, although it was a bad movie, it was the worst kind of bad movie - dull and unbelievable dull. At least with stupid and exaggerated bad movies, you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and the terrible direction and acting. Here, you never really see much of the monster (mainly due to the darkness of the print) and the acting, while bad, is lower low energy ... apathetic and bland. <br /> <br /> The movie Begins with some young adults going to the hollow of Satan for the neck. Well, considering the name of the place, it is not surprising when they are found later chewed to pieces! Duh ... do not go to Satan's Hollow !! Well, there are reports of some sort of heavenly object, so what do the teens go for? Yes, have a dance party - a very, very, very slow party, where the kids almost dance in slow motion. So it's up to the sheriff (Hagar) and his men to ensure that teenagers can dance in peace without fear of chewing. <br /> <br /> As for the monster, it's a guy in a gorilla costume with a silly mask. - A bit like the monster on ROBOT MONSTER. Not exactly original and not exactly high tech. To make matters worse, he makes little noises and moves very, very slowly - so slow that even the burly teen could easily overtake him! The way he can repeatedly kill is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Overall, too boring - even if you are a fan of bad movies.
