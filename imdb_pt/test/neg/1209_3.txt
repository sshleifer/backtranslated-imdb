It's hard to believe that such a bad movie has not been produced once but four times! Most movies require a certain "suspension of reality" to take advantage of, but that takes it too far. The basic scenario is an Air Force pilot shot down over a "Middle East" country. The US government risks regaining it, prompting the pilot's son (Doug Masters) to attempt a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with the movie is that it portrays the US Air Force as a colossal joke. In the film, you'll see that Doug and his friends at the air base manage to secure two F-16s, all ammunition, fuel, Intel for the mission, and so on. Security on this basis seems to be a joke. No one seems to have a problem that a sixteen-year-old is fully qualified to fly an F-16! <br /> <br /> If that were not enough, you would think that the producers would at least try to get the ammunition right, since people like to see things "explode". Not so! Several times in the movie, Doug fires AIM-9 missiles at ground targets. AIM stands for "Air Intercept Missile", meaning a weapon used to attack targets in AIR. It also fires 15-20 missiles, where the maximum that an F-16 can withstand is 6 AIM-9. The film also lacks continuity. You'll see the aircraft configured with one set of ammunition, and in the next scene, you have a totally different ammunition pack. Plus, 20MM does not completely destroy everything it touches! An F-16 will have 500 rounds of 20MM, and is mainly used for self-defense. <br /> <br /> I could go on forever with holes, flaws and completely wrong information from the movie, but I won. It annoyed you. If you're in the mood for a good Air Force movie, your choices are pretty slim. Most military films are about the army, the navy, or the Marines. Until Hollywood can feature an Air Force movie on the lines of 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'A Few Good Men', we will be forced to watch films like the 'Iron Eagle' series. <br /> <br />
