Film blood and chocolate is NOTHING like book. The plot changed completely and whoever chose the cast had to read the book. First, the girl is not an introvert that Aden is. Vivian was the one who chased Aden. His mother would have survived and would be the only one after Gabriel. Astrid was the one who made all the murders along with Ralf, a Vivian ex. Gabriel is not old. He is old. And Aden did not get Vivian in the end, Gabriel did. The title came from Vivian comparing Aden's kisses (sweet as chocolate) and Gabriel (delicious as blood). She got blood because she promised more and he understood her more. That reminds me, Gabriel is not against humans like in the movie. He just avoids intimacy with them because they have hurt him in the past. Really the book is soooo better than the movie. But if you want to see running, a montage of dating and many jumps. So this is the movie to watch.
