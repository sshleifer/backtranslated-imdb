I realized when watching this kind of movie that I do not like them very much. Caged Women is more a 'women in prison' movie and like most of the rest of the genre; the plot is completely abandoned in favor of simply showing naked women. Now do not misunderstand me; I love naked women, but I also like that there is some kind of plot to go with nudity, and since this film has only the basic theme 'women are in prison' (as well as the essential escape, of course), I stayed a little bored before the end. The movie is good because there is only one time when women are wearing clothes, but that is the only positive element. Director (and writer, ha ha) Erwin C. Dietrich has fun showing close-ups of the naked female body, but it's never too erotic. The director was the producer on several trash films, including some directed by Jess Franco. In my opinion, he should devote himself to production, since his writing skills are non-existent, and he does not seem to know how to film a sex scene. This kind of material is pretty dry most of the time, but I think Franco could have done more of it. Overall, this may be enough for people who really like this sort of thing; but I can not say I enjoyed it.
