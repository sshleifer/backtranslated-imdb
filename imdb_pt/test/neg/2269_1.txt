This is not a good movie. I can not believe that after fifty years, this film will receive the National Award when there are so many Marathi movie jewels that have been systematically ignored. This is a very overrated movie that was very lucky. It was given the National Award, collected the popular opinion and now will represent India before the international public. Anyone with a marginal understanding of good quality filmmaking will know very well that it will not even be nominated for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> I can not figure out where to start. There are so many things that are wrong and missing in this movie that is incredible that has been considered for the National Award. That this movie is awarded as the best movie coming out this year will show the biased judgment of people who dominate Indian cinema and the tiny understanding of people who blindly appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> The theme chosen is great. Is it important that such films be made? but only by people who are able to deal with them. Sandeep Sawant is not up to the task? not even close. Her direction is nervous, confused. There is no clear thought process. He tries, but fails to explore the depth of the characters, especially the grandfather. He is not able to show the initial horror, the anxiety, and then the hopeless detachment, and yet the impassable courage of the grandfather. He wastes our time at the hospital when it should have been shown the couple of time we spent together. He is trying to cram everything without any priority. He does not understand his subject properly and this really counts against him. <br /> <br /> However, the cast also does not help Sawant. Worst work? Amruta Shubash. She is a terrible actress and a lousy choice for this or any sensible acting job. How did she get 'Tee Phulrani'? Extreme luck and / or extremely influential and / or extremely unfortunate casting. That said, she goes out of her way to do a terrible job even in this movie. Should your MSW act have gone to the most responsible actor? Sonali Kulkarni. Amruta Subhash did not understand that. The work of the MSW is under constant emotional stress and yet it is important to design a calm and strong exterior, which is comforting for patients. Asawari, by Amruta Subhash, seems even more frightened and in need of support than the people for whom she works. <br /> <br /> Second worst? Arun Nalawade. I've never seen a more wooden face in the Marathi film industry (however, it's plentiful and everywhere in today's Hindi cinema). He is the producer and so he chose himself; without second thought, without consideration. Any good actor would have jumped to play this role, even if he had to pay the producer to do it, but Arun Nalawade would not let anyone else do it. More ambitious and obtuse, he helps to bring down the film more than all the others together. His performance lacks research and even basic acting skills. My choice for this role would be Vikram Gokhale. <br /> <br /> The music is uninspired. The film is technically lacking. It could very well have been a work of the FTII project. <br /> <br /> From the top; brilliant performance by Ashwin Chitale. It is incredible that such a young boy can give such a respectable performance. He has put many of today's actors to shame. Unintentionally, perhaps, but he brought his own innocence to his character and this made for a memorable performance. In addition, Sandeep Kulkarni really gave a very convincing performance. Really put in all your efforts and shows. The script is also well written. <br /> <br /> The tight budget can not be a valid argument to praise this movie. Lack of funds for all Marathi movies. Cricket and Hindi movies consume all the money and the rest are left to fight for errands. It is a sad state of affairs, but still not enough reason to praise any immature film that comes out. 'Doghi' was brilliant movie and was also done on a tight budget. Doghi also lacked technique, but it was well researched and well done. It was abundant in detail and supported by wonderful performances from all and that enriched the cinema. Why did not he receive the praise he deserved? ??? only proves my point of prejudiced judgment. <br /> <br /> Lack of research and not funds, is what makes 'Shwaas' such a bad movie.
