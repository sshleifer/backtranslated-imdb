This movie is, in all likelihood, the worst movie ever made. It's certainly the worst I've seen, and I've seen MANY bad movies. <br /> <br /> In this, nothing interesting happens throughout the movie. One can literally start the movie, take a nap and wake up safe, knowing that nothing interesting has happened while you are asleep. And I've seen this movie three times, staying awake all over. I feel I should be congratulated. <br /> <br /> The film goes as one might expect, according to a formula, without variation. Hunters capture baby bigfoot, are killed by their parents, and the next town enters a killer frenzy. This is surprisingly annoying for a Troma release. <br /> <br /> So do yourself a favor and skip this movie. If you have to see it, you will understand why.
