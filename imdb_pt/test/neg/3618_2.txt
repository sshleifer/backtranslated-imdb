I usually like movies about animals or reptiles turning against humans that threaten the environment, but I have to say that Snake Island was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> The premise is interesting, a group of people including a writer played by William Katt goes to an island called duh, you guessed "Snake Island", and knows what the island does of its name. That's one thing I'm going to give this movie, there are snakes, lots and lots of snakes of all sizes and types. So that part of the movie lives up to its name, but writing, acting and driving is so bad that it's almost painful to sit down. <br /> <br /> The characters are so unpleasant that I begged for the name. snakes to end these horrible people to get us out of misery. There are some scenes that are so surreal and ridiculous that can be seen - snakes turning into really horrible disco music, while two women dance half naked together and a scene with a snake holding a futile dialogue with one of the actors. , is beyond the absurd. I think the writer was trying to be funny, but this ended up coming off as a weird LSD trip ... <br /> <br /> I remember William Katt years ago when he starred in "Carrie", what a piece he was .. not that he was never a big star, but to be reduced to this garbage, I feel for him. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague unless you're really into movies that feature lots and lots of snakes and really horrible humans.
