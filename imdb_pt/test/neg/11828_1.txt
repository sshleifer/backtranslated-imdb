Animorphs Ah I loved the series of books and devoured each of them in high school and when I learned that there was an adaptation for television, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> Boy, who disappointed the final product. I think for me, this was the time when Nickelodeon was no longer a legal and more generic program. <br /> <br /> So what was wrong with the show? Let me count the ways: 1. The characters were HORRIFLY miscast. In the books, the Animorphs were somewhere between 12 and 14 years old, the television cast was at least 18 years old. I remember being horrified when I first saw the cast photos. <br /> <br /> 2. Horrible acting / bad writing. I do not know what was to blame, so I'm piling up in the uneven mass it was. Maybe it was the fact that the accelerated cast age has hurt the humor that is at least cute coming from a 13-year-old girl because Marco - it's not funny. In fact, I do not remember a single comic moment of the group and there were some. The actors certainly were not helped by the writing that was insipid at its best and pathetically pathetic at its worst. <br /> <br /> 3. My lord was stingy with the budget. The final result of the Andalons should only have convinced Viacom to pull the plug ... Their heads had slits that showed clearly which was the helmet. <br /> <br /> 4. Back to the cast - Rachel was by far the biggest disappointment, far from being the warrior woman in the books, the best equivalent in the TV series was "scarecrow." Besides, I know Cassie was an idealist, but there's a difference between "idealist" and "idiot." <br /> <br /> 5. One of the worst opening titles ever. Does the song have to be so obvious? 6. By answering question 6, "yes" because everything else was dumbfounded, then why would viewers, hopefully less intelligent, not get a thick song like a brick rapper rock idiot or whatever the hell? Since then, there has been a major downfall (Iraq, 2004), but in case I have not been clear - this show was a drug and was an abomination to the series of books it should be based on .
