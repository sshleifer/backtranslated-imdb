I saw this at my in-laws one night when it appeared on TV and my mother-in-law said it was one of her favorite movies. Well, she can have it. <br /> <br /> Look, I can enjoy a girl's movie once in a while, as long as it's good. But this is extra-sappy, unrealistic and simply predictable, despite some decent performances by Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman. It's strange how quickly a woman can accept her vision taken from her. Oh, well, they say love is blind ... <br /> <br /> The happy, tidy little end almost made me gasp too. And how often do we need Otto Kruger repeating the title? It happened not once, not twice, but THREE times!
