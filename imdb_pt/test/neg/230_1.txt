Bruce Willis, as usual, does an excellent job. <br /> <br /> [warning: can be considered a spoiler] <br /> <br /> While my friend thought it was good, I kept looking at my watch throughout the movie asking when it would end. After watching movies like "The Patriot" and "Chicken Run", I was very disappointed with Disney's "The Kid". Willis plays a middle-aged man with a harsh, realistic attitude by putting a positive spin on people's images (he's an Image Consultant). An unknown boy appears. Yes, he is younger, and even Lily Tomlin can see it. At this point I remember a cross between a "Quantum Leap" episode and a bad travel film. <br /> <br /> Kid and Willis try to figure out why he is in that time period. They find out. They know Willis when he is older. It does not matter that it never goes into detail how many years Willis teleports them between the time periods and puts them together, to begin with, how he got that knowledge, how he came to the conclusion that he needed to do it, and so on. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a very tired, uninspired and uninspired plot that has some great actors in it. The good news is that the actor "Kid" is not nearly as annoying as it is presented in the television trailers.
