Do people rate this movie very well because it's a foreign war movie? <br /> <br /> For me, it's nothing more than a bad Hollywood war movie in German. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad on many levels. Even mentioning it along with Platoon or Full Metal Jacket is absurd. Battle sequences are pathetic, dialogue and acting atrocious. <br /> <br /> This group of "assault troops" is regular in the Wermacht. Not SS troops. There's so much wrong with this movie that it's sad. Bad editing, bad acting. It has everything. <br /> <br /> The film continues and continues as if the public were forced to suffer as much as the soldiers. <br /> I read in a comment that the movie had a budget of $ 20 million. <br /> Really? Where was it spent? In the false train wagon sequences? In the pathetic "special effects"? Ugh. As a history buff of World War II, and a fan of WWII movies, I found this film to be a serious disappointment. <br /> <br /> For an excellent alternative war movie, check out "The Beast". (It's not a WWII movie, but still in circulation.) <br /> <br /> Do not worry about it.
