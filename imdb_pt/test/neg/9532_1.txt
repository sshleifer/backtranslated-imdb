This is one of those road movies that I would like to tell a lot about the women, the universe, the better life, the awful solitude of the brilliant Manhattan architect who breaks every link with everyone, including his three year old son - irresponsible to some - in fact, the hero wins hands down when it comes to selfishness and the scene with his old schoolmate who starts off as a good old-time talk and ends on a menacing note is the oasis in a movie in the desert. <br /> <br /> The scene with the father-who-left-when-I-was-a-child was told and told and TOLD. Of course it did not stop the children from making their way. And when you see the attitude of the hero's wife, you may think she should never have heard of the woman's lib. <br /> <br /> The best is the soundtrack that includes superb songs from Willie Nelson, Tom Waits or Bonnie Raitt. ... But you can enjoy them without this pretentious and tedious work.
