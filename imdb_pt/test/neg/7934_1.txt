I was looking for ATTACK in Precinct 13. There, the movie is so memorable. Who's the star of it? Ethan Hawke or Matt Dillon (I can not say who the lead actor is, that's a big point against the movie) Gabriel Byrne (who could not have needed the money so badly?) Drea De Matteo is awesome but just because of his incredible body. It took me ages to finally discover that she's Joey's sister to "Friends." I agree that people called SWAT attacking the station are very bad with regard to tactics. We even learn better basic skills than this in basic RAF training. <br /> <br /> Avoid this, even the snow does not want to fall on a bus full of prisoners! Continuity really bad. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague!
