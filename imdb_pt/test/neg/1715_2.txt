I really liked Tycus, if not for much more than mocking production figures. Dennis Hopper was fine, though I wondered if he would have signed the project if he had seen the special effects they used. And besides, what was with the scene with the ninja? This was completely out of rhythm. Maybe someone had the brilliant idea in the middle of the shoot. Oh well, this movie is great if you're drunk and need a good laugh. Cheers.
