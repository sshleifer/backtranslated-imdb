Hey, I'm a fan of such bad movies, but there's nothing so bad about Rise Of The Undead. It's so bad and that's it. No redeeming cheese, no unintended humor, nothing! - The annoying apocalyptic zombie (The "Undead": some people with almost no make up) nonsense with lame special effects (if you can call these effects), stupid plot and annoying actors. They also have the guts to pluck and quote other (best) movies (Resident Evil, Dawn of the Dead and Night Of The Comet) and managed to put me to sleep next door. However, it was Rise Of My Eyelids, once the final credits rolled. My advice: save your money. Neither is it worth renting, unless you want to p * ss off and / or put some people to sleep, so go ahead and take a look. You have been warned;)
