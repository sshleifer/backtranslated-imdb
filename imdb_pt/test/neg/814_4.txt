"Jaded" offers a premise with potential as it analyzes a woman's rape by two other women and asks the question "when is rape not rape?". Unfortunately, the film seems to suffer from a bad direction as it goes through cool minutiae while trying to weave some kind of story with a handful of ill-mannered and ill-portrayed characters, but it ends abruptly. "Jaded" is a lame thing only for couch potato with cloudy eyes in the mood of some somber drama.
