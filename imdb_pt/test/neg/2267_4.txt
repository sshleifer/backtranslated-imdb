If you really loved GWTW, you will find the story quite disappointing. Those who may think it's just a romantic and southern story will probably be satisfied with this decent TV production (though I consider Scarlett's choice to be an important evil). But let me say that, considering the novel, nothing good could come of it. <br /> <br /> Li GWTW over 20 times and I can really appreciate the adaptation that Ms. Mitchell made for the film. It took me some time to figure out how good the ending was: Scarlett was sure he would regain Rhett, for he always got what he wanted. But there was no kiss in the end. <br /> <br /> So Alexandra Ripley came to "fix" this, showing us exactly how perfect and powerful Scarlett could be, and of course, describing in detail how exactly she stays with Rhett. back even when she had an important affair with another person (nothing could have been further from Mrs. Mitchell's mind, I'm sure). <br /> <br /> The story between these points is, in my opinion, only a long and boring ride done until tie ends, showing fantasies and scenarios just to give us an obvious and totally unnecessary end. <br /> <br /> If Margaret Mitchell could come to live again, she would die one more time at the same time she would discover what Scarlett became after the GWTW. Of course it's not fair to compare this to the original, but this is not GWTW's fault. It is not? Is it good if I do not compare it to the original? Perhaps. Sorry to say that I do not really care. <br /> <br /> I would expect a little more commitment to continue the work of another person (suberb), otherwise, nor try.
