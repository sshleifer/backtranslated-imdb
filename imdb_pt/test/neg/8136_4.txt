Of course I disappeared in the movies. The Neil Young concert film "Heart of Gold". <br /> <br /> There have been many great concert films over the years. The best was 'The Last Waltz' by Martin Scorsese, who filmed the band's last show on Filmore West. A phenomenal concert and a phenomenal movie, that is, if you love rock and roll and feel as if you were born in it and were part of the song, and could be in the band if you had a better guitar and someone showed you the chords and with some chords and a letter or two you could change the world ... as you can imagine I felt all five to the bottom of my twenty-four year old soul. <br /> <br /> Neil Young was in 'The Last Waltz'. They had to digitally, before the digital, in fact, they had to manually shave a large stone of cocaine that came out of his nose, so in the film there is a bright light that is not the star of Bethlehem swaying above the lip and below the nostril ... is a bit famous in the history of rock and roll. But 'The Last Waltz' was made when the band and Neil and everyone was in their thirties and 'Heart of Gold' was filmed last year when Neil is in his sixties and his band looks like they are in the late 1990s and the entire movie can be used visually by the Christian Right and the DEA just as the Ohio State Patrol movies on drunken driving hazards were used when I was in high school showing teenagers dead front windows or hanging from trees or bloody in a ditch. <br /> <br /> Close your eyes and it's a great concert, open them and see the hidden portrait of Dorian Gray. Case in point, the once ethereal and beautiful Emmylou Harris literally coming out of the darkness to sing with Neil and from the darkness to the light, appearing to be a ring apparition, jumped full out of the river in front of Rivendale. Worst, ghostly, a nose that does not appear in nature and is not an advertisement for plastic surgery, eyes that make buttons on dolls look real, and the ability to express any emotion, human or not, constrained by the unbridled indulgence in Botox. My mind staggered ... porcupine ... Peru ... Jack Daniels ... living hard for decades ... my god ... sweet Emmylou Harris that I saw singing for free at Fred's in Boulder, a face from 2000 years old Pharaoh dead would not accept. But the voice, as pure as a thick bottle of Boulder beer brewed from the waters of Boulder Creek and I closed my eyes and smelled ammmmmbbbererrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrssss (a tribute ... one must use the tribute at least once in any movie review ... for Fred's hamburgers in Boulder Mall and the movie Steve Martin Pink Panther). <br /> <br /> It would have been a great concert sitting in the dark at the Ryman Auditorium, maybe twenty rows back. But up close, in close ups, it was a piece of medieval morality portraying the horrors of indulgence and the consequences of a sinful life. The theme of the concert, stamped on stage, A Prairie Wind ... the last song, massive guitars (I counted eight) and wondered if the irony was at stake. I think not. A Native American bassist, a guitarist who looked and dressed like Buffalo Bill, a pianist whose face looked like the face of the screamer in Munch's The Scream, female singers (actually matronial singers, mostly reminiscent of one of United's lost seniors flight attendants still wielding the friendly skies) dressed in full-length jeans dresses distressed ... no, it was thrown straight. <br /> <br /> None of them had seen, I would bet, A Mighty Wind. <br /> <br /> It will be a great CD, and I would be happy to tell stories of hippy dippy Boulder when Neil was a long-haired Canadian singer whose indecipherable lyrics seemed to reflect pain and loss, feelings as universal as now. <br /> <br /> But only in a dark bar.
