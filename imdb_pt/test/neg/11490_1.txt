I have not seen and heard the original version. <br /> <br /> I'm not Russian, but I'm learning now. <br /> <br /> I also have no preferences for Russia, Bulgaia, USA. But what I have to mention is: <br /> <br /> In German synchronization throughout the film, all Russians speak with a Russian accent. Americans speak "Hochdeutsch" (without an accent)! I've never heard that stupidity! Besides, this is annoying. <br /> <br /> I hope the original is better. <br /> <br /> The rest is a simple thriller, not really a good idea. Like a cheap version of a James Bond movie.
