I love watching Australian movies, but this steaming pile of shit was just embarrassing. The DVD cover looked promising, but you know what they say, do not judge a DVD by its cover. <br /> <br /> I also noticed that he won the award for Best Actor for an award, but the competition must have been very bad because the performance in this movie is pathetic. It seemed the director thought he had enough talent to drive and act when he should focus on one part of the movie and hit it before it spread. The music was very common. The story really was not going anywhere. It was just a sequence of fights chained with poor script and cheeky dialogues. <br /> <br /> I will say this to all aspiring filmmakers. Watch this movie. It will give you hope that your movie will win something at some festival. <br /> <br /> However, good for them to come in and have a chance. I hope you have learned some lessons and the next venture is a little better.
