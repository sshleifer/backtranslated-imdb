The 33 percent of the nerds who still support W. Bush would do well to watch this film, which shows the consequences of the French Revolution and the terror of 1794 as very similar to the post-September 11 socio-political scene. Maybe then they could stop worrying about saving their faces and getting the shit they deserve. It's really a pity that when a politician ruin the country, those who voted for him can not deny the right to vote again. They have clearly shown that they have no sense of character. <br /> <br /> What really stands out in this film is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinal as Robespierre; an empty haunted man whose simplistic reductionist ideology can not help him elucidate the boundaries between security and totalitarianism. Execution and murder. Self-defense and patriotism. His legalistic tests aggravate the desperate situation he helped create. Sounds like any belligerent, underprivileged, and retarded cheerleader you know? <br /> <br /> Wojciech Pszoniak plucks the sloppy Deparidieu from the screen. As nice as Robespierres is, it's comforting to know that, shortly after the film ends, he'll have his jaw fired and sent to the guillotine.
