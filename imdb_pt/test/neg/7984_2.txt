Oh my God, I was so hoping for something more fun than that when I downloaded this movie, since 1903 was one of my favorite years for the movies of all time, but it sucked! The "plot", though I hesitate to call it so, is about some dumb elephant. He slowly enters some platform and is electrocuted to death. Lame. Even for a short film, the plot was too thin to keep my attention. Edison is, as the worst director of all time. In addition, the elephant has no presence on the screen. And the end? Wow, that was not predictable. * sarcasm * The quality of the image is awful too. You can barely tell what is happening most of the time. The only positive thing about this movie is that, unlike most other non-scary horror films, this did not generate eleven sequences. Other than that, this is a complete waste of money and a minute of your life that you will never get back.
