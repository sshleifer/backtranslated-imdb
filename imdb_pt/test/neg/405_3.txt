36/100. This should not be confused with decent arachnophobia, this film is a very low budget and cheap for the film. This is so bad that it really does have some entertainment value on that level. There are lots of unintentional scenes (I think) out loud. I was not expecting much from the movie, and it was actually worse than I imagined it would be. <br /> <br /> It's a clich√© mounted and predictable straight into the video mess. Fortunately, do not take yourself too seriously. The performance, as expected, is not exactly the caliber of the Oscar. Special effects are poor, worse than I'd think they would be. Poorly edited and the score is intrusive.
