I'd like to know what to do with a movie like that. It seems to be divided into two parts - action sequences and personal dramas on land. Follows Ashton Kutsher through survival school, led by Master Chief Kevin Costner, and then to Alaska, where some spectacular redemptions take place, the latter resulting in death. <br /> <br /> I must say that the scenes on The Beach seemed so stereotyped in so many ways that it should be encrusted with barnacles. A typical fight between the guys from the Navy and the Coast Guard ("pirates of the pool"). The seasoned veteran Costner, who is, as one old bar says, "married to the Coast Guard." The older boss who "keeps trying to prove to himself that he's still nineteen." The neglected ex-wife ashore to whom Kostner makes a farewell visit. The seemingly sadistic demands placed on swimmers by the instructors, all in pursuit of a higher goal. The talented young man limped through a troubled past. <br /> <br /> The problem is that we've seen all this before. If it's Kevin Costner here, it's Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosset Jr. or Vigo Mortenson or Robert DeNiro elsewhere. And the climactic scene has elements blatantly drawn from "The Perfect Storm" and "Dead Calm." None of this is new and none of the old stereotyped characters and situations are treated with any originality. <br /> <br /> It works best as a kind of documentary of what goes on in the swimmer's school and what could happen next and even that is a bit weak because we do not have much in the way of instruction. It is mainly personal conflict, romance and tension over washing. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because the US Coast Guard is a bit noble, its official mission is "the safety of lives and properties at sea." In times of war, he is transferred to the Department of the Navy and serves in combat functions. In World War II, the Coast Guard even managed to have a Medal of Honor winner in its ranks. <br /> <br /> But again, we have not learned much about it. We really did not learn much about anything. The film falls into a succession of visual displays and not much more. A disappointment.
