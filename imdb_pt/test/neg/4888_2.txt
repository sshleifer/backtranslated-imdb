No lack of female flesh, but still not interesting! Lenzi at least is able to by now much larger, probably coming to Spasmo and beginning with Kiss Me Kill Me. The release of the Hard Gore R2 DVD can be cut in 86 minutes, but this film contains an act of cannibalism and a victim - a scene with a native girl who is brutalized and disemboweled by the cannibal tribe of whom we are warned and who later set fire to some huts. Burning Holocaust? Firestarter Fernox anyone? <br /> <br /> Surely it's not a cannibal movie, but has there ever been a decent one? Avoid.
