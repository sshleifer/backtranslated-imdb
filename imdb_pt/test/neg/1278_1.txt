Are you the one alive? OK, I think I'm smart, educated, liberal and really into movies. I really like it and I have a great sense of humor. I was under the impression that this was a terribly painful comedy. They were paid to do this, gasoline was used, electricity burned, food was consumed, sets built ........ why? I blame the current state of the world on this film and on all the people associated with it, I will even include the public. We are all guilty and deserve whatever comes. Not funny, does not happen too much, everyone seems bored or boring. There are no conversations, communication is minimal. There is no plot as far as I know. In fact, I just lost 89 points on something in my life. I'll never get that time back. The only message I have is that maybe life is too short to be watching movies of people who do not do much ... and then you die!
