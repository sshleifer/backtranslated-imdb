After hearing that some of the people behind the low-budget movies "Terror in Rock'n'Roll Önsjön" and "Sphere of Space ... and other things" were involved in the production of this film, I decided to buy it without be seen on DVD. I wish I had not. The other films were funny, ironic and kind of dumb. While Kraftverk 3714 is devoid of any mood at all. And it's so horrible that I'm getting angry just thinking about it. The worst possible actors, the worst possible script, the worst special effects available. And the sexiest sex scene of all time. Uhhh And the whole thing goes on for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Please, never make another movie.
