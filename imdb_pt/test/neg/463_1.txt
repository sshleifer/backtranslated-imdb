How can anyone even start to like this movie really beyond me? <br /> <br /> The idea? There is none. "A guy collapsed." This is the idea. Wow. An environment was slowly killing him ... now this is original and worth watching. <br /> <br /> This is the first Fasbinder movie I've seen ... I've heard that he's a mise-en- genius genius, but I've seen student films with more attention, inspiration, idea, and craft. that this ... this ... that nothing. There is nothing! <br /> <br /> Every shot is too long. There is a lot of emptiness in them ... The acting is horrible. You can see that the actors had no preparation, no understanding of their roles, not even an attempt to show emotions ... it's so ... superficial ... The speeches are so explanatory that you could remove 90% of them and still has the same low quality film. Time? Who cares? Atmosphere, dynamic, this is for pussies! One shot per scene, 80% of the time that people look unrealistic, having no idea how to represent emotions and moment importance, besides looking at the camera or at each other ... Editing? All editing rules have been disregarded without any payment whatsoever ... Photography? Half the planes have reflections in them and little illumination, without any kind of stylization. Shadows, shadow play ... who needs it? We need a guy urinating, drinking, beating his wife like he's ... as if acting. We need a lot of closes of a not-so-pretty woman ... we need an amateur climax of her capture by an unconvincing Arab torturer ... This movie has so many mistakes that it's not worth the budget Frankly, I have not seen one movie so bad since American Pie 5. Yeah. That's bad. <br /> <br /> I started watching your movie "Veronica Foss", which looks much better, based on the first 15 minutes (since it has a suggestion of direction and artistic idea, other than that crap), so I do not I'll argue that Fasbinder's lack of notion ... but this ... this movie sucks!
