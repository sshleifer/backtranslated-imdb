I'll have to admit that I'm at a disadvantage here; when I learn more about a movie from other reviewers than from myself, then that's a problem. Although the plot of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" seems generally simple, the film allows many enigmatic elements to hinder what might have been a satisfying mystery. The moment we come to the scene where a witch-like woman lays down the secret of the "first degree of the seven-fold radius," I did not know whether to laugh or rewind to see if I missed something. In retrospect, the enigmatic note recovered by Lawrence (Leslie Banks) from the handle of a bearded brush was a masterfully written message, leading to a dentist named Barbor and finally to Albert Hall, a place, not a person indicated by "A. Hall". But despite all the intrigue, it is never clear why the murder target was being eliminated. Okay, Louis Bernard was killed because he knew of a conspiracy to murder a diplomat named Ropa, but why was Ropa a target? Thinking about it, why was the note written and fixed on the beard brush? Did Bernard have to refer to him from time to time to remind himself what would happen? With his disjointed scenes, "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is difficult to follow and a bit disorienting, however, I will credit Alfred Hitchcock for that initial effort. As a matter of perspective, I will have to watch some of his other works from the same period, although this film certainly can not keep up with his later works like "Psycho" or "North by the Northwest."
