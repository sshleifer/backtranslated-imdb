Uncle Fred Olen Ray once again gives us some of his "goodness" Retromedia in the form of this non-classic Cinemax soft. <br /> <br /> A couple of nobos are looking at the rocks as they come through a rotating vortex, a "black hole," as the clever dolts say. Pretty soon, a cute cave girl from a million years ago happens on the timeline and she fits in the future. Very soon, your other studious half also opens the way for the future and opens a path through the beds of the future. <br /> <br /> Ray again offers a bad party (but almost) that has a horrible performance but some decent skin. Yes, it's just exciting, but heh! If the worst happens, you will heal your insomnia. <br /> <br /> S10 reviews: 1/5 or 3/10
