I did not really watch this show when I was little. And I think I just watched 1 episode on Railroads because I liked trains and still did. Still, I thought it was a baby show. I mostly watched Arthur. The songs are pretty weird too. And I do not think that's educational either. They just sing some idiot rhymes. This is a stupid show, any adult who likes is crazy! If you want some good children's shows, watch something like Arthur, Mister Rogers Neighborhood or even better Pee-wee Playhouse. I thought Sesame Street was boring when I was little, but even that is better than Barney. Trust me, this show is really dumb, there are other Kids Shows that are better than this. I can see many of the reviews here that many people do not like this show. Now there are some mature people. I hope they get this show out of the air soon enough.
