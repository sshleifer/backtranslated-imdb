Bad dialogue, slow story, creeping scenes and absolutely useless. I can not believe how much money was invested in such a poorly written film. The direction and performance could not save this bomb either. <br /> <br /> 50% of the movie and you're still waiting to get started. They place the base with the opening preface and then spend the next 40 minutes configuring NOTHING. You watch 40 minutes of footage that is absolutely directionless in trying to do what, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Much of this movie is like watching a very bad French movie where nothing happens and the characters are just kind of boring, lifeless and self-centered living without purpose or care. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. Anyone who advises you is preparing you for disappointment and you will undoubtedly question their taste and depth.
