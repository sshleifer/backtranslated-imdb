This was not a good movie. Badly scripted and acted - the concept was not new, the effects were bad and not a showcase for Arnold Vosloo, who is actually a half decent actor. I watched it under some protest and only remembered seeing it before the end - it's forgettable. The performance seemed to consist of a series of gleams and glances devoid of any sincerity. I kept waiting for it to really happen and before long I was just waiting for it to end. As for the medical parts - well, I was not expecting a true version of the ER events, but that was just comical - I'm a Dr, so know what I'm talking about - and the operational bits were just silly. <br /> <Do not waste your valuable time - unless you have absolutely nothing to do - get out, call a lost friend, watch the painting dry, organize your stocking draw, do some housework. AVOID your danger.
