This movie is truly pathetic in every department imaginable. horrible, horrible, horrible. It's only about eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching a Andy Warhol movie (then again twenty hours into the life of the Empire State Building would surely be a lot more interesting). <br /> <br /> Where to begin ... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, its bad acting so bad, the spectacularly dark effects, the terrible music, or just the fine plot that resembles a sieve. This film is an incoherent mess. <br /> <br /> A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, leaves the waitress looking out the window of the cafe that remarks with a medium English accent " Damn it! ". To correct that woman. God damn this horrible monstrosity. <br /> <br /> Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves. Hopefully the director will never find the funding to work again.
