I will not bother mentioning any part of the plot - this is strictly a B movie on the way to obscurity. The shock to me though, is to see what happened to some of the actors in this movie. Erika Eleniak, never anything you would call an actor, seems to have turned into Anna Nicole Smith (in her great time). Daniel Bernhardt - I almost shed a tear. He has always been one of my favorites because of his martial arts prowess as seen in the Bloodsport series (also B movies, but if you enjoy martial arts, eminently watchable). Here he is a shell of his old self - certainty, he is older, but making the mercenary and not even seeming interested ... I just did not get it. Do not these people invest? William Forsythe is another "heavy" I've always liked, but his last roles are what you'd call "sending." I'm not even going to mention Mr. Reynolds - your show here amounts to a waste, nothing more. The only winner is Andrew Divoff, as usual, a scary villain, evil and bumpy, with a voice of sandpaper that can curdle milk - the best kind! This is a movie that you watch for laughs. There is nothing more for that.
