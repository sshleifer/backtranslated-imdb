Fame did something strange. It was not just a musical that was originally created for the screen (mostly based on Broadway musicals), but spawned a TV series and a Broadway musical. Let me correct that phrase. Fame is not a musical. Musicals have numbers of music to advance the plot or to show the feelings of the characters. The chant in this song is not used to make anyone; in fact, it's no use. People just sing at random to suit the plot. And that's not the kind of musical I know. <br /> <br /> The so-called plot of fame has an attack of characters (which are all introduced at once - the last time I saw this in a movie [Gosford Park]) had disastrous results) that took the test and entered the New York High School for the Performing Arts. They are all for different reasons, for example. acting, singing, etc. The quoted drama unfolds when these middle-aged pretending to be teenagers spend their four years. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that high school should be selective. After all, it's a free college, and they can not let everyone in. So how come some people who are really bad get into college? Obviously so that the drama could happen among all these different people. And why is the person charged even in the movie until near the end for no reason except to make us feel uncomfortable? There are many unsettling situations with which these unskilled people come in, but you can not feel bad about them because you do not know who they are! These relationships occur among people whose names you do not know. And these characters perceive things about themselves throughout the movie, but you do not realize this because you do not know how they were in the first place. <br /> <br /> As for singing, it pops up randomly (and is supposed to be humorous?) and does nothing. When the title song is sung, it's played in the middle of a street and before you can say Ferris Bueller, everyone is in the middle of the street dancing wildly and without rhythm. The music itself is good, but the whole scene, like the whole movie, is unnecessary. Fame is a nasty movie, to say the least. I'd say more, but most of the movie has happily gone out of my head. I just do not see it. You will be doing yourself a favor. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R for language.
