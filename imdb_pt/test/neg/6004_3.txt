An ugly face tearing of Se7en and not fit to clean his shoes. The word "predictable" must have been invented only for such an occasion. Lambert is as wooden as ever (his moments of 'emotion' are laughable as well as his accent). The "climax" is nothing of that, since we had so many signs and, in the end, we are simply immune to the flesh, rotting or not. All in all, a real mess.
