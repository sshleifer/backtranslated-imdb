This film was so weak that it could not even get good cliches to boot. I love horror movies and I see almost anything, but if I had to do it again I would have skipped this entirely. You may think I'm overreacting, but challenge someone to find anything even remotely satisfying or interesting about that piece of junk. It's not scary, it's not funny, it's not curious, it's not worth it.
