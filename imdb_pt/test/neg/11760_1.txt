You can not blame the filmmaker for glorifying Che because the industry is all about money. Most of the stories you hear about this "freedom fighter" is an absolute maneuver made by the communist Cuban government after Che's death. Che was a murderous asshole from day one. Here is a list of the great things that Che did for Cuba. 1) He executed thousands of innocent Cuban men, women and children to satisfy his longing for power. <br /> <br /> 2) Destroyed Cuba's economy and good reputation with the rest of the world. The Cuban peso used to be equal to the US dollar. Now it's basically useless. <br /> <br /> 3) Continually failed in all things involving diplomacy, economics and the military. He never passed his freshman year in medical school, and he was just in a real battle, in which he surrendered with a fully loaded weapon. <br /> <br /> 4) He took over the largest property in Cuba to set up for himself. He had a yacht, a custom 60 "TV from America, a pool and a view of the ocean. So much to avoid the materialistic lifestyle. Cuba today is an absolutely destitute country, and you do not you have no one but Che and the Castro brothers to thank you for it.If you go to Cuba today, you will not be allowed to leave the tourist areas.If you managed to get out of what you should see, you would find favelas, beggars and prostitutes. > <br /> If you think that something I am saying is a lie, then go study a little: compare the Cuban exports of 1950/60 with those of today, talk to the people who survived or who had parents in the so-called " revolution "of the 1960s, read all the accounts of innocent murderers, read the accounts of people who served under Che and Castro, and fled because of an evil and disgusting human being. And please, please remember to always read or watch EVERYTHING objectively. Stop taking everything for value and THINK ABOUT IT.
