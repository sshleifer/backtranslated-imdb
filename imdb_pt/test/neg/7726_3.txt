I was on a mission to watch Uwe Boll's movies to see if they were really as bad as all this. The first one I saw, BloodRayne, was not a complete loss. I liked it more than most people, and actually rated it 4 out of 10. The next was the first House of the Dead movie. Now that was horribly bad. I was able to watch ten minutes, and went forward a little, and that was it. I could see where I was going and I did not have to see anything else in order to evaluate it in only 1 in 10. <br /> <br /> But I also had access to the sequel (which, however, is not from Uwe Boll, but mysteriously written by the same guys who so incompetently wrote the first), and as he got a higher rating in IMDb than the original, I thought he would give it a try. And I really got to watch it all. It started with some funny references and cool lines (as the president received orders from the vice president!) And in terms of acting, it's light years better than the first. Here we have cool girls like the ultra-hot Emmanuelle Vaugier, whose coolness is allied to Carrie-Anne Moss, Claudia Black and Evangeline Lilly. Dude, I hope some Matrix-style movie shows up for her sometime. And the always delicious and super aerobic Victoria Pratt. I love athletic women. And there was Nadine Velazquez (Catalina in "My Name is Earl"), who performed very well. <br /> <br /> The story was not much, and the action was not great either. The ending was a disappointment, as they were unsuccessful in their mission. Oh well, at least the two main survived. I think it's a small victory too. <br /> <br /> Good cast, but a very bad movie. The actors make it watchable, but there is no real substance there. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
