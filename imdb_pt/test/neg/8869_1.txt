I consider myself to have a decent sense of humor, but this "movie" stunned me in my chair. <br /> <br /> It's so bad it could not have been worse. Not once did I laugh at the sadly tried jokes in this movie. I watched and enjoyed several parodies of great movies, but unfortunately this will always be what I most remember - in my nightmares. <br /> <br /> The only reason anyone should want to watch this is if they want to go into a coma for a brief period of time. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie ever.
