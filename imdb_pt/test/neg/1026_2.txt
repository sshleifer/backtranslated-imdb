Although there is very little plot and all that exists is just improvisation, it was still a good start for a new director with no previous financial backing and also a clever move by Andy Warhol to make his productions easier to be sold and viewed. In any case, this story of a street smuggler depends a lot on showing Joe buck naked (almost all the time!). And the creative use of a flashy edition really disappears after the hundredth time and the cut of the dialogue thing gets really annoying halfway. That would have been a lot more fun, or even dramatic, if they made a daily documentary of a male prostitute or crook, instead of letting the actors invent a plot and meaningless dialogue.
