I give it a 2 - I reserve a rating of 1 for movies by Guy Ritchie and Woody Allen. We do not even remember what this movie was. The only thing we remember is a shooting scene where the actors fall to the ground, roll to the other side of a hall or something and then return to the shoot. It was like watching 80-year-old children with two broken legs trying to perform "acrobatics." Also, when the characters were driving in a truck, the engine noise (or the radio does not remember) disappeared completely when the actors were talking. <br /> <br /> And, like others, we bought it because of the cover of Sandra Bullock. very sad, very bad
