Harmony Korine. I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this movie. If it was to turn my good day into a night of disturbing memories of what I think he got. <br /> <br /> I know there have been big issues raised in this movie like, Who are we really, what are we? here there really is a God. All the great questions, but I really do not think it's funny when you have the questions next to such a tragedy. I'm all for real life being portrayed, but come on. It is never funny when a wife is being raped, someone is killing herself (and family and friends find the body), and people die for unexplained and unnecessary reasons. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was the location was filmed. There are many beautiful places. <br /> <br /> I'm not a film student or know much about it. I admit it, but I know that when I leave the theater with a feeling of disgust, then it was not a movie I would recommend to anyone.
