Royal Rumble 1988 bored me very well. The bang itself is rather monotonous, full of medium cards, and a winner who really had no sense in winning, and why the hell the main event of The Stallions Vs The Islanders? half the crowd went away. Jessie Ventura sounds bored, through half the thing, and you can tell when he mentions that he finds the development of Hogan Vs Andre more interesting. McMahon and Ventura do not have the chemistry of Gorilla and Jessie. <br /> <br /> Ricky Steamboat Vs Ravishing Rick Rude. An extremely disappointing departure, with many rest breaks and a slow pace, sinks this. When it catches like crazy in the last 5 minutes, it's too little, too late. Steamboat wins by DQ. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Next comes Dino Bravo trying to set a new bench press record, with Ventura locating him. Horrible segment, no entertainment value what so ever. Ventura is not enough to lead this segment, and even McMahon admitted that it was annoying. Controversy or not, I wasted enough time on this crap. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Woman's Tag Team Championship. <br /> <br /> 2 of 3 falls The charm girls | C | / W Jimmy Hart. You see the angels of the jumping bomb. This is the best game of the night, no, I'm not joking! Very exciting things for women's wrestling, and you will have a hard time finding such good things nowadays. The Jumping Bomb Angels had already finished, and the crowd went in search of their title. <br /> <br /> Contract signed between Hulk Hogan and Andre The Giant. Hogan gets a decent pop, but there are some noticeable boo for him, probably because he's in Canada. A little too much for my taste, but it was necessary for the plot. He understood, and had some actual moments, but many times I kept saying "Keep it up". Both sign, and Andre bangs Hogan's head on the table, and pushes the table toward him. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Royal Rumble Match. Royal Rumble, very weak, probably due to the clumsy rhythm and the star's true lack of power. I think Vince was testing the waters with this, and it showed. Ventura seems disinterested and I do not blame him. Crowd clearly wanted Roberts to win, shouting DDT almost every 5 minutes he was there, and while Duggan had a good pop, I did not believe he was the winner they wanted, and where did that lead his career? Nowhere. Bret's first, Royal Rumble, and he made an impressive showing. It was not terrible, but it was pretty dull, and did not have enough to do the show, considering that this was what the show was based on. 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Hogan has an interview with Craig DeGeorge. Standard interview with Hulkster, but not with the same outrageous and outrageous comments he usually pulls. <br /> <br /> Ted and Andrew are interviewed. Andre claims that he will hand over the championship to Mr. Dibiase. Short but effective. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2 of 3 Falls. <br /> <br /> The Ilh√©us Vs The Young Stallions. The crowd is completely dead by this, and half of them fled to the exit. It's very annoying, and there was no business being in the main event. Jessie and Vince look bored and argue over other things while the game is going on. The islanders win, taking advantage of the Roma injury. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom Line. Historically important, I suppose, but there's really nothing to see here. This was just an initial suggestion for great things to come to the Royal Rumble, and while you can see glimpses of potential here, there is nothing here, going out of your way to see. I usually recommend it all once to Die Hard Wrestling fans, and considering it's the first Royal Rumble event, I think so, but prepare to be bored most of the time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
