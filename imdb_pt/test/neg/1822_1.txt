This short review does not contain spoilers, since the movie spoils. It is wooden and pedant. There is no saving grace at all. If someone invites you to his house to watch "Mr. Imperium", do not go. Even the title of the movie is terrible and announces that the trash is inside. The whole plot is so bad it could lead Mother Teresa to despair !!! It was not a stroke that led to the premature death of poor Ezio, it was to have to act in that tumult that made him enter. It must have haunted the rest of your days. Maybe he was an enemy alien and wanted revenge on the Americans for their confinement. He found a perfect vehicle for his wrath in this farce.
