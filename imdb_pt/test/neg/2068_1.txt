As a film critic for a local gay magazine, I automatically get something if she has a homo in it. Chicken Tikka Masala is stirring in the background as I write this. I gave my attention for 53 minutes before I found myself involuntarily shouting - like a Tourrette sufferer - "This is the test film I've seen." We are getting to the emotional climax where the son is giving a talk to his father at his wedding. Dad seems to be doing great. An attempted assassination for honor at this point would at least have excited the film a bit. And made it funnier. <br /> <br /> I did not particularly like Beautiful Thing, for example, but I could at least see why other people did. It was done with some professionalism and it seems that I remember I had at least two good lines. The lack of humor in this movie is quite surprising - even the most mediocre sitcom will tend to have recognizable jokes. The closest movie to be funny (at least for the first 53 minutes) was the subtitle commentary for the fat, attractive chief woman: "Look at her with her legs spread - she's like the Mersey Tunnel." Completely bland and I did not smile, but I could imagine someone with a low IQ (who might work in a chip shop) liking it. <br /> <br /> I imagine it to be some atrocity funded by the lottery. If not, I can at least console myself with the fact that the sponsors will lose a substantial amount of money, even if a low-budget British film still arrests a few million people. Seriously, if I knew the most handsome guy in the world and, returning to his place to make love, I found a copy of him in his DVD collection ("Dude, I love this movie") I would probably kick him in the nuts and leave immediately. And this from someone who spent about six months without any of the sweet love mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Oh Lord, I hate this movie.
