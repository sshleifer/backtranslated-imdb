Let me start with a personal note as a fan of cinema and television, plus the pleasure side of life: I love what James Woods can and has done, and I always love Melanie Griffith, and Natasha Wagner was very good at it. horrible thing A miserable, smelly rehearsal of "true crime." <br /> <br /> Who actually wrote this movie apparently never spent time talking to real criminals with real criminal talents: yes, some thieves are addicted but have very short careers as thieves. Truly successful thieves are rarely caught because they do not do "junk" or any kind of drug before getting a score (work). <br /> <br /> The character of James Woods was true to this paradigm at the beginning of this film. , and then the script completely disbanded. He turns into a furious, alcoholic lunatic ... good job for a tough guy like Woods, maybe, but not at all believable. <br /> <br /> Most criminals are lazy. If they wanted to work, they would go to work. <br /> <br /> These people in this movie are beautiful, self-indulgent, narcissistic drug losers. They failed to get a real score in the real world, the real world where a big, burly security guard beating hell out of a skinny kid (as in the first scenes of this "DOG"), keeps him from falling and does not let him up. <br /> <br /> How many ways did I find to hate this movie? Many. Even totally vulgar people - like most thieves and drug addicts - have a higher vocabulary than these cretins. And the scenes of 'theft' with the neo-Nazi bikers? Puhlease. All rednecks are not neo-Nazis and those who are neo-Nazi speed sellers are not that dumb! <br /> <br /> This film won two because Natasha Wagner was extremely good at her role as Rose and because Melanie Griffith still has "something special", or at least she had for that brutal and offensively stupid movie. I am not to sing praises of real criminals for any reason, but the reality of these criminal types in this horrible movie is that they would all be dead or stuck in the second act, Scene 1. Watching a lousy zombie movie would be better time spent on that this .... thing ... and I hate zombies.
