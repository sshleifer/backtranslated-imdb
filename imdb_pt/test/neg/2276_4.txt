This four-hour mini-series production is about two hours longer than necessary, mainly because the filmmakers did not seem to have a clear idea of ​​how to adapt a novel to the screen. They seemed to not know what should be kept and what could safely be left out. The film begins with Sir Walter reading the book of Peerage, which is his main comfort in his problems. This introduces the family - all of which we know intimately in the next four hours - but serves another purpose. Likewise, the scenes in which the Musgroves lament "poor Richard" serve no purpose other than dragging the story down. Some of Austen's current dialogues are attributed to different characters and some of her narratives are recycled as dialogues that fall awkwardly from the characters' tongues. There is some fill-in dialogue as well, and this is uniformly awful. The scene in which Charles Hayter is annoying Henrietta with her concerns about getting Dr. Shirley's healer was just uninteresting as narrative in the book; Like a scene in this production, it is dumbfounding. The scene in the Cobb, when Louisa falls and is "lifeless taken!", Is totally without urgency, and I wondered if Wentworth's line "there is no one to help me?" could have been directed to writers as well as to other actors. <br /> <br /> This production often looks and feels like a piece that was filmed instead of a real movie, and this is most evident in the acting, which is the opposite of subtle: delivery of lines, gestures exaggerated and actors who have no idea what to do with their hands, feet or faces when they are not speaking their lines. Charles Musgrove is in his living room with his feet shoulder-width apart, and seems to be projecting onto the porch (if any) by talking to the other people in the room with him. Louisa Musgrove's face, when she is not actively pretending or laughing, seems to be at rest confused. Louisa is a dazzling, smiling, docile creature, and for a moment I did not believe Wentworth would be interested in her. <br /> <br /> The costumes are a mixed but mostly awful bunch, and Anne Elliot's green tartan dress is possibly the most odious costume ever invented. We got the dates early in the show - it's the late 1790s or maybe the early 1800s - and yet many of the costumes appear to be Victorian in design, and therefore about 60 years too early! The hair is so wrong that I will not even mention it here. Except to say I will not mention it. :-) <br /> <br /> This production does some things right, though. Mrs. Smith receives her due importance, and her story with Mr. Elliot, his dissipation and his intrigues, are fully addressed. I was also pleased to see the scenes of "reconciliation" with Anne and Frederick at the end, which are a precious reward to the reader, but were hidden in the production of 1995. <br /> <br /> If you love the book Persuasion, and even vaguely like the 1995 film, do not waste a moment (or a penny) on that production; you will find this very needy.
