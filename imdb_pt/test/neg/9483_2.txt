the boys were the most attractive things in the entire film. the girls were thighs and pathetic, I mean, how can they have their own line of clothes, dolls, movies, produce studios, and not smell the bomb from afar? in order to gain some kind of responsibility, that I do not really see the sense of punishment ..., they are sent to Paris, far from home to live with the so-called strict grandfather who holds an important position with Paris. I really can not remember what he was, so who really cares? the detail does not help, the girls are sent to Paris to learn something ... so what exactly do they learn when they meet two French boys and are able to manipulate the guy who should watch them so they can meet these guys on scooters ? the typical preteen movie, having all preteens wanting to behave badly and being able to afford the trip to Paris or some distant country away from the parents? I really do not like olsens anyway, they could never really get rid of the image of michelle, in full house ... in case you did not see this, then you were lucky from the start. (F F-)
