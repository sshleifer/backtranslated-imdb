Wow, this movie is bad. Think of "Flashdance" with ninjas. The worst part is when a sword must be floating in the air, but you can see the ropes. Or maybe the worst part is the gigantic eye-catcher (which looks like a roller coaster) that the good ninja uses. In fact, there are so many bad parts that I can not decide which is the worst. I can not believe that someone actually put the money to have this thing done. The only value left is that it's good to laugh.
