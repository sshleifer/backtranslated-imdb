Insane really. Even if you have not seen the original George Cukor movie with Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine and a cast of thousands of other stars, you can dispense with this politically correct and depressing forced comedy. Depressing for many different reasons. Meg Ryan for one. What did she do to herself? His face can barely move. That alone puts her miles away from Norma Shearer. Annette Bening should be suing DP and Debra Messing, what the hell was she doing here? Actresses without connection in the subconscious of the public trying to pass friends, totally unconvincing. Eva Mendes on Joan Crawford's part is an outrageous piece of miscellany. What a terrible idea! Your character is like a transgender artist without any taste or subtlety. It is bizarre to think that a woman has adapted and directed these women. The only positive things I can mention are a short but very funny apparition of Bette Midler and Cloris Leachman as the housekeeper.
