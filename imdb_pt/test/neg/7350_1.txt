Free Willzyx (Stupidest name / title ever) is the worst episode of any of the TV shows I watch, which includes X-Files, Alias, All 3 Law and Orders, CSI All, Family Guy, Simpsons, Chappelle Show , Colbert Report and more. South Park was long my favorite comedy show, because of its outrageously obscene content and disturbing black comedy. Free Willzyk has NONE of the content I mentioned earlier. It was so meek, so harmless it could have been an episode of Sesame Street. Kyle goes to Sea World where some of the workers play a joke on him, making him think a whale is talking to him. He respects the whale, in fact, commits himself. Hello? This is South Park! the same show that brought "Canceled", "Chickenlover", "Hits The Fan", "Death Camp Of Tolerance", and many more! No SpongeBob SquarePants! Ugh I really watched the whole episode, which is 30 minutes of my life that I will never go back. Anyway, I was extremely disgusted by this episode and can not believe the shocking decline in the quality of Matt & Trey's work.
