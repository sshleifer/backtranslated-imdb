Yes, I bought camp blood and lost about 86 minutes of my life and 5 pounds of my money in that crap, I mean, I did not expect an incredible movie, judging by the cover I was not really expecting anything good but less breasts in the first 3 seconds (I'm not complaining about breasts ..) I'm complaining about what the heck this has to do with anything? this movie should have been kept there hand cam at home as a joke .... they suck..why was the blood browner and dung like that real blood? ... cheap I say ya I mean that everyone was not in The colors were just tinted yellow, And another thing that made me die of laughing at this sad excuse for a movie was the fact that they tried to pretend that the clown was a woman all the time, although she is clearly a short black-haired man. ..that someone else noticed that the only special effect in this movie was a slower jump.that was also bad oh and the dissolving effect you can find on many pc basic programs like ... powerpoint .... this knocks of film
