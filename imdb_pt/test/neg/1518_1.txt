I've always been a Bottom fan, getting as many videos as I could find from the series here in the States. The chemistry between Rik and Ade is always brilliant, and the combination of clever writing and totally stupid humor seems to work flawlessly. So, I sat down to watch this movie with great enthusiasm ... and I was totally disappointed with the ending. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 of the film can best be described as uninspired and misdirected (sorry, Ade!), but with some absolutely brilliant moments. Unfortunately, those moments of laughter make you realize how much less brilliant the film is. The slapstick starts out funny but eventually becomes a bit annoying with just the perverted sex jokes to keep things funny. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie (the 'green' scenes, for those of you who saw it) was ... perhaps the worst ending I've seen in the last decade. Honestly. It was a joke repeated about thirty times, followed by an abrupt ending that did not make sense (which did not bother me) and was not funny (what happened). <br /> <br /> To summarize, I was very disappointed with this movie. I'll stick to the few bright moments to keep the best memories I can ... but I have to warn you, if you're about to overpay for your local importer's NTSC conversion tape, do not do it. There are much better things to spend your money on.
