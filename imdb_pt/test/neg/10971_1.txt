This film takes many liberties with known historical facts. Even small things like Flynn licking one seal after another, when he would certainly have used a damp sponge, is one of the most annoying things. Flynn has never been tried for manslaughter or murder. He is not known to have caught his mother making love to another man, and is not known to have had a homosexual relationship with anyone, and he did not end up in skid row in Sydney. He did not get his half-cent role in The Wake of the Bounty by imposture and this role did not make him into a well-dressed movie star. <br /> <br /> This is just a mediocre movie where Errol Flynn's name was only added to sell more tickets and more videos.
