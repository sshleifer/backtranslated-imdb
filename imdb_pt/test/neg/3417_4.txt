Aussie Shakespeare for 18-24 set.with blood, blood and more blood.and good dose of nudity. this will not be for everyone in May levels, for violent by some very cheap for most. made on low budget they try and make there better, but it only works sporadically. and this macbeth just seems to be missing, not just convincing. While there is some good acting on the part of most people, you do not go into their heads, especially the mechbets. the best performance came from gary sweet and the oddest mick molly. If your into Shakespeare then see it but if you like your mature cheese you will love it.it not a bad movie but not so good either. sam peckenpah would love it, that is, if it were filmed as a western. I was expecting a lot of it, as I loved stomper break. but this is a vague effort.
