"Paranormal State" is an interesting program for most paranormal believers. I like to see what the "team" has to say and what they "think", however, I know that the whole show along with its build ups and storylines are completely ready. They go to the actual haunted places and I suspect they talk to real witnesses. I usually feel like I'm watching I'm not watching non-fiction, but a real movie that is contradictory to reality. I personally would not advise or recommend anyone to attend this program, unless you are a basic researcher. <br /> <br /> Interesting show. Stick to "Ghost Hunters"
