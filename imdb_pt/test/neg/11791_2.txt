I suppose by 1961 this movie should be "cool" but looking back now (45 years) its charm was as silly as the entertainment value! Granted, special effects do well in T.V. with the series that started in 1964, but for the BIG screen? I once had an aquarium that was just as exciting! I must agree on the octopus scene near the end where it joined the Seaview. Obviously not well staged ... or trained! Overall, it is very bad acting with poor quality special effects and I still recommend it - for fun, laughs. This was probably one of Irwin Allen's greatest films and I think he thought a lot about it. Barabara Eden started playing "Genie" on TV. Micheal Ansara was her husband. Now that's a cool part about this movie! I've always enjoyed watching the real-life Husband and Wife teams star in the same movie. Tidy !
