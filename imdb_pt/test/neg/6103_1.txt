<br /> <br /> This film is most appreciated amidst a large audience with giggling. <br /> <br /> All too often, Kadosh's characters are seen staring into nothingness. Unhappy faces very intense, very pensive, very serious. During those moments, there is a very serious soundtrack, just to make sure that the viewer realizes that the scene being watched is not about fun and games. <br /> <br /> The funniest parts of this movie are among the many thoughtful. We have learned that women in the Kadosh community have two duties. One is to create as many male babies as possible for their husbands. The second is getting employed to free your husbands from having to work. What do these men do with their ample free time? They pray. And we learn that at home they pray aloud: "I thank you for not creating me as a woman." And at their place of worship they pray to thank them for having functioning male genitalia. <br /> <br /> Together with prayer, there are many scenes of frenzied pranks, screams and swaying heads and bodies swaying back and forth, and mixed with everything are many intricate and bizarre ritual activities (or simple but equally strange ). <br /> <br /> The cream of unintentional comedy comes from sex. The imaginary of a hot and troubled man actively switching bodily fluids with his wife in bed while trying to keep his cap from falling off his scalp is unforgettable! <br /> <br /> Every sex scene is funny, but one that stands out is when a husband rubs his face against the feet of his beautiful wife (YaÃ«l Abecassis). Oh yes, we are finally entering the land of sensuality ... but NO! The feet rubbing themselves before anything happens and the husband gets his autistic head swaying and swinging his body until the scene is over. <br /> <br /> There are three attractive women in nude near states, however KATESH does not contain nudity. Technically, there are some interesting images and nice uses of light and colors by the director. For a more believable, educational and entertaining treatment of the condition of being an impure woman unworthy to hold a book in a world where respect is measured by the speed with which a man can quote a phrase from ancient writings , I suggest the YENTL of Barbra Streisand. <br /> <br />
