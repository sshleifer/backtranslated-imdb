I know these types of films sell tickets and make a profit for the filmmakers, but that does not serve as a movie about Vietnam. Vietnam was full of horrors for the men who lived it day by day. <br /> <br /> This movie stars Gene Hackman, the Korean War veteran assigned to train a group of Vietnam veterans back to that country to rescue a group of American prisoners of war held at a camp there . These men include an old tunnel mouse, a mad, acid sailor, a California brown-skinned surfer and an inexperienced boy (Patrick Swayze) who happened to have a father killed in Nam. They first train in some camp on the Texas and once in the Nam they are discovered and lose all their weapons. They are able to find substitute weapons and continue their way to free the captured men. Most men are found and saved, but the rag group is virtually eliminated. <br /> <br /> This movie was played as a video game in which you could find out what would happen next and who would appear. behind which bush, and who would die and who would live. Vietnam I'm guessing it was not like a video game ....
