Already on Youtube? Well, the definitive question for this is YES. Do you see ICarly and Nickelodeon charges? No definitive answer. <br /> <br /> Many people think that ICarly is a boring and stupid program, and others think it is the best program on the face of the earth. I have seen many of the loads of critics going by in the head and some giving her a bouquet of roses. In my opinion, Icarly is for kids, but the show is just awful. <br /> <br /> If you did not read the last review, here are the reasons 1-8: # 1: Steryotypes # 2: Goofed-up drama # 3: Everything is silly (taco truck, for example) # 4: Carly thinks she's cool, but she's bad # 5: Anyone over the drinking age is stupid # 6: Sam is small but strong? # 7: There are no real companies # 8: I mean teachers. # 9: The webshow overuses 3DFX. Just look at the webshow to understand what I mean. # 10: The webshow also discloses personal information. # 11: Almost all famous things are insulted. Icarly insults the Japanese race, Solitare, Mercades-Benz and Pac-Man, to name a few. # 12: There are lots of recurring jokes (Sam's meat obsession, Freddy's computer, Gibby taking off his shirt, etc.) # 13: Video games based on the show are bad. # 14: Freddy has a lack of manhood. Because? You're running out of originality. # 15: The show is aimed at a female audience. I also hate concerts aimed at a male audience as well, so I prefer it to be for both sexes. # 16: The words "nub" and "in chiz". # 17: Excessive use of laughing tracks. <br /> <br /> Part 3 coming in early spring! Just in time for spring break!
