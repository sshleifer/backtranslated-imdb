This could have been a very good movie if someone had known how to end the movie. <br /> <br /> The story was going really well and heading towards that point in all movies like this, where the "gray" characters get "good" and the "bad guys" get their desserts and boom * ... it's like they've just written the script and the cast just started doing things. <br /> <br /> What wouldn \ 't have been so bad ... if the cast had just continued the development of the character they had already put into practice. But that's not the case and the movie soon becomes a silly mess. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch this movie until the last 30 minutes ... and then turn it off. At this point, imagine how you think the next 30 minutes will be based on what you've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Believe me, the ending that you took off will look a lot better than how this movie really ends. Trust me on this.
