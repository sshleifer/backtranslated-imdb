This show is very good and fun to watch, it's a great Disney Channel show and sometimes fun. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the first season, but I hated the second and third seasons. This show has completely changed around. In the first season it was more about science and animals, everything that was gone now in the season and third season. It's more about your life and dating. Ever since the gay boy (Ben) showed up, this show sucked. The writers made a perfect children's show and turned it into a low-quality teen comedy. Disney took a turn for the worse. I can not stand watching the newest episodes, they're all rubbish.
