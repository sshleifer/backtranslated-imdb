This movie had some funny moments. Louie, the main character was well released along with a few other decent supporting characters. The opening scene of the film set the tone, but the direction and history descended from there. In addition to a twist at the end (interesting and funny too), I would like this film to have a better direction and a more developed story. Without giving up the plot, the idea is better! I just wanted it to run better in this short film. The potential was there, but he simply did not deliver the goods.
