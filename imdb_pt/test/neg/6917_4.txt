Dr. Markoff is a wacky scientist who is experimenting, trying to find a cure for a viral cause of acromegaly. When he attends a piano concert, he is struck by the beautiful daughter of the pianist and begins to court her. But when she does not want anything to do with him, he infects his father with the acromegaly virus in an attempt to extort money and his daughter in exchange for a cure. <br /> <br /> This is the basic premise for this low budget B thriller. I have to say that I was disappointed with this movie. Not that it was terrible-it was not, but there was nothing particularly noteworthy either. It was fun enough for a vision, but it is not the one that will stay in my memory. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is a bit cheesy at times, and the acting is just mediocre. The story is quite predictable and gives us nothing new. Of course, I can not complain much about a movie that has a guy in a gorilla costume that serves almost no real purpose and a doctor with a Svengali look who fails to hypnotize his victims. <br /> <br /> It may be worth watching if you like this kind of movie, but do not come with too many expectations.
