After the success of Star Wars, there was an increase in interest in science fiction films. That was one of those cheap attempts to make a quick profit. <br /> <br /> A group of survivors of a spacecraft land on a planet inhabited by stop-motion dinosaurs, where half of them are systematically dead (people not the dinosaurs). Performance at the porn movie level. Cheap special effects, even for the season, though it seems a lot of effort has been put into them. <br /> <br /> Costumes were 1970s pure, as were the hairstyles. Ah, the 70s. I expected a disco to leave at any time. <br /> <br /> Nothing I really recommend in this movie.
