Hungary can not make good films. Fact that. This is a great example of this. <br /> <br /> First, the term "plot" does not exist in this movie. You're seriously weak. Even though many people argue with me about it. Of course, it's about a taboo, but that's about it. There are endless possibilities, which could have been really good, if used, but they almost jumped everything. I think the whole movie is just an excuse to show pictures, which are the only decent things in this whole pile of horrors. <br /> <br /> The acting is simply shit. There are not many lines, so you'd think the actors have great facial expressions or imitate skills, but they do not. In fact, 86% of the time, they are bad. And that's when they say nothing. If they say a single word, you will begin to bow your head, saying, "This is unrealistic." But, again, this is partly the fault of writing. There is also no emotion in most dialogues. <br /> <br /> The editing is sometimes good, but most often illogical and only makes the whole picture worse. It could have given an emotional boost, but it seems the issue here is about putting cuts one after another. <br /> <br /> Someone, please explain to me, why critics say that this movie is a masterpiece. Calling this "Art" will not improve. Sorry Mundruczo, but you failed. Live with it. Even though you probably will not mind my opinion or any other staff scarifying your "son".
