Is it just me or the fact that the evil racing team is Japanese and that their arrogant German star driver seems a little overdone? Maybe it's like that on the international racing circuit, but if all America represented them, they're idiots like Cody and his mechanic Chris (Peter Berg, who must have learned how to act), I'd be rooting for another country. Formula movies might be good, but the characters have to be nice and no one meets that criteria in this movie. To put it succinctly - a very bad movie.
