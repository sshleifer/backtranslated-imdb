I'm very interested in the overwhelmingly positive comments here. Despite having some good features, for the most part I found this movie heavy, predictable and, worst of all, not at all scary. The first 30 minutes of the film were promising, the actress did a good job on her portrait, and the world around her was thoughtful and meaningful. Unfortunately, from there, the film went into a downward spiral. I entered this movie with no clue as to what it would be - I knew nothing about the actors, directors, genre, etc. At one point, my wife made the remark "is this supposed to be scary?" movie? "Well, I suppose so, since the movie" horror movie, "full of squeaky violins and extended vibrato, could not mean anything more. the first moment, and the second half of the film went down deep into the realm of ridicule. A film like this runs along a dangerously narrow path, and unfortunately there comes a point where the viewer must decide whether to continue along this path, or simply laugh at the ridiculousness of all this.In the past 30 minutes, I chose the latter.
