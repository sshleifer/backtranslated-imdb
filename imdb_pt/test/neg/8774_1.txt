I waited a long time until I could watch this Lone Ranger movie. I finally got to see him on the Lone Star Channel today and I was really disappointed with the whole movie. Clayton Moore and John Hart acted better as Lone Rangers and Jay Silverheels as Tonto, than the two stars in this movie. Too bad performance was made by everyone in this movie. Even the plot was bad and very attractive. I believe the horse, playing Silver, was the best actor throughout this film. I'm glad I did not go out to buy a copy of this movie when it first came out because I feel like it's a waste of money. I really am sorry that the characters that Clayton Moore, John Hart and Jay Silverheels played, and brought to life on the silver screen, have been so stained. Unless, in the future, they find actors worthy of portraying the characters the way Clayton, John and Jay did so well in the past, I will not spend the money to buy the movie. I'm not going to watch this movie again. <br /> <br /> Wayne Davies
