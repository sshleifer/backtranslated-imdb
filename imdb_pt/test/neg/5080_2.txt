Seeing the names of the leading actors (Statham, Snipes and Phillippe), I thought the film should be at least decently funny or interesting. Instead, all I got was not just 92 boring minutes, but the frustration of knowing all that was about to happen and of listening to tons of silly and stupid "silly" phrases. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the movie does not have a good story to start. And when you have it, no one can help you, not Statham, not Wesley Snipes ... not even John McClane could save this movie :-) It could be cool for kids, if they're not over 12 years old, because they do not care so much about the story, and there are some big bangs in the movie.
