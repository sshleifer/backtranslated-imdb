<br /> <br /> Some years ago I bought a movie called The Cellar. I had heard it was supposed to be a great movie, but it turned out to be a flop and a B movie. The story is good, but there are no good effects in the movie. (Maybe they do not have enough money for that in the budget ???). <br /> <br /> If you choose to watch this movie, be sure to watch it three times. The first, only and last time !!!
