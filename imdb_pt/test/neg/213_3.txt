OK, I thought the trailer was pretty good so I was hopeful for this movie, and with the casting I was sure I could not have less than 6 in my books. However I was annoyed half an hour in history ... where normal movies look good, this movie reaches the bottom of the pit. SPOILER The guy everyone is trying to help is so careful with other people getting hurt in the midst of the mess he turns to save a homeless man and then he locks himself inside one of the armored trucks. Not only that, he constantly tries to catch the attention of other people, which endangers more people and shortens the story, the result is that he is responsible not only for the death of the homeless, but also for a policeman being shot and kidnapping of his younger brother ... ah, and all his colleagues died in disgrace. <br /> <br /> But in the end he is HAPPY because he has come back to himself in the midst of the effort, and if all his colleagues are dead instead of staying true to the plan and becoming millionaires. This movie has tried to be so politically correct that it makes me sick! Ruined a good story. It's a shame.
