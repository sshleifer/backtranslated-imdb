I just got "Farewell to the King" on the cable, and maybe it's just because I'm a girl, but I thought that was on the crazy side. The script and direction are pretentious (as soon as I discovered that John Milius was responsible, everything was clear). Supporting actors, in fact, were not bad - James Fox was excellent. The biggest disappointment was Nick Nolte, which I usually like. Once he's a native, he starts to speak a very rigid and blistering English, and half the time he seems a bit distracted, as if he had just smoked a bit of the generosity of the rainforest of Borneo. And then the end - what the ??? Learoyd just happens to be in the same boat as The Botanist (by the way, if the Botanist had left his girlfriend, or what?) ??? The boat only happens to strand conveniently near a mature island acquisition by an ex-headhunting exile from Anglo's crazy Army ??
