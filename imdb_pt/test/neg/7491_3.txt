The cast of Class C and poorly traveled scenes, complete with a terrible performance, also led me to believe that this would give a good release for the TV, like the presentation of a smallpox outbreak by FX. In my local blockbuster however, about 9 copies are kept on the shelves, none of which were checked when I rented the title (I wonder why ....) Anyway, this title was almost ridiculous in the "fear factor "the director was going to. The entire "death count" at the bottom of the screen completely contradicts the plot at times, such as when the helicopter was passing through Angola, and the toll was accelerating at a dizzying pace from 23 million to 24. However, when the movie ends (possibly several hours or even a day after the helicopter landed) the death toll counter is also readjusted as it was the moment the helicopter approached the area. The films end up leaving a huge ensemble in the whole plot, and God knows no one is waiting for the sequel. Anyway, do not rent this, I just advise you to see this if you got the title without monetary loss, and you're in the mood for a tacky thriller.
