A few years ago, I remember reading an essay on a feminist cinema theorist who briefly mentioned Rosalind Russell. This theorist wrote that the "strength" of the "strong women" Rozzie R. played in rests in part on his ability to defend his man (even when he was not worth it). <br /> <br /> I thought of this essay after watching 'Crimes of Passion'. Kathleen Turner exudes the same strength and style of Russell in his interpretation of the prostitute China Blue. She is the object of affection for two men: the manic priest, played by Anthony Perkins, and a very white white boy, whose marriage is slowly disappearing. And she will not let any of them have a piece of it until ... <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the ending - but I will say that this is the fantasy of Bland Whitebread Boy. No matter how much Ken Russell try, he can not disguise the fact that this movie is basically a melodrama of the 1940s for the MTV generation. Except for their regressive class and gender politics, these old black-and-white films look revolutionary in comparison.
