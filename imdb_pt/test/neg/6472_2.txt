This remake is titled "That Darn Cat", but D.C. the cat is more a sideline than the main character. Patti Randall was also not at all pleased with this remake. It reminded me of one of those high school goth idiots you've read about the ones who've been angry since the day they were born, so they end up setting fire to the rest of the school one day. Federal police officer, Kelso, was fine, but not as good as the original. I think Disney was trying to get Christina Ricci and Doug Doug (or whatever goofy name he got) into the stars, but they do not care about Hayley Mills and Dean Jones in the original. I am animal lover and cat lover and I do not blame D.C. for the remake to be much lower than the original movie. After all, they almost cut him off from the whole movie. All in all, a very poor remake.
