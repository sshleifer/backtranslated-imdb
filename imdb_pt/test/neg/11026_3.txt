Extremely stereotyped with logical holes of cosmic size and a pretense to comedy. Aw, poor NYC lawyer! He's just trying, and when he gets a pay cut, he does not go out to find another job, although he's one of the region's most respected lawyers. We see him arguing in court for others to come and congratulate him on his ardent and winning commitment, but he can not resist anyone in his company. At home, problems are ignored until people leave home. <br /> <br /> The only character you want to cheer is the last maid, who seems to be a human being who uses logic and communication to survive. world. How ridiculous that the housekeeper brings the lawyer and his wife a chicken and a wine on New Year's Eve because they feel sorry for them! (The bit is not played for laughter) <br /> <br /> Sorry, just unbelievable and with a ** SPOILER ** pat, everyone turns to 180 degrees ending. How did they get high-level stars for that? If I were in the studio, I would have sent this one back for a full rewrite.
