The stranger of Galaxina is not that it is extremely bad, although it is. The strange thing is that, despite being extremely bad, it's not funny. Extremely bad movies have their own particular imprint of unintentional humor - the secret of their success, you might say. But Galaxina is uniquely different - it's the worst nightmare of the MST3K, a bad movie in which the intentional * and * unintentional mood swings in the face. <br /> <br /> It's easy to find out why intentional jokes fail - and the reasons are quite varied. Sometimes it's a matter of time; sometimes it's a poorly crafted good idea (the * * human restaurant may have been hilarious, but it was not); sometimes it looks like there was some confusion in the cutting room, with the end line ending on the floor; and sometimes the jokes are just bad jokes. Bad films take their laughs out of such unintended confusion. It's harder to figure out why Galaxina can not laugh at it. Something is subtly wrong with the unintentional mood in this movie, just as something is wrong (not at all subtle) with the intentional mood. It's an extremely bad movie whose wickedness is not the redeeming quality it usually is. It is absolutely unique in my experience.
