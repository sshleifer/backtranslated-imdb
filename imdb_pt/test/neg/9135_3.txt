The first two films in this series stood out for their images of the natural world and ordinary people trapped in the middle of society. This movie does not have any of these natural scenes, which I understand is part of the argument, but it really does make the entire video component of the movie look like random images together - ones and zeros flying around, computer models of skeleton humans and so on onwards. Occasionally, filming is put into practice (the nationalism / finance segment around 35:00), but usually makes the video appear to have no meaningful content, and requires you to accept the context of the photographers instead of the context from the principal. It is not better than the video displayed on a karaoke machine. Three stars added to Philip Glass's soundtrack.
