Wow, what exciting visual effects. I also loved the costumes and the artwork, the circus and the ethereal feel of the film were sublime. It only required the viewer to worry about the fate of our protagonist. Because she's stuck in her imagination, there's never a danger feeling in contrast to, say, David Lynch's films that always haunt. It also draws attention to what age range this movie is intended for. Who would get involved? <br /> <br /> Mirrormask will obviously make comparisons with Labyrinth with the teenage / distressed theme, but unfortunately does not come close to delivering the same essence of Henson. The sick mother's theme is never fully explained and certainly not something you care about while licking eye drops. <br /> <br /> It is not agonizingly horrible to The Cell, nor as attractive as Labyrinth - a forgettable but good looking fantasy.
