Sad very sad. This movie has nothing (hmmm, well, maybe Sybil Danning) to keep it watching. It also hurt my eyes to see Linda Blair in this exploration film. She certainly deserves better. <br /> <br /> So what's the story? Let's see ... Director John Vernon puts the prisoners in pretty awe inspiring positions while Prisoner Sybil actually runs the arrest and little Linda must fight to survive ... Sounds like a B movie, huh? This is.
