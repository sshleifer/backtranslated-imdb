If you watched the show and love the league like me, then prepare to be disappointed. I went to the movies with a group of league fans and we all agreed that this movie was not as funny or gloomy as the previous three series. In my personal opinion, it was a money spinner. Writing was invented and the plot confusing - no, not confusing, just confused by what he was trying to do. It was self indulgence of the worst kind of writers who are far more talented than my pitiful critics. I hope that the league, at least, be honest with itself and recognize that this film is inferior to the three excellent series. I will not be buying despite possessing most of the memorabilia in the league.
