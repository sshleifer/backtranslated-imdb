University students (who are currently in their early twenties) on the Boston campus (which looks strangely like the Isle Of Man) are threatened by a ferocious monster (set during an episode of Blue Peter). The new teacher should save the day (Even though he's really ... Oh, who cares?) <br /> <br /> I'll start with the positives ... there's a good picture of new Eastenders gal Samantha A Janus can in the mandatory campus shower scene with his best friend Katy Lawrence. A bit of trivia: Katy was hired when she auditioned with her sister, as well as moral support for her brother, but eventually got a role. Oh Joy Chose from the dark to ... flash your attractive buttocks into a senseless scene added to titillation, then being killed 30 minutes for your troubles. His most recent (and only other credited role) is as Nurse Trainee # 5 at Atonement. I wonder if she took a look at Keira Knightly (if extras and stars can mix) and wondered: where did everything go wrong? <br /> <br /> I'll give you some tips Katy: If everything else is asked of the other British cast members who speak with American accents in a condemned mass marketing attempt, and the only person who can administer it is veteran Todd Jensen, native of the US B movie, you know you're in trouble. If you look at your salary receipt and it only covers your lunch and your bus ride home, you are not starring in a movie with a trillion dollar budget. If the premiere is frequented by many members of the fourth assistant director's family and causes giggles when the Stickyback tape monster rattles through the sewers, it should be clear to you that this is not exactly Alien. Or even a Critters IV, come to think of it. So, Katy, in your next life (I'm a Buddhist, see you), maybe you're a bit more selective in choosing your first feature film, rather than jumping impulsively into the first pile of garbage that opens in your direction. Blinking the skin on your first movie does not guarantee lasting success. Unless you're Sylvester Stallone. And he had the script for Rocky to support him. <br /> <br /> For all intents and purposes, that's like 0/10 a movie like I've seen. However, out of pure unintentional laughter and pure camping value, it gets a 1. Well done;)
