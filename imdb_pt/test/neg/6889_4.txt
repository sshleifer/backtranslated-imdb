The video case for this movie reads "A Story of Beauty, Passion and Forbidden Fruit". Are they talking about the same movie I just saw ?! They can not be, since the movie I just saw was beautiful but there was no passion and as for the fruit, this is all nonsense meant to attract the potential viewer to see this movie. If I had some passion or some life, I would have really liked this movie. Instead, it was an agonizingly slow and not particularly interesting movie that I definitely would not want to see again. It's not that it's a bad movie (after all, it's very well filmed), but it's unbelievable. I've been waiting for something exciting or interesting to happen, but then the movie is over. There was no great sense of excitement, mystery or anything - just a rather uninteresting story about a young woman becoming a maid and spending the next 10 years of her life working as a maid.
