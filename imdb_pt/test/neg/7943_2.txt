This movie definitely made me laugh, but that does not mean it was exactly funny. Well, then again, me and my friends had a lot of fun watching. <br /> <br /> I doubt there is anything about this movie that has not been done at least twice before, just like the plot itself. All characters are clich√©d roles in cardboard boxes that do not require acting skills; consequently, such skills are not delivered. We have the corrupt cop, a merciless murderer who claims to care about his men and their families, not caring about the people he throws on his forehead so close that blood spits on his face. We have the worn-out cop on the edge so pointed in the discussion boards of this film; we have the old one-day-old cop who almost everyone must have immediately identified as the most likely man inside, since he had more to gain and he did not utter a reliable word throughout the film. . About how to see-through like a glass house on a sunny day. The great black gangster king was a copy of all the great black kings in film history (they might have called him Marcellus Wallace), but a little tougher and relentless, because we must emphasize that we also know Laurence Fishburne. actually good movies. So finally we have the HIGHLY EDUCATED doctor who can not think of anything reasonable to do so the situation differs from his normal life and who spends most of the film sitting in a corner trying to figure out how to hold the gun she received. NOT USING. <br /> <br /> The whole story of the siege is not interesting, not original (having been used twice before), and this movie manages to add absolutely nothing of interest to it. There is the initial probe, then the siege placement, then the attack, then the escape attempts. Meanwhile, a bunch of stressed-out, stressed-out and frightened police officers and bandits are able to postpone a police assault team with high-tech equipment and the very important advantage of VISION. So again, in the deep night, with the power cut and with a snowstorm on top, there is definitely a lot of light coming in, so who really cares about the night vision. <br /> <br /> But the best part comes out well in the end. In the first scenes that show Precinct 13, we see that it is located in a periphery of an industrial city; factories and office buildings surround on all sides. From this point, the besieged walk maybe a hundred yards from a sewer and where do they end? Some alley ending right in the middle of a forest! A FOREST! Where did this forest come from? Who decided to put a pine forest in the middle of an industrial area? How is this forest, in the last scene, suddenly on a hill over the city in question, while in the scenes inside the forest looked deceptively flat? <br /> <br /> Here I leave the judgment for you and your common sense. Go and see this movie if you're looking for a good unintentional laugh, I really can recommend it.
