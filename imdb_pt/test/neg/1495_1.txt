A lot of teenagers get together to discuss their fears, but an uninvited guest has appeared and is killing everyone. Probably the worst horror movie of the 1990s, Camp Blood (1999) is the only film that could challenge him for that title, has some of the most stupid characters and situations to decorate a television screen . The so-called surprise ending is horrible, just like the rest of the movie. Gently fun in a sooo bad is good level. My rating: 2 out of 10.
