This was an abysmal show. In short, it was about this boy named Doug, who was very much to blame. Seriously, he could feel guilty for killing a fly and feel guilty for feeling guilty for having killed the fly and so on. The animation was annoying and unpleasant and the jokes were cheap. <br /> <br /> It aired here in Sweden as part of the "Disney time" show and I remember liking it a bit, but then I turned 13. <br /> <br /> I never understood why some of the characters were green and purple as well. What happened to that? <br /> <br /> Truly a horrible show. Apparently it spawned a movie that I have never seen, but I also do not have high expectations for this movie.
