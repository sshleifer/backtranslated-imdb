This movie is full of pseudo deep thought and is cloying in his writing-ness, which includes a canned ham voice and some unbelievable dialogue. Dialogue that is small and deaf, like Spike sometimes (not always) when writing "certain" characters. For those who like movies like Pieces of April and One Hour Photo, this is another one for you. <br /> <br /> That said, this comment is nothing short of Ryan Gosling, who showed off his great skills at The Believer. A film that proves that cinema is the medium of a director, and when a movie is rotten, it is fair to say that the fault is there and not in the actors.
