Celebrity singers have always had a hard time invading movies (the movie is full of frustrated attempts), and one can continue to speculate why John Mellencamp was never successful as an actor. Instead of taking small parts on heartfelt projects, Mellencamp plunges himself into the role of "Falling From Grace," which he also directed, and the results are as awkward and improper as this title. Story of a famous singer returning to his hometown at the baton, opening old family wounds, features a script by Larry McMurtry, but the winding movie takes nowhere slowly. The supporting cast is decent, including Kay Lenz (which is always good to see), Mariel Hemingway and Claude Akins (who share the really strong picture scene). As for John's acting, he does not seem particularly comfortable, despite apparent efforts to make him look at home; he seems to be lowering the camera most of the time, and he never connects with the audience in an immediate way. * 1/2 of ****
