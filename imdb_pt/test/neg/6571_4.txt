Supposedly, director William Shatner had in mind a much more "bleak" movie when it came to "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier," but those on Paramount, looking at the huge box office receipts taken by his humorous predecessor. insisted that the new film had lots of laughs as well. So what we have is arguably the weakest and dumbest of the six Star Trek movies with the original cast. There are many bad ideas along with some good ones, and if you're in a charitable mood, you could look at 'The Final Frontier' the same way you would in an episode of the TV series. On the plus side, Laurence Luckenbill is a great actor and does one of the best 'guest actor' performances on any Star Trek screen, big or small, with William Windom's Commodore Decker. His interpretation of Sybok, Spock's half-brother, always raises the film when he threatens to sink, which happens very often. Charles Cooper is also good as the old fat Klingon General Korrd; Too bad his role is not as big as him. If the story about Shatner's intentions is true then I owe you an apology because I was prepared to put the blame for the incessant nonsense and not very convincing action scenes directly on their feet. The reason is that I've always felt that, of all Trek goers, Shatner was the least "tuned" in everything that makes Star Trek work and what makes it special to his fans. Having read his memoirs of Trek, it is very evident to me that he considered the show another series of action and adventure that happened to have a science fiction scenario. He preferred Gene Coon's vision to that of Gene Roddenberry; Coon was known for his work on the popular western series "The Wild Wild West." Shatner also mentioned that a favorite episode of Star Trek was "A Piece of the Action," a silly episode of the second season co-written by Coon. So finally, given the opportunity to direct a Star Trek movie, Shatner would not follow his instincts and produce an action movie with a lot of ironic humor? Well, somebody did, because that's what 'The Final Frontier' turned out to be. Shatner, himself, definitely returns to graduate as The Great Ham and, as Leonard Maltin points out, the film suffers from a bad case of "cutes". At the opening scene of Yosemite National Park, it's hard to say what's worse, special effects or divine dialogue. The jokes about the malfunctioning of the equipment on the Enterprise ran all the way from "Wrath of Khan" and with it, the fifth film in the Trek series, ran to the floor. So you have the idea of ​​a "skeleton team". A new development is an apparent romantic relationship between Scotty and Uhura and suffice to say that one does not exactly perceive flames of passion burning between the two. It is a meaningless subframe and adds nothing. The climatic scene in which "God" is found does not add much; whether this was a good idea or not, in the first place, is debatable, but the scene itself does not make much sense. (The creature's 'God' abilities seem to vary according to what is needed at the moment.) About half of this is a retread tired of the climax of 'The Search for Spock.' Leonard Nimoy manages to rescue Spock's integrity, even as he swears lines like "Catch up, Doctor." And DeForest Kelley, as always, outshines both Shatner and Nimoy; he actually appeared as an actor in the final Trek films. So this Trek out is not terrible, just not very good. There would be one more original Trek movie before the stick was passed to the "next generation", and was much more suited to the task than "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier."
