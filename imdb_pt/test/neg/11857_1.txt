Roger Corman has enjoyed his share of cinematic infamy in his illustrious low-budget career spanning more than 300 films. While few (if any) would call him great, the obscure links of his films to clandestine culture (through references, tributes, or influences) earned him a deformed legacy. Throughout his career, he also developed a lousy habit of redoing his own films ("Piranha," "Humanoids from the Deep," etc.) without improving them at all. "Raptor", "written" and "directed" by "Jay Andrews" (Jim Wynorski, the man behind one of my favorite cinematic guilty pleasures, "Chopping Mall") takes this practice to a new and disturbing low Corman's 90's. Trilogy "Carnosaur". <br /> <br /> Wynorski's credits are quoted because "Raptor" is not a tribute to the films "Carnosaur", not even a remake. "Raptor" are the "Carnosaur" films, or at least the dinosaur-induced death scenes in the film, randomly combined with original plot traits and some newly filmed scenes (many of which consist of "dinosaur-vision" a Failed attempt to make inserted scenes less obvious). The "new" material has been written around filming, rather than vice versa, and is totally normal, with huge gaps in logic (for example, two separate teams are sent by the military simply by footage from parts 2 and 3, where the soldiers had different uniforms, could be included), which is incredible considering how little logic plays in any of the "Carnosaur" movies anymore. The lack of any sense of the actors in their characters (although fair, any dimension of character is only presented in script once, perhaps twice) brings to mind the terribly wooden acting in the 1950s b movies, and certainly does nothing between the stolen attack scenes that are worth watching. Even more embarrassing for the actors in the new scenes is when there is an obvious discrepancy in the physical construction between the new actor and the actor in the original scene. When the only scene that evokes any response in a movie is the oldest trick in the horror book, the "spring loaded animal," something is seriously wrong. <br /> <br /> As it stands, this is a despicable practice in two b-class figures (who do not have to worry about ruining their reputations, because they do not have one) by pulling out their own material, cheaply and quickly of dirty tricks, simply because they can (why would someone else feel possessed? tear out a series to be a rip-off of the "Jurassic Park" series?). There is not much else I can say besides that this movie carries my highest recommendations AGAINST viewing; the only good thing about it (besides looking at Melissa Braselle's navel) is that now I do not have to see any of the "Carnosaur" movies.
