The Untold ... It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story really looks original, but was misplaced on the screen. Lance Henriksen, a good actor, ended up in this crap. But, hey he made a lot of low budget movies ... you need to pay the bills, you know? Playing. Lance is a great actor, but he did away with this bunch of silly actors. Seriously, Andrea Roth was just there to have a nudity scene, and other actors ... well, they were there. There has been a constant fading in editing, and that makes me sick! This was the most horrible move that keeps coming and really pisses you off. It was also very predictable, annoying and slow. It has a bizarre time that just goes ... wrong. <br /> <br /> I can not say more ... do not rent it or buy it. You can watch it on TV.
