No, it's just a cheap 1940 serial using the good name of Cap. If you're a comic book fan, you'll be very disappointed. They radically changed the character. No shield, no Bucky, no fighting against the Nazis, no wings beside his mask and more importantly: Captain America is now a district attorney and is no longer a soldier. <br /> <br /> Dick Purcell as Captain America? Do not look too closely when it turns into your costume. It's pretty obvious he was not in top physical shape when he made this series (can you say flabby?). It is also VERY obvious that a stuntman is performing most of the action here. Almost every chapter has a mandatory fight that is filmed and performed in exactly the same way. The villain is rather dull and, although he uses a pseudonym (The Scarab), he does not wear disguise of any kind. The story is repetitive and very simple. The effects are laughable and the action is average. On the plus side, we have sexy Lorna Gray as D.A.'s assistant and the good Captain can ride a cool-looking motorcycle in one of the first chapters. Overall OK, but nothing special.
