Every movie that Quentin Tarantino did became progressively worse. I would like to believe that most people would agree with this statement, but seeing as "Inglourious (sic) Basterds (sic)" has a 8.5 / 10 out of over 100,000 ratings, it does not seem like the overall film goes public has any meaning. Even his best work, Reservoir Dogs, was not a "masterpiece". The problem is that claiming that you like Tarantino's work has become fashionable. Once that happens, you have many people ready and willing to embark on another wave. They will ignore ridiculously terrible acting, and write totally self-indulgent just so they can be part of the exclusive club called "all". This movie is so terrible, I swear it must be some kind of distorted joke by Tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and still praise him. As another commentator has said, "Tarantino's previous films were from a guy who was in love with other movies. This is from a guy in love with his own writing." I could not agree more. This film is nothing more than self-indulgent writing and with inner joke combined with the acting ability taken from a high school play. But thanks to the fact that the movie is generally going public, I'm sure it will remain one of the best movies ever made. Bravo, Tarantino. You took one of the best practical jokes of all time.
