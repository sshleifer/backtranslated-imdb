Steven Seagal is back! Here with your third movie released this year. Of course, as a fan of being increasingly discontented, I can say that it's not surprising that this is too bad. Firstly, the film made headlines because of apparent production problems due to Seagal. He arrived late on set, changed script, staff etc. and usually caused problems for the director, Don E Faun Leroy (his lack of talent was enough!). This also happens in his second collaboration, the next Mercenary, which promises to be as bad as this junk. It also marks a major turning point in Seagal's career, because this film is his first to truly extract the footage. There was a bit in Ticker, but this movie takes the cookie. They borrow from "The Order" (Van Damme's film, Seagals' biggest rival in digital TV movies!), No Code of Conduct, Uncontested, and also a whole action sequence from the well-known Peter Weller, starring Top Of The World. Curiously, the car chase stolen from Weller's epic, made almost 10 years ago and, ironically, probably cheaper than this junk, is by far the best action scene in the film. I was shocked enough when Dolph Lundgren had a brief period in the world of stocks, which fortunately he escaped. Seagal is currently the DTV stock market leader, with Van Damme and Snipes as its main rivals. Seagal still manages to sell movies and, for my life, I do not know how. Certainly the fans must be getting bored with this horror, yearning for a return to the likes of Above The Law. The story here is totally stupid. In fact, the film has so many plot holes that you can not think. For example, at the end of a movie, there is a little girl Seagal apparently meets in an orphanage to whom he gives a necklace. Because I do not know, but we never see her in the rest of the movie, or we hear her mention. Seagal has a girlfriend in this movie that at the beginning of the film is with a psychic and she becomes haunted by visions, which until the end of the film are never explained and mean nothing. The film is so ridiculously glued by a series of senseless paps that it becomes a headache inducer. This is by far the most idiotic film of Seagal! Seagal himself is more wood than ever, however, to his credit, he is not nicknamed in this one as far as I could tell. Seagal, however, feels the need to speak as if he were a gangsta rapper, making me anxious for the days when he would use his Brooklyn / Italian-American accent in his early classic films. He also has a painfully embarrassing double act with Treach, which I presume to be a rapper. It's funny how the producers seem to think that the combination of Seagal plus the hip-hop star seems to work because their team with DMX in Exit Wounds was their most successful film since Under Siege. Obviously, if no one has heard of the rapper, it will not work. This is an action movie and therefore the action itself should be judged. Unfortunately, the action that did not come from the previous NU Image catalog is strictly routine. There are a few small fight scenes with some Seagal aikido classics, but when 90% is performed by your stunt double, who really has a rigorous job in this movie, it does not really impress much. There are also some standard gun fights that really only have some nice violent and bloody squibbage going for them. In short, this is a painfully boring experience and once again I have to give the same verdict: Seagal lost! I keep asking the question of years now, "Why do people still watch their movies?" This is very good and good as a question, but the sad bastard that I am continues to watch his films in the illusory hope that he can do something good again. Chances are small, unlike Seagal's ever-growing waistline. * 1/2
