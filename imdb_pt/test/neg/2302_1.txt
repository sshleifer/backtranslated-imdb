So I rented this movie hoping to learn about the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the beginning of its independence from the Belgian domain. I was excited to get acquainted with the numbers involved in his story, especially Lumumba and Mobutu. I wanted to see how the new Congolese government tried to bring together the various groups opposed to the colonial government, the political motives behind each one, the reasons behind Belgium's decision to give independence to the DRC and also how the US and the ex -URSS involved. Unfortunately, all my questions went largely unanswered. I believe this film was made by people who, through a passing familiarity with the history of the DRC's struggle for freedom, saw a story full of drama and emotion, and decided to exploit it. They then tried to put all the dramatic points in a plot, filled them briefly with dialogues, went to the set and filmed. I may be wrong, but if it is so, it's all sadder, because then the creators must have simply got too caught up in everything, and they ended up covering up every detail in an effort to create a comprehensive story. Whatever the reason, the fact is that the film can be a timeline of statements and facts with long phrases printed on the screen. The film goes through every important occurrence and tells the viewer, at point-blank range, the main idea about what is happening, completely softening the real details in favor of overcoming the great things. For example, there is the scene in which Lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebel army controlled by Mobutu. In the situation, the soldiers have three possible points of view: one that sympathizes with Lumumba, one that vilifies Lumumba and another that is in the middle, sympathizing and obeying the orders. Correspondingly, there are three soldiers who speak on the scene, uttering lines that show without adhering their views. So to avoid dealing with the real tensions that these opposing points of view bring, the writers simply inserted a few random shots, more expensive of the army appeared and ended up beating everyone. This is the extent of the film's reflexivity. Most of the time, each character simply declares their basic motives, the other characters respond with theirs and that's it. There is little telling through actions; even the things they say are direct to the point of being painful. It is hard to believe that the people represented actually acted like this. Moreover, in the tendencies of this frankness, things like political tension between factions are reduced to mere acknowledgment of fact - we never learn what these factions are, what they are fighting, their power, basically anything except they exist. The characters are also one-dimensional and flat; unfortunately I do not know if Lumumba was actually a freedom fighter dedicated to the ideals of the Congolese unit, but after an hour or more of the film I certainly did not trust that to tell me that. The DRC, like many developing countries, has a complicated and important history, especially in the period before and after independence. But reporting these stories will not be useful unless there is recognition of the complexity of situations. Lumumba does not pay enough attention to these details, and ends up telling the viewer little, except the more general of the outlines.
