First of all, no one with any law enforcement experience (not ER or EMT, but actual law enforcement) takes this show seriously. Walker would be expelled from any US police force for his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics. In addition, he is a comic book character - no acting ability, incredibly banal lines, no character development. The fact that Alex Cahill loves him shows how blondes are dumb. And Trivett is the last black-faced clown. Come on - if you think Walker is a sincere show with no preconceptions, then explain why JT is treated like an idiot, is always the subject of Walker jokes, is never allowed to be the one to solve the crime, and never rescues Walker , who should be dead 50 times for the stupid things he does. While it may be true that many criminals are even dumber than detectives who chase them (and, believe me, most cops are dumber than dirt), the smart ones Walker faces never seem to understand that once Walker is caught , the idiot needs to be put down from his misery. But again, Norris produced the show and starred, so how could he get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactic is? As if six guys waited to catch him one at a time. What a terrible series! It's more degrading than any of the disguised westerns like The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, The Cisco Kid, and Wild Bill Hickock, though I imagine most of you here are too young to remember these shows. But like these shows, in the same way that these shows, Walker TR is so insulting and simply silly.
