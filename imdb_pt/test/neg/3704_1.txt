This movie is the worst I've ever seen. You may think that you have seen some bad movies in your time, but if you have not seen this, you do not know how terrible a movie can be. But wait, there is worse news! The studio will soon relaunch this masterpiece (I'm being ironic) for all to see! The only things worse than the plot of this film are effects, acting, direction and production. Bill Rebane, the poor man Ed Wood (not that there's a rich man like Ed Wood) (I like Ed Wood's films, though) manages to keep things to the rhythm of a snail throughout this movie. It starts with catching a bigfoot baby (a small foot? - sorry, could not avoid) by a pair of nasty hunters, who are killed by their parents. This causes the entire city where hunters lived to go on a Bigfoot hunting jihad. This is very beautiful for the plot. Nothing even remotely interesting happens, and we viewers are never able to worry about any of the characters. If anyone is interested in the Rebane movies I would recommend almost anyone else about it. However, as I said, it will soon be relaunched by Troma, in order to annoy a new generation of viewers.
