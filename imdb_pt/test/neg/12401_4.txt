Of all the movies in movie history, I can not imagine anyone sitting down saying I want to spend an X amount of dollars (or pounds sterling) to remake that imperfect classic movie called "Creators." Many stories have been turned into movies about meteors coming to earth with something sinister lurking inside. Why not put your money into making a spectacular 3D remake of "It Came from Outer Space"? Why look for a dirty nudie film that existed just for the purpose of displaying a set of monsters and naked cohorts? Was the script for the 1986 version of "Breeders" so inspiring that these producers felt it had to be done again and this time done right? When you come to this conclusion, the only reason this movie exists is to show Britcom's cute pie, Samantha Janus. But if you're going to do a skin movie and explore Sam Janus, you better have her more naked than that and get naked more often than that if you want to succeed. <br /> <br /> Meteor lands. .. monster escapes ... coeds duff their clothes ... monster eats people ... and another "what if?" Honestly, I never thought I'd recommend the original "Creators" over any other movie, but this would be the one to come second to it.
