The novel WEAPON, which serves as the basis for this heinous piece of crap, is one of the best techno-thrillers to come down to the ludic in a long time. The character of SOLO, who should NOT resemble a human, is a wonderful creation and it was simply horrible to see him reduced to just one more clone Terminator with Mario Van Peebles horrendously trying to "act" like a robot. There is nothing worthwhile about this movie. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood insist on snatching the rights to excellent novels and then massacring them? There are so many wrong things in SOLO that listing them seems as unfair as inviting a man without legs to a quick game of Amarelinha. Avoid this horrible movie and look for the two ROBERT MASON novels that characterize the incredible character of SOLO. The books are WEAPON and an excellent sequel ONLY. But do not pay attention to this terrible movie.
