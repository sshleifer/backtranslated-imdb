I saw this in the movies during its initial release and I can only ask "has the world gone crazy?" The seemingly overwhelming positive response is incomprehensible to this deceptively written and embarrassingly predictable trap of applause. Stephan Elliot is not a genius filmmaker as evidenced by the consistent bombs he's produced since then (check out 'Welcome to Woop'). Woop, 'Eye of the Beholder') <br /> <br /> I can only assume that making a movie dealing with gay / transgender culture has people assuming that not liking the movie is an offense to this section of the population. Are not we smarter than that? How about an interesting script and good performances? Ok, so the 3 leaders are fine considering what they have to work on, but this movie includes the worst performance of a child actor I've ever seen, not helped by a terrible dialogue and a very bad resolution that you can see at one mile away. This is a disappointing movie that does not deserve the overrated reputation it has accumulated.
