This is possibly the worst thing I've ever seen on television. First, I'm pretty sure that this takes itself entirely seriously, and I tend to be very good at recognizing satire. Second, it exhibits Aristotelian levels of chauvinism; In one of the ads, one of the "playas" describes women in terms of "quality." Third, every competitor I've seen in him (six, I think) was an idiot of the variety that probably owns a Facebook with "BONING U" or "WOMEN" inscribed in "Here For". To paraphrase Roger Ebert, this does not shave the bottom of the barrel, nor does it deserve mention in the same phrase of the barrels. The closest thing to a redeeming feature I experienced in connection with the VIP Key was having a friend assure me that the male cast was in fact the opposite of attractive in both physical and mental terms.
