while the mind of mencia could be summed up as nothing more than a clone of Chappelle's program, it is actually worse than that. First of all, Carlos Mencia is a jacka ** who is as funny as he is original, which is not saying much. the show contains fake US television advertisement frauds and political issues, and the "comic" view of politics over politics contributes to the low quality of this program. on top of everything, mencia plays in the most idiotic ethnic jokes and has stolen Jeff's foxworthy lines from what I can count on one hand. while from time to time Carlos has a cheap laugh, the rest of the time he passes insults to everyone in sight, which includes the exploration of his own members of the audience. with the exception of South Park together, and Friday night standing, this show marks the end of the glory days of Chappelle's show, which for those of you who did not hear, was before he went to Africa.
