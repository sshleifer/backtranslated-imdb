Is it a poorly crafted and clich√© pile of rubbish? Clear. Anyone who does not realize that when they pick up the box from the video store, they probably have no right to judge the movies in the first place. So, I will now assess the aspects of the film that we really care about on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /> <br /> Violence and violence: 4 - For this genre, there are very few deaths, and blood is almost non-existent. Anyone looking for a little blood should probably look elsewhere. The only redeeming quality is the fact that children are doing these horrible things, which raises the bar level slightly. <br /> <br /> Suspense: 1 - Ok, I feel bad for anyone who gets scared by this trio of idiots. Nude / Sex: 7 - Much boobage from three different women, one of whom is MTV's Julie Brown. There are two sex scenes, but little is shown in them. <br /> <br /> Unintentional humor - 4 - There are some good laughs with kids trying to act scary, but after all, it's just bad, not funny bad. <br /> <br /> General - 4 - It is not unwatchable. There are some fun moments and nudity enough to keep your attention throughout the movie. However, just watch this movie if you are a big fan of the horror movies of the 80s. This definitely falls on the lower end of the scale, but it is not all the way down the bottom. The real downside is the disappointing end. It almost ruined the movie for me.
