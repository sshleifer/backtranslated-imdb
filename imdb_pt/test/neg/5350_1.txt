This movie endorses self-righteousness! Grant freedom to a black man who killed the men who raped his daughter and in the end he is free of scandals! However despicable it may be, there is also adultery in this film. The character of Connaughey has a penchant for the Bullock character and the film has some of these stereotypes of experimental films (such as the important news brought to court at the right time) that make every movie goer aesthetically demanding like me sick! I really can not believe anyone liked this crap. It's such a bad movie and holding false ideals that I can not put my critic in an eloquently pleasing way. When the American people will wake up and find they're being manipulated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for movies like these that turn reality into a bit of BS, where there's justice for everyone if they put it in their hands ? This cowboy attitude only makes me sick and in my eyes represents all that is wrong with America!
