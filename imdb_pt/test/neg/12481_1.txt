The latter fulci schlocker is a totally abysmal mix that deals with an incurable player (Brett Halsey) who decides to Bluebeard style to pay off his ever-rising debts, seducing some of the ugliest bitches you'll ever put your eyes on and that just by chance they are rich widows! The script written by Fulci also includes some black comic elements - which only result in bland business involving a corpse that does not stand still, an opera singer who does not stop singing, etc. - not to mention doppelganger theme straight from THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE - although in this case, the two people communicate through pre-recorded radio messages !! In the end, I can not say that I'm surprised that this film shows no sign of Mario Bava's (1970) MATCHADOR FOR THE HONEYMOON sophistication that resembles in many ways and that he is content to simply accumulate the disgusting (but not very convincing) effects of dismembered limbs and crushed or melted faces with which, unfortunately, Fulci had become fully associated.
