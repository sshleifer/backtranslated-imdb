Mount Godwin-Austin (also known as K2) is the second highest mountain in the world, and it is believed that the evidence presented in this film is the most difficult mountain to successfully climb without being killed. "K2" is basically a movie of friends set in the incredibly dangerous world of mountaineering. While outdoor photography has a truly incredible setting, the characters in front of all these glorious landscapes are a huge hassle - and there's the flaw with the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Cocksure lawyer Taylor Brooks (Michael Biehn) and his calm and married friend Harold Jamieson (Matt Craven) spend their free time climbing. During one of their journeys, they meet another band of mountain climbers financed by the Philip high mountain enthusiast Claibourne (Raymond J. Barry). Claibourne's team is in training for the next scene of the infamous K2, a mountain that Taylor and Harold would love to face but who could never afford it. During training, however, two members of Claibourne's team are killed in an avalanche. Taylor and Harold present themselves as potential substitutes. Despite their initial reluctance, Claibourne gives them the nod and the pair are joining their team in the Himalayas. Harold's wife, Cindy (Julia Nickson-Soul), is upset that her husband will face such a dangerous climb, especially since he recently became a father. Tensions on the climbing team increase as Taylor repeatedly collides with another member of the group, the equally daring and arrogant Dallas Woolf (Luca Bercovici). Meanwhile, Claibourne himself becomes increasingly sick when altitude sickness affects his body. Will the guys get to the peak of K2, or is their mission bound to end in deception, or even death? <br /> <br /> "K2" spends an excessively long time introducing his somewhat unpleasant characters. Biehn as an aggressive, aggressive and aggressive type is especially hard to like, just like Barry as the mountaineer millionaire. But on the other side of the coin, Craven is so monotonous that it becomes hard to believe that his wife could give a shit to him to climb out to climb K2 - heck, she'd be better off if he never came back !! Completing the main characters is Bercovici, whose characterization as Dallas Woolf is as extravagant and exaggerated as any other role he has ever played. Is the story itself tame and disposable? just a straight line over guys trying to reach the top of a mountain. There's a bit of a male connection, but the whole subplot about Harold and his wife is nil, and the clashes between Taylor and Dallas are totally false. "K2" scores its few merits solely from the dazzling cinematography of Gabriel Berastain? during the sequences of the Himalayas, the scale and fear of the mountains are well captured. I'm completely down with critic Kim Newman about this, who hilariously stated in Empire magazine: "Based on that evidence, climbing the K2 can not be harder than standing out!" It's quite true, Kim, it's quite true!
