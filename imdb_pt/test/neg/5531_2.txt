Dirty and horrible, I was not surprised that this short show did not happen. I remember fondly when Tales From the Crypt tried to reuse these tacky episodes as if they were really scary. Along with the bad acting and bad music, I was surprised that this crummy show was already conceived. It never came again, and we can only thank for this circumstance.
