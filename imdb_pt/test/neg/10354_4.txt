I being from Australia and loving the series, I did not expect much from the American version of Kath and Kim, but I thought I'd watch the first episode to see if it was really that bad. <br /> <br /> Well, what's there to say? It's nothing special. Mrs Blair is just like Kim and actually had some good lines, Molly Shannon is not a good Kath though. The good thing about Jane Turner's Kath is that when she talks in all her funny accents (like when she says Yumor or Noice) it sounds like it's just the natural way she talks, but when Shannon has an accent in the accent, of course that she is acting and trying to be the same as Turner. And the show really misses Sharon or someone else to give us something to laugh about, because the Kal and Craig characters in this version are not funny. <br /> <br /> So far, only the first episode has been aired. clearly does not live up to the standards of the Australian version, although it was an independent television show with a different name, not being compared to the Australian version, it might have been seen as being a bit better. But if there's nothing else to do on a Sunday night (or Thursday night in America), then you can not do too badly at watching it, or rather put a bit of the Australian version if you have it .
