The movie starts with a lot of voice, a bad sign. Then it just goes down hill with silly scenes and insults of intelligence involving hunters and Indians. But, it reaches new and impressive lows when all the men of the mountain have fun dancing in a high alpine meadow. Meanwhile, the cheerful Indians sit around watching them. It's a better scene than the dancing cowboys in "Blazing Saddles." There is a small flaw in this comparison; "Across the Wide Missouri" is not a comedy. <br /> <br />
