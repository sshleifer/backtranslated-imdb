So Seagal plays a DEA detective named John Hatcher, who lost his partner in a drug investigation, a surprise surprise for Colombia! Not to boast or anything, but my father was born and raised in Colombia (hence my surname), and now he's a doctor in California, so no matter what the movies want you to believe, there are other things besides drug dealers and cocaine coming out of Colombia! <br /> <br /> Anyway, in a bad drug seizure, Hatcher loses his partner and accidentally kills a naked Colombian prostitute, inspiring him to confess, somewhere I've never seen him go on some your movies, sooner or later. It was really very interesting. Seagal tends to seem almost asexual as he has never been much involved with women, except as a plot device and the way the occasional attempt at seduction, whether by a stripper or a lover, never arouses the slightest interest. he. He's a mean man all the time. <br /> <br /> But in the confessional, he confesses to lying, selling drugs, fake evidence, and even sleeping with informants to get the information he needs to get the thugs behind bars (hopefully I'm not getting into trouble with God saying that?). The priest tells him to go to his family, so he decides it's time to retire from the force. <br /> <br /> The next third of the film is an exercise in the thin paper characterization of Seagal films. Marked For Death is the story of Seagal against a bunch of Jamaican mystic dealers, and these guys have no discernment about pushing their products in broad daylight. <br /> <br /> Hatcher comes back to visit his old high school trainer, Max (a minimal effort from Keith David), and right in the middle of the practice, there are some of these idiots trapped in the arcade preaching the cracks in some high school girls who look like a worm. <br /> Maybe I had a sheltered high school experience but I did not know crack dealers and crack addicts were in SCHOOL in the middle of the day. Anyway, it does not take long for Hatcher to figure out how these guys are evil. They are not only selling crack to high school kids, but the coach has lost football players regularly to their drugs, they get involved in smart looks with Max, and as that is not enough, his 13-year-old niece died in his crackhouse <br /> <br /> Oh, okay. We have the photo. I'm sure they also torture puppies and beat old women, and maybe steal candy from children too, just in case. Is it really so difficult to establish who the bad guys are? 13-year-old niece died in her crackhouse. Wow. <br /> <br /> Anyway. The film not only does not know how to develop villains without resorting to what basically boils down to movie scourging, where bad deeds are attributed to them superficially through dialogue, but they also do not know how to act. <br /> <br /> The leader of the drug dealers is called Screwface, and I suppose I should just tell you something about what kind of movie that is. Screwface is a Jamaican caricature man with these bizarrely bright green eyes, which I think should be an important part of his character because he spends a good majority of his time on the screen with his eyes half bulging out of his head. His favorite means of intimidation is to scream loudly in his wildly wild Jamaican accent with his face literally less than an inch away from whoever he is screaming at. This guy likes to get into the faces of the guys that he has to turn his head to the side so that his noses do not touch. All I could think was how the poor would deal with his breathing. <br /> <br /> Man, they do not want you to forget that these guys are Jamaican, by the way. His accents are so exaggerated and exaggerated that for most of the film, it is almost impossible to understand them. Not that it matters. No matter what they're saying, all you need to know is that everything that comes out of their mouths is some kind of evil thing related to the drug, they're just the psychopaths that sell drugs and kill people. The film must have been a huge success in Jamaica! <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the movie is that the theatricality, particularly of the bad guys, as I have described, is spectacularly goofy even for a Seagal. movie. They are so caricatured and strange that it is impossible to regard them as anything other than a silly b-movie creation, something made to provide food to whom Seagal can distribute his trademark characteristic of retrograde revenge. <br /> <br /> But there's also a bizarre kind of mysticism in the movie that makes everything look weird. For example, a mystic, I think you could call her, at one point puts some kind of curse on Screwface (if I remember correctly) spitting bits of Bacardi into a live rooster that is hung upside down before beheading- and drip your blood a picture of Screwface. Hmm. Interesting. <br/> <br/> Unfortunately, it is this same woman who tells Hatcher that her family has been "marked to death" by these people, which means they have a bit of sorcery against them. Do not disparage anyone, but if you told me that my family had been cursed by such people, I would just laugh at it. Hatcher does not strike me as the kind of guy who gives a lot of voodoo curses. <br /> <br /> But the set-up, as you can see, is quite normal for a Seagal movie. Only villains, I think you could say, though not very impressive. Definitely the weirdest movie from the start of Seagal's career?
