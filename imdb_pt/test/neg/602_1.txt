This movie had horrible lighting and terrible camera moves. This movie is a horror movie with no meaning. The cuts are totally false. It seems that some 17-year-old idiot wrote this movie and a 10-year-old boy filmed it. With the worst performance you can find. People are tired of knives. At least get into the guns or shoot. It has almost exact lines of "When A Stranger Calls". With horrible deaths, only crazy people would enjoy this movie. It is obvious that the writer has no children and does not care about them. I mean, show some pity. Just to summarize, this movie is a "B" movie and sucks. Just for your own good, do not even think about wasting your time watching this fucking movie.
