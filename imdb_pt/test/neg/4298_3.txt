I do not see the good sense in going through so much trouble making a movie like that, and then throwing the storybook out the window. There was not one precise detail in that film other than the fact that Richtofen was dead, so I was grateful in the end, so I did not have to watch. Movies like this are an insult to anyone who knows anything about the history of World War I. <br /> <br /> I'll skip the obvious, that they were flying Fokker DVII in 1916, because Blue Max did it either, or that The 209 squadron was flying in the SE-5 and would attack other parts. On the one hand, they call the Pfalz D-III an "Ancient Albatross" at the beginning. On the other hand, they have Voss, Goring and Wolff all in Jasta Boelcke. The only one who was in that Jasta was Voss, and he joined after Boelcke died. Richtofen was not blamed for Boelcke's death ... Erwin Boehme, who collided with Boelcke, turned aside to avoid a British plane that Richtofen was chasing. When Richtofen received his wound in the head, it was while attacking a two-seat F-2d, and he did not collide with the trenches and made soldiers fight for him, and NO..Werner Voss did not die that day. He died on September 28 in one of the most epic battles of World War I. Manfred was short, not like the actor who stood above all others. His brother Lothar had never been to Jasta Boelcke, he joined the squad when Manfred was in charge of Jasta 11. <br /> <br /> There are so many other glaring errors in the historical fact that I let them go, except perhaps the worst, the death scene In the movie Manfred is maneuvered by Brown and then shot down, making a perfect landing. Brown had a blast at Richtofen while Richtofen chased May, and the facts accumulated over the years show that Richtofen was killed by fire on the ground, not by Brown. <br /> <br /> The only value in this movie was chance to see the flight scenes themselves, which were as good as The Blue Max, plus I'm not going to watch it again and I paid $ 30 for it ribbon!
