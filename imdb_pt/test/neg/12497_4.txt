Synopsis of the plot: Los Angeles in the future. The crime is kept under control by Core Trackers, androids murderers sent by the United States Computerized Judicial System to execute the guilty. Secret Service agent Eric Phillips prevents an attack on his boss, Senator Robert Dilly (the man who created the USCJS), the Union for Human Rights, a group of anti-machine gun activists. Dilly tries to start Phillips in his private circle, but the SS agent will flee after witnessing Dilly murdering a cold-blooded UHR agent. Dilly sends Core Trackers after him. Phillips joins the UHR group and helps them uncover a conspiracy involving Dilly. <br /> <br /> "Cyber ​​Tracker" is the first in a series of science fiction hybrids run by Richard Pepin, co-founder of PM Entertainment. , a powerhouse of action films during the 1990s. Other Pepino films include "Hologram Man," "T-Force," "The Silent" and "Dark Breed." Cucumber's films usually start with a great action sequence that lasts about 10 minutes before allowing the plot to come in. Does the script for this movie have any holes in the plot? it is never clear what the conspiracy the heroes are trying to prevent is. As for acting, Don "The Dragon" Wilson can be tough, but can not act because of beans, with little charisma. Your co-stars are much better. The best bet of the film are the action scenes, which provoke an impressive artillery fire, a huge body and not one, but three moments in which a vehicle flies through the air, turns and hits the ground, exploding. The edge of visual effects on the cheap side and the musical score is discreet and strident.
