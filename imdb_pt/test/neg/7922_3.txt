How could they carry such a beautifully animated gem as Don Bluth's All Dogs to Paradise and bastardize it with a charmless, uncooperational, and uninspired sequence? The scary music and the delightful characters disappeared, now replaced by kitschy animation and an unimaginative plot. <br /> <br /> Pros: Charlie Sheen is sometimes fun like Charlie, but he does not have the attitude of a tough guy who took him to the life of Burt Reynolds. I particularly liked the songs "I will always be with you" and "It's very heavenly here". <br /> <br /> The Cons: There seems to be no connection between this and the original. At first, Charlie is friends with Carface, but wait a minute. Is not this the same character who was responsible for Charlie's murder and kidnapped the little orphan he loved? I think all the changes in heaven, but why Anne-Marie is not mentioned? If Itchy gets to heaven, would Flo and Killer not be able to do it, too? What about Annabelle, the whippet's voice? In the original, it sounded feminine and charming, and then it sounds like a weeping, moody parrot. The new characters are not that good (except Sasha). And the animation is best compared to a generic drawing on Saturday morning. The constant "humor" of the cartoons is plain and bland and the "heart" simply does not work when compared to the original, which had such a subtle touch that it makes me cry all the time. <br /> <br /> All Dogs Going to Heaven is one of my favorite movies of all time. How Don Bluth allowed this sequence to be made is beyond me. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: Not all sequels go to heaven.
