This movie was very disappointing as several elements of the book were poorly made. The main story is the same, but there are several flaws that undermine the film. <br /> <br /> 1) Boobie Miles gets hurt early in a preseason game at Texas Tech. That means he will not do anything during the season and Chris Comer appears earlier in the team. <br /> <br /> 2) The game against Marshall was lost in Marshall. The team represented as Marshall was actually Midland High, one of Permian's top rivals, and here's the proof. Marshall High is the Mavericks, of scarlet and silver color; Midland High is the color of Bulldogs, Purple and Gold. Look at the shirts and you'll see who they are. Also the list of Marshall High football players is overwhelmingly black, the team shown was racially mixed as Midland High. <br /> <br /> 3) The Permian only loses to Midland Lee for a point in the district game. Midland Lee loses to Midland High and Midland High loses to Permian. These are the teams that prepare the draw as such. <br /> <br /> 4) Boobie returns to the team as a backup to Chris Comer and after not having any game time in the Midland Lee game, he resigns. the team completely in half the time and never stands on the sideline or goes to any game again. <br /> <br /> 5) Brian Chavez was a tight end and defensive end that wore # 85 not a tight end and strong safety. In addition, Boobie wore # 35 and Ivory Christian wore # 62. <br /> <br /> 6) Coaches end up liking Chris Comer as a player more than Boobie because he has a better lifting ethic and runs more direct the way the team prefers it too, this is partly because Boobie leaves the team. <br /> <br /> 7) Dallas Carter is played in Austin at the Darrell K. Royal Memorial Stadium, where UT plays in the state semifinals, not the state finals. Carter wins the state title, but is forced to fold due to an ineligible player. <br /> <br /> The acting is done very well, but if you read the book, you will see that these failures are quite true. I'm also tired of hearing all the PC hypocrites complain about the representation of the Dallas Carter football team. The team according to the book is as big, monstrous, talented and black as the movie shows. People say it's a racist representation, but by reading the book, you see a true representation of the team. The story is greatly altered, giving this film a score of 3.5 / 10.
