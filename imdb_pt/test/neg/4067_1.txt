My suggestion ..... This movie was really meant to be a "comedy", was not it? ! If not, producers, directors, actors and hair stylists should really choose another career! Now, the guidelines for my submission require a minimum of "10 lines". How in the world can I add more to it? Hmm ... Let me see. Oh yeah, the beginning of the movie was pretty hilarious with the "forced landing" scene. Too bad the plane did not hit the tank truck and a lot of "Martians" would have left the wreckage (obviously hidden) and decided to take over the planet "world" and make a better movie. Now, that would have been a great start! <br /> <br />
