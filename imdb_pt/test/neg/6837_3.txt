This may well be the worst remake Hollywood has ever produced, and that's saying something. I will take this further and say that this film is so incredibly delusional bad that it MUST BE SEEN. I do not know if I can deal with all the wrong things with him - like the fact that the casting director seems to have taken names out of a hat, or the mind of Richard Gere's character being allowed to leave him unpunished at the end (I'm sure people saying, "It's just fiction, who cares" would not have a problem if it were a former Al-Qaeda operative who just wants to return to his home country) - then I'll devote my review to hilarity total, which is mainly the scene in which Bruce Willis is testing his weapon. <br /> <br /> In the original version, you will remember, Jackal practices his killing on a pumpkin. The pumpkin explodes on impact, an effect known as "euphemism." In that version, Willis assembles a pumpkin target, but he does not use a sniper rifle - he uses a gigantic remotely controlled cannon, which costs tens of thousands of dollars and can only be stored in the back of a huge minivan. (this man likes a challenge). He reveals the cannon by taking off a tarp, at the point where Jack Black, who is there to watch, jumps up and says, "THIS ROCK! This ROCK thing!" about 18 times (I think Willis did not have to disassemble it first, he just lifted it, canvas and all, out of the back of the van, though probably weighing several tons). The scene then turns into an Austin Powers movie as Willis misses the pumpkin and picks up a tree, then Black runs through the mud with his pants falling, finally dropping Black's entire arm. The pumpkin falls to the ground, unscathed. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend this movie for a non-ironic reason, it is for the character Diane Venora as a Russian tough guy who becomes romantically connected to Gere despite having a facial disfigurement - a bold move for a Hollywood Resort. In the middle of the movie I was really liking this character, so it was a shame when she had to be killed. I'd like to see a movie about her. Other than that, this pile of junk is useful only as an objective intelligence test. 3/10
