Barney is just awful. Like many of the other reviews on this show say. I am not to disagree with them (I will not). Because I hate this show as much as they do. They use kids who seem to be in sixth grade, cheese graphics, horrible dialogues, and really bad special effects. Not to mention the great purple dinosaur. He makes any other kid look like a prize winner (Sesame Street won awards, which I know). <br /> <br /> Please just watch Sesame Street, Thomas, the Tank Engine or even the Teletubbies. Avoid both this and your movie (which I also analyzed). Both are extremely bad and are inappropriate for anyone (even babies).
