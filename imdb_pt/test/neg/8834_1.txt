This proves how awful the WB Network was in the last years of its existence. As a homeschooler, I naturally deplore this show for its ridiculous, fantasy land, obscure and bland stereotypes about kids being "weird hippies who are so smart they are alienated from super cool high school students." Sorry TV writers, the world as seen from inside your ass (containing their heads apparently when you wrote this show) is not the world that talented people see with our eyes while we live in a little thing called reality. As for those who really enjoyed this show ... please sweet and sweet Jesus PLEASE rethink the statement that you really liked this crap over a long walk. The acting is even more hollow, fake and wood than the stereotypes that the whole show was built on. Thank you WB for doing the right thing and putting this horse out of its misery from start to finish. This show should never, never should have had the privilege of being done, not less than have eight terrible episodes. I really hope these actors eventually have a clue and stop playing roles on TV shows like this once the show is over.
