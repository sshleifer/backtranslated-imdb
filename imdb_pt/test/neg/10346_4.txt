I watched this movie erroneously thinking it was that other zombie movie from the radio station. Production figures and the low-rent cast soon revealed that this was yet another of those cheap science-fiction channel-style knockdowns. <br /> <br /> The central performance of Bill Moseley is initially quite engaging as the dubious Jock Shock Jock, but as the film continues it becomes less and less convincing as he is really bound to take action. The rest of the cast has little to do but look worried and have no depth at all. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is monotonous, flat and completely uninspired, like many of these types of films. He does not even get some convincing blood, the makeup of the zombies is literally pathetic except for one notable exception at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film attempts to inject originality and a message into it's blend of half-cooked and ripped-off ideas, somehow equating this outbreak with intolerance towards Islam and the war on terror. This is poorly administered with all the intellectual influence of a 6 year old. As the characters and apparently writers are unable to distinguish the difference between race and religion - describing all people of a certain skin color as "Muslims." Most notably, a character is revealed as a Muslim only by the color of his skin. At the same time, the "Muslim" terrorists who cause the outbreak are the usual psychopathic stereotype. <br /> <br /> Presumably, the much higher Pontypool had a budget like Dead Air, but it shines everywhere where this movie fails miserably.
