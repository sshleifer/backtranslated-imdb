A multi-millionaire marries a doctor. He has not worked in a day and she is dedicated to his profession. He sees her every day. Something has to be given. <br /> <br /> Our hero, Henry Fonda, finally decides to do something with his life. He becomes a salesman in a department store, but soon gets fired because the poorest people need the job. Meanwhile, has Dr. Helen Hunt (Barbara Stanwyck) given up on her practice? What is there to do? <br /> <br /> Kirk (Fonda) buys a failed hospital and the two will now be happy helping others as they earn an existence. <br /> <br /> What about writing here? ? When annoyed with her husband, Dr. Hunt says, "You have acted like a gestapo." This is supposed to be a comedy. Hogwash. <br /> <br /> A very boring and boring film. Very little happening here.
