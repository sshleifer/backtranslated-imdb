Emraan Hashmi post MURDER did some good roles in Bhatt's films, but another director made use of his impertinent and kissing image. <br /> <br /> AKSAR is one of them and came after AAA, JAWANI DIWANI in a row and I was already fed up with him and such roles <br /> <br /> The film has a good turnaround in the beginning, I felt like a film by Abbas Mustan, but then it became a routine film with sudden love, sudden envy and a bad climax <br /> <br /> Anant Mahadevan makes a terrible movie Music is a saving grace Camera work is fabulous <br /> <br /> Emraan Hashmi just repeats his act from his previous films and has two expressions in all the Dino. speaks as if he is practicing Hindi and does well in some scenes Udita is expressionless and annoying
