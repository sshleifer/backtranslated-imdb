This is on my TV now ... but just enough for me to finish doing this in this comment. The previous review let me know that this movie will not get any better, no matter how much I expect and pray. I'll agree that this movie is a colossal waste of my time, and it would be of your time ... it will not get any better! I can not believe this writer is doing Atlas Shrugged! I hope he has improved a million times! I see some other credits on your resume that have had good reviews, but I'm still not convinced. If you're familiar with his work, please post something here, because I really want to see Atlas Shrugged, and I would hate it if this guy turned him into the trash that this movie ended up being.
