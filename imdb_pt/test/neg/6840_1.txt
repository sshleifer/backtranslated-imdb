Amidst all the many problems that make this a terrible celluloid role is the most stupid plot device in recent movie history. Richard Gere determines who the true target of the Jackal is through some form of revelation. He does not work with anything, just comes to him. When in doubt "He goes after the First Lady!" This movie explodes pieces.
