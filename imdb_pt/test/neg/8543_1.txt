Franco's films can be divided into 4 categories - the "first" (often black and white and inventive), "pranks" (late 1960s and early 1970s, involving Soledad Miranda), "nudies" ( of various periods, but using frontal female nudity as a plot unit) and "the rest." <br /> <br /> This is part of the "rest". It's not really a cannibal movie. Certainly not gorefest. The few women in the photo do not even lose their loincloths and there is little full frontal thing at all. The picture quality on the German DVD I watched is poor. The movie ends (as it catches fire). As a Franco fan, I would tell others not to bother. Do something else with your time ... read a book ... get a copy of "Women in Cellblock 9" ... anything really ...
