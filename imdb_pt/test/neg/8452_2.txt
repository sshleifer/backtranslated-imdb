This is an example of a movie that can have great potential and runs very poorly .. I am a fan of sucker and thumb kids and many other so called teen angst movies but this bothered me. <br /> <br /> Why every white kid is a bandit who loves rap, is becoming one-dimensional. the acting was horrible but simple since it basically consisted of dropping a bomb after f bomb being just a bad bad movie if you would like to see better movies like this: thumb sucker kids bully all <br /> < I recommend one of these is that you would like to see a good "teen movie" I hope my review you found useful and I hope you hear future comments from me
