How shocking. For starters, I could not stand the constant screaming and noisy panic all along. It did not leave me terrified, horrified, or made me sympathetic to the characters; was simply annoying. The camera's jerky movements were also annoying. The plot was the same as any other cheap horror. There were some pathetic attempts to give the characters depth, but this did not really work on the rest of the plot. And then there's the end. I'm still not sure what to do with it. I think it was to be smart, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid. <br /> <br /> The case had a couple of these small awards / nominations symbols on it, so I figured it could not be that bad. I was wrong. If you see it, you should probably leave it on the shelf.
