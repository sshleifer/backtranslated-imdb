Very silly schoolboy / teen movie about geeks trying to prove themselves better than the rich brats. Sound familiar? This television movie by director Rod Amateau ("Uncommon Courage" and some episodes of "Dukes of Hazaard," believe it or not) says nothing, does nothing, and is sure to amuse very few. <br /> <br /> "Who's Who" from the television cast, including Michael J. Fox, Bob Denver ("Gilligan"), and Todd Bridges ("Different Strokes"). star Anthony Edwards ("ER"). <br /> <br /> Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video
