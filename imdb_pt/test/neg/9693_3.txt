Dramatic? Yes ...... Historically accurate? Not Enough! .... This movie twists the details of the bible of the flood, putting Lot Noah's meeting during the construction of the Ark. Fascinating journey back in time to Lot done in part by NBC! .... being Lot had not been born until 2136 BCE, 234 years AFTER the waters of the flood (2370BCE) .... It's like having George Bush meeting William Shakepeare! And with this guy floating around selling nicknack's and items to Noah? <br /> <br /> You can make a movie based on dramatic historical facts, but do not distort it by putting people where they were not ... especially when it comes to the Word of God.
