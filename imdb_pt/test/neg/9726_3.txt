If I were to present the idea of ​​the movie to some Hollywood bigwigs, I'm sure it would sound like this: US: "Four boys in a private school are good friends, and they're wizards. Hollywood: "That sounds like" The Craft ". ME:" No, no, I said four boys, not four girls. "<br /> <br /> Hollywood : "It still sounds like" The Craft, "with only boys instead of girls." ME: "Okay, but there's this fifth unknown guy coming on the scene and he wants more power. "<br /> <br /> Hollywood:" There's not much difference yet, because one of the girls from The Craft also wanted more power. ME: "OK, OK ... I'm going to make these boys part of the" in the crowd ", they'll be rich, and the school is on the east coast. <br /> <br /> Hollywood : "Now that sounds original. This is nothing like "The Craft", here's a billion dollars. "<br /> <br /> This film was so clichéd and uninspired.Even the drama made between Chase and the brothers in Ipswich was very blase.children, with their biggest problem being the color Bentley wants for his 18th birthday (and 18th car), do not interest me, even if they have powers ... and of course there had to be free male nudity and 80% female nudity just to take you home like you're out of style.I wanted to rename this movie " The OC Witches. "Oooh, rich kids and their problems let me pretend that you care. This movie was completely unimaginative and predictable The final fight was lame and dragged out and the end was very anti-climatic This was a better film left in the room to cut the floor.
