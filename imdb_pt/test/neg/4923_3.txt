The fact that a movie is on DVD does not guarantee that its quality is very good. The fact that the quality of a film is exhausting does not mean that you should not buy it. This review really applies to 2 movies paired on a single DVD. <br /> <br /> The tangles of these films are of little importance. Are they of interest only to people who collect Holmes films ?? Anyone who just wants some of the best deals would do well to buy some of those made by Jeremy Brett? or, in a pinch, Basil Rathbone. Are there any other very good Holmes films featuring good actors on a single basis? such as "Seven Per Cent Solution" or "Private Life of Sherlock Holmes". In any case, these films are considerably less estimable. <br /> <br /> Here we have a couple of movies with some of the best actors to do Holmes, even if the results tend to disappoint. This seems to be the only disc with these movies (although "Deadly Necklace") appears by itself in the same version on other discs. <br /> <br /> "(Sherlock Holmes and) the Deadly Necklace" dates from 1962, although it does not look or sound. Some who have seen this may be surprised to learn that it was produced by Hammer Studios. Not that Hammer did not produce some really shocking things, but where Christopher Lee was concerned, they usually did a better job. Print is a direct transfer from a 1: 1.33 copy rather used in black and white. The quality of the color suggests that the original may have been in color, and the cut ends of the film's appearance suggest that it may have originally been 1: 1.66 or more. <br /> <br /> The film is in the early twentieth century. Century ?? not unlikely, since Holmes was still working (and did not die until 1957). However, the script is not adapted from any real Doyle story. It involves an Egyptian necklace, and Professor Moriarty appears as a world-famous archaeologist, as well as the Prince of Crime. The plot is melodramatic and banal. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw of this movie is this? for any unfathomable reason ?? Hammer filmed in Germany. However, it was filmed in English. It was then dubbed in German and then re-dubbed in English. So what you hear is not Lee or any of the other original actors, but a lot of unknowns ?? Not that outside of Lee, doubt that anyone knows any of the other actors. This is very bad, since Lee (see his "Hound of the Baskervilles") makes a pretty decent Holmes. As it is, his double voice is condescending and simple as bread pudding without raisins or cinnamon. <br /> <br /> The music for this movie is basically jazz, in a possible attempt to be "period." Too bad no one thought of ragtime. As it stands, the music does not relate to what is happening on the screen, and is often at odds with the action. <br /> <br /> The other film is "(Sherlock Holmes and) The Speckled Band" of 1931, starring a young Raymond Massey. The quality of the image and the sound is totally superior to the effort of 1962 and, in fact, a little better. Massey makes a fairly respectable Holmes, though he certainly does not have the role in the way Rathbone did and Brett does. The other actors who participate in this production will hardly interest modern readers. The acting ?? as is the case with many films of this period? owes much to the post-Victorian stage and silent films. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that while "The Deadly Necklace" is available on DVD by itself, "The Speckled Band" is only available with the old movie. <br /> <br /> There is very little to be said about this movie. The settings appear to be a strange combination of the 1890s (horse drawn carriages) and the 1920s (electronic gadgets as a primitive dictaphone). Taken completely, it is an interesting curio and an incentive enough to buy the DVD with the pairing, instead of a DVD with "Deadly Collar" only.
