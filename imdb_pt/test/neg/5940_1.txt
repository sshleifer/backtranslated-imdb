The film shows the relationships of the dying mother, and the son, who is very attached to her, and definitely loves her. What does this show? This shows that they live in very bad conditions. It shows how tenderly they "walk" (in fact he is bringing her). But what do we see further on? After his walk he walks alone in the same places, where they walked together. It's not possible. A person who loves and cares about another person who is dying would do everything to improve that person's life. He would not have a free minute to ponder, be alone with himself, and if he found a few minutes a month for it, he would run away from the places where he is. Another thing. The author dedicated this film to Andrey Tarkovsky. We see that he learned many visual effects from Tarkovsky. But in Sokurov's film they are just effects, they do not support any sense or mood. Someone compared this movie to "Mirror" ("Zerkalo"). There is nothing common except these visual effects. "Mirror" is a great movie and this is just a poor imitation.
