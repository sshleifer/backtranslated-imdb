If I did not know better, I would think that the resurrection was made in the late 80's and early 90's, when the crap was sold as a movie in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why people like Christopher Lambert. He speaks as if he's reading suggestion letters and turns into a source whenever he needs to get emotional. He was easily the weakest aspect of the movie. The other actors were okay, not horrible. <br /> <br /> It's easy to see where the bulk of the budget went: special effects. The murders seem very professional, but they hardly make up for the stupidity of the film. <br /> <br /> I would not go so far as to say that the resurrection is a copy of Se7en, but it certainly bears a certain resemblance to it. . Focusing on a religiously minded killer in a modern crusade, detectives investigating their work have to rely on biblical passages and Christian history to join the killer puzzle. The resurrection, however, is devoid of the intelligent narrative of Se7en, of cinematography, of acting ... well, of everything that makes it good. Instead, resurrection lies to the public and uses the mystery method of Scooby Doo to surprise him. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the resurrection was as bad as I had hoped it would be. I almost feel bad for criticizing this movie since I knew it would be bad to get in, but ... sue me.
