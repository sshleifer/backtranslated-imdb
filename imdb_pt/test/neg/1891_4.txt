I think the previous movie "House" was a success, causing Universal to extract a few more drops of the monster cow. The creative team must have been in a state of recycling, starting with the opening theme raised from 'Son of Frankenstein' and some of the footage scattered throughout the film, as an unintentionally funny piece of business where footage of Glenn Strange as the monster is mixed with Karloff clips from the 1935 Bride, and compared to how Strange moved robotic, Karloff seems to move like a cheetah by comparison. <br /> <br /> Continuity of the previous film is played by the wayside, about the miraculous death-skills of Wolf Man and Dracula, but when Dr. Edelmann & Larry Talbot discover the Frankenstein monster with the skeleton representing Boris Karloff, Edward T. Lowe at least recognizes part of the movie's past history, though Talbot curiously never mentions having found Karloff Dr. Niemann. <br /> <br /> Since this would be Universal's last round of terror, the supernatural elements of The Wolf Man and Drac become (unconvincingly) in medical ailments. Drac is told that he suffers from a blood disease, a very rare disease that allows him to turn into a bat or to evaporate if sunlight touches him. >: -] And Larry Talbot has a little pressure on the brain. Of course all this is meticulously explained with a lot of medical jargons related in many scenes. This proves to be the biggest obstacle, since somewhere the filmmakers seem to forget the horror or the real entertainment in favor of giving the monsters conditions that seem treatable like the flu. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of Universal's old horrors, it's rare that I feel so bored while watching one. The whole thing looks like a movie that was made just because it could be, but if this mess had not been sketched out, the monsters could never have met Abbott and Costello, so I guess something good came out of it.
