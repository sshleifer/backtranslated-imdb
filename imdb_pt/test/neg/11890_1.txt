I was forced to watch this movie for my World Reigonal Geography class. This movie is what is wrong with America today instead of figuring out the best way out of difficult times or situations that we would rather complain about as it is another person's fault. This movie passes through the fall of Flint, Michigan and blames 100% of General Motors. In the process of doing so, Moore struggles to make General Motors executives be villains just because they are doing their job in a capitalist society. Moore films several dumps throughout the film and does not even question once if the person is being evicted because of a GM firing. In addition, he never interviews the owners of the filmed tenants. Moore goes to great lengths to distort historical events to fit his political agenda into this film of pure propaganda.
