Obabakoak is a bunch of tales with a single common point: the small town Vasque of Obaba. In this film, the director tries to explain some of these stories using a young reporter as a continuum. The result is a strange movie, as it has any main character (the film spends about 20 minutes for each tale) beyond the town of Obaba. Any story is well explained and the fact is that they are very boring. It was by far the best film of the year in Spain, but, well, that's not saying much. The only good thing about the movie are the beautiful scenarios. It's filmed in a very precious valley and it's nicer to spend time watching the scenery rather than being aware of the story.
