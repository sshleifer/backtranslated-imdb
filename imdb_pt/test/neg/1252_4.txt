This film has tried to make Stu Ungar's life interesting by being creative. What they forgot was that his life was a lot of fun on their own, without having to do things. <br /> <br /> A small list of inaccuracies: 1) Stuey was not sent straight to Las Vegas for a Gin Tournament to pay off old debts, he spent a lot of time in Florida first, and only went to Las Vegas when he ran out of Gin games on the east coast. <br /> <br /> 2) Stuey never associated (or played Gin) with a casino executive (as played by Pat Morita in the movie). <br /> <br /> 3) There was no magic twist in the 1997 WSOP buildup. In fact, Stuey barely managed to get into the tournament as it was. He snorted Cocaine the week before. <br /> <br /> Or tell the story correctly, or say nothing. 4 out of 10 stars for Michael Imperolli's credible performance (the only redeeming quality of this film).
