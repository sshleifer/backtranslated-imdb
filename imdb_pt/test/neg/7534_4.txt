Think of an extremely low version of "Heathers" and you have "Pep Squad". This sums up the movie in a nutshell. I must give credit where credit is due, however. The film has a beautiful visual appeal. I liked cinematography, I liked the wild color schemes, I liked the costumes. But without good acting, a movie has no redeeming value. I'd rather watch a movie with little visual appeal, with good actors and sharp dialogues (for example, "The Brothers McMullen" or any Edward Burns movie). The actors recite their dialogue in monotonous or shout as if they were in a bad novel. That is why I do not criticize most of the traditional actors. Let's face it, most of the actors who are mainstream are mainstream for a reason. If they are not "great" actors, they are at least competent. Malicious people Leo DiCaprio, but when was the last time you saw a movie where he recited the dialogue as if he were reading off the page? It's a shame because the director seems to know his stuff when it comes to my en scene (sp). At the same time, I can not fully praise Steve Balderson (the director). He wrote the script, which contains some horrible dialogues. He may be a bit racist as well, since there is a black director in the film, who inhabits a culmination of African-American stereotypes.
