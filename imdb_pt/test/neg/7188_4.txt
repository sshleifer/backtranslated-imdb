let me start with a terrible plot and a terrible control system. good animation, but not very good graphics. that's why I'm giving this game 4 out of 10. THIS GAME REALLY NEEDS AN IMPROVEMENT IF YOU ASK ME !!! I would redo it and make this control system better, so the jaws are not so difficult to control. If I did this to improve, I would make these graphics look better than in the movie. It's going to drive anyone crazy when you're being killed so easily. I played this and was killed by a diver when he had one of those flick knives on 2 hits. the dolphins will kill him so much that the shark will be begging to go to the bottom of hell. this game sucks a fat ass. Sorry for all the cursing, I think I'm done. just that this game is so bad it should be removed from the store shelf. I dare you to throw the trash and you'll probably get so crazy for dying so easy, so do not throw this !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
