This is by far the worst version of William Shakespeare's tragic masterpiece I have ever seen. It seems the filmmakers did not read Shakespeare's text. No, they just got what they wanted from Lawerence Olivier's movie. The plot is out of order and reduced to his naked need, but there is still time for the non-canonical Olivier to create a suggestion of incest between Hamlet and Queen Gertrude. Could we have had the "rotten thing in the state of Denmark" instead? Casting is another problem. I understand that Branagh's much superior film had its weak pieces (Robin Williams and Charlton Heston come to mind), but this one has very few good times. I like Laertes and Polonius, but the rest of the cast is old. Mel Gibson's scary beard is annoying, and he often wonders if he has any idea what he's saying. Many of the actors seem to have just memorized the part - they know less about what is being said than the high school students. If you want a version of Hamlet, check out Kenneth Branagh's book or even Lawerence. Olivier. To be honest, even Disney's Hamlet is better.
