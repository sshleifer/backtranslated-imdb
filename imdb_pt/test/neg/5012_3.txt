This movie is supposed to be a comedy. So where all the laughter is gone. So forget to put them in the version I watched. Like a football movie, it's kind of fun, I guess. mud, no discernible sense of humor. Or maybe this movie is not funny. It's also annoying, with that way over "you're a winner" musical score. And the strange thing is that the team sucked most of the season, winning only the last two games, and the last game did not mean anything, since they were not in the playoffs. So what's the point? Are they celebrating mediocrity? I do not see that. If anyone knows, please let me know. Anyway, this movie is not great or even very good. I'm giving a bass 3 *
