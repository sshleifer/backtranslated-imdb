I always say, "There's nothing like a good movie." And I must say that this was nothing like a good movie! Monotonous, monotonous and tedious. It was like one of those bad dreams that never seem to end, no matter how hard you try to wake up. I do not care about the concept of a wordless movie, (ie: get into a fantasy world or dream), but there has to be something there to capture your imagination, not just empty images, which is what this movie is. There seemed to be no character development and jumped so fast from scene to scene that it was hard to discern any story. (Was there even a story?) You could say that the actors were trying their best, but unfortunately, the bad direction sabotaged the work of all the actors. It sounded like a kind of cinematic masturbation ... just to please the director and no one else. Big waste of time.
