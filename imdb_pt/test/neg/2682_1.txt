Okay, wait, let me take this street, there are actually some idiots on this site who think this is one of the best, if not the best Halloween sequel. I even read someone saying it was as good as the original. Pah absurd do not believe in them I watched all Halloween and clearly unlike some people know what makes at least a good horror movie and this rain of S is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen in my life. Honestly, if I were John Carpenter, I'd sue the person who wrote it or go out with a hunting rifle. Seriously Halloween sequels in general are almost all bullshit, two were crap, three were stupid, four is good, five is five, H20 is good, painful resurrection. However, in many ways I think this is the worst of a lot of very bad sequels. Because? Well, let me just embark on some kind of outburst, not so much a criticism, but a stupid speech about why Halloween 6 The Cure by Michael Myers be one of the most abysmal movies I've seen in a long time. OK where should I start, oh yeah the plot oh boy the plot. Basically, the plot is a cluttered mess containing cults, Thor signs and some other crap. It's just stupid, the movie tries to be flashy and clever yet, it's packed in a horribly crappy way. Why does Michael Myers have to have a reason to kill people? Simple enough explanation Micahel likes to kill his relatives that would be enough, but we do not have to have a man in black and mysterious cults and signs of Thor and absolute crap. God is so bad that it made me want to really cry, the writers tried to add to the character of Myers, but actually managed to do the opposite. In addition to wearing a mask and a boiler suit <which is a completely different color, Myers is not the same face of the original or even two, maybe even four. Is this something else because Myers has become a parody of Jason Voorhes? I thought it was to be the other way around, but Myers is so much like Jason, all he does is kill endlessly people in bloody ways. In the original he provoked his victims took their time and as a result, the whole thing was much more suspenseful. In this he just walks around, killing people to death. I mean, in the space of half an hour, we equated the amount of deaths in the original, it was ridiculous. Oh and Myers in this seems to have a very big head, I mean it is huge and hes put on a lot of weight. What else is crap, oh yeah, Tommy Jarvis's return is really bad, actually all the characters in this movie are Dr Bark, of course. I can not stand the little boy, I'd like him to understand that he's really annoying. Our heroine is boring and not interesting. And his whole family is a terrible group of actors. The mother is bullshit, the brother is bad and the Father, I mean, was this your first part or something? He was like a cartoon villain for God's sake, he was actually more evil than Myers. By the way, his death is one of the most abysmal I've ever seen, I guess until Friday the 13th it would not be so laughable. What else is bullshit oh yeah Tommy Jarvis, do not know the name of the guy, but he really can not act, he tries his best to be serious and all this, but I just wanted to laugh at him. I wish he had died, in fact, if everyone had died, it would have been really good. There's Dr. Loomis at a horribly old age and with Donald Pleasence for all the stories. Although he is on his last legs, the pleasure is still what stands out in the short time that he presents. It's a pity that such a cornerstone of this franchise had to say goodbye in rubbish like this. What else is rubbish, oh yes, the part where the radio DJ understands. First of all, how the hell did Michael get into that van when, five minutes ago, he was in his house? Secondly, it was just a meaningless murder that can increase body count, but it's just another peace of nonsense that adds to the absurdity of this movie. It's actually death that said it all to me, because it was useless like this movie.
