I like to enjoy movies, but I did not find anything to like The Box. I was interested in the 'hook' of the plot, but unfortunately it has never been anywhere and it was impossible to follow. Anyone who says they understand this movie is probably faking it so they can feel they are part of something, well, I have news for them, the emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> The only tone of this film is that women are to blame for the original sin and corruption of humanity. I've heard this story before, and it makes less and less sense every time. It is true that this movie is unlike many movies currently shown in theaters, but this is not worth the price of admission.
