This miniseries / movie was so terrible at times that I almost broke down and hung up. I'm a big fan of romance, however this movie suffers from throngs of problems. The costumes are poor, and many of the scenes most charged with emotion are blas√©. Romance matches are poorly chosen, significant nuances are lost or rewritten. <br /> <br />
