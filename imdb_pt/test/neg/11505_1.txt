Of course Sadie is by far the worst show I've ever seen, it's a piece of sh ** and loaded with full ****. I did not find any of the jokes funny or a bit clever, it was a horrible joke. <br /> <br /> The acting sucks, many of the characters are lousy at acting, Charlotte Arnold (Sadie) is one of those jokes. Terrible actor, the other characters are lousy too (Magaret, Rain, Hal). <br /> <br /> The plot is not unique and creative and the show is very predictable. This is one of the worst shows ever, which should not even have been done, the idiots responsible for writing this garbage should be fired (if they have not already) The first season was attended, but the second season was only season a disaster, it is very difficult to watch this show, it is beyond horrible.
