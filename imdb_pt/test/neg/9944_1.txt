This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is supposed to be a remake or update of "The Swordsman of One Arm" by Chang Cheh. The difficult direction and bad fight choreography mean that fight scenes are not worth watching. The script tries desperately to sound serious, but it's full of cliches like "And I knew that nothing else would be the same ..." or "If I knew what a high price I would have to pay" Ugh! And who is that girl who plays Cante? Somebody find her and eliminate her !! She's horrible. If you like Chinese martial arts movies, you would look better with Lau Gar Leung. This stinks.
