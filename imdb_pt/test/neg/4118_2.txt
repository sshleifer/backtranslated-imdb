What a waste of great acting talent. That's a pity, because with Catherine Deneuve, Mathieu Amalric, Emmanuelle Devos, Chiara Mastroianni and Melvil Poupaud (not to mention lesser known in America), there is a lot of talent to waste. This film by Arnaud Desplech was a terrible disappointment. After having enjoyed their "Kings and Queens" and this movie left me completely bored and frustrated to the point of actually leaving before the end of the movie. The film wandered through the central plot (involving Catherine Deneuve's illness) being diverted by every peripheral plot and supporting character that appeared on the screen. The film also gave us very little character development to understand why the different characters did not like each other very much (this was a story of family dysfunction), so the lack of a coherent narrative became even more critical. Finally, the soundtrack (ranging from hip hop to Bach and Mendelsson's Midsummer Night Dream) was at odds with the film's emotional temperature and further obscured any emotion the viewer should have felt at the time. The photograph (the director often started scenes with a mostly dark screen where our only view is through a small aperture, making us feel through a magical eye, which then expands) was also pretentious and inscrutable .
