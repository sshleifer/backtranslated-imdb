I do not know how people can watch it - the only people who like to see it are those who do not have feelings and emotions and like to see people die, homes burn, car crashes, babies die and cast members die every day week. . It's the most absurd thing on television and I still do not know how it pulls the ratings. It's so depressing. I can imagine the writers sitting down and saying - 'So, who are we going to kill next week then' or 'whose house should we play in a month?' <br /> <br /> It's the most depressing, absurd and most stupid thing on TV right now, and I can not understand the motives of people to watch that depressing pile of crap anymore
