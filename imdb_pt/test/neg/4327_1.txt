I felt as if the two hours I spent watching this movie had been better served, perhaps going to the local bookstore and looking for old-fashioned magazines and Halston ads. Or maybe watching the paint dry. These two jobs would have at least occupied my mind a bit more than "India Song". The most frustrating part of sitting through it was that I could see what moods / atmospheres were trying to be created and the notion of them could have been interesting had they developed further. Instead, what happened was a presentation of an incoherent and silly chain of unrelated events - with the same scenes repeated several times to hit some sort of point in our senses. <br /> <br /> I hated to devote more time to this movie, writing any kind of review, except to maybe warn others against this loss of time.
