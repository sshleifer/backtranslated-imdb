The only reason anyone remembers this steaming load of fecal matter is because it was punctuated by Pink Floyd. (Or as they were known, "The Pink Floyd".) Stefan, a really boring Eurotrash hitchhiker, connects with American model Estelle and they continue to get nude throughout the movie ... the point of it is, what exactly? What drugs are bad? Or just heroin (horse) is it? The problem is you do not give a shit about the characters, and even Pink Floyd was not prepared for his best work. When Steffan overdoses in the end, you're almost happy to get rid of him because he was so annoying.
