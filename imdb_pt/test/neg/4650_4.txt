This is a treat for fans of Z-grade movies. Here you will find writing and acting enough to rival anything Ed Wood has produced. Cameron Mitchell is a former makeup artist at Paragon Studios who, after an unpleasant incident at a social gathering, becomes a bitter mad scientist with a rubber scar on his face getting revenge by kidnapping Paragon actors and turning them into living statues in his Secret Laboratory (tm) conveniently located in the local wax museum. Or are they zombies who do your bidding? He is not sure. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, many of your favorite movie cliches are here. Check out the villain's lab! Are those mysterious fuming tanks of liquid? Non-Explained Colored Water Test Tubes? Yay! And what the ho, do we see spare arms and legs arranged informally in a wooden rack? You bet! Marvel at the awkward detectives who acted straight out of Plan Nine! Now, enjoy a stupidly tame car chase and hear screaming drums more than you could possibly want. Raise an eyebrow at the plot, made even more opaque by the totally meaningless ending that seems to have no connection to the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Cheese trash and lots of fun for the connoisseur of bad movies.
