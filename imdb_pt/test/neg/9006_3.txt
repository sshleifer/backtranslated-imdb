I'm sure I'm in the minority (I know I'm among my friends), but I found this movie long, annoying and free. The fact that the role played by DENIS LEARY is the nicest character (the only other time I liked him was in "A Bug's Life"!) Speak volumes. Rene Russo's character was annoying and unbelievable, and Thomas Crowne himself was flat and stereotyped. To say that he was two-dimensional can be a bit generous. (No, the scenes with her psychiatrist did NOT help make it real.) <br /> <br /> With the exception of two wonderful scenes (both involving the attraction of the museum and NOT involving Rene Russo), this movie made me wishing were at home watching televised golf.
