Plot: <br /> <br /> - An EBay chair <br /> <br /> - Random people <br /> <br /> - Random people say ("Dude, that's right." <br /> <br /> "Feel it." "Let's get married now!") <br /> <br /> - If you're a hippie, then you'll love this movie. (You must be loud or drunk, otherwise you'll question your life by seeing this rubbish.) <br /> <br /> This film was clearly not thought of from beginning to end, and the other comments are probably filling out the team.the comments.If this was not directed at my demographic, I do not know what to It's something I would do, and believe me, it's not worth filming. Going on a trip and filming half the silence does not make a movie!
