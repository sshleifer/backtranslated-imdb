Perhaps the weaker film in the "Kharis" series, despite the presence of John Carradine (miscast as Egyptian high priest) and George Zucco (as his predecessor, hilariously afflicted by a severe case of Parkinson's disease) supporting Lon Chaney Jr. as the creature holder - if it really was him under the bandages, as his contribution is insignificant at best! It's a 60 minute time in itself, I think, but the standards have dropped considerably compared to the previous two entries, and the end result is strictly routine and nothing memorable. Only the only interesting feature here is the fact that female leadership happens to be the reincarnation of Princess Ananka, mentioned a lot in the previous films, but never really seen.
