Firstly, this film is so confusing that it is almost impossible to summarize it, since I myself did not understand this horrible story. In addition, the unknown cast, led by an actress named Laura Mennell, is simply horrible. The expressions and cries of the character Sara Tobias are laughable and ridiculous, confusing faces with the acting. Last but not least, there are many favorable comments about this movie on IMDb as follows: Top Notch - Can not wait to see more of the directors working ?? the author has only one review in IMDb on September 24, 2004; <br /> <br /> - Incredibly shot, incredibly intense ?? the author has only one IMDb review on August 12, 2004; <br /> <br /> Not your typical blood and blood, actually better. 7/10 ?? the author has only one review in IMDb on February 13, 2005; <br /> <br /> - As intense as Asian terror !! - the author has only one review in the IMDb on November 14, 2004. <br /> <br /> Coincidence? Or are parents, relatives, friends or people hired by the production to promote this crap? My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11.11 The New Prophecy" ("11.11 The New Prophecy")
