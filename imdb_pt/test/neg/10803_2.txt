The plot of this film is dangerously thin and the only "stellar power", if we can call it, is Joe Estevez. I do not know what is more shocking. The fact that this movie was made or the fact that some people actually gave good comments about it. If you've already seen the cover of the video, you can read them. Someone even went so far as to say that the actress / writer could be the protagonist of the 1990s. Yes! And Joe Estevez could have more money than his brother Martin. If you want to check it out anyway I recommend watching the MTS version of it. At least you'll laugh a lot without going crazy.
