The original body and soul (1947) is a masterpiece. John Garfield, Ann Revere, Lilli Plmer, Guilherme Conrad, Canada Lee ... and filmed by one of the greatest filmmakers who ever graced the screen ... James Wong Howe. This remake is disgusting. Despite the presence of Rod Steiger, Joe Mantegna and Jennifer Beals, there is nothing of value here and it is a shame that this product has the same title as the original brilliant. Just the name of the main character, Charlie Davis, is the same in both films. I do not think there are redeeming qualities in this remake. I'm amazed that Rod Steiger has participated. This may be the only bad movie he has ever made. Maybe he needed the payment.
