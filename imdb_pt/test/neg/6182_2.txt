Big disappointment. CLASH BY NIGHT is very interesting and the dialogue does not resonate as true coming from these characters. This is the melodrama in its heyday. The acting is really exaggerated and very unreal. Only MARILYN MONROE and KEITH ANDES as support players give this movie any closing. I wish they had more to do. I am someone who looks at details in movies. Two big questions ... 1 Who's watching the baby all day when Stanwyck and Ryan are together and Douglas is working, and then he breaks a fight at a bar with his dad? 2. When Stanwyck is packing to leave town, why is she seen packing at her brothers' home where she has not lived for at least two years? Also, when everyone goes to the projection room at the Theater, who's taking care of the baby again? Such details really irritate me and make me give much lower ratings to movies. What were writers, directors, and all others connected with film thinking? Nuf 'said.
