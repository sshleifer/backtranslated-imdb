Well, that was a waste of Dave McKean's talents, was not it? Do not get me wrong: when it comes to graphic design, Dave McKean may be the best in the world right now. The textured, layered look he can perform with just a few lines of pencil on rough paper makes the efforts of people like Peter Greenaway and David Fincher look like they are: cutting work. McKean has been the godfather of a revolution in comic book visuals, movies, and even magazine ads that borrow the distinctive collage effect he pioneered. <br /> <br /> But this movie? It's crap. Complete trash. The story, by Neil Gaiman, is, unfortunately, exactly what Gaiman has given us since he first stole Clive Barker: a dreamy, pseudo-mythical and exaggerated landscape populated by characters who have Titles in All Capital Letters names. Everything is allegory, to such an extent that it is impossible to get any human drama, emotion or empathy from anyone involved. People make vigorous statements, speaking in riddles that remind us of what Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead might have sounded as if Tom Stoppard had suffered a debilitating stroke in half of his composition. Really, Gaiman, get over yourself. You are not a prophet. You are a poser. <br /> <br /> McKean's direction does not help - his pace is weak, taking half an hour to prepare for the main picaresque plot, and then simply providing a disconnected sequence of events, none of them gave any weight. Monsters do not threaten because they are not prefigured, simply played on the screen. The plot does not fit because we do not care about the small rancid characters. Half the dialogue, whispered on shirt fronts and omnipresent masks, is unintelligible. <br /> <br /> Some of the visuals are beautiful, and I'm sure the fans will lick it. Feather. Think about the amount of really good work McKean could have done if he had not been stuck with this bad project. <br /> <br /> Grade: D / D-
