Here's a parody that is guaranteed to entertain people in the range of Homer Simpson's IQ. It's a cheap shot on all the great superheroes, notably Spider-Man and Batman. But that does not end there; becomes progressively worse until it disintegrates into a pathetic set of antics by the truck. <br /> <br /> For those interested in plotting, just watch Spider-Man under the influence of some heavy narcotic. What you got is Dragonfly Man? A wonder boy, who loves the girl next door, suddenly inheriting some super super powers. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script is as predictable as waking up in the morning and brushing your teeth but not 'Believe me! For the kids, this is a bit of fun; for adults is a great movie to leave the kids.
