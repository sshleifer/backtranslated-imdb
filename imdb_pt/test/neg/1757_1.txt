Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renne Zelwigger. They are all horrible. Especially the star, Jude Law. It is directed by the same guy that made the English patient and is based on a bestselling novel of a man risking everything to return to his lover, but unlike the wonderful English pateint, this movie sucks. Is very bad. <br /> <br /> The worst dialogue of all time. "But we only met for a moment" "But they were a thousand times like diamonds in a bag" <br /> <br /> "In some cultures you just have to say that I marry you 3 times and you're married "lovey-dovey-" I marry you, I marry you, I marry you, I marry you ... " /> I'm ashamed I've sat through all this. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was horrible, horrible ... Ughh no words, I'm sick. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (the first one is for the really loud bullet sounds, the sound crew did a good job)
