It is one of Shakespeare's joys that there are no definite performances - no single performance can be "right", but some may be wrong, and this is. There are at least two things about Hamlet that can not be dismissed: 1. Your indecision and inability to perform any kind of action. For God's sake, that's what makes the play last as long as she does. If you had Othello there instead of Hamlet, Claudius would be dead by the end of the first act. Any production has to try to explain why Hamlet delays, why he is unable to act. 2. Your sexual disgust. His total disgust at the thought of what his mother and uncle do in bed fills him with an absolute dislike for all sexual things and that means that any kind of relationship with Ophelia is impossible. At the slightest sign of sex, Hamlet vomits. So what does Mel Gibson give us? Lusty man of action. You could not go any further than Hamlet's character if you tried. There are many ways to play Hamlet, but this is not one of them! What I do not understand is that they managed to have such good actors for the other parties - Claudius, Polonius and so on, why could not they find one to play Hamlet as well? Mark Rylance in the play would have made this a great movie. This "Mel Gibson", whoever it is, completely abandoned the rest of the cast. And let's face it, Hamlet without the prince really does not work.
