Two men are shipwrecked on a remote island. They are then captured by an insane count who lives there with a small group of servants; while in the dungeon of the castle lives the earl's unfortunate leprous wife. <br /> <br /> Harrow's dungeon is practically a hack job of a movie. All the amateur actors pass sleepwalkers by the film while an incessantly insistent score touches the bottom. The various pieces of action are filmed in an incredibly non-energetic way; in fact, the film in general is completely lethargic. It seems to creep. And even if the ending is not so bad, you'll be hard-pressed to care about that point. As an example of the gothic horror of the 1960s, this is an example of bargaining. I unfortunately can not recommend this really.
