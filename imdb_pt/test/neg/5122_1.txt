I give Flashdance a lower rating of 1 out of 10 because it's nothing more than a series of video clips with a short film around the music videos to make a full length movie. Since when does this count as a movie? Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens, an aspiring 18-year-old dancer who, incomprehensibly, works as a welder at a steel plant in Pittsburgh. It is not a line of work that most older women find, let alone 18-year-olds just out of high school. Meanwhile, at night, she works as an exotic dancer, who never takes off her clothes, in a greasy spoon bar called Mawby's. However, looking at the well-choreographed, well-polished choreographies girls do every night at Mawby's, you'd think they were working at the best casino on the Las Vegas Strip. <br /> <br /> Alex ends up having a predictable romance. with his boss, Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), who is almost twice her age. After resisting Nick's advances, hanging out with the boss is not a good idea, she isted no time in going to the end after the first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their relationship at work, which does not make sense since it is likely to look like Alex's co-workers. <br /> <br /> When Beals is not being bent to the many dancers sequences in the movie, his character spends most of his time tantrums. Alex's dream is to audition by invitation only at the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance. Inexplicably, when your boss / boyfriend helps you make the audition with which she is dreaming, she throws one of her tantrums. She tells Nick that she is not auditioning because of her intervention, and then leaves her car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is just a scene that leaves you wondering what the hell the manufacturers were thinking when they were doing it. <br /> <br /> Of course Alex finally got his audition at the Conservatory. She puts on a dance routine before the Conservatory board which is so ridiculous you'd think it was in a movie marketed to the MTV generation. Oh yes, it's a dance routine in a movie marketed to the MTV generation. <br /> <br /> I do not think I can judge whether Beals can really do well based on what I saw in "Flashdance." This is because the character she is forced to play is so poorly written that I do not think it's a test of her acting skills. <br /> <br /> You have to hand it to the creators of "Flashdance" though. This film is proof that the poorest movie can be covered up by a marketing campaign. In this case, a soundtrack and video clips sold and awarded for the said soundtrack in high rotation on MTV. If they had devoted more energy to scriptwriting then they could have invented a plot and a story with characters that I cared about. Instead, what we have are characters placed in ridiculous scenes that any viewer with a functioning brain can not take seriously. A truly forgettable "movie."
