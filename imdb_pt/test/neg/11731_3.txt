The first review I saw about this on IMDB says that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Perkins was in that role. Makes me wonder if he saw the original. It's hard to review the Psycho if you do not have the perspective of how the movie was revolutionary in the 1960s. You have a heroine who is not very friendly and is not dead very far in the movie and a villain who is scary but makes you feel for him . Add to that some graphic violence and you have a blue copy of some of the horror films of the 80's and 90's. <br /> <br /> Where does this movie go wrong? Let's start with the cast. Anne Heche is just like Vivian Crane, but like Norman Bates, Vince Vaughn is wrong. For one thing, he looks very young. Secondly, he has no idea how to play the test. His nervous laugh reminds me of Ron Howard trying to play a tough guy in Happy Days. Whatever he does screams I did it! The original film, even for those who know all about it, still makes you feel uncomfortable with the mother's influence on Norman, and turns her into a real separate character. How about the shower scene. When I finally saw the 1960 movie on a big screen, I was amazed at its power to scare me. Bernard Herrman's score becomes unbelievably strident and noisy and goes further to scare him than Danny Elfman's interpretations of synthesizer during the scene. This shower scene serves only to show us the naked body of Anne Heche and some colorful blood. Which brings us to the choice of filming in color. Did not work. <br /> <br /> There's something about redoing classic movies that almost never seem to work. Some may see this as a noble experiment, but honestly, if Gus Van Sant had nothing to add to this film, he should have left it alone
