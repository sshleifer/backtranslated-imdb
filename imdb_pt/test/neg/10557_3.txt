How many talented or at least charismatic actors ended up in this conversation? Nothing is very good about this movie, but the worst things are probably the script and the direction. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this is director Damian Niemans as he wrote and directed (and acted also). He is a card magician and seems to have named characters in honor of other famous magicians. This was his first feature film as far as I know, and chances are he'll be the last. <br /> <br /> Is it difficult to pinpoint exactly what makes it so bad? but I would say that the story and the character are not believable (the script) and the direction does not give any impulse (the director). More ?? the poker scenes are bad in Hollywood's worst way (super hands, Hollywood rules)! The alleged plot twists are either totally predictable or totally unbelievable. They end up tying a story to a story that, at best, can be described as "some decent scenes"!
