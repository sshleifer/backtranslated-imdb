I am very interested in children of animals and read many Edger Rice Burroughs novels - but this horrible movie did not interest me, nor could I endure all the absurd and unrealistic scenes. I could only sit in the part of Africa and in the early days of John in Scotland. Let's talk about 'unrealistic' and 'downright silly'! The actors in monkey suits looked like extra-large chimpanzees rather than great apes (there is a difference). They did not move with the grace a wild animal would make. (For comparison, see some of the best films on the Planet of the Apes, where they trained their actors to move simian.) Monkeys eat large thighs of flesh - not a common practice of monkeys, as far as I know. I'm a sucker for animal stories, but the script did not make me worry about the monkeys. The great white expedition hunters who meet John Clayton are entirely caricatured. Clayton's parents were shipwrecked on an oceanic beach, but somehow it's a very long trip down the river to get to shore - give me some time! Let's talk about 'slow'. Even people who think this is an excellent movie admit that it is not an action movie. Far from it. It tries to be a character study - unfortunately the completely foolish part prevails! I did not read Burroughs' Tarzan books, but many of his other series - they were full of meaningful action and heroic purpose! This movie is not there.
