In the first 5 minutes of this movie, I knew I was in one of those "pick the flaws" movies. The acting was terrible, the script was even worse. Anyone who has never let these people write write that crap out of a movie, needs to feed the Komodo themselves. With Russian Mig jets posing as US Air Force jets, and pistols that can miraculously shoot 50 to 60 rounds of rapid fire without reloading are precarious details in any story. In one scene, Komodo is killing special forces troops at night, while in another they are explaining how the komodos and snakes are cold-blooded and do not go out at night !!!! Also with fantastic special effects available in the film industry today, they were just average even for this low budget movie. <br /> <br /> All that was said, I watched him at the curious end about what other bad movie wonders do could produce. Shame Shame Shame, for producing such rot !!! <br /> <br /> This movie should have been left on the cutting room floor !!!
