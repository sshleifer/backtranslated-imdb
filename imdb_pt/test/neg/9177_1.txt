the only reason I bought this DVD is because cynthia rothrock is in it.now everyone knows she is the queen of martial arts b movies.the difficulty is that this is not a martial arts movie.cynthia rothrock has about a minute or more of fighting scenes in this stupid movie. Now, if you were a filmmaker and had cyththia rothrock in your movie, would not you like to have a lot of martial arts action? all she does in this movie is walk around looking bored like I was when I watched that bunch of crap. I own a lot of their movies and they are all b movies, but at least they had some cool fight scenes in them. is a martial arts fan avoid this no matter what. I'm still mad I lost 4 dollars to buy this DVD
