Koyaanisquatsi is simply the best movie I have ever seen. It's a masterpiece where everything is in the right place. Some scenes are not "pretty" or "pretty", but the camera never stalks or intrudes. That is exactly what is happening here. The camera is used to invade, disgrace and ridicule. There is no magic flow here, no sense of grandeur or respect. Instead, some scenes are brought together without purpose or plan. The music is disturbing. Just as I rated Koyaanisquatsi as the best movie ever, this is the worst. It's a "pure" movie too, but this is the negative form, exactly the one that should not be made.
