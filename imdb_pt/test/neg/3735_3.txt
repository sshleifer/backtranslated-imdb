The Minnesota feeling is not really a road movie, but it's still the best categorization I can generate. A road movie does not depend primarily on a great plot, and since the plot of this movie is truly pathetic, it fulfills that description. To be interesting, such a film must rely entirely on moving and intriguing characters, and on the chemistry between them. Unfortunately, the Minnesota Feeling team totally fails to produce this excitement. <br /> <br /> The initial presentation of the characters is unsatisfactory and confusing; I can, for example, not find out if Jjaks (Keanu Reeves) grew up in his mother's house and brother or not. It is said by his mother (Tuesday Weld) that he should live with his father, but nothing in the film suggests that this should happen. The same goes for the rest of the characters - I never know them. They seem irrational, and no real explanation is given as to why they do this. <br /> <br /> The main point is that I leave the film with no feeling for the characters except boredom and maybe a little kick of attraction for the cute Cameron Diaz.
