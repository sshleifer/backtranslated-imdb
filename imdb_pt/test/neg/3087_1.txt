Filmmakers expect the name of Cameron Diaz to help sell this photo. Unfortunately, nothing can save what has already been captured on the screen. Despite some beautifully filmed European locations and some solid elements of production design, the film fails mostly due to its strange and unbelievable romance between Brewster and Eccleston. An unplesasant filmgoing experience.
