Jim Brown stars and produces a short story in the Philippines shortly after the Japanese invasion. The story prompted the Japanese to take several navy soldiers, including some divers, which they used to retrieve the gold that MacArthur dumped in Manila Bay. <br /> <br /> It's a confusing film with the purpose of making a statement about war and racism (The film uses Edwin McCain's war on a not-so-subtle set). The performances are only adequate at best. Jim Brown is fine, but he does not really show any kind of break in a performance that just leaves him looking annoyed. The sets are useful, but they look pretty cheap. The film suffers from the start because of a lot of footage including many of the best known images of the Japanese attack on Tora! Log! Tora! The use of such a large budget sequence effectively makes the rest of the film appear positively anemic; also remembers that there are better movies out there that someone might be watching. For me, the film seems to have half a real plot, the silver recovery and half a plot that exists just to fill the time. None of this is particularly exciting, even with the explosive ending. <br /> <br /> Given the choice, I would give a pass.
