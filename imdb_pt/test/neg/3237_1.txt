It's hard to believe anyone can get such a good book and make such a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine King Kong being reworked as a realejo monkey and Fay Wray being part of a boy. How about Elton John as Rambo !!!! This movie is even worse than the TV remake of The Night of the Hunter. <br /> <br /> By using the title Watchers and the name of Dean Koontz, the creators of this film should be sued for fraud by book readers who expected a reasonably accurate adaptation of the book. <br /> <br /> Read the book, I've never talked to anyone who did not like it. Another good book is The Winner, by David Baldachi.
