Well, after seeing "Beginning" I thought why the hell they burned Schraders Version and did that poor one. But now, after seeing "Dominion" I deeply understand that decision. Even they did not get much better. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie sucks. Some good times, but a really boring story and some big holes are killing this movie. <br /> <br /> I think the story of the Exorcist has a lot, and in a prequel about it you can build a lot and give references that the audience will enjoy watching. But there is very little of that in the film. The effects are very bad - not even the TV standards.
