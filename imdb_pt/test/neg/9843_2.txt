If this movie had been directed by a man, he would have been arrested. While Adrian Lyne was handcuffed to a lawyer in the editing room to supervise the evisceration of a classic piece of literature to appease the censors, and to avoid conflict with the Child Pornography Protection Act of 1996, a woman turns Ripe into us and everyone applauds. Did I miss a meeting? In addition to flagrant pedophilia, this film is totally absurd. This woman never set foot on an active military base? Has she ever met a soldier? Whose army is this? Uniforms must have come from Uniform-R-Us. Just play some patches, who cares? Just make sure each and every one of them has a Big Red One. There is a slight inner joke that undoubtedly went over the author's head but could have been played by anyone who supplied the military vehicles. Certainly there were no military advisers. The US military does not operate favelas. Temporary camps in war zones in the jungle are cleaner than that. The US Army does not put 14-year-old girls to work on military bases, nor does it allow them to use the firing ranges or training camps. There is much drama to be explored in teenage sexuality. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with it.
