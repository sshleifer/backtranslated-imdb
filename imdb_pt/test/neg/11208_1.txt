For many years I've seen this movie as a real ninja movie, but after studying more about this culture, I can only think that this is just another karate film. A black shinobi and some guns do not make a ninja, it's much more than that. Ninjas are the most dangerous warriors in Japan because they are trained in every aspect of life to survive anything, killing any attempt to stop them. This movie is not about a ninja warrior about a clown trying to be something he can not even understand.
