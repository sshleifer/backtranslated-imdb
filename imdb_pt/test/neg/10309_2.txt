Do not worry when looking at the DVD cover, Sandra Bullock only appears in maximum 5 minutes total in this cult classic. The entertainment value here is very high. <br /> <br /> To cite just a few of the many highlights that should be watched: <br /> <br /> - The voices of evil double of the main villains - The special weapon camera - The strange masks and clothes of the hit killers - The flashy ways to get a bullet and hit the ground - Plenty of shots from the bottom up - The space scene in which Bullock falls unconscious in the street - The Italian super-cliche mob guy Moe (LaMotta) - A cheap synthesizer background music - The mesmerizing fetish exaggerated weapon <br /> <br /> And last but not least: the scenes of fist fighting super tacky. I wish there were more of those ... <br /> <br /> Extra point to the successful attempt to make me laugh out loud.
