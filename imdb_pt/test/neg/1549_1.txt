For a while, it looked like this show was on 24/7. So apparently there was a second season or some other kind of continuation of this horrible show about the two most insipid and vain people ever filmed. All other comments perfectly captured the essence of these two egoistic and haggian air heads. Not much less can be said about them in addition to what everyone else has already said. <br /> <br /> I doubt that these two ladies have souls, and more than likely they have made some kind of Faustian bargain to get their caterpillars. a television series. May fate protect the human race from any other exposure to the Frightening Girls!
