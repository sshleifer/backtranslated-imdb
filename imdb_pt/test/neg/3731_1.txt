Feeling Minnesota is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, it's also one of the most disgusting movies ever made. It has to do with a woman who is forced to marry a disgusting mafia man. In marriage she meets her brother Jjaks. They have sex at home after they eat the cake so they decide to run away together. The other brother, of course, comes after him armed and he kills his wife. Jjaks wakes up to find his corpse in the tub and buries her. He seems to be friends with Jjaks and they try to raise money because someone is blackmailing them because he saw them and the body. This goes around and several characters die or come back to life, but it never comes along with something that can be called a good plot. The performances are horrible by just about everyone. Cameron Diaz, Keanu Reeves and Dan Akroyed. Direction, dialogue and visual effects are simply horrible. A disgusting and horrible movie.
