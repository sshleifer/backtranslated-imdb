This movie was so bad it was funny! For a while I thought I was watching a parody of a bad movie (the "For Your Consideration"). The scene of the "cliffhanger" at the end made me laugh until my insides ached. The script was terrible enough, but along with Sean Young's terrible acting - especially as she explains the whole plot in great detail (complete with flashbacks) while rocking off a cliff - makes a truly classically bad movie worth watching! In fact, the shots on the scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can not believe how this was done. First of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? How did the main actors get attached? Were they at low points in their careers? Questions, questions
