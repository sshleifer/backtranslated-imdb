The original Hitchcock classic benefited tremendously not only from performance but also from the "visual" of Anthony Perkins. He designed a kind of clean innocence: a kind of young teenager idol personality. He was not an actor who had portrayed the bad before that; nor was he physically fit for the role of what the public could have imagined as a psychopath, especially in the 1950s, when that ultra-cold aspect of mental illness (split personality psychosis) was relatively untapped in cinema. And that's exactly why his stage as Norman Bates was a slice of the true Hitchcockian genius. The audience was taken by surprise to say the least. <br /> <br /> That's why this reformulation does not work, even if it's a little bit, even though it tries to be an exact copy. While Anthony Perkins looked like someone you'd never think of as a serial killer, Vince Vaughn is easily imagined as one. He does not have the fragile look of Perkins and his acting skills are also clearly inferior, at least in that role (honestly - has there ever been an actor who could convey nervousness as genuinely as Anthony Perkins?). Although it was a useless reformulation, the miscastir of the most important personage of the history sucks this film completely. <br /> <br /> As a side note, I feel that Hollywood's propensity to remake wonderful films because "young" people refuse to watch anything that is not filmed in color not only stinks at the height of corporate greed, but is exceptionally disrespectful to the original work. As for viewers who can not watch black and white - it's their loss. I hope they mature sometime in the future and no longer need bright colors to hold their attention. When they find out, sometimes black and white work better. With the background mute, the history and the performances are much more frontal and central. And in many cases, the mood or atmosphere created by black-and-white cinematography is not reachable in color.
