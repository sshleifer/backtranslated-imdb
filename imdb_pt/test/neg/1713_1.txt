Do the following: Get a copy of this movie and a friend. I bet the friend $ 10 that they can not be seated throughout the movie. They can not look away or be distracted by anything. Now watch your friend. Win or lose, you get $ 10 of entertainment. <br /> <br /> It irritates me to the very end when people watch a movie and are quick to give 1 in 10, or sum up their thoughts with "it sucks." (And when asked "Why?", They respond: "Just why." Arrgh.) That's why this movie exists. His only goal is to say, "There, THIS is a horrible movie! It's 1 in 10!" <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> The recent trend of movie parodies has forced them to become increasingly stereotyped, this film falls short in every respect. It's not funny. It's no fun. And for some of the parodies, it's completely inaccurate! Horrible acting. Unhappy dialogue. A bland story. Terrible "special effects". One INANE gag after another. And to make things even worse, even free nudity does not make it worth it in one way or another. <br /> <br /> This movie jumps over like an idiot, stumbles on idiots and faces the idiot first. Even though I, who loves a good movie "check your brain at the door", I found myself physically agitated watching this. This movie is not even "Hard Ticket To Hawaii" so terrible-it-good bad ... It's just bad. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I really challenged a friend to watch this as described above. Not only did he fail to reach the end, but he had a headache and needed a few minutes later because he felt a little sick. True story. <br /> <br /> I could not accentuate this rating anymore ... a resounding 1 in 10!
