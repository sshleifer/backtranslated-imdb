Ivan The Terrible is more a play of theatrical filmed than a "big screen opus". Citizen Kane - a work similar in many respects - is just the opposite (the way we expect it to happen), because it has a lot of filming on location, for example. <br /> <br /> Character motivations and thinking for the public; if it gets you to understand the character, what does it matter HOW it was done? And considering the low amount of action, how else to express events that influence the story and hence the machinations and decisions of the characters, in addition to "exaggerated movements"? <br /> <br /> Well, there is a historical level. because the acting style should not surprise. The rise of totalitarian regimes in Germany and the USSR forced the filmmakers who were left behind to make movies the way they knew. Because they were prevented from accessing more modern works that showed the evolution and techniques of cinema, they only used what they knew. Control of the Nazi government in Germany destroyed the great German film industry of the 1920s because of its total control over the film industry. And the propaganda films can only "entertain" the German troops; hence the need for popular German silent films of the 1920s, for example. Thus, many of the techniques of the film Ivan The Terrible would have been derived from captured German films provided to the film crew (as mentioned in other reviews). <br /> <br /> There was no confusion anywhere and although personally it was found super-hyped, it is by no means a bad movie experience - and it definitely is NOT among the worst movies of all time. The acting is good, and part of the cinematography is excellent (even by today's standards, below). It's definitely not a popcorn movie; No one can leave his brain out of that person's door. Maybe dated and very symbolic - it's only worth watching on the big screen if you can not see the movies with the lights off at home, since many of the cinematic elements will be lost in the B & W experience of these films. It all depends on the expectations with which someone enters ... <br /> <br /> WARNING - SPOILERS: Do not read the following comments if they influence your personal vision of the film (s). <br /> <br /> ... and if you do not mind the obvious communist propaganda (as opposed to capitalist propaganda). For Ivan it is as Stalin has seen - obvious in his influence towards the film (see other comments) - and anyone with a world historical consciousness out of the US perspective will definitely understand this. Maybe Ivan was an earlier incarnation of Stalin, or maybe not; This is another diatribe about Stalin and his motivations, decisions, solitude, promotions of lackeys, etc. - using Ivan persona - than any true historical record of Ivan. Note also the obvious use of specific colors in the sequence: Red (for the USSR) in the banquet scene. And maybe blue (to the US) during certain takes when the usurper uses the crown? <br /> <br /> But it has many excellent visuals, like the deep use of shadows, or the outer photo of the population that comes to beg. The return of Ivan to Moscow.
