Sappy. <br /> <br /> I liked how they went to "Haaavaad baaa" to quote books to each other to impress the ugliest girl there. <br /> <br /> Probably my school janitor is a genius, too, but he's waiting to get this great building job done. <br /> <br /> Just because you keep your nose on the grinding wheel is no reason to try to cut a steak with it. "You like apples?" <br /> <br /> the guy nods or something. <br /> <br /> "Well, how do you like DEM APPLES!" Wow, that's great. <br /> <br /> Duh, Minnie Driver would give his number to anyone. Robin Williams can not paint and keeps the good books on the top shelf. And there is a teacher who always wears a priest's handkerchief for no reason.
