I bought this on VHS as "Terror Hospital", and when I got home, I checked the IMDb and it was like the OMG, it's the legendary "Nurse Sherri" !!! So here's another from Al Adamson, who clearly learned a tiny amount about movie making since the days of "Dracula's Castle Blood." Where this earlier effort is more or less totally sclerotic, it mixes a bit, adding a definite element of variety and surprise amid incompetence. Of course half of the film is a blind post-op player who blows the breeze with his nurse, but any moment now we may be cutting off the head of the Satanist leader, or nurse Sherri directing a farmer with a pitchfork. , or a little bit of quick cut of abstract student film to accompany the pulsating bubble effects in the possession scene, or the most carefree topless of all time, or God knows what else (I forget, to be honest). Like stupid pieces of shit, it runs in the direction of the high end. Congratulations, Al.
