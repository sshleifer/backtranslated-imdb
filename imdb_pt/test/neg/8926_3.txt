Harlan Banks is a thief at the top of his game but, after a successful career, he decided to settle down with his wife and retire. However, he decides to do one last routine job in Las Vegas. All he has to do is drive the car and it seems simple. Unfortunately someone knocks down the police and after a frantic car chase he ends up in the slam just to escape and get revenge on those who betrayed him and took him there in the first place. A typical action show happens. Steven Seagal plays himself (surprise!) wearing a raincoat and sporting his beloved Colt 1911 along with his aikido to break bones. Colt and aikido have always been with him, but the first one I remember him with the overcoat is in "O Estrangeiro". Not particularly impressive, but adds a little to Seagal's lethal arsenal of evil. Or covers the extra pounds he's packing. Look at it the way you choose. His main friend throughout the film is played by Treach (another new thing, a rapper in an action movie) and they both discover a small conspiracy of bandits on both sides of the law and give every malefactor his due . <br /> <br /> The main problem of the film is that it is painfully, and I really mean painfully, without originality. Seagal just follows a clock story all through the movie and even this can get increasingly monotonous as the movie progresses. So it goes from monotonous to totally ridiculous in the final scene, when people who seem to be dead for killing themselves suddenly, without reason, start talking. Moan inducing in every sense of the word. The only really positive thing here is the decent opening - a car chase in Las Vegas complete with throwing police cars and generally amusing chaos, but after that brief highlight you've seen it all before. 3/10 <br /> <br /> R rated: constant violence and profanity
