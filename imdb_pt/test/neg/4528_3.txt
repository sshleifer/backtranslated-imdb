In another miserable attempt to make a quick hollywood of one of the greatest works of art on television, Peter Segal created a monster. Out of context, if someone did not know Brooks' work before seeing it, the film would be a high budget movie that is not sure whether it wants to be fat joke and stupid comedy, or just an ordinary action movie with nothing to go forward . However, as a young generation who recently spent two months obsessed with the five seasons of Get Smart, the TV show of the 60s, this movie hurt me from the moment I walked in and saw Steve Carell dumbing down the role. The background stories, agent 99 receiving plastic surgery and 86 as an analyst who was previously morbidly obese, embarrasses the complexity of the original pair and paints a flat flat reassessment of them. It seems the writers, unable to be honestly funny in both dialogues and situations, fell back on stupid plans for Don Adams' famous lines, flashbacks to the fat camp, references to Carell's part in the office at the camera-style interview angles they have and a female chauvinism that falls flat on the floor. <br /> <br /> For those who saw the original, the writers of this movie thought they would include some memories. They mention Herbie, Fang (now a useless little hairy dog ​​that Carell covets), the shoe phone, the cone of silence, and his classic red car and the doors and phone that intro'd the show. Classical music is back, but now everything is up to date, usually for the worse. Cone of Silence is now a strange blue telekinetic force field, the control headquarters are under a museum that preserves Control's past. The film has no random creative technology and replaces it with beasts in Swiss knives. Much of the "humor" in the film is Carrel himself hurting himself, or another character being wounded, whether he spends two minutes accidentally shooting himself with the beast, being punched by security guards or vomiting on airplanes. In the original, Smart would insult a big enemy, attack him unsuccessfully and try to join him before being sprayed. In this, he attacks without success and is assaulted. It seems that the writers did not understand that humor was established through dialogue and not meaningless violence. It's like they pick up the names of the show, and cut everything that made it look good in the first place. <br /> <br /> The poster hides Carell's face beyond Hathaway's. The movie also avoids anything that can make it good. They intertwine classical music with dramatic action and romantic music in big budget films. Whereas the original fed off an extravagant feel, this one replaces quality with massive doses of cgi blasts and pow. I was really looking forward to it, since I finished the original series only two months ago and it was among the five best shows of all time. However, this was a big disappointment. Credits say they collaborated with Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but in all the things I read on the internet, they were largely left out of the writing process. In conclusion, if you want to waste your money on a cash-in with little value and no respect for your namesake, go ahead. But be prepared that the ride is not as you remembered. <br /> <br /> PS: I almost forgot George Bush's humor. They mention "Nuculor", falling asleep with works of art, the president working for the vice president and appreciating the real problems. If you're listening to the same jokes you've heard for 3-4 years in the form of big budget movies, throw your money here.
