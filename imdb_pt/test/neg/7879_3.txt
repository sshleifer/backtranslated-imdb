Another absurd French film. Baise-Moi (F * ck Me) tells the story of two young women who come together to kill and f * ck. One is a porn star who escapes from her community after being raped and killing her boyfriend. The second is a prostitute who kills her apartment mate and watches her boyfriend get shot dead. After these incidents they meet at a subway station (they both miss the last train) so the whole thing begins. They find a loop and come very close. They sexually abuse men, take drugs, drive around the country and have sex. That's all about Baise-Moi really. We can see that they have no mercy on their victims. They even kill a woman for her money. Both actresses are real porn stars in France, which affect the film in two different ways. They look so comfortable in sex scenes, however, they can not make the whole movie worth watching, since for me the film does not require more acting ability than that. It's a version of Thelma and Louise on a different level. I could recommend you a lot of things to do instead of watching Baise-Moi. So bother to see if you want to see a meaningless and perverted movie. * outside of *****
