In fact, I scoured the whole set of reviews, looking for those who gave this movie less than 5 stars. They were few and far between. Which is totally disconcerting! Yes, I know it's a Disney movie and it's not directed by Christopher Nolan, but good God. This is absurd straight to the bargain bucket. They should have done it and excited the damn thing. <br /> <br /> And what's even worse is the fact that IMDb does not let me just finish my speech there, because my review needs to be longer! <br /> <br /> The "Awesome" camera shots in the game are literally taken from the Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf on the Playstation, the story trails as a grumpy school boy, the multi-stranded character and the plot development crippled setting weak, and the grand finale is simply annoying. <br /> <br /> In addition, it was actually the biggest movie I've ever seen in my entire life. <br /> <br /> Authentic-looking sports suits, suits and equipment. There I said that.
