This is beyond stupid. <br /> <br /> Two high school graduates travel to Nantucket in the summer and find situations that are absolutely revolting. <br /> <br /> Demi Moore is co-star in this movie. As the movie was in 1986, was Ashton Kutcher just a baby in the woods back then? <br /> <br /> Moore's grandfather has died and his house is on the verge of being sold to implacable people with father and son. which bring a new meaning to the term means. Bobcat Goldthwait, with that detestable voice in the film, as well as two brothers, who become increasingly dumb and dumb. <br /> <br /> The writing is absolutely ridiculous. The highlights of stupidity are when one person says to the other, "Have you ever noticed that when people die, they go alphabetically in the newspapers?" <br /> <br /> I rest my case.
