Undoubtedly, the smallest of the spaghetti westerns I've seen lately: basically a low steal of Leone, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (1966) with three disparate characters who outdo each other (and occasionally form unstable alliances) in his quest for hidden gold. Leonard Maltin ranked as a PUMP; although it is harmless enough, is also totally routine, and fatally the three main roles are stereotypes, that is, uninteresting: Eddie Byrnes is a bank employee with ideas about his shipment being transported by train; Gilbert Roland is the "legendary", but the old Mexican bandit (his frequent lapses in Spanish, when excited, are very sentimental!) Which apparently are still irresistible to women; George Hilton, as an enigmatic bounty hunter, tries very hard to emulate the figure of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name. Director Castellari - I saw in the retrospective of the Italian B movie held during the 2004 Venice Film Festival, where he came out as the most pompous of cult film directors present! - shows a bit of genuine sentiment from the West (with the strength of two above-average Franco Nero efforts in the genre, I asked for your collaboration with Castellari KEOMA [1976] ... I'm keeping my fingers crossed now!) and the movie ironic approach is equally regrettable.
