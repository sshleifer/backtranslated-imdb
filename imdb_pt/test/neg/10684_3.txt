Following a double weapon of the 19th century that goes wrong, a charming young woman becomes a vampire. Not only does she become one of the undead, she uses her goth, temptress persona to support her talents as a cold-blooded killer. This is a low grade B feature that should have gone straight to the video. Violence is cruel and bloody, but actually rather bland. The plot is so weak and the dialogue is so random that it is difficult to get much interest. Eileen Daly is the main character Lilith Silver. Also in the cast are Mark Caven, Kevin Howarth and Isabel Brook.
