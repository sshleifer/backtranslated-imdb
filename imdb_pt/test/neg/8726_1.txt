I was looking forward to watching this movie since I loved the David Lynch version. On my first attempt to watch it, I fell asleep. Nothing was happening. The next night, I tried to watch the rest and, once again, I was putting myself to sleep! Nothing happened in this movie that could keep anyone's interest alive. The only time it got a little more exciting was when I tried Fast Forward! The DVD came with a second disc that contained bonus material. It goes without saying that I had no difficulty in going through the torture of seeing more of Dune (2000). Here are the low points: The acting was bad, the plot was moving in slow motion, the scenarios were and seemed cheap, the direction was pathetic, and the visual effects of the children's CGI. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch Dune, save your money or rent the 1984 version.
