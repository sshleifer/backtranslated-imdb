If you are planning to schedule your program for a film festival, do not be fooled by what it says in the booklet. This is a complete waste of time and energy. I looked at Bunuel, saw Dali, and admired them; but this is not surrealism, this is not to be at all. Did they ever think about the reputation of the human race while taking this picture? Once we become extinct by global warming, these will be the remnants of our civilization. What if the aliens exemplify it as an example of our intellectual capital? With all due respect for the effort put into it, it may be a good idea to finish all copies of this movie - or whatever.
