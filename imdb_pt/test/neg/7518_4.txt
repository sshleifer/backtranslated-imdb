The time machine begins in New York during 1899, where Professor Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) proposes to his beloved girlfriend Emma (Sienna Guillory), who accepts, unfortunately soon after they are attacked by an assailant and Emma is dead and dies in the arms of Alexander. Hop forward 'Four Years Later' and Alexander built a time machine he uses to travel back to the night Emma was killed to save her, but she's still dead, only this time in a different way. Alexander realizes what he does, however, he often returns Emma will always end up dead in one way or another and he longs to know the answer why so he travels a lot in the future to find out the truth. However, after having destroyed the moon, two new races evolved on Earth, humans like Eloi and the monstrous Morlock who eat Eloi. Alexander decides to stay close and save Eloi. Directed by Simon Wells, who is actually the great-grandson of writer HG Wells who wrote the original The Time Machine in which the original The Time Machine (1960) film was based and is actually the movie 1960's script producer John Logan is based here rather than original Wells literally source. While all three share the same basic story and ideas, this remake adds the subplot on Alexander's fiancé, Emma, ​​being killed and that's the reason why he invents a time machine, not just because he's smart and can. The screenplay is a mix of sci-fi, action adventure and drama, which really grabbed me or got me involved, sure there are some special effects, some action scenes and the moment when Alexander's question is answered he can not saving Emma is really very smart and makes sense, has never really captured my imagination and I've never really been moved by it either. Time Time aspects of The Time Machine look very similar to Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1992), in the sense that you can not change the past, but at the same time the future is not defined. Good character as Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The character is fine, though I think Guy Pearce seemed too young to be a smart scientist capable of inventing a time machine and there is never any real explanation behind his mechanics as it is like if at one time there was no one time machine and it works perfectly. I believe the Back to the Future trilogy offers much more excitement, laughter, excitement, and overall entertainment value than Time Machine does, and though I stop calling it a bad movie as it moves at a rate decent story and have moments that I would not call brilliant or even particularly good. There is also a small insolent reference to the book and the original film, both of which are mentioned here. <br /> <br /> The benefit that this modern version has over the original is the development of special effects and in particular the CGI that takes the time scenes passing quickly by Alexander in his time machine with huge buildings being constructed, new ridges, canyons and mountains being formed and an elaborate pot that ends in the space, while we see passenger rockets orbiting the moon. The effects work is good, there are one or two moments that seem a bit under par, but overall the effects are good. I saw The Time Machine on the television and the station playing badly and scanned so that the left and right edges of the frame were cut off from the screen, thus cutting part of the year on Alexander's time machine display, so I really did not know in which year he was. Apparently, director Gore Verbinski took over the last eighteen days of filming while Wells was suffering from "extreme exhaustion," while IMDb says the time machine was the largest and most expensive instrument ever built for a movie at that time that I find difficult I believe & Guy Pearce broke a rib during a fight scene, but as one soldier continued. With a supposed budget of about $ 80,000,000, production figures are high with a period lovingly recreated New York and good effects surprisingly The Time Machine was nominated for an Oscar for best makeup, but lost to Frida (2002). The acting is mixed, Jermey Irons performs well in a terrible makeup job that makes him look like a cast from a Lord of the Rings movie, while singer Samantha Mumba makes her onstage debut here and is just plain awful even though Guy Pearce is very nice and quite nice. <br /> <br /> Time Machine is not a particularly bad movie or particularly good, just a little ordinary that is watchable and it takes an hour and a half, but not much more than that. . Watch Back to the Future (1985) again in its place.
