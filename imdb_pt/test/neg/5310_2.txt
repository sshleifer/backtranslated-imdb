This movie, though somewhat flawed, was totally entertaining. About half an hour after Be Cool, I started having Flashbacks from Hollywood Homicide. But guess what? This is worse. Even the dance number is bad. I like most of the cast in this movie, so it makes me feel bad for writing a negative review, but I feel obligated. The Rock, Andre 3000 and Vince Vaughn were in a comedy. No one else seemed to decide on what genre of film they were performing. I feel bad for Travolta because he brought the same Chili Palmer from Get Shorty for this movie. He was totally consistent in the role, but this film is so different from the original that the character stands out as a sore thumb. I was going to give this movie 4/10 because I really like the actors, but there's a talk in the movie about a certain song that is so stupid I could not believe the artists really said that. If you want to go to the movies this weekend, there still must be a few Oscar nominees out there. That would be a much better way to spend your time.
