A comedy haunting inspired sports films, The Comebacks tells the story of an unlucky coach, Lambeau Fields, who takes a lot of college misadventures and takes them to the football championships. In the process, this lifelong loser discovers that he is a winner, after all, saving his relationship with his family and friends, and discovering that there is indeed no "me" in "team"! <br /> <br /> I decided to watch the unrated version for this movie. It took me thirty more minutes and I think it might be better than the release in theaters, hearing that people hated this movie. After all, thirty minutes of extra footage can add a lot to the movie. Well, I certainly was wrong. It was as bad as the recent "Meet the Spartans", but it was thirty more minutes of torture! <br /> <br /> Seriously, who makes a parody movie of two hours? A spoof movie is short because if it is longer, it would be an exaggeration! Honestly, I love stupid comedies. Heck, I liked "Date Movie", "White Chicks", "Epic Movie" and "Little Man"! I think when it comes to spoofs, it's a hit or a failure and it definitely was not what happened. On the lighter side of the film's many jokes, I'll talk about six or seven. made me laugh, even some that made me laugh out loud. But that's not saying much. Following these jokes, there were more scenes of torture and lack of grace. <br /> <br /> I can not see how people would say that this is not a horrible movie. In fact, there are as many product placement here as Meet the Spartans, there are so many dance sequences and bland jokes. I'll say another thing I like about this movie is the songs. They are some very good songs here. Overall, watch if you like fake movies. Jump if you like funny movies.
