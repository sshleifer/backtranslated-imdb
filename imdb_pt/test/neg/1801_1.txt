Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness, had a vivid sense of description that made this book astounding. While reading this book, I had every scene totally drawn in my head and I knew what each character was like. This book had many pieces, and by the time I finished reading this book, it seemed that the puzzle had been completed. After I finished reading Heat of Darkness, I watched the movie, which was a mistake. The film cut so many substantial parts. For example, in the novel, Marlow waited a long time for the rivets to come to him to repair his boat. This was a great source of futility. In the movie that part was left out. The movie added more parts that were useless and did not make sense. For example, when Kurtz was talking to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz broke the monkey's neck and killed him. What is the purpose of this scene, besides making the audience feel sorry for the monkey? It's as if the writer did not read the whole book and put the parts he read in the movie. If I had not read the novel before watching the movie, I would have been completely confused. The book was incredible and truly a classic in American literature, but the film could have been defiantly nominated for the worst photo at the Razzie Awards.
