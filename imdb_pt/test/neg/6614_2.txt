I watched this with great trepidation, and my apprehension was well founded, it seems. What was that movie? Knight? The station? The players? What? It was everywhere all the time. There was no tension (sorry, we all knew Bobby would curse and throw things), but Brian Denehy, a great actor, seems to be sending the rage and delivering zero tension. Very cheap, like an episode of MacGiver. Compare this major Thanksgiving course with HBO's work in the Don King movie "America Only" to show you how to do sports biopics, warts and all. Notice that ESPN has promoted hell out of it and then never showed it again?
