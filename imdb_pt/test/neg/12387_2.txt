I have not read the book of it and, based on that adaptation, I will not bother. I hated all the characters in this show - Miranda was mean, selfish and muttered miserably through terrible dialogue, her sister was a total coward, and that was the worst depiction of manic depression I've ever seen. I have a degree in psychology, and that was not accurate. In fact, until it was mentioned, I did not know that Troy should be bipolar - I thought he was a normal, mildly grumpy teenager. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace in this stupid show was David Tennant, whose brilliantly psychotic performance was the only thing that made me watch the second half. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the writers and producers of this program did not do any research - Troy's mental problems are neither remotely precise nor the forensics involved at the end of the "twist" (and if you did not realize that mile , you're such an idiot!) <br /> <br /> Total garbage.
