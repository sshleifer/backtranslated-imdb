I have to agree with the previous reviewer. Although Kristin Erikson did a great job of playing the possessed girl, I honestly do not think Isabelle, the character she was playing, was possessed. I have seen people having psychotic interruptions due to sexual abuse, and they have never made it clear whether the father actually abused her or not. I also had to watch some parts of it again, to make it clear what the letter said, what were the names of the characters, and I'm still not clear about some things that happened, whether they were real or not. . I'm trying to find the "original" story on which she relied, to compare facts, but I can not find anything about it online. <br /> <br /> It was not a bad movie, but some of the dialogue was incredibly extravagant. Special effects, the film was not bad for a Grade B, and those scenes of ownership made it all worthwhile ... that is if you have nothing better to do. I laughed a lot
