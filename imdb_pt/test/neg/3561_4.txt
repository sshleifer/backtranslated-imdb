This movie is about a bereaved wife who lost her husband by suicide. She is plagued by her son who refused to speak after that. <br /> <br /> Child suffering is rarely exploited in films, so it is refreshing to see a movie like Addison's. However, due to the very nature of the film, there is no tension or drama. In addition to some fundamental emotional moments, everything in the film is very simple. The abrupt ending that does not solve any mystery certainly does not help the film to be more watchable. The Addison Wall could have been a lot better, like exploring the contents of the wall, an intensive care program to help Addison go through his trauma. Instead, the movie looks very unfinished and not engaging.
