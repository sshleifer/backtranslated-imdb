I still have to watch the first entry in this series, however, fortunately, I was still able to follow the complex and intricate plot with all its unexpected twists and turns, and I applaud them for the total originality of the concepts contained herein. In case there is any confusion, let me leave no doubt that everything I have just said is clothed with pure and carefully nourished sarcasm, the kind that flourishes and grows exponentially when exposed to crap like this movie. One clear sign that this is not impressive is that it was directed by a visual effects creator whose only other credit in that field is a Henry Rooker movie that was not well received. The acting is, at best, average, and I challenge anyone not to meet ... Scottish Russian accent (come on seriously, with the surname)? Risible and / or irritant. There is a try or two in styling on this, and they are reasonable. The action is not terrible. Cinematography and editing are fine. The music is cool enough. Language is infrequent, even though it is. The violence is quite bloody. I recommend this just for fans of B movies, and I will say you can do worse than that. 1/10
