To be honest, I used to like this show and watch it regularly, but now (thank goodness!) I do not understand why I watched it. Sex and the City is one of the most insane and insulting TV shows I have ever seen. I really did not understand the purpose of this show, despite trying. People are saying sex and the city are funny. In what way? By cursing all the time, talking about vibrators and the size of the penis? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the plot: we have four girls who are trying to find a perfect man sleeping with every idiot who comes around. And this show is about four spoiled girls, who are sleeping with all the men in town, but in the end they admit that the best pleasure comes from the penis vibrators. And yes ... the show is trying to tell us that sex is the most important thing in any relationship. If you can have a good sex, you are a good husband (or wife). It does not matter if you want to be loyal and have a good heart ... size matters. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is also poor performance. The four main actresses (Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattral, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis) are so bad and unconvincing, it makes me sick just watching this show. Parker is just screaming and complaining all the time, Cattral is showing off her old boobs and saying "the f-word" all the time, Davis delivers her smile (and nothing more) and Nixon acts like she's bored all the time. And yes ... men are sex hungry pigs on this show. But, judging by this show, women are not much better. This show is insulting to both men and women. Women are shown as primitive and emotionless, as if they had no heart, just a hunger for sex. It is insulting to everyone. <br /> <br /> Sex and the city is one of the worst TV shows and I'm glad that the show is over because it has a bad acting and nonsense stories. The whole world is not all about sex and vibrators.
