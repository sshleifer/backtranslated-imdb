If someone tells you that this photo is simply fantastic, they probably have something to do with it or profit from it. This movie is a real loser and copies great budget horror movies situations and not to mention soundtracks for. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy. It's a low-budget movie with amateur actors. Looks like it was filmed for a movie contest. The acting is terrible and would not surprise me if the script was written by a screenwriter of Hee Haw. My family laughed at this. A Grade ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ all the way. You will not be frightened by it. Here's a taste of the terrible elements in this movie. When the guy gets stuck by the stupid portrait of Ric White of the Rev. James Johnston walking with a cane. The guys' reactions are as if he had an amputation without analgesic. Watch the extras on the DVD after watching the movie. When you see Ric White and the others speak so seriously about the movie, you'll laugh until your stomach hurts. How people will extend the truth and what they will do to earn a dishonest buck. Do not be fooled like we did and buy this failure.
