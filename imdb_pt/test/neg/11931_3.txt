Joan Crawford is convincingly disfigured when our story begins and, of course, she gets dressed up. But she's a bad egg, exploiting a guy while living the antisocial philosophy of another guy. All this happens in Sweden, which is truly bizarre. It makes anything and everything memorable in the visuals, which are released from representing Anytown USA, but it makes a spectator wonder why each remake is overloaded and made unspecified by the need to Americanize everything. There are plot, plot, plot so chatty that you could drown in it and make matters worse is a framing device that adds zilch to the movie. The photograph is occasionally nice, with odd angles and thumbnails embedded very well. But he is exhausted without ever attracting him.
