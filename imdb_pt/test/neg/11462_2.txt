Is it really possible that so many people in this movie believe that the girl is a witch? Just because she has dark hair and dark makeup, should she be a witch? And I have the impression that the movie tries to portray her as someone who is "different," someone who no one understands ... She's just a teenager and a dumb girl at her school says she's a witch and everyone believes her . In addition, Brandi is portrayed very poorly or the character itself is made to be so ... False. She did not convince me that she is not a witch, not that I believe in the first place. Everyone accuses her of being a witch and she acts as if she was not sure if she was a witch or not. And the way they dressed her for court - I see old women every day who would not wear it, even if it was the world's last outfit! Brandi's brother was not very convincing either ... But, you see, the important thing is that "she put the bad girl back on the floor at the end of the movie." "She won the battle, proved to everyone that she is different." <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the worst movies I've seen in the life of May, very shallow. I just watched because there was nothing else on the TV at the time, so I was doomed to this crap. Please do not waste your time watching this movie. When I saw the rating of 7 stars, I almost fainted ... It does not deserve it, compared to some other movies that are also rated with 7 stars.
