I thought it was comedy !! What a joke! I can not believe that Forsythe or Reynolds would really show up in this piece of garbage ... And then there's the beautiful Erika Eleniak or whatever that bit of eye candy is ... It seems like she put a few pounds from her center Playboy. About 50 !! The plot is ridiculous, the performance absolutely horrible, and the tired old cliches that run again and again, boy, it took a lot of energy to sit through this dog ... The only thing that paid off was the laugh !! And there's plenty! If you really want to kill say, an hour and a half picks the baby at the rental store, but make sure you have a room full of brain-dead people to watch with you. I think it's who you wrote it for ... it's like they're thinking about a real low-income, drug-induced audience for this one.
