It's as if Ghost-Hunted Marshmallow Man had reincarnated into Rutger Hauer's body and was taking revenge on a rival's pregnant wife! If you see an obese Hauer chase after a pregnant Isabel Glaser (imagine the creepy emotions in this competition) sounds good to you, watch this movie! Seriously, if Hauer is what looks like an Iraqi prisoner of war after six years in prison, then hungry people everywhere should queue up for a prison in Baghdad. Overall, "Tactical Assault" ranks 2 stars instead of 1 because Mike Mitchell as Hawk is fantastic. Mitchell burns the screen like a NATO pilot until his own plane is burned (by an enemy missile), after which the movie loses what little verve he had to get.
