Watching Showtime I got the impression that the producers got the idea to put Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy just for the sake of having a movie that co-starred the two. Also, I can not think of a reason to justify the existence of the film. Not that this is not fun on certain points, it certainly is, but the concept is so utterly ridiculous that the laughter is a bit muted. <br /> <br /> What really got me was the character of Eddie Murphy. I can not get involved with the concept of someone being a policeman as strictly a day job. When I worked for the New York State Crime Victims Board, I had to deal with all sorts of cops and they ran between the really dedicated ones and some real slugs, but I can not think of anyone who thought this was just something I do until I started my career by going in a very far area. I mean, can you really see Eddie Murphy or anyone else go through the rigors of the real Police Academy, not the onscreen version just to get a daily job? <br /> <br /> Either way, DeNiro is his basic detective. Who's on the runway of a big arms dealer. He is in disguise and Murphy is part of his backup. So, what makes the Murphy show, it calls a reality TV series like COPS to shoot the action. So DeNiro's bust explodes in the sky, but the show's producer gets some good scenes from Murphy and DeNiro and decides on a new reality-based television series. Then these reluctant partners come together and try to keep working on DeNiro's case with all the TV cameras. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy is a funny guy, I loved him in Beverly Hills Cop and in the films of Doctor Doolittle, but he's made things better than Showtime and Robert DeNiro certainly has. <br /> <br /> I think Murphy wanted a chance to work with DeNiro and DeNiro must have gotten a big paycheck to make that movie.
