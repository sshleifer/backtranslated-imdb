Simply put, the only saving grace that this movie has is settings, costumes and an OK punk show. As H.R.Giger should feel about his cyborg photo on the cover of this movie, I would not want to know. Right away, all I could do was make sarcastic remarks about the protagonists of the films, I was hoping the freaks in this movie would perform them bloody. I feel like the SPOILERS are coming! I was wondering if this movie in the spirit of the first 20 min. Was he meant to be as good-humored as the rest? Examining all the obvious political protests (Police trying to rape an "aberration", discussion of the superficialities between the "freak" and the boy of the fraternity and the punk concert with the feminine vocalista) and the use of the slow camera in the sequences of fight shouts "martial arts coordinator") I just do not know. The character named "Steve" has annoyed me since he tries to get into fights with street people (he should have been robbed and raped) and it looks bad when he broke that guy's neck at the end (I want him to show me how to do it?) say that, though, if they had developed other characters better than "Splatter," it could have gone somewhere. If there was a 0 to give this movie, it would have succeeded, but unfortunately it is a 1.
