I can not believe I sat through this crap. Palm trees in D.C. (already mentioned), a dummy-like-dead-body piece so obviously artificial that I thought it was supposed to be a mannequin ... until it left a blood stain ... blistered dialogue, ridiculous plot. I think it's a shame that Jill Ireland's last film before her death was this stink. Do not waste your time - I wish I had not. The only saving grace is that I was on the cable, so I did not spend my money on everything.
