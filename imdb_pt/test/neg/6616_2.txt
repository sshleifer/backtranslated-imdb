"Season on the Brink" is one of my all-time favorite books - a stern and unyielding look at Bob Knight and his Indiana Hoosiers. And Dennehy is one of my favorite supporting actors of all time. So I made a point of watching this adaptation. <br /> <br /> She was disappointed on every level. Dennehy's performance was less than inspired, and he seemed unprepared to play Knight - as if he had accepted the role before filming. The rest of the cast is not much better. <br /> <br /> And it was obvious that this was the first ESPN movie. It was misdirected, poorly filmed, and lack of budget was obvious at any time when games were simulated (smaller gyms, empty seats, etc.). Ignore this adaptation and read the book - it still holds true!
