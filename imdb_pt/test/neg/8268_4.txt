You just have to see it as a badly executed anti-abortion propaganda and you'll realize how bad it really is. The main message of this film is that even the sickest people can not commit an abortion. If you ask this is not too far from exploding abortion clinics. So this guy wants to kill a poor girl, but he has to convince her to have an abortion first. What a load of crap. And the worst part is that he has a compelling argument (bringing a child into a loveless environment), but this should be discarded because he is an aberration anyway. And the part with the Bible pushers ... first they play this girl just because she explains that someone stole their money (this rule must be in the bible somewhere) and then in the end they are a kind of angel like deus ex machina delivering the evil killer by harassing him in his front yard. Let's go. Other downpoints include a very confusing scenario (and I'm not talking about a good way) ... so this guy is just some psychotic, why? Because his mother fed his liver once? And I do not know about the rest of you, but he seemed like the coolest person in the world all through the movement! even if he was wearing girl clothes, stealing money and recording girls in his car. If you forget the silly story, this movie has great cinematography and Bob Hoskins was really great, and has one of those funny little English cars on it. If it was about some psychotic killer, I'd give it a 7 at least.
