Certainly one of the most horrible shows that have ever been produced on these beaches and that is saying something. Even many of the leading actors did not stay around all the time. The fact that it has worked for eight years is a sad accusation about the average and cultural intelligence of the Australian observer. It spun and circled, with repetitive jokes and poorly drawn characters. Arthur MacArthur, for God's sake. Did they really pay the writers of this show? I wonder if anyone checked their qualifications. There were tired jokes about country people and second-rate farce situations that were poor imitations of thousands of previous English and American sitcoms. I think this is what I hate so much, it seems like no one involved wanted to make it memorable, original or clever by opting for the lowest common denominator every time.
