Hollywood produced yet another garbage that is very exaggerated and unassuming the first time it is seen. Hannibal is evil, terrible, inept, lame, idiot, invented, laughable and utterly atrocious (no pun intended). Small spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> This film has huge logical holes - more than any Bruckheimer / Bay movie - or any movie that exemplifies the indulgence of Hollywood exaggeration. It's a Hollywood production planned to make money with Hannibal Reader Mania, directed by Ridley Scott, director "hack-it-takes-too-serious" and produced by an Italian producer hacker with an inflated ego whose creed is " movie is s ** t, money is good ". <br /> <br /> I can not get over the fact that acclaimed writers David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote this snob adapted from a lame and pretentious book by a good novelist-hacker-author Thomas Harris. David and Steven - well-known and immensely talented writers - squandered their efforts on a poor script in return for fat paychecks. Another factor in the disappointment of this movie. <br /> <br /> There are many ridiculous scenes to list that are laughable in clumsy executions and weak logic, for example. Starling / Pazzi cell phone in the middle of Lecter's pursuit appearing as Inspector Pazzi as the victim. Not to mention the ridiculously bad dialogues delivered by Tony Hopkins with a smile and Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta and others who can not act with a serious face. Hopkins gives the true meaning of "chewing scene" along with Hammy acting for Gary Oldman as a deformed psychopath bent on demanding revenge against Lecter. <br /> <br /> The bloody effect is good, but only serves to repel rather than provide suspense that is notably absent from Hannibal. The predecessor - Silence of the Innocents - is more believable with tension and suspense. Suspense is what makes the Silence of the Lamb work as a spectacular blend of psychological terror and suspense, not to mention superbly written and tenuously directed. The sequel to "brain dinner" is so ridiculously fake that it borders on self-parody. <br /> <br /> The ending is kind of cheeky and stupid - should we believe that Lecter is still a threat to society with the last shot setting his brilliant eye looking at you? Ooh, scary ... <br /> <br />
