I never thought a movie could make me regret the fact that I signed up for HBO. Now I know better! Jack is usually one of my favorite actors, but not even he could rescue that part. Not that he tried. Jack plays his usual Eastwick Wiitches character. Unfortunately it does not transfer to the American Southwest. He is as believable as a desperate cowboy like Pee Wee Herman. There is no room for performance and, for this reason, comedy fails. He's about to cum. The rest of the cast was worse. The delivery time for lines is apparently something that the protagonist did not perfect since 1978 and the others seemed happy to be there. My recommendation to those who are interested in seeing this movie is that it saves you valuable time for something like watching the paint dry.
