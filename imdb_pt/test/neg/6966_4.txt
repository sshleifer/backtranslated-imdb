Like other films by the worst director of all time, Ed Wood, this movie is very bad, but because of that is also very funny. It may not be for everyone, but I laughed a lot. It's a strange thing when you enjoy a bad movie. How do you rate it? Like a very low film, like at least a little bigger entertainment. <br /> <br /> The movie tries to explain what a transvestite is and does it through a scientist (Bela Lugosi) and an inspector (Lyle Talbot) who talks to a doctor (Timothy Farrell) who knows about these things. The doctor tells the detective two stories and that's what we, and apparently the scientist, see. The doctor tells these stories because a dead transvestite is found, suicide and because of a headline in the newspaper about a change of sex. The first and longest story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself) who is in love and about to marry Barbara (Dolores Fuller), but he has never told her that he likes to dress as a woman when he is called Glenda . The film tells the same thing repeatedly, especially the fact that a transvestite is not necessarily a homosexual. The film almost says being a transvestite is not a bad thing, but being homosexual, as it keeps telling us the fact that a transvestite is not homosexual. The second story is about a transvestite who really wants a change of sex and not just wants to dress as a woman, but is much shorter and less interesting. <br /> <br /> Some things make this movie very bad and therefore laughable. As the story is presented is the first thing, the way the same things are told again and again and the conclusion of all this is other. This is not where it ends. The acting is really bad, especially Dolores Fuller seems to be reading his lines directly from a small screen somewhere. Everything she says is funny. The whole dialogue really gave me a few laughs. <br /> <br /> There is also a sequence in which someone enters a room. The door is half open and we see something hanging on the wall, not completely straight. So the door, in what appears to be the same shot, although we know it is not, is a little less open and suddenly the thing on the wall is straight. Ed Wood did not mind leaving that kind of continuity error in his film. It may be a good thing, because it's basically just another laugh for the modern crowd. I think you understand that it's a bad movie and I think there's a good chance you'll laugh at the ridiculous mistakes too.
