When people say that kids are annoying, you think my little cousins ​​can be annoying and I said LITTLE. These kids are turning 10 and are arguably the most annoying kids you'll ever find (in a movie). Let's start with the blonde - Debbie - She's a whore for a girl, I mean, come on she wears mini skirts, she has stupid blonde beaded hair and a red rabbit like the face. She acts innocently. Then we have the second son - the nerd - who thinks he's so cool, with his long range shooting and his use of a muffler (a jacket over his gun) and, above all, his evil, spoiled grin. The next kid is the one you do not care about, so it's all about him. This film irritated me with the intelligence of the children and the only pleasure I received was from my cousin who kept complaining about them.
