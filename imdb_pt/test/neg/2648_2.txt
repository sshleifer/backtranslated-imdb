I went to see Random Hearts with 3 friends and at first I thought maybe it was just me who was not enjoying the movie. After all, I did not like As Good As It Gets and this movie won all sorts of awards. Well, it was not just me ... none of my friends liked it either. It was unbelievably slow, much like getting pulled teeth. The only action in the movie is what's in the previews. We did not leave the theater because we all assumed that something else would happen. We were not as smart as the 7 or 8 people who left. I've never been in a movie in my life, but I definitely should have. This is all difficult for me to write, considering that I am relatively easy to please when it comes to movies. It takes me a long time to think that a movie is incredible, but it's not much for me to like. This movie did not even come close to the category. Not only did the film last about 2 hours, but it was like two separate stories in one, but they were not stitched without problems. Also, the "soundtrack" if you could call it that was so annoying. As Seinfeld has the same riff that is played over and over again (difference being that I like Seinfeld) .. this movie had that jazz riff that kept playing, which sounded highly inappropriate at times, especially when people were dealing with the deaths of the plane crash. Hard to explain what I mean, but trust me, it was awful. I can not say enough to make people not waste their money. After I left the theater, I honestly wanted to write to the movie producer and demand my $ 7 back ... sheeesh, I might have played bowling or something like that money.
