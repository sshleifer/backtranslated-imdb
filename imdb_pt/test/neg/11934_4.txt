I'd bet the one month salary "The Magnificent Seven Returns" (MSR) was made for TV. Other reviewers attest that MSR was a theatrical movie, and I'll take your word for it. The logical answer must assume that it was originally shot for the TV, and after a change of studio, was cast in the air instead. Every actor is basically a TV actor: Mariette Hartley, Michael Callen, Ralfe Waite, Stephanie Powers ... TV artists. Lee Van Cleef divided his time between the TV and theater screens. Stephanie Powers has only made 3 or 4 appearances in "real" movies over the last thirty years of a very prolific television career - positive evidence that this was made for TV. The smaller players are veteran small-screen actors who can be seen in old reruns of "Gunsmoke," "Wild Wild West," "Streets of San Francisco," and so on. <br /> <br /> The ho-hum sets are identical to the Universal Studios Tour sets, often seen in older TV episodes. And the issue reveals the two or fastest of the TV, with limited camera movements, positioning, cutting and lighting. The soundtrack, exclusive to the original Berstein themes, is directly from the television of the seventies. Yes, I would bet the money was filmed for TV. <br /> <br /> This is an important point in the MSR assessment. Initially I watched MSR on cable, assuming it was an old version of the movie. Compared to the original "Magnificent Seven", it's a joke, a cartoon, an amateur attempt to make movies. Acting, lighting, writing, scenery, action, cinematography, music (exempting Berstein themes), editing, rhythm, ... and so on ... all pale compared to the classic "Magnificent Seven" the perfect 60's of the West, and one of the great action movies of all time. <br /> <br /> However, as I imagine, a TV movie made in the early 1970's, the movie is actually better than average. Those unfortunate enough to live the seventies as an adult know what I'm talking about. MSR would compete against "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" and bland network programs. During the '70s, "Gunsmoke" was a quality show, focusing on character development instead of action, disregarding the shooting game with two shootings a week. The first shooting, usually a murder, sets in motion the plot of the hour - the second shooting culminates in the episode killing the guest actor, his enemy, or otherwise resolving the conflict with Marshal Matt Dillon. MSR has more action than an entire season of "Gunsmoke". In this light - in this frame of reference - the MSR is passable entertainment, a cut above the TV rate of that decade.
