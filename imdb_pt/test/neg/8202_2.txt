The 1957 non-epic Roger Corman in which a lot of characters end up in a valley full of lead (sic) as well as the stock of nuclear material is unleashed. It's the end of the World. Four armed men, two women (one single virgin, the other a Las Vegas show that drinks and smokes - guess which one comes to the end of the movie?) Time passes, tensions develop (or should). Something is in the forest eating radioactive rabbits. A mutant monster! Seven weeks of radioactive dust have "a million years of evolution" (in an already living human being) the result is a laughable, zippered back rubber monster that is strangely afraid of its only source of fresh water. It rains. The monster dissolves. The two remaining characters, the Hunk and the Virgin. set out to repopulate the world as the caption "The Beginning" fills the screen after the brief rain shower has washed away all radioactivity and dissolved all the monsters running "out there." <br /> <br /> The only real note thing about this is the incredible amount of 'curtain actuation' that takes place in it. One of the basic elements of the film production of the period was the overabundant use of curtains in the design of the setting. It was cheap. Finished with a set-up? Pull out a curtain, drop a different piece of furniture in front of it and you will have a different location in minutes without having to move the camera or change the lighting. "Curtain Acting" is a skill in which the actor will comment on what is happening outside of any building he is in ("Looks like Rain" or "Here they come now, and it looks like they have the sheriff with them! ", kind of thing). He will do this by standing by the window - passing over the body and lifting the curtain away from the window, but along the axis of the shot - that is, toward the camera - allowing him to look and tell us what is happening off-screen without allowing the audience to see that he is looking at the studio wall three inches away from his nose behind some cheap velvet curtains. There was a lot of that in this movie.
