This film makes me seriously doubt if Armando de Ossorio was a good filmmaker or not ... His BLIND DEAD films are praised by many fans. This I can understand. But wanting to be a banal goth vampire like MALENKA shows no sign of a talented filmmaker. And that goes for SNAKE SEA. It features horrible acting, a stupid plot, stupid events, many other things you can expect from a bad movie of monsters and also veteran actor Ray Milland who does his best to grumble his way while not having much experience. clue what he's doing in it. Apparently Milland was already very sick while filming SEA SERPENT (his last theatrical long) and leave with a stinking ridiculous like this, it makes everything even sadder. One last appearance alongside Peter Cushing in a TV movie directed by Roy Ward Baker (also in 1984) does not change much about it. <br /> <br /> But the sock / sea serpent puppet is a joke. to contemplate. Watch him shake a headlight and smash it. Watch him destroy a port with miniature boats. Look at it, demolish bridges and munch on charming miniature trains. Good evil? Yes. 3/10 and 7/10
