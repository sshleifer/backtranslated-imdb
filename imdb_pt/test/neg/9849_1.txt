There are so many things wrong with this movie that I do not even know where to start. The story is not cohesive. I guarantee that five minutes into the movie the average viewer will be scratching his head in confusion. Here's what I remember about the movie before I was bored into unconsciousness: a quasi-abusive father chases some pre-teen Sisters through a home but ends up not being so abusive after all. In the next scene, the girls are about 15 years old. They are driving with their parents and hitting a deer. The deer must have been explosive because his car explodes, one sister dragging the other from the burning wreckage. So the girls are adrift on a boat on a lake and make a great plan to go to Kentucky (?) And start a new life. In the next scene, the girls are asking for a ride to a military base. And what a military base that is. In fact, it's more like a pig farm converted to look like a military base with lots of confusing extras playing "soldiers." The base commander's office is particularly impressive because there are random things like an AK-47 hanging on the wall and a sergeant hat mounted on a plaque (????) so the public knows for certain that this is the office of a military. . Then a random guy pushing a motorcycle shows up and the base commander orders him to "go to the city" to buy some pornographic magazines, and to make sure the soldiers do not think he's in the "pink team". Then our character picks up a converted pickup to look like an army truck "to town" and carries a box of an undefined bookstore with a doll in the front door. The girls hide in the guy's truck when he stops to choke, and look through the pornographic stock to find items inside as the "anal invader." I think it's enough of the plot to scare most people. Apart from the plot, the sound quality is terrible and the film is filled with absurd attempts at symbolism, like a radio preacher talking about forbidden fruits during the scene where the "sneaky" sister meets the main character for the first time, or as the camera remains too long in certain scenes to try to convey a "message". <br /> <br /> If you see this for sale or rent or anything else, stay away. Not worth the money in any of the cases.
