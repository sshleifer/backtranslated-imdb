Strangers with sweets exaggerate in the wrong context, situations are not funny with the extravagant voices and the comedy of bad eyebrows, the clear attempt of dry / black / dark humor is obvious and fails to deliver all the elements of a good joke. <br /> <br /> With a factor of high distortion and low rate of laughter I was shocked by the show passed in the first season, I personally like Scrubs, The Office, 30 Rock, Park Boys Trailer, Pulling, Peep Show, Simpsons, Family Guy and I know what you think, these shows are no strangers, so some other good shows I've seen are Jam, Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, The Book Group, Asylum and Snuff Box which are original with dry / black / dark mood / satire and are at least 5/10. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Garth Marenghi's Darkplace is especially cheap, overdone and strange, but the context is thought out and works to make it really out there and fun too.
