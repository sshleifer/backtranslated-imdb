I was seriously stolen with this purchase. The other posters cover very well the flaws of this poor poor movie. My DVD I actually bought had the 1978 Piranha poster art on the cover with the credits for the film in the 'Directed by Joe Dante', etc. I was very disappointed to find the wrong movie on the disc. I'm really a fan of many bad movies. There is always something funny or at least fun in most of them somewhere. Not this movie! In fact, I will spend the three dollars in gas money to return this two dollar DVD just for the principle of the thing. Shameless fake packaging here. Easily the worst movie of all time. No redeeming factor at all. Nor is it worth checking just to see how bad it is. Seriously.
