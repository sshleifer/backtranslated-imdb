This movie is very bad, trying to create scientific explanations for zombies always ends up taking the credibility of the film's history. There are so many things I could point out about the movie that I could almost write a book about how much the movie sucks. For example, there were about 50 people on the plane, they killed as 100 and they kept coming, apparently the "virus" causes liver complications because everyone had yellow eyes, the virus also makes people roar like lions or something, and the virus not only regenerates the tissue, it also gives superhuman strength, not to mention that this virus messes people's hair. It is also important to note that if you shoot someone with a pistol (probably only happens on airplanes) that person is kicked back into the air. Remember that if you're escorting a prisoner on an airplane and loosening it, always look into the drawers and cabinets the size of a bottle, you never know where those bastards are going to hide. And if you happen to be able to land an airplane full of zombies against a mountain and survive (happens all the time), after seeing dozens of people being killed, just get off the plane, watch the sunrise and make jokes about dating the flight attendant. :)
