This movie was like a meeting of people who were in other films and they decided to make a very bad movie. There was a guy from "Detroit Rock City," a girl from "The Cosby Show," that idiot who kissed the girl and bought that sausage in "Sorority Boys" and there was more. Ok, this does not make a bad movie in itself, it was just something I noticed. The whole thing with the prostitute and the French girl with the same name was dumb and the thing with 37 people writing those notes and if you think they're going to mix ... shocking enough ... you called. And the purse thing, that was just stupid. It was so bad that I watched the movie in two parts and still managed to get to the 50 minute mark. If you're watching this and expect "Van Wilder" or a movie like that ...... No.
