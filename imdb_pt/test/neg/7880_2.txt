I'm fed up with the "open-minded" argument. I'm usually pretty open minded, but this type of line is basically made by people who like things that should not be "enjoyed". You know what, there's a reason so many people are upset about it. And just because someone out there is no less so. There is, after all, a reason for the existence of the feeling of disgust, and no amount of "open mind" or "pushing the envelope" should eliminate this feeling. Otherwise, we are no better than meaningless living beings. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Another argument is that this film puts women in the roles usually reserved for men, which may be the reason why men do not like it. But only because it proves revolting to more men than would not be great. Maybe men should not be linked by what dominates the film industry, but the answer is for women to do the same? Maybe if you do not like movies, TV and entertainment having so much sexual objectivity from women, so much violence, do not watch them. <br /> <br /> And if you're a director, do not do it. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, someday someone will ask for an open mind when what happened in this "movie" happens in real life. <br /> <br /> Heck, some people seem to like this a lot.
