Anyone who rates this movie above a 3 has a very distorted view of the movies, anyone who values ​​this piece of sh! T 7 or higher, I have absolutely no respect for their taste in movies, and I doubt they have seen a good movie. I'm always ready to give a shot to any movie and I did with this, I tried to watch, I tried not to let my money go 2 wasting but 15 minutes my friends were laughing at me because I was listening 2 my iPod 25 minutes then I could not even see what was happening inside the movie, so I went up and left, I never left a movie, even this garbage, Anyone who said they liked it, is a liar, or they should be banned from this site. I get very angry when I see a person evaluating this as an 8 when Godfathers' overall rating is 9.1, it's like saying that movie was close, but it's not.
