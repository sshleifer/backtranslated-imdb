"Fat Girls" is among the worst films of the gay indie genre. <br /> <br /> The premise is promising: an ordinary-looking gay teenager is trapped in a small repressive Texas town. Their only spirits are the other misfits of the HS village: the fat girl of the class, a naive immigrant from Cuba, and the sensitive theater teacher. So far, interesting. In theory, this plot creates a decent setting for a compelling story of maturity with a built-in audience - the thousands of gay men who grew up in small towns across America and experienced that teenage first-hand anxiety, peppered with a dose of self-deprecating humor . Sadly, instead of a dramatic drama, Ash Christian addresses his autobiographical subject with a poorly executed attempt at irony and black humor. The result is a cast of two-dimensional, derivative characters that the viewer can not help but feel indifferent to. Sabrina (Fink) is an almost bitterly obstinate Gothic. She is such a thorny and unpleasant person; There is little doubt as to the reason for his friendless condition. The chemistry between her and Rodney (Christian) records zero. This may have been a bad choice, but it is most likely due to a road map that is simply unrecoverable. Consequently, one can wonder when there is such a nonexistent link, which could justify his almost constant companionship throughout history. <br /> <br /> Sabrina's newly discovered boyfriend, Rudy (of Jesus), and Rodney's mother. Judy (Theaker) are among the most exaggerated cliché characters ripped from dozens of other films. Rudy is the undiscovered horny immigrant / nerd drawn directly from all the adventurous teen comedies of all time inside the TV or movie theater. Judy is born again obsessed with Jesus talking and big hair. Just when you thought the Tammy Faye thing had been made to death, Christian inserts a scene where Judy's mascara is rushing with her tears! Is there anyone in the civilized world who might think this old, tired stereotypical one is still funny after seeing her ad nauseum for 20 years? <br /> <br /> In addition to the failed attempts at sardonic humor, there are many intriguing puzzles. inconsistencies of history. Rodney considers himself a "fat and ugly" loser. However, he can simultaneously participate in casual and regular impromptu encounters with the ubiquitous school athlete, Ted (Miller). Although such contacts are devoid of emotional satisfaction, most gay teenagers (full of furious testosterone, as well as their straight brothers) would find this a very enviable arrangement, given the more common alternative of involuntary celibacy. <br /> <br /> Rodney finds an object for his affection in Bobby (Bruening), an exotic transplant from England. Against all believable odds, the boy does not just land in this small village in TX, but is conveniently openly gay. Like Sabrina, Bobby is a smart and angry, and the viewer gets scratching his head about his magnetic appeal. <br /> <br /> To his delight, Rodney is invited for his new passion for the city's gay bar, where Bobby claims to be the DJ. Upon arriving, the future boyfriend leaves Rodney alone and goes to another area of ​​the bar for a quick meeting with a rather handsome young man. This is yet another of the elements of the ridiculously inexplicable plot since Rodney's feelings as an outcast are supposedly derived largely from his solitary existence in a parish city. As small as the city is, do they have openly gay students at school? A secretly bisexual football captain? Lesbian moms? A gay teacher? and has a gay bar in the center (sponsored by attractive men, not less)? Apparently, the place is not so late, after all. <br /> <br /> Ten years earlier, Todd Stephens' "Edge of Seventeen" covered almost the same material with a much more creative, honest, touching and humorous film.
