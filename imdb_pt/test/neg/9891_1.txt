This rubbish bears as much resemblance to romance as a slice of cucumber does with a cucumber. The filmmakers removed the Alamo section of the book, turned it into a movie and said it was based on the book. Hah! I wonder what they did to induce Mr. Michener to endorse this piece of fluff? It was just another Davy Crockett, flintlock, Santa Ana, 13 days of poppy glory collection. I almost started cheering on Mexicans, just to make the damn thing go away. And what was that scene where Stacey Keach was trying to make James Bowie let him look at the knife? The sexual insinuations he used were juvenile and unnecessary. They could have used the film they squandered with such nonsense to put in some real dialogue. This show was an embarrassment to Hollywood. Or can these clowns be ashamed?
