In addition to some good moments of gross violence, this painful movie is most notable for making 68 minutes seem like two hours. <br /> <br /> It starts with an endlessly lengthy introduction where the Leeds family is introduced, including two unbearable tykes and their adult brothers and sisters, completely cliches Pa and Ma, and incredibly annoying grandpa (played by Charles " Chic "Sales). As they sit down to dinner, the family is disturbed by the sounds of gunfire, and rushes to the window in time to see two men being slaughtered by mobsters on the street. The mafiosi flee the family home, leaving them as witnesses to the crime. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film consists of Walter Huston as the prosecutor, occasionally interrupting long anti-war speeches to make attempts to protect the Mafia family. Everything ends in a predictable way. Good points about the film include a couple of decent shootings and a really nasty beating, Nat Pendleton as one of the mobsters, and the beautiful Sue Blane in a small role as the daughter of Leeds. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch Huston play your man of law, try the "Beast of the City" of 1932. Avoid this if possible.
