This Western Spaghetti uses three major American actors who take away some of the typical aura of spaghetti. The plot is about an amnesty that the governor of New Mexico gives to all criminals willing to give them a chance to start a new life. Usually this type of opportunity is limited to past events, but in this movie it seems like a license to kill, because even new crimes (such as threatening the governor) are forgiven. The story is an endless chain of murders where almost every character has only the purpose of delivering more carcasses. Only the few leads have resistance. Clay McCord is haunted by nightmares related to a childhood event where, unsurprisingly, he has killed many people. In the midst of eternal chaos, this kind of reflection lacks credibility. Compared to similar films, such as BANDIDOS none of the characters in this movie was pleasing to me. <br /> <br /> In addition to the weak content that hits certain clients, this film is well filmed, the sets are a little detailed and the acting is average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
