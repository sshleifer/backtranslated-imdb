The female high school star dies of a blood clot after winning a rush with the community in an uproar against trainer George Michaels (Christopher George interpreting him as a big butt who is very picky of the athletes under his watch). He will be canned after the school fails to provide the film with his motive as a possible killer. Some twisted psychopath with sweat (almost the same as Michaels is usually seen wearing), using a stopwatch to time his executions, kills the track team members that the dead female runner was part of. Soon, troubled parents call director Guglione (Michael Pataki) wondering why his kids did not come home after a graduation party. Inspector Halliday (Carmen Argenziano) starts snooping around the campus at the request of concerned parents. Instantly, a besieged Michaels becomes the prime suspect after the body of a gymnast is found in a closet. Student Anne (Patch Mackenzie) returned home from her base in Guam to receive her dead sister's diploma and then confronts the killer herself in the climactic chase scene. Kevin Badger (And Danny Murphy) is the tired boyfriend of the lost star. <br /> <br /> A slow pace spreads the death sequences trying to mix a little inner humor and instead fails miserably. Low-quality killing sequences only increase laughter, such as a sword embedded in a soccer ball thrown into the stomach of a football player or a pair of gardening scissors used to behead a poor soul leading to a leak. Linnea Quigley has a fun role as the eccentric student Dolores, who sleeps with her music teacher to a higher degree and always chases a stallion (the winner of the garden scissors before he has a chance to sleep in Dolores outside the party of Graduation). Vanna White has a starring role here as a ditsy blonde who discovers the body of the dead gymnast in the closet. Virgil Frye has a foolish role as an inept officer.
