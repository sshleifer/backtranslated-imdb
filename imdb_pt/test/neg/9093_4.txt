I really could not get into that movie. The plot is an old woman who has tortured someone for so long that she is deformed. She dies and he is left in the basement to starve to death. The months must pass and a family moves. The daughter is blind because of an accident caused by her father. Well, anyway, this guy in the basement, who by all means must be dead a long time, is still out there. He eats a cat and is now superhuman. He now wants to eat people and have sex. And when a prostitute dies, the father is guilty. I always do not like movies where someone is guilty of the murders, because you're always here on the typical lines "I did not do it", "I could never do such a thing", blah, blah, blah. And the plot of the family could be a movie plot for a lifetime.
