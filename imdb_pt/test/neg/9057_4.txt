I did not hate it. I just could not adapt to the story. did not really get me. Michael Mann is a very good director, but I have to disagree with his methods on this. I'm also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. some projects he's been in are very bad, but his acting is brilliant. my favorite movies of Daniel Day Lewis are "There Will Be Blood and Gangs of New York". <br /> <br /> There was one thing I loved about it and that was the soundtrack, it gave the movie a lot of atmosphere. That's all I liked, though. this movie has a high vote, which is a bit random. I can see that a few people will like this, but not enough to do the overall 7.8 rating. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a miss if I were you but there are a lot of high votes for this so I guess you should watch and make your own opinions on what you think. I really did not like it ... 4/10 .... j.d Seaton
