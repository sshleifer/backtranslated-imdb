Do you want the worst horror movie of the 21st century? El Chupacabra is that. "Hands: The Hands of Fate" is the worst film of all time, but El Chupacabra is certainly the worst movie of this century. It also has to have the distinction of having the worst absolute actor of all time. Eric Alegria, the actor in the lead role, has never made another film besides El Chupacabra, dammit - I wonder why. <br /> <br /> Apparently the monster is attacking people, but everyone who is attacked moves very slowly and is really stupid. And, there are no cops in this town just two idiot detectives - Hello! Cops appear on the homicide scene first, then the detectives come! And apparently the monster only attacks in a person's backyard and in some deserted area on the docks. Or ... these are the only places the filmmakers could have access to the film. <br /> <br /> This "movie" is the reason the IMDb must allow us to give negative stars. This easily deserves -10 stars, or at least 0. They should allow a rating of 0.
