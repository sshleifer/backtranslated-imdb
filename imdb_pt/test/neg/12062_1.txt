Idiots are going to camp and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots, yes Camp Blood (or if you're wanting a lousy, worse than a pun that combines with a bad movie, "Camp Bloody horrible"), it's so bad really depressing to watch. And it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad movie ... <br /> <br /> A horrible check. Bad script check. Sticky effects - check if there is no originality - double check. <br /> <br /> It does not even try to be different, and it's full of all the predicted cliches. For example, the movie opens for a couple having sex in the woods, so of course they end up dead. <br /> <br /> One of the most disturbing things is that this movie actually spawned two sequences, like and why it just confuses the mind. <br /> <br /> Just stay away from this.
