What is it about drug addiction that attracts novice filmmakers to offering their own opinion on the subject? This matter was done to the death. Drug abuse is bad. We understand. Drug addiction is painful to watch. We also understand that. But the dark subject does not give the filmmaker permission to make a bad movie. Each film need not be a Hitchcockian masterpiece of cinematic excellence, or use Orson Welles' deep focus, but it's still a narrative film. Verite does not mean pseudo-documentary. Even consumer mini-DV cameras are capable of producing white whites and black blacks, and this filmmaker is only being lazy when shooting without contrasting scenes with the existing lighting: the subject is dark enough without artificially forcing it with a cinematography sloppy And even documentaries have a mix of sounds. Vera Farmiga is very talented, given the right stuff, but the director obviously outdid her and sucked the whole life out of her performance. Addicts may live in a haze, but they still have emotions, but none of these characters seems to exist off-screen. Supporting players just handed in their lines without creating real people. Sorry to be so severe, Debra, but some things are true wanting to believe them or not. I'm sure your next movie will be better - but please, not another drug film. :)
