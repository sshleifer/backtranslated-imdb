The box is why I originally got this movie and the back is because I rented it. But I soon learned that I was deceived. I had thought that this movie would be something like a Business Trip / Eurotrip / American Pie. But I was wrong. This movie is one of the dumbest I've seen in a long time. The unrated version causes you to watch, but it will disappoint you completely. The performance was poor and the sound effects were exaggerated. It seemed very low budget with all the setup taking place in the same building. Go and get Eurotrip or Road Trip instead. I can not believe National Lampoon put your name on it. DO NOT BUY, DO NOT RENT. Do not waste 2 hours of your life on this.
