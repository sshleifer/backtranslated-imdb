I have to agree with what many of the other reviewers have concluded. A subject that could have been thought-provoking and shed light on a double inverted pattern, failed miserably. <br /> <br /> Rape being a crime of violence and forced to an abusive control, the scenes here were mostly pathetic. It would have been a better idea to cover brief glimpses of what was happening and let the audience imagine the action. And the victim's laughter with the police, when he aborted his police complaint, seemed as genuine as the police officers. No embarrassment, no hesitation in just participating. I do not know if this was bad or bad direction, but someone totally missed the point. As for his supposed quest for his aggressors, pathetic. They should have skipped most of the sex scenes - another monumental failure in themselves, and he had met Colin Friels when he first went to the police. The story could have been crafted with a good dialogue and occasional flashbacks - and saved by the superior acting and presence of Colin Friels - the only reason I watched this movie - brings to any project he does. <br /> <br /> The only concrete revelation of this movie is crap.
