Extraordinarily cold and silly drama director Sydney Pollack. The soapy plot revolves around an adulterous couple who perishes in a plane crash, leaving their spouses to find each other and connect on their own intimate level. Romance-writing is a slow treatment, though I thought the performances of Harrison Ford and Kristen Scott-Thomas were fine. Intelligent production is of interest, even if the plot continues to cover the same terrain and never builds any emotional moment. As a result, the climax at the airport is a big "so what?"
