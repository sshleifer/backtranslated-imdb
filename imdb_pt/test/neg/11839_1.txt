Ok, let's get one thing straight, I love dinosaur movies, even the bad ones. So, with that in mind, let's move on. "Raptor" is a truly horrible movie, in fact it is not even a movie in itself, as it is patched up of bits of "Carnosaur", "Carnosaur 2" and "Primal Species - Carnosaur 3". There are some new footage with Eric Roberts as a sheriff and his bumpy little helper running around confused, scared or whatever is trying to convey (badly) the emotional scale, but how can they react to something that was filmed several years before? . The producers (yes Roger Corman I'm talking about you!) Even went so far as to hire 2 people from "Carnossaurus" to play little parts so there terrible death scenes can be reused! So this movie is the cheapest on the cheap. Watch the 3 original movies, there are no Oscar winners, but they do have some meritt value and entertainment, but avoid "Raptor". Oh, also has the most meaningless sex scene that lasts almost 10 minutes! Do you think they were trying to keep up with the execution time?
