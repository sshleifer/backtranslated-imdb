After reading many good things about it, I finally watched "the clearing". With a cast of great actors like Redford and Dafoe, it would at least wait for a decent movie. After the final credits rolled I was still shocked at how bad and incoherent this movie really was. <br /> <br /> Is it supposed to be an "art" movie? I do not think so because it's too melodramatic for that. The bad thing is that the drama seems very forced and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The truth is that the script makes absolutely no sense. First of all, he never really explains the motive behind the actions of any of the characters, he just overboard the so-called "personal issues". What is so bad about the character of Redford's character that he has to "clean" ? The fact that he occasionally cheats on his wife? The guy is a millionaire who has had a good life, has a big son and a big daughter, a wife who loves him (and a girlfriend who also seems to be well above the generic type of woman) and a newborn grandson. The only problem seems to be that he's been working hard all his life to be a successful person. So what? It seems that your hard work really paid off and there really is no real problem with your life. Then we come to Dafoe's character: here is someone who was manager of one of Redford's companies and was fired. Why is this guy unemployed for ... eight years ??? It seems like he must have some kind of good education to have a job like what he took first and seems to have been a man with solid ideas about his work (as evidenced by the flashback of a conversation he had with Redford when he was working to him) Why did not a man like that get a decent job and live a decent life? Why was he once fired? Totally unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The movie really tries to portray these men as "tortured souls" or something and that comes out as really cheesy. In fact I would say that if the creators of this movie were trying to say something about the American dream t when they failed miserably. <br /> <br /> As for the real events that happen during the film, they also make no sense at all. In fact, the last 20 minutes of the movie are an insult to the viewer. intelligence because there is not one thing that really makes sense. Redford seems to have about 1000 chances to escape but he does not. One moment he is ready to escape and yet he loses his chance because he feels sorry for his kidnapper and does not want to hurt him! Then Dafoe takes his weapon from the water and the mud, which must be useless (if you shoot a shot with a gun after the gun have been in the water and mud will possibly explode on your face) and the gun is in perfect condition !!! The way an unemployed, useless (as portrayed in this movie) and mentally unstable character, manages to fool the whole FBI so easily brings the narrative of this movie to "twilight zone" levels. The cheese end (with illusion of Redford's wife) comes to wipe out the viewer. <br /> <br /> This movie pretends to be something, is not (ie, a sophisticated and quality psychological suspense). Unfortunately it fails so much that it becomes a disaster and that is the word that describes this movie is better: A DISASTER.
