This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen (not including anything by or with Pauly Shore). I could not believe a movie could really be that bad! <br /> <br /> Coolio has to be the only worst actor (again, not including Pauly Shore) forever "starring" in a movie. The temptation to hit the STOP button during this movie was huge (actually, if there was a THROW IN THE LASH button on my VCR I would be inclined to press it). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, and do something more interesting than watching this movie, like watching the grass grow or watching golf on TV.
