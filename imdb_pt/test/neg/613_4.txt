I became a big Carpenters fan, and I really did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I think it's focused a lot on your anorexia and it did not let your true personality shine. I did not much like Cynthia Gibb's picture; especially knowing that she decided that Karen's anorexia was suicide, which clearly was not. Although her family was not big on hugs and kisses, I thought the movie portrayed Agnes (her mother) as being terrible. <br /> <br /> I found some scenes to be distressing in a way, like where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier; I thought the metaphor (so to speak) was quite effective. When the family is playing pool and discussing their divorce, she becomes uncontrollable and Richard is shocked when he consoles her and feels that her fragile body was well on the move (which is probably the wrong word). <br /> <br /> I feel that they needed to bring out their most bubbly and quirky side - their genuine personality. Even as the focus of the film, there really was not a point that led the person to understand what would lead to anorexia (although, of course, no one really knows), and almost made it seem unfounded. The film was poorer-singer-with-anorexia than the Karen Carpenter story, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I would say that they changed their husband's name / profession and everything because they were not allowed to actually include it (there were some bad terms there), but that whole thing was inaccurate with the changes . On this note, I can not remember the movie bringing up the yearning for a family and children, which prevailed a lot in his life and explains his vertiginous romance and his quick marriage with her husband. <br /> <br /> Overall, it turns out to be a low-budget movie made for TV that is not high-quality, and it can be disappointing if you're an unconditional fan who expects to see beyond Karen's disease. I feel that such a legend deserves / deserved a better film as a tribute to an incredible person and an incredible voice.
