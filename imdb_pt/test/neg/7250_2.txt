If I like a movie, I need to be concerned about the main characters and what happens to them. In this mess of a movie, I found myself waiting for them to all die in the end. None of the characters are people you'd like to meet, they've all made me sick. If it were not for some nudity scenes, I would have given this miserable movie a 1.
