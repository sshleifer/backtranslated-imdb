I saw this movie considering this as a normal Hollywood movie but then came to know that it is a movie made for the TV channel. On my DVD cover two critics comments one of the reviewer stephen farber of moviline reveiwed as a better movie Year .. <br /> <br /> The whole character was simple and decent performances except the character of the Brain, who never achieves scope that director wanted to keep mystery to the end .. there was suspense to the end, but when you see the end that the lady Officer of police and main culprit had a lesbian case seems to be totally stupid idea. God knows what happens to DAVE the main male character .. <br /> <br /> The other critic of Mr. Brown's movies said that shocking and effective but does not quite live all the hype ... that I saw after watching the movie. for which I was partially at peace ... I should have read this first before making the film ..
