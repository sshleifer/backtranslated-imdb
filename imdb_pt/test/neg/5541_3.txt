I realize it's a small statistical sampling (8 votes from this post), but 5.9 out of 10? I'm giving this movie a 3 and even this is generous. I've tried watching this movie three times now (Saturday night at 9 pm on the SciFi Channel, and Saturday night at 1:00 a.m. and Thursday night) and I fell asleep all three times before the movie finished. Which leaves me with a list of unanswered questions. For example, is Lance Henriksen needing the money to continue playing supporting roles in these awful "Pumpkinhead" sequences? Is Henriksen banned from making any film other than "Pumpkinhead"? Can not the creators of this franchise be better than a monster that looks like a geriatric, emaciated "Alien" who walks around like a stuck toothpick? When will the white-haired characters in these films realize that guns and rifles do not hurt "Pumpkinhead"? Why do not they try to improvise something else? And finally, the writers of this film are so challenging that they could not find names for the two more original rival families than the Hatfields and the McCoys? While you're at it, why not write a screenplay about a fictitious president and name him George Bush? Someday I may have the mental energy to watch this movie through to the end without falling asleep. Until then, if anyone has the answers, please let me know.
