I am a big fan of Deepa Mehta's work, especially Fire and Earth 1947. Unfortunately, this film of her lacks everything that is needed for a good movie. <br /> <br /> The film tries to show the situation of the widows. in India at the beginning of the 20th century and the new wave of ideas of his rehabilitation at the same time. Shown with a child widow as a central character, although the plot very banal from the Indian point of view, it could still have been a very powerful film. There! the film lacked both the sensitivity of Fire and the intensity of emotion on Earth in 1947. <br /> <br /> Even if we assume that history is a given, although there are hundreds of things I would have liked differently in this as well , the film is especially unfortunate. All is said. Everything is shown in a straight line. Absence of sensitive sensitive phrases. Absence of unspoken things. I just could not believe this was a Deepa Mehta movie. There were some very standard Hindi movie characters - like an old widow with her own interests, or a father who has twice the standards of the movie. higher quality. Can not write a screenplay without having these old characters from standard Indian movies? <br /> <br /> Many people hailed Deepa for making a movie and proving a point against Hindu fundamentalists. Well, I agree that she has taken a bold step, but should not she worry about the quality of the film, or will it be a controversial end in itself? Obviously, if you start with a story like Water, you will end up feeling the pain of the widows in consideration - it does not take a consummate director to achieve this. And the movie had nothing more to it !! So where is Deepa's contribution to the film? <br /> <br /> And talk about how to act etc. - pathetic !!! Lisa Ray has a pretty face, an extremely handsome face - but that's when it ends. She does not speak Hindi; she can not thrill. Jo√£o Abraham is no better. Most widows seem unnatural. The saving grace is Seema Biswas and the young woman. They are fabulous. <br /> <br /> And this was a period film - but the dialogues in Hindi are a big problem. Even the utterance is as unnatural as it seems. No rustic accent !!! No local slang. There's nothing. The only certain thing was probably the locations. I thought the whole of the vidhwa-ashram was fairly real. The overall blue tint throughout the film is also adequate. <br /> <br /> But everything and everyone, do not watch this movie. You will not get anything. There is nothing in the story or direction. If you have to watch, look at the performance of the little girl.
