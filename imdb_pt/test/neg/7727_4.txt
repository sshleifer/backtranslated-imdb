Granted, HOTD 2 is better than Uwe Boll's crapfest which was the first, but that's like saying that drowning is better than being bitten alive. Okay, I'm being a bit rough on this one, it's just that the adaptations of the zombie movie video game always leave a bad taste in my mouth. Resident Evil was fine, but its strings are pure crap. The first HOTD was crap fun more than anything else; Uwe Boll realized that. And HOTD 2 was ... better? The entertainment value was there, the hotties were there, the blood was there, but ... is this it? The script, though below the point, was better than the first. But in the script there are horribly written characters, idiot action sequences, clichés and a final that creeps and reaches a level of ridicule that would make the Bollmeister very proud. But, could it have been worse right? <br /> HOTD 2 stars Sig Haig (Yes, Sid Haig) as an insane doctor looking for a cure for death. As you can imagine, everything goes to shit. A nearby college campus seems to be the center of the zombie epidemic (or Hypersapien?), And as you might expect, a group of Commandos and two zombie scientists try to save the world by going there and neutralizing the problem. Your main goal? No, it will not explode. Instead, they need to get a blood sample of zombie to create a cure for the deadly virus. Between this and that, there are dull character interactions, an unbearable amount of clichés (but, hey, at least, the nigger is not the first to be killed), and decent-looking zombies. <br /> <br /> Acting is acceptable. Who would have thought Sticky Fingaz was an acceptable actor? I do not. Emmanuelle Vaugier and Ed Quinn shine a bit like the leaders. And the support cast was also acceptable. It was all acceptable. <br /> <br /> The effects of makeup on the Zombies were good, it could have been worse as in the first HOTD: just guys running around in dusty mommy suits. The blood was fine too. Cheap attacks and even cheaper tension are almost nonexistent in this movie, which is a good thing. The action sequences were stupid as f * ck, but at least there were no zombies fighting with swords or that ridiculous slow-motion bullet effect. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will appeal only to zombie enthusiasts, fans of arcade games and anyone who wants to rent a cheap horror movie for the weekend. Apparently, there will be a third as suggested by the end, but I would not count on that. Unless Uwe decides to do it. A 4.
