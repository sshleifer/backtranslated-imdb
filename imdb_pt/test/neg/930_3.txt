He loaned scenes from SDA, Matrix, Star Wars, etc. The mood is so dry, artificial and tacky that you can not help but laugh occasionally at your inanity and the fact that you are watching. Exactly what you would expect from a HK comedy. The average person would come in with an IQ of 100 and leave with less than 80. Stephen Chow is an obvious omission from this movie. The mood would have worked better with Stephen. The Mandarin version of this movie is not as good as the original Cantonese. The graphics are poor compared to their Hollywood counterparts. There is excessive reliance on low quality CG. My biggest complaint is your ending. The origin of the white horse is so clearly described in "Journey to the West" (JW), that this alternative explanation does not work well with the plot. Despite its many flaws, this movie has a lot more entertainment value than the other film in which Nicholas Tse starred - The Promise.
