1983 was an excellent year for Stephen King's books to hit the big screen. Christine, The Dead Zone and Cujo were all released within a few months of each other. While The Dead Zone was easily the group's choice, Christine and Cujo were both very bad, and it's a close thing as to which is the smaller of the two. If pressed for an answer, I would say Cujo - marginally - is the weakest. Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace, who succeeds Elliot's mother in "ET - The Extra Terrestrial") is a mother whose marriage to her husband Vic (Daniel Hugh-Kelly) hangs by a thread. She is having an affair with a local worker and is now thinking of leaving her husband or not. Trapped for the marital grief is young Tad Trenton (Danny Pintauro), son of Donna and Vic and a very confused boy with a chronic phobia of the dark that often leads to severe panic attacks. Donna and Tad took the family car to a nearby mechanic's yard for repairs, but when they arrived, the car stopped working. Things get much worse when they discover that the mechanic, Joe Camber (Ed Lauter), is not there (he was savagely killed by his pet dog Cujo, a giant St. Bernard who was recently bitten and infected by a rabid bat.) , the dog catches them in the car and is trying everything to get in the vehicle to separate these two unfortunate victims. The weather is too hot; no living soul knows that they are there; the car does not start; and the dog seriously wants their blood ...... which has the potential to be a genuinely steady siege thriller, but never quite works. I read the book and it's quite disappointing - certainly for King - so it's not surprising that the movie version is so small. On the printed page, King managed to at least generate some degree of tension, but the film is critically hampered by the fact that a Saint Bernard is simply not too scary. The "visuality" of the film medium serves as a constant reminder that Cujo is a Saint Bernard. In the book, it was possible to forget that. In the book, Cujo sometimes seemed almost to assume the guise of a monster. Even with the relatively short execution time of an hour and a half, Cujo becomes a tedious and patient experience, occasionally unintentionally funny and certainly never as anxious as it would like to be. They even omitted the cruelly cruel ending of the book and replaced it with a conclusion "everything is well that ends well" so that the public can go home in a good mood !!! Chalk this down as yet another inferior adaptation of the king.
