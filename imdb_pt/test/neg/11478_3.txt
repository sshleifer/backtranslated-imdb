I saw this movie when it came to theaters for the first time in 1988, and although I knew it was not an award-winning caliber ... I kind of liked it. It tells the story of 5 former Boy Scouts gathering to take on the only task they have never had to finish as children - that is to climb Mount. Whitehead Of course the Boy Scouts are now all grown up and have developed their personalities in many ways, but not much different than they were as children. Richard Lewis is still a neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklyn Ajaye is still a Dear Abby of the group, and Tim Thomerson is still the group surfer. Of course the best-selling star is Louie Anderson, a "true believer" in everything related to the Boy Scout. He still lives in the same house with his mother, still reads the Boy Scout manual daily, is brave, reverent and clean, and is the one who brings the others together for another great adventure in Scouting. Comprising his task, however, are the Grunski brothers, two batucados bullies of the Scouts by the aforementioned. Coincidentally, they run into the old lair and decide to attack them a little, albeit without causing damage. Not so harmlessly are three convicts, who think that Pack 7 is from the FBI and are determined to eliminate them. All in all, the movie still has a bit of charm. Watch Richard Lewis trying to get comfortable in a foldable crib, for example, and you have a really funny piece for you. After a review, the entire film needed more of that kind of observational humor. It does not hold up well after all these years, but it's still a guilty pleasure.
