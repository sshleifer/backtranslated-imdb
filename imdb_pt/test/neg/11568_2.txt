Cheap, gloriously bad cheese from the 80's, the cheese decade. I watched this first without cuts and without MST3K'ed, and was very funny aloud even without the comments. <br /> <br /> The plot (as it is) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which AI robots revolted (sound familiar?) and destroyed almost everything, leaving a world in ruins with air so bad that no one can breathe. The few remaining humans act as slaves to an enigmatic being called Dark One, who seems to be part of the computer and part of being organic. The 'aerial slaves' work to produce energy for this in exchange for breathable air. From time to time, the Dark has the strongest of the aerial slaves fighting to the death, so that no one stands as leader in a revolt against the Dark. <br /> <br /> Okay, this is called serious stuff. About silly things, like the ridiculous almost futuristic outfit everyone wears, including fur clothes, loincloths, weird things, and feathered boas (mostly worn by the Dark One's squire, a girl with an unrecognizable and almost accent not understandable). Or the acting and stilted lines of wood sported by all so-called 'actors' whose dialogue is high in pretension and low sense. Or the special buckle, which includes pink socks with teeth glued to "deadly" sewage snakes, a bomb made of piano wire and a can, and terrible "mutants" with Halloween rubber masks. <br /> <A bunch of air slaves follow their leader, a mysterious wanderer who has adapted to the air outside, to go to the power plant to destroy the Dark. The guy's name is Neo, which explains where the Wachowski brothers came up with the idea for the Matrix. They meet with a group of Amazons along the way, with the obligatory fight scene in which the female is overcome (of course). Has anyone ever noticed that in every Amazon movie or TV show ever produced, these amazing warriors always get their butts kicked by men or women? Amazons are just perfect pansies, I guess. <br /> <br /> This bunch of determined warriors makes their way through Central Park ... errr ... the devastated lands beyond the last standing city (good way to save money on the faded paintings of a destroyed city of New York, anyway) and travel to the sewers that lead to Power Station, where the Dark One and his go-go Valeria bitch girl leave. Here they win beasts as fierce as the sock puppets, a giant spider that no one sees, and the goofy lobster robot who is one of the personal guardians of the Dark. <br /> <br /> The final confrontation is very sad. One of the slaves, a girl whose father was taken by the Dark because he produced a way for people to breathe in the dirty air, sees that his father was "consumed by the true form of the Dark," which involves him being eaten by a giant avocado that only his head is stretched, the three remaining adventurers destroy the Dark, turning off some switches, and the Robot Holocaust does not die with a bang, but with a groan. lines, and that's it.
