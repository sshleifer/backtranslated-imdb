This is a terrible movie, and I do not even know why it's so terrible. It is ugly, for example, with the modern visual style of the 70s, which may have seemed like a good idea at the time, but now allows you to instantly recognize a movie from that period as a product of the 1970s. The film keeps the story and the songs which made the theatrical version of the musical a hit, but the songs sound lifeless on the screen. But mostly, the film sucks because of Lucille Ball's poor performance, which you think would be able to make something of this character bigger than life if anyone could. She dreams of the movie as a terrified actress choking on her opening night, and the movie sinks with her. Even Bea Arthur, who bet he was hilarious in the role of best friend on stage, can not give life to this stinker. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> Grade: D
