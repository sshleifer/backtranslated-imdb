This movie was an embarrassment. Ulma Thurman looked like she had some sort of illness and John Travolta looked like he was walking in his sleep. I was hoping this was a follow-up to Get Shorty, not a half-baked remake of the same movie (except some of the characters have different names and outfits) <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this to film to my worst enemy. I feel like I've been robbed and Hollywood once again tricked me into seeing another horrible sequel (I also suffered from the Alien Vs. Predator). <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say about this movie is that it has my vote for the worst movie of 2005!
