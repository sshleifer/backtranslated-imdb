The actors are so insular that it's almost impossible to distinguish them (Pauline Kael said about this movie: "The actors have names, but they're really anonymous"), and the special effects are really bad. They simulate weightlessness with people hanging on cables and recycling the trick that lets Fred Astaire dance on the ceiling in "Royal Wedding" (but none of these guys moves well enough to make him sound convincing). The low point of the movie is when one of the characters, an airplane tycoon, is trying to convince some "industry giants" to join him in a moon rocket consortium, and he shows them a Woody Woodpecker cartoon that explains how a rocket works in the 2nd year! (And to think that Robert Heinlein worked on the script ...) <br /> <br /> The only advantage is that the production design manages to communicate a kind of "Amazing Stories" sensitivity, and even this is made much better in subsequent film of the producer (George Pal) "When Worlds Collide", that has similar bad performance, but is much more fun. However, Pal's best science fiction film has to be "The Time Machine."
