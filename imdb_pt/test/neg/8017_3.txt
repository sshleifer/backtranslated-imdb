Do you remember the non-dramatic wooden literary adaptations of the 1970s at their worst? You will see this largely amusing, unintentionally hilarious adaptation of the chocolate box's adaptation. The most guilty of all is Catherine Z-J, which, while undeniably easy to use, replaces the swishing of a great dress and looks sexy to turn into a performance. It touched the face of a melodrama, or Cold Comfort Farm without the jokes, that effort is not aided by a writer with a tin ear for the dialogue that totally loses the sense of irony or tragedy of the novel. A shame, given the quality of acting talent on offer - Joan Plowright, Claire Skinner, Steven Macintosh all deserve better than that.
