A group of teenagers discovers a pirate video game, but once they start playing, each of them begins to die as it does in the video game. As they become addicted to the game, they need to find a way to defeat the central villain of the game, The Blood Countess, before she kills them all. <br /> <br /> The premise sounds a bit stupid and familiar, but this movie could still have been slightly fun. However, this "horror" movie is not scary at all. In fact, it's more of a comedy than anything else. The film takes itself very seriously and the film is not much fun to watch. Of course, there is an occasional laugh, but for the most part, the movie is very annoying. PG-13 horror movies can still be good as The Ring or Cry Wolf. Ring and Stay Alive is not the same kind of horror movie. Stay Alive is yet another horror movie and since its PG-13 rated, the death scenes are very smooth. It should have been the main selling point of the film and as it had an interesting concept, the deaths could have been very good. Unfortunately, the studio wanted a bigger audience and the movie had to be changed. <br /> <br /> The acting is a complete joke and most of the cast makes horrible performances. Jon Foster is not a good leader. He lacks the charisma to actually engage the public or the public to care about him. Your character is not nasty just very bland. Samaire Armstrong really gives a good performance though a bit bland to really stand out. Frankie Muniz probably gives the best performance on Stay Alive. This is an honor at the level of being the best player in the Houston Texans. Sophia Bush is absolutely terrible like October. His performance seems so rushed and so false. The most boring character in the movie is Phineas played by Jimmi Simpson. Your character is so unpleasant that you'll be cheering for him to die. <br /> <br /> In fact, most of the characters are pretty nasty, which makes it even harder to get interested in the movie. It's hard to feel sorry for some of these boring kids and it's a lot more fun to watch if you want the characters to really survive. The only good thing about the movie is the atmosphere. It's a little old, but it still works. The movie is also very short so it's not too difficult to sit down. I really would not blame the cast because they were working with an inexperienced director and writer. The direction is not very good and the script is not much better. Stay Alive is not really the worst horror movie of 2006. That honor would go to When a Stranger Calls. Stay Alive is still a missed opportunity. In the end, it is best to leave this playful and lame horror movie on the shelf. Overall rating:
