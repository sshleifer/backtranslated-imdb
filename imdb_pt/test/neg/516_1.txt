You have to see this movie, it's a great footnote in the history of cinema. When this movie was made, the American film industry hit the suction bottom. Watch this movie, laugh and feel sorry for yourself for wasting the last 2 hours of your life. It's the worst performance I've ever seen and even worse direction. The villains laugh as if they were drawn from a circus clown and if the guys who made "Scary Movie" want to do a parody of superhero movies, they just need to get the script for that movie and make a remake, called Black Scorpion III : The threat of really bad movies that somehow manage to lure the producers into sequential suicide.
