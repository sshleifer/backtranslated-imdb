It could easily have been better. In fact, maybe so much that if the filmmaker had not tried as much as he could, it could actually have been better. <br /> <br /> On a good note. The lighting was reasonably well. But virtually everything else was missing. Unstable camera work. (Yes, yes, I know, it's supposed to be the style now.) Badly recorded audio. And editing that looked like someone watched many Ulli Lommel movies (which are some of the worst movies ever edited). To summarize, the film seemed to be a rationalization for the director / writer / main character to have some nude young people, put them into false slavery, and grope them, saying "threatening" things.
