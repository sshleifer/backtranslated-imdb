I really liked the movie 'The Emporer's New Groove', but seeing this was like coming home and seeing his wife having "intercourse" with a llama. Seriously, this movie was bad. It's like Club Dread after Super Troopers. I must write 10 lines, but I do not know what else to say. I laughed a few times, but only because I was drinking. A movie like that should be funny at least when you're drunk. Was not. Maybe the llamas are just funny and the regular cartoons are not. Anyway, just stick with The Emporer's New Groove if you want a cartoon-themed movie and llama. Line 10 is this line here.
