I rented this movie, knowing it would be bad (I just saw a good Disney sequel and that was the story of Toy 2), but it was much lower than my expectations. I'm a hard disney fan and I just do not believe in sequels with Disney movies. For someone who has not grown up with the classics (or watching them when they left, or renting them since you were born) is a cute story. I just feel that the plot was dragged a little too much and was predictable. The only thing that bothered me most was the voice of the girl's and the slut's daughters. They were very tall. Although most reviews say it is not so bad, I think if you are a true Disney fan, you should not waste your time on this one. <br /> <br /> I hope Disney is not making any sequels to any of the other classics anytime soon.
