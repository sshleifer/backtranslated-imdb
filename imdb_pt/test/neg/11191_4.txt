Some movies you watch because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow. <br /> <br /> Some of you will watch because you want to be exposed to adventure or shock out of your experience; they will not feed you directly, but they will help you place yourself in a larger world than the other way around. And after all, the difficult parts of life are in what you choose not to accept. <br /> <br /> And then there are movies that do not do any of these things, that you will observe by obligation, or because you have a need of historical context. These are worthless experiences in terms of building a life. <br /> <br /> The problem is that many times you do not know which of the three a movie will be, coming in. people you trust, but because a movie life is so personal, you really will not know until you go blind. <br /> <br /> For me, this was very useless. Yes, yes, I know that for many Bunuel is the epitome of the sublime and rich. And you must know (if you do not know) that among my greatest cinematic experiences are some very strange, really very strange films. <br /> <br /> It's not that it's not cinematic, or symbolically profound, or apolitically / politically friendly the way I think. That's how it gets there that it's off base. It is the deviation from the real detour that irritates me. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is that this is alternative art of success, which means it is a successful commercial art. Which, in turn, means that it can simply be explained and the explanation is not only broadly acceptable, but simply coded in shorthand. Certainly all of this is true. <br /> <br /> When the term "surreal" is used, it is usually misused to denote any movie or world image that differs from reality or seems strange. But when used correctly, that is, according to consensus theory, it always revolves around Bunuel, and in particular this film and what he genuinely did with Dali. So, because they invented surreal cinema, they define and control the term. This alone irritates me, and I have my own alternative definition that does not come from his philosophy. <br /> <br /> It's because philosophy is totally contrary. It is not a philosophy, but a rejection of philosophy, an anti-order. Their packaged anarchy, carefully selecting the things they use and the things they oppose without clearly differentiating them. <br /> <br /> All right: against linearity, against narrative, against history, against religion (an easy), against deliberate love. But for an illusory linear narrative, to establish their own story (celebrated by countless film school teachers, what else can they do?); by a sort of transcendent "accidental" love. <br /> <br /> It's your own enemy. If there was a Bunuel alive today as he sold his image, the first thing he would do is attack the church or the surreal. <br /> <br /> My regular readers know that in almost every movie subject, I stick with Spanish and avoid French. But in the matter of surreal, I would like to consider the opposite: take your surrealism out of Alfred Jarry, not Bunuel. <br /> <br /> Ted's rating - 2 out of 3: It has some interesting elements.
