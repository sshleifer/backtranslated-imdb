<br /> <br /> It will not be long in this movie. The first half hour was one of the most boring I've had to face since I started watching movies. The story did not advance, nothing was explained about any of the characters. It looked like a non-movie. (A lot of people had already left the audience this time). <br /> <br /> Much of the scene was totally unwarranted and unexplained. <br /> <br /> The director should have studied some film. more to know that each sequence, each scene, has to make history move forward. He never did that. <br /> <br /> The supposedly funny moments were planned, and only a few people laughed (people with a strange sense of humor, I think). <br /> <br /> Jury Prize at Cannes 2002 ..... I do not know what the jury was thinking .... probably the "politically correct effect". <br /> <br /> I would love to love you, the disappointment was therefore even greater. <br /> <br /> You have to see it to believe it. But wait for the video.
