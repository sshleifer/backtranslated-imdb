The title is a misnomer: the film portrays only one year of the so-called "divine marquis". It was a difficult time for him, because he was threatened by the guillotine: the tranquil joys of the reign of Terror. Historically speaking, the background is somewhat schematic: "De l'et is supreme," Robespierre's unsuccessful attempt to create a secular religion, his downfall, a heaven sent the opportunity of showing the sinister machine of Doctor Guillotin at work. <br /> <br /> As far as Sade is concerned, it is an absolutely mediocre subject: he is waiting in an old convent with other nobles, a golden cage if you compare him to the " or, say, Marie-Antoinette or scientist Lavoisier's fate, and he exchanges futile conversations with a young virgin about death, love, and other trivialities. There is the obligatory "bold" scene, but you have to be patient because it's a long time before it appears on screen. by today's standards, can we call it risqu√©? "De Sade," by Cy Enfield, who has one of the lowest ratings in the IMDb, is at least entertaining, and Keir Dullea was a more marquis credible than the old Auteuil. And it was characterized by John Huston.
