So it's Friday night and you want to go watch a movie ... all you want is something fun, not very artistic, or anything that might require a long night of philosophical discussions. So you pay $ 10 to watch the Mod Squad. The trailer for this movie should have tipped me off, but come on ... they're three of the most beautiful people in Hollywood - eye candy. But that's about it ... a series of Prada ads on the move. And what did the Hollywood producers forget? The plot. Why are these kids running through the streets after some unknown enemy? Where are they? But, do not worry, after a while you'll just stop caring. I was about to leave this movie because I thought sitting in my room and looking at the wall could have been more productive (and free), but by that time, it was over (90 minutes - just save grace). So, are you still willing to spend $ 10? Go, get a good hot meal.
