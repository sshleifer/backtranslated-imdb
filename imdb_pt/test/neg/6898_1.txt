BARNYARD sucked! I saw this movie last week and it's horrible. What bull has udders? My 2 year old son was asking me if all the cows have udders and trying to explain to her that this is simply not true and seeing the film just confused her more! <br /> <br /> In addition, the violent theme scared my two-year-old. They made the coyotes look ferocious and this instilled a fear of coyotes in my daughter. I know that coyotes are not ferocious and are natural predators. The mother and son who were sitting in front of us shouted, "Kill him, kill him, yes" in a specific scene in the movie, where good versus evil is said <br /> <br /> It's a King Lion rip and they should stop using big names actors for a lame movie. Steve Oederek, who has also made Thumb movies, such as Thumb Wars, Thumbelina and many others, are so bad! <br /> <br /> If a good Steve Oederek movie comes out in my life, I'll spend it naked and swallow my diarrhea and post on Youtube.com ... Enough!
