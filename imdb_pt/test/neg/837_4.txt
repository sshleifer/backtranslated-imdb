The film begins with a dandy shootout, where three bad guys are quickly slaughtered by a bounty hunter - a bounty hunter who has more than a shallow one for the unnamed man in the trilogy Clint Eastwood (DOLLAR FELLOW, FOR FEW LITTLE DOLLARS AND THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY). <br /> <br /> Immediately after, you see this man in a gold train full of Union soldiers. Of course, the shipment is attacked and all the soldiers fight like blind, soon they are neutralized. However, in a turnaround, one of the bad guys cheats the gang leader (Gilbert Roland) and runs away with the gold. Soon, Roland reaches and is about to discover where the gold is hidden. But, at that very moment, the army appears and kills the traitor ... What a bummer. However, the nameless man supposedly thinks Roland knows about the treasure, and perhaps a medallion given to Roland by the traitor holds the key. A strange banker is also thrown into the mix. All three want gold and all three look like males. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not a particularly distinctive western. Much of this is the plot, and part of it is that George Hilton (an Uruguayan, despite the American name) is not as interesting as Eastwood or some of the other stars of Spaghetti Western, but mostly because the soundtrack is simply a drug . So often the music does not even come close to matching the performance and seems almost randomly added. Also, it is not a very good thing either. This is clearly not the work of Ennio Morricone - master of music of the genre Spaghetti. <br /> <br /> In general, just a time smoker - not a particularly good one to boot.
