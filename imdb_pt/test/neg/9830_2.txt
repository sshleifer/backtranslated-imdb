If you've ever wanted to know more about taxi drivers, then this is a great movie to watch, just for informational purposes. I can now hear, "Wait, wait a second!" Why do not we follow a taxi driver all day long? Taxi drivers are funny, just like the people they know, and they just talk to each other for just a couple of minutes, then the other actors must be cheap Harry, you take care of the production, Joan, you have materials, Brian, you're going to gather some actors and we'll all meet here tomorrow to start filming! > The first 90% of the film could not have been worse had it happened. At least without planning, there is always the element of surprise to be found. Some of Jim Carrey's movies have added stuff as they go along and they always do well at the box office. The problem here is that the first 90% are well scripted, and it's too bad. Paul Dillon plays the Chicago taxi driver who works all day. We practically see what he sees. People come in and out of your car and he drives around the city. He talks to these people for a few seconds and then we get some more people. <br /> <br /> I admit, there were some funny bits here and there. A religious family tries to convince the taxi driver to go to church with them, take a pregnant woman and her husband to the hospital, sever a wealthy businessman from his girlfriend, a poor girlfriend from his boyfriend, and take a rape victim home. I think the moral of the movie is that a taxi driver is more than a taxi driver and has a bigger sphere of influence over the life of his passengers than you might originally think. For some people, it is just a way to get from here to there, but for others, their very common words help change the direction of their lives. <br /> <br /> The last passenger of the day is used to try to make sense of the rest of the movie, and to some extent is successful. There was a bit of that feeling of regret on the deathbed, where the good majority of the movie sucks, and in the end, it tries to improve everything in just one or two changes. I was not too impressed with the film as a whole, but there were some pieces that deserved to be seen again. As far as the actors are concerned, Paul Dillon is that. John Cusack, Gillian Anderson and Julianne Moore are in this for about 30 seconds each, but do not watch this for any of them or you will surely be disappointed. I'm going to give other people with some credit that is not their ordinary movie that they produced here, but it also was not very good. There simply was not enough material to keep him for an hour and a half. It was a decent effort, but it was not the same.
