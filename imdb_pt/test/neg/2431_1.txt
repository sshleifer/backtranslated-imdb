This show is not in my opinion, good, So again, I did not like any Disney Channel cartoon. Except for "The Proud Family," because this is about a normal teenager. This show is very much like what I feel about Lilo and Stich the Series. It was a mistake to turn the film into a cartoon because the movie was great, the cartoon is terrible. The Disney Channel was doing pretty well before adding all those stupid drawings like Dave The Barbarian, Brandy and Mr. Whiskers, Lilo and Stich the Series, American Dragon Jake, and where it all started: Kim Possible. The shows would have been better if they had gone to Playhouse Disney! As for this particular show, Kuzko will never leave school as Dave The Barbarian's Parents will never return home, and Brandy and Mr. Whiskers will never leave the jungle.
