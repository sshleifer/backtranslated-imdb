Yes, I know the girls are hot and the scenery is beautiful, but for someone who knows the place, it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> If you want some precision, this is not a movie to be trusted. It starts with the flight from Sao Paulo to Rio on board a 747. This will never happen in the 400 kilometers of flight. Smaller planes, such as the 737 or the A-320, carry passengers between the two cities every half hour. The trip from the airport house, if shown on a map, would reveal an intricate zigzag from side to side. Perhaps the producers tried to imitate one of the best-known itineraries of taxi drivers when confronted with tourists. Not that it was a local habit, for I myself was robbed in very serious places, like Switzerland. The girls did. All topless. This is something a stranger will never understand. The Brazilian chicks will be happy to expose 100% of their incredible bodies in the parades of the Samba Schools and to wear bikinis almost nonexistent on the beach, but never topless. A handful of beaches across the country will allow this. Everything carefully isolated and out of town. Oh, the inside decor; the incredible wallpaper ... maybe at Disneyworld ... Also, it's a lot of fun and, yes, Demi Moore is absolutely splendid.
