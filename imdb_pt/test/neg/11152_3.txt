I was hoping to get Arnold Schwarzeneger's return to action after the dark films he did after "Eraser." "End of Days", however, can be added to the somber movies he had the misfortune to appear. <br /> <br /> "End of Days" begins well with an exciting action sequence, but quickly becomes a boredom, taking focus from action and suspense and concentrating on the investigation of demonic and millennial events that is rapidly approaching (read "Last Judgment"). <br /> <br /> The performances are obsolete, special effects and abundant gore. Considering an inveterate fan of Schwarzenegger, I could not believe I did not like this movie, but with such a bad script, what could Arnie have done besides passing that turkey? <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 <br /> <br />
