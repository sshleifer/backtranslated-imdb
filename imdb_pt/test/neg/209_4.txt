Dillon, Fishbourne, Reno, should have joined together for a much smarter effort because this fits into Category B and could have been made with nameless actors and a much smaller budget since 2 armored trucks and a warehouse waste could not have gone too far. As the screenwriters failed to come up with a clever robbery plan, they targeted the drama of the situation, but there was not much to explore either. Fishbourne and Reno bring nothing to this film except the interest of the media, they are just expensive advertising. Dillon is OK, but this was a ride in the park. The choices of the main character, Ty Hackett, are very uninspiring and the final, with the "reward" is quite childish. Waste of time, money, actors and so on.
