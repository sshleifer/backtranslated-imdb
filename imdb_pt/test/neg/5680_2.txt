Nothing to ruin here, but this could be a SPOILER, so beware. <br /> <br /> Special effects were on the level of a video game - about five years ago, or perhaps the original Star Trek. The acting was just pathetic - some outgoing blonde walking through the desert while a voice in the background continued. And on and on. And on and on. This was the walk and half drone that I really managed to get through. Progress is interrupted by some struggles. The ships explode for no real reason that is episodically apparent. Again, it's not that there's a real fight you'd expect from a movie, more like a cheap video game. Boi-ing! Boi-ing! The ship explodes. Next ship. Apparently some of the ships are looking for the blonde. Here in the distant future, ships must be short-sighted and astigmatic, because many of them pass directly above the futuristic baby elegantly dressed in black, but never see it. <br /> <br /> So there are some choreographed fights that look like something made by high school kids. Again, the raw video game mentality is prominent. The combatants switch to "Fight Mode," flipping something on their wrists, and a high computerized voice echoes and flashes "Fight Mode." This should be a neat design if you're trying to get close to someone. Then you go to a large power station that looks like a current power line tower and connects to recharge. LOL, I'm not joking, you can not do these things, it's like watching a freaking video game of about 2000 only acting is best in the game. <br /> <br /> More trekking. Then she appears in "The City". (The lame soundtrack gets even weaker here). She gets into a fight with a future robot mechanic who can not hit her with her big gun, even if it runs right in front of him, about five feet in front of him. Obviously, the robots of the distant future are as useful as toaster ovens in a fight. She throws sand into his eyes and hits to death by throwing stones at her. rofl, I was about 95% tolerant by that time, my nausea circuits flashing red. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, she ends up holding a rocket with a rope. I'm not kidding, strapped right next to outside a rocket. This is supposed to be an advanced form of transportation. At that moment I gave up. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete disgrace to a movie made at the present time. Just damn doom. There was a drippy story but the movie got distracted from it - someone droning about "mother" constantly. <br /> <br /> I gave it a couple because there were some scenes that showed some beautiful works of science fiction as a backdrop. Unfortunately, the plot, the acting, the action, the cinematography and the narrative distracted from this work of art and degraded it. No joking.
