If there ever was a movie that could be considered a missed opportunity, then this movie is Galaxin. What could be wrong about basing a science fiction movie around a sexy and feminine android? Surely this film could never be a complete waste of time? Well, unfortunately this movie is very close to useless. There are a number of flaws with this production that have to be said, however, there are two basic problems that destroy the entire company. First of all, it's a comedy with no funny parts, or at least a movie in which the potentially fun aspects are presented in an incredibly fun way. Second, the title character is woefully underused. This may be because Dorothy Stratten was not really an actress, but if so, it was a terrible decision because she is still easily the best thing about the movie. I do not think she really needed to be a great actress to play the role of a sexy android to be perfectly honest. Anyway, what we have left is a lot of mind-numbing comedy of relief, which is often made up of impossible farce-type jokes from the great science fiction hits of the time, like Alien, Star Wars and 2001. It's misspelled and nothing funny, and does not even have a plot to propel things up. The story is basically about a space cruiser police who is sent to get a rock. That's it! Steven Spielberg once said that a high-concept film was one whose storyline could be described in one sentence. What he did not define was what you call a movie that can be described in less than one sentence - useless, perhaps? <br /> <br /> This seemed like a sure winner to me, but failed miserably. It seems to have been an attempt to fool Star Wars and combine it with adult comedy situations. All you really can do is leave you cold and a little annoyed at not being close to what you should have been. A Barbarella for the 80's, this is not it. Soon after the completion of the film, Dorothy Stratten was murdered in a terribly violent and horrible way. And for this reason, Galaxina has gained a considerable amount of cultural interest. I just think it's a great shame that Dorothy does not have a better movie to immortalize her.
