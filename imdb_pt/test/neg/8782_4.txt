The undisclosed source of the Lone Ranger. He shows who he was and how and why he became the Ranger. <br /> <br /> Legendary bomb. The idea was not bad - reinvent and introduce the Lone Ranger to the 80's audience. Right away though there were problems. The studio ordered that Clayton Moore (the original Ranger) stop appearing anywhere as the Lone Ranger. This led to a nasty little battle that made headlines. I know people who refused to see the movie because of how Moore was treated. Also they hired Klinton Spilsbury without talent to play the Ranger. Spilsbury was very handsome and muscular, but he had absolutely no charisma and simply could not act. In fact, his entire vocal performance was rediscovered by another actor! Also their antics (public drunkenness and beating of people) did not help. Acting sideways, the script is monotonous and slow. Also Ranger himself does not show up for an hour! There were some complaints at the time the film was too violent for a PG. However, I do not think it was that bad. <br /> <br /> There are some (very few) things done here - the picture was really beautiful; Michael Horse was excellent as Fool; Christopher Lloyd is a lot of fun as the villain and when the Lone Ranger finally shows up (with William Tell Overture growing on the soundtrack) it's really exciting. But, in spite of everything, this is a boring and terrible attempt to bring back the Lone Ranger. It's easy to see why this was bombed. A 4 - mainly for photography.
