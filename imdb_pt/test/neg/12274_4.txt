I was expecting a lot more from this movie than what I actually got. The acting was horrible for everyone and the story was far from impressive. It took me a lot of things that I did not even follow what was happening because I was so nervous. An example of the acting is when Paxton's character, Vann, is upset with the colonel from South Vietnam, so he throws some of the sand from the "sand map." It was impossible to have any idea what he was feeling and his actions were robotic. To make things worse, I have no idea how I should feel about Vann. He is obviously introduced as the protagonist, but as soon as he arrives in Vietnam, he begins an affair with a Vietnamese English teacher. The only thing the film had for it was that it was not particularly boring. I give 4 stars out of 10.
