Stupid and senseless movie should appeal to the Southerners rednecks, IQ teens bordering on the retarded, and Bush's common defender. Noble Willingham plays the lead role in this simplified roadmap for what is and uses a generous dose of MFers, eff what and what is SOBs. The end I anticipated to "save" this empty story was the biggest disappointment, leaving me hanging and asking, "Why?" <br /> <br /> It's a cat and mouse story or more like Bully Vs. victim. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time unless you enjoy listening to the phone ringing every 2 minutes, and cursing and screaming constantly throughout the 123 minutes of garbage droppings.
