This movie was very funny even though it was not meant to be! The acting was stupid and the voices too. Almost all it was was a guy walking through a corn maze for an hour and a half. They played this super natural stupidity thing that made it even dumber. It was not even a normal movie, this weird song was playing almost all the time in the movie. What is this with horror films from the maze maze? Sons of corn were really scary, I thought and thought it would be something like that, but it was actually stupid. The main character just walked around aimlessly screaming for these two little girls. And then, in the end, he likes to kill someone or something. It is worth seeing if you are with your friends because it is very funny how bad it is but if you are looking for a horror movie then do not waste your time
