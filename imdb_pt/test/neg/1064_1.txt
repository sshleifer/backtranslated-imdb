There is nothing original, human or insightful about this movie. The acting is medium, the images are amateur, the writing does not have subtlety and the scenes are very basic ... something next to a soap. <br /> <br /> In 2: 37, a suicide is used to turn the film into a thriller. We see, in part, why we want to know who dies. Each of the characters has a problem, and the movie shows how much each problem is bad for them, but only as a means of taking them to a place where you think they can kill themselves. Despite the different views offered by the camera on the major events, there is NEVER another way of seeing the events themselves. Then, in 2:37, the arsholes are arsons, the angels are angels. This is simple thing. <br /> <br /> Without this complexity, the film appears as a voyeuristic story of youth sex and violence. You can hardly know the children as much as the breasts, bodies and lame that the filmmaker passes as characterization. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you know ANYTHING about movies in the last 5 years, 2: 37 is just an immature rip of Elephant - not a meditation, not a progression. However, while the filmmaker and distributor use a friend's alleged suicide at all times to give legitimacy to the film, they never talk about Gus Van Sant or Elephant. The positive posts on IMDb, curiously, avoid any mention of it, or simply do not value originality. If you want something with heart and voice - avoid this piece of youthful exploration. I was amazed at the age of the filmmakers when I discovered after watching this movie - I guessed that a 13 year old had gotten it. The twenty-odd things I've always known are too busy trying to express something real in them to pick up the work of an old man.
