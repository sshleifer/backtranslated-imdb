Usually, I do not even bother to see garbage like that, but as RPG is a hobby for me, and that was the subject of the movie, I did. It was rubbish in so many ways that I do not know where to start. I'd rather sit in the "Plan 9 from Outer Space" marathon than watch another minute of this vomit. At least Plan 9 did not have an agenda. How the media could capitulate and irresponsibly represent the extremist agenda, since the fact is beyond me. It is a frightening time when a whole group of people can be slaughtered without any defense and no real fact is presented. I know this review was more social, but it could not be helped, as this movie begged. Imagine a pro Nazi film being reviewed strictly on the merit of the film. Will not happen. As it stands, the people who made this film are themselves facist, and perhaps should move to a communist enclave where propaganda is accepted.
