I accidentally came across this movie when I was looking for something to watch while having lunch. In fact, I turned to WE Network because it said there was the last 20 minutes of some movie about the importance of "putting" to some gymnastics team - I realized the thing was tacky. Well, I got really rough. <br /> <br /> First, I lost a good 20 to 40 minutes at the beginning of the movie. Luckily, most of it was recapitulated quickly, especially in the bedroom scene, where Crystal admits she felt responsible for her rapist's death. <br /> <br /> I love Jenny Garth and I'll see her in just about anything. She is so beautiful and I want my lipstick to look as perfect as hers ever. She looks great throughout the movie and does not age what looks like more than a decade. <br /> <br /> Overall, I felt bad for the actors while watching this movie. They all tried to sell their shares, but all were so poorly written that it was a constant struggle. Frankly, I was surprised to see Terry Farrell and Mitch Ryan (the father of Greg Dharma & Greg) in that. <br /> <br /> But the writing was not the worst part of this movie. About half an hour before the end, the mother dies, and when they show the tombstone the date of death is 1979. Having lost the beginning, I had been left with the impression of the wardrobe that this was occurring in the 80's. leisure suit or bell bottom in sight. Shame on the person who made this wardrobe for this movie! Do not get me wrong - all the clothes in this movie were beautiful, but they were completely wrong in the time frame. It almost makes me wonder if they told the wardrobe that it was a play of the period. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - good for laughing or for feeding a dose of Jennie Garth. :)
