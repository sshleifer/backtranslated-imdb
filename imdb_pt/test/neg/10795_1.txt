I've seen both the MST3K version and the uncut version. I liked it a lot. Anyway, it was not that bad of a movie. Of course it moved a little slow sometimes. I liked. <br /> <br /> As far as MST3K is concerned, they only made the films for which they got the rights. Not all the films they separated were bad movies, it was so easy to make fun of them. Take SoulTaker, for example. <br /> <br /> Characters of Joe Estevez and Robert Z'Dar, who are so inanimate and annoying that I could not help but laugh. I could not take them seriously. This really created a unique feel. <br /> <br /> Vivian Schilling did a great job with the script. A world better than 95% of the trash in theaters today. Your role was played well. Not too glaring not for the masculine, but just for the right. The camera really likes her in this movie. I would have given her that role after the script was ready. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie deserves a little more credit than it is given. Please watch the uncut version if you see the MST3K. That deserves a lot.
