I can not believe there are people out there who voted 10 for this garbage! Have any of you gained access to a computer in the insane asylum where you are undoubtedly kept, or is there a special colony where especially gross people are secretly imprisoned whom I do not know? <br /> <br /> If I were to say what I really thought about this movie, none of this would be published. To begin with, his 'star' is an untalented idiot who acts like a bad Jim Carrey impersonator who stole enough of the angel's dust to come up the nose to re-emerge the Sahara desert. His name will be a total guarantee that I will not watch a future movie with him - even if he touches a stone hidden by a crowd. <br /> <br /> As for the 'plot'. One more crime we can attribute to the Nazis is that they were so terrible that they can be considered righteous as "villains" in such crimes; mere criminals and murderers would have the public at his side in the blink of an eye. <br /> <br /> For the people who made this movie - give up making movies and, if not, confine yourself to making announcements, where your efforts will at least have the virtue of being fleeting in duration. <br /> <br /> Finally, a criticism of IMDB - Why do not you have the facility to vote 'Zero' for a movie? Or maybe not. To express my contempt for this thing, I would have to vote for double zero or something.
