I enjoyed watching Lost from the beginning and I supported some bad actors in badly written episodes because when Lost is good, it's very good! But this episode that tells of Echos's death had so many scenes drawn with persistent close-ups of bad acting that I saw myself tapping the fast-forward button. This episode stood out as by far the worst. In fact, the variation in the quality of Lost has been so inconsistent, I wonder many times how many writers they are using. <br /> <br /> I will continue to watch but hope things get better and hope that I stop secretly wishing for the sub-par actors of the series to die.
