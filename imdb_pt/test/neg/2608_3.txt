He had his moments, but overall, when I watched this drawing as a child, I was bored. The only thing that kept me watching was the fact that it was a cartoon, probably my first exposure to anime. It's also one of my favorite anime's, I remember others involving a giant ship in space that did not make sense, but it was nicer because they were in space. I also remember one of those people dressed like birds that was a bit strange, but more fun. I really do not like car races, however, no then and still does not, which is probably one of the reasons why I do not care for this show, although today I am an avid anime fan. The characters were a little silly as well, and then there were the horrible scenes where practically no action was taking place which was probably used to reduce animation costs and to accompany the show. The appliances in the cars were cool and provided some entertainment for me back then. Overall, I find this show to be quite unwatchable compared to newer animes and some from the same era, but this is just a personal opinion, I am sure many other reviewers love the show which is cool.
