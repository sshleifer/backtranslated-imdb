Yes, my resume says it all. <br /> <br /> If you have not already, try it. But not for pleasure. For studies one of the worst examples of trying to be politically correct, family oriented and "legal" at the same time. <br /> <br /> Men always think they know everything, they are stupid, and finally they lose to magnificent women. Etc .. This is especially offensive when all the characters are so terrible and stereotyped. I mean, okay, "Cody" was funny at one time or another, but unlike other "stupid characters" like Woody in Cheers or Joey in Friends, he does not get good lines. His stupidity is shaped in a "duh" way, which gets pretty annoying after a while. <br /> <br /> The morale of the family is horrible. All for the family. Mother and father are supreme dictators, who say that, between severely punishing and old-fashioned parents, they constantly say that they "love" their children and, of course, in the end, children love them back. always a "contest point" like that squeezed in the "action," where the lessons of American morality (c) (tm) are imposed on viewers, on sex (in a mature, you can not have sex before you have 18 (! !), kind of way), or drugs. Even the habits of the church are described in detail here. The whole concept is directly unhealthy, all made indifferently to make money. If there are people like Karen and Frank out there, please get them locked up and disintegrate the key. <br /> <br /> So, with themes that even revolutionize religious propaganda, I think it's fair to conclude how I did in my subject ...
