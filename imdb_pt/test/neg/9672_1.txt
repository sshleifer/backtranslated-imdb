Just when I thought nothing could be as offensive and / or annoying as a Billy Mays infomercial, I had the intellectual experience of renting that piece of junk. Peter Barnes and John Irvin are to be criminally charged for smuggling this script to the public place. Actors need to be accused as accomplices, serving no less than a lifetime away from the public eye. <br /> <br /> This production offers the warning, "For dramatic effect, we take poetic license with certain facts," or some unsuitable statement to fully prepare it for the absolute disgusting rewriting of a Bible story that it did not need of no additional drama. What they added was enough to make their I.Q. drop three points for every five minutes of viewing time. <br /> <br /> The "poetic license" taken, invents such bizarre characters, you will recognize nothing but the names of some, and, of course, the ark. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Noah and Lot are living in Sodom, so maybe Abram was vacationing in Switzerland on a ski trip. Lot's wife, played by Carol Kane, is a harpy, and when she turns to a pillar of salt, Lot breaks her finger and carries it in what appears to be an empty baby food pot. If this is "poetic," I am a kumquat. <br /> <br /> When Noah - who now began drinking wine in quantities that could help to float the ark - regrets the hard task of the construction project, he wakes up. one morning, to find that God has already given enough wood to lighten his burden. At least I think it was God. It looked like a delivery of the 84 Lumber, neatly stacked and packed. Maybe 84 Lumber is really an agent for God ????? Instead of bothering you with the cargo being loaded, I thank you for the account of the pirate attack on the ark. Incongruous, do you think? This movie is full of insults so absurd. After a countless time on the waters, Noah spies a pirate ship going straight for them. And who could be the salty captain of the sea? Well, it's a lot, of course! My only surprise was that his uncle Abram was not on board. If you're going to cut a plot, shoot it down. The piracy attempt is unsuccessful, and the braggart was pathetic, not poetic. I think it was around that mark that my nausea prevented me from punishing myself more. <br /> <br /> An ugly, nonsensical, and stupid distortion of anything remotely resembling a biblical account. On a scale of 1 to 10, this movie is a premeditated mental abuse. Stupid and insulting, you'll be more entertained reading the Yellow Pages.
