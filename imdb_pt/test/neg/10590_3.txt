This is one of the most annoying movies I have ever seen. The three main members of the cast simply did not seem to click well. The character of Giovanni Ribisi was very annoying. For some reason, he seems to enjoy repeating what he says. If he was the Rain Man, it would be all right, but he is not. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
