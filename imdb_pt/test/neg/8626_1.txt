I do not believe this movie has 6 stars in IMDb. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen that was not an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The plot is predictable. I could not care less about any of the characters. The dialogue is tacky. Several moments in the movie really made me moan loudly (including Kiefer Southerland's crazy neighbor and the incredibly stupid joke that ends the movie). Jeff Bridges's accent is silly - I can not tell from what country he should be. It has to be one of the less thrilling thrillers I've ever seen too ... after the character of Sandra Bullock disappears, absolutely nothing happens to advance the story for a good 45 minutes. I would give this movie a negative amount of stars if I could.
