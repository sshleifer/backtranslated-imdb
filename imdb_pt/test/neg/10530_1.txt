Seagal fans beware- He does not do action scenes until almost an hour into this mess. Instead, Seagal walks away from countless bouts, letting Ja Rule lose all his battles convincingly. In fact, Ja Rule could be a rising action star, but Hollywood needs to let him at least reach puberty (which should happen in a few years ...) Also, what kind of command / terrorist wears a costume no belly The girl in this atrocity looks like a surrogate singer of Christina Aguilera. Back to Seagal - When he finally loosens up, it's his stuntman (HEAVILY PADDED to look like bloated Seagal) doing a lot of work and catching the falls. I do not remember any aikido either. It's just your standard kicks and punches that you would see in any martial arts turkey direct to video. Not even "so bad is funny" as well. Simply dull ...
