It's a weird and weird movie and it does not deserve a better brand than David Lynch! The special effects are poorly done, the actors are mostly bad actors and in this film it is not about a race that is the minority of a planet and tries to fight against the dominators, but it seems to be a crazy movie that pays tribute to the type of organizations . This is certainly not the will of Frank Herbert, the author of the six-part epic! Check out David Lynch's, which is the perfect tribute to the novels!
