I have read the comments of other users and I am happy that someone has compared it to the original Kamal called Perumarzhakalam released in 2004. The original had a tight history and no gaps as described above about the Indian government did not have proper records, or even bad recordings and bloopers. <br /> <br /> The story is great and delicate and well described by others. But unfortunately, Nagesh takes credit for it, because his own story is a sad thing and is nothing more than plagiarism. <br /> <br /> I think he was affected by Bollywood's so-called "inspired" syndrome. <br /> <br /> He should at least give credit where it is due. <br /> <br /> I liked some of your older movies, but now I suspect if any of them were original after all. <br /> <br /> Here is a link in IMDb for the original masterpiece. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425350/#comment I recommend everyone to see the original, even with captions if necessary, to know what class direction and class action is.
