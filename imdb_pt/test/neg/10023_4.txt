Everything that everyone has said is true when it comes to 'The Prey'. Endless Nature Filming, Bad Performance - In addition to these elements, this is a watchable film for slasher fans who in some cases is considered a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Jackson Bostwick and Jackie Coogan play very well with each other. . There is also a three-minute banjo solo that shows Bostwick's skill behind the instrument. Not too bad if I say so myself. <br /> <br /> The last ten minutes of the 'movie' are his saving grace. The end still haunts me to this day. This can also last a little longer, since one of the early John Carl Bucheler does the special effects. Some may know you from movies like 'Troll' and 'Friday the 13th part 7 - He directed both films). All in all, this is not a movie where everyone will find something redeeming. In fact, on a Hollywood level, you can rank yourself up there with one of the company's most amateurish endeavors, but for that (albeit very loyal) handful of horror movie fans in the world, even the bad action and Atrocious images of nature can be forgiven.
