The laughter is few and far between this boring movie, and I can not help but think about how this mess was made in the first place. About the only good thing in this movie is the talent of Griffin Dunne, but his best efforts were easily overshadowed by the obnoxious performance of Madonna. I was able to go through this without getting too bored, but that's probably the best thing I can say about this time-waster.
