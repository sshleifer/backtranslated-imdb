"Love Life" explores a culturally relevant setting of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a gay man. I found the subject attractive, even though the conflict was somewhat forced and easily resolved. For example, Thomas falls in love with Joe with speed and convenience through the plot. There are many mistakes in continuity: another reviewer commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses ... what struck me the most was the fact that Joe's facial setup seemed to change from scene to scene. In the end, I found myself more excited about this movie than moved. Stephan D. Gill has a very beautiful body and shows everything sometimes with skill and exuberance of pornstar, and often acting to match. Often, the movie looks like it will be full porn. Stephanie Kirchen does a good job but her enlightenment moment at the end was spotted a little by me as I was in the mood for a good joke in the shower by the end of this movie.
