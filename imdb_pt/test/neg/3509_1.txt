I saw this "movie" partly because of the large number of good reviews on Netflix, and from that I took a valuable lesson. It's not a lesson in ethnic diversity though ... the lesson I learned is "Do not rely on assessments." <br /> <br /> Yes, racism sucks and people are complicated, but the people who really need to see this movie will be those who are less attracted to it and less affected by it if they see it. The only reason I can think of for the number of good reviews is that it is being reviewed by people who are not accustomed to thinking, or who have seen their first movie thought-provoking and somehow think that Haggis invented the concept. In fact, he basically made this film, which should be called "Racism For Dummies," as emotionally as possible, seemingly to give people who do not spend much time thinking about the impression that they have discovered some fundamental truth that is never covered in a movie before. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is not ... A special for the thoughtless masses after high school, cut into pieces of fist joint to facilitate swallowing without much introspection. <br /> <br /> It's as if they portray everyone as the worst possible, just to make us happy to be such good people because we do not identify with the characters. Let's face it. NOBODY identifies with these characters because they are all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictable inverted stereotypes). He is well executed (even if the dialogue is atrocious) and cleverly executed, so much so that you do not think to ask "where is the flesh?" until you can say the movie is running out. The scene of the burning car was well executed, like most of the movie, but it did not get anywhere in the end. <br /> <br /> The messages are very heavy and behind the scenes behind the producers were clearly watching a different film because there is very little to laugh about in this movie, even during the movie. desired funny pieces. I have to point out that this is not entertainment, more like a high school diversity lesson ... call it "Blood on the Road" of racism. They could even show it in schools if it were not for Jennifer Esposito's "side-nude" picture. <br /> <br /> In this movie, everyone is an idiot and everyone learns a lesson (except Michael Pena who has the best role, but the most predictable plot). <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie with bad writing and good actors ... an ugly drawing by Paul Haggis for people who can 'deal with nothing but the striking features of the narrative ... an image painted with crayons. <br /> The accident is not anything depressing, it provokes emotion, but it does not teach you anything if you already know that racism and prejudice are bad things.
