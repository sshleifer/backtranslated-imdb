Edith Wharton's John Madden's rendition of Ethan Frome does not do justice to a great literary work. While the story is kept, the elements that give the novel its soul are stuck and lost in the movie. Madden can not convey the innocence and, in general, the tragedy of the relationship of Ethan and Mattie, transforming it into a tale of morality. The mark is lost and the point lost in added detail and unsatisfactory dialogue. Zeena (Zenobia) in the book is almost completely the antagonist, the least sympathetic figure in the books, in which in the film she may be almost sorry, although it is somewhat exaggerated that you feel bad for this sick woman being betrayed. The book more accurately describes Zeena's tyrannical control of the house and Ethan. The movie just irritated me. The addition of the fox was useless, as was the scene with Mattie trying to kill herself. It was just misinterpreted and done. Elusiveness Ethan in the church dance scene, interactions with Denis Eady, love scene addition, fox scene, shop scene, saying his plans allowed, lack of displays of inner emotions and thoughts of Ethan, introduction of the priest instead of nameless engineer Let's be clear that Zeena knows about the growing relationship in which, in the new reader, you never know what Zeena is thinking or aware of. Only a lot of flaws and bad management decisions.
