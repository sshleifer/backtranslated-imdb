Wow ... where do I start. I rented this movie because it looked like something I would be interested in watching. With a name like Val Kilmer starring in this movie, I thought how bad could it be? This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen with such a big name attached to it. I was wondering why he slipped through the cracks and I never remember hearing anything about it when he first came out. It starts very well, and is somewhat reminiscent of the intro sequence in the bourne identity, but after the initial 30 minutes or so it goes from bad to worse and then ventures into WTF land. If you have not seen this yet, do yourself a favor and do not rent / buy it unless you are a masochist or looking for all the Val Kilmer movies out there. There are many more titles out there that most deserve your time. This movie (if you can call it that) is a real waste of time. I want my 82 minutes back.
