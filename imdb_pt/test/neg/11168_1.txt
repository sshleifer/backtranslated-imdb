Stay away from this movie. The fact that you're reading reviews tells me that you may already have been contaminated by the horror you carry. This is a truly horrible movie ... so let's get down to business. Writing and Directing: It would not surprise me if these were handled by a group of overage school students who watched "yell" and "I know what you did last summer" a few times too. GAPING GAPING batch holes abound; while I can not congratulate them for this movie, it's nice to know that they are finally trained in the bathroom. Actors (or lack of them): Only the best for this movie ... the best extras ever to spruce up a screen, now starring in their debut on paper! As a warning, I have to note that I can watch and enjoy practically anything. I recognize a good movie when I see it, but I can still laugh and smile during Bubble Boy (yes, it's true); So when I say to avoid something, you know I'm not joking.
