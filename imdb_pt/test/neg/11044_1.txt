This movie was one of the longest movie experiences of my life. While I like how the director, Chan-wook Park, dealt with revenge, the movement as a whole was TERRIBLE. Oldboy is billed only 1 hour and 55 minutes, but it seems it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story. I will say that the dubbing in English was done very well and the film was easily understood. I felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and much of the dialogue was repeated. Also, if you have aversion to annoying voices, avoid listening to Hye-jeong Kang (she plays Mi-do). If you are looking for a movie to kill time and make you feel morally superior to others, then keep an eye out. If you do not want to watch a movie full of incest, bad dialogues, unnecessary fighting scenes, gross torture scenes and confusing flashbacks, then this is not the movie for you.
