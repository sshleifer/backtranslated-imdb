PLAN MASTER: Have the winning team in a deadly tournament. One of several martial arts action images that tried to capture the taste of the famous "Enter the Dragon" of 1973, this is an effort from South Africa. The villain's fortress is a bit different, appearing as a white fortress similar to a castle in the middle of the desert in the distance. The villain himself, a baron or general, is a somewhat more perverse version of the "Dr. No" or Han mold of villainy, having strange flashbacks to the glory days of Nazi Germany. He wears the complete Nazi uniform of regalia at some points. His main ambition in life is to hold an illegal martial arts competition / tournament against his Japanese rival, an extension of his complicity in World War II (my army is better than his army). It sounds silly and it is, although the hint of madness and maddened machismo almost works. Central hero Steve Chase (Ryan) resembles a white Bruce Lee character with an equally slim and agile physique, though obviously not in the same level of martial arts experience. I thought he would be some undercover government agent here, but apparently not. He and his girlfriend joined the Baron's team of fighters, but decided to give up (what did they think they were getting into?). Of course it's not that easy. There is a strange sequence of them escaping through the desert using a wrecked car with a manipulated candle - those desert winds can do wonders for travel, it seems. <br /> <br /> The half-winding plot twists in the second half as the hero joins the villain's competing team and the girlfriend is held hostage by the villain in a cell under threat of rape by the hero's rival. The most interesting character turns out to be Chico, a dwarf who is the villain's assistant; he is loyal to the Baron, but is sympathetic to the hero's suffering. Much of the fight uses the ballet capabilities of the hero, with a lot of leap and slow movement. The FX sound is also amplified and exaggerated in an attempt to add more impact to the punches. There are some good fights during the tournament towards the climax, but none really stands out. If I have to choose, I suppose the best involves the Baron's man of raw muscle, introduced at the end of the story (he lifts the back of a car at one point). You wonder how the hero will get him out in the end, since the brute seems to get rid of most of the blows. The performance is very mediocre, going down to the camp to the girlfriend, who tends to laugh for no reason, as if she were on the grass, although she is very cute. Some of the training scenes are also extravagant, especially all those guys running or rolling through the desert sands. And with that title, there are surprisingly few real murders. Ryan, like Steve Chase, returned as a traditional agent following "Kill and Kill Again."
