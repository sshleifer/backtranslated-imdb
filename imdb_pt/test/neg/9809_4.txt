A very distorted horror film, which has some good times here and there, with scary scenes of blood transfusion, however it's very annoying for its own good. All the characters are fine, and the story, though it has a lot of potential, is rather monotonous, but the scenes of blood transfusion seemed frighteningly real and as a result were extremely disturbing. It's well done and decently written, and it started very interesting, but I just could not keep up with the pace, but I found the ending disappointing. Linnea Quigley does not have a very small role to play in that, so I was disappointed in that, too, and Stephen Knight did a good job as a leader, since he was very fuzzy, and I got it on a DVD called Horror called A Taste. Of Evil, along with a lot of other horror movies. There is a lot of blood, however, it is not that bloody, and because of its low budget was very well done, however, as I said, just could not sustain the interest. This is a very fuzzy horror movie that has some good times here and there with some scary blood transfusion scenes, however, it's very annoying for your own good, I would pass, but I think it's worth watching if you have nothing better to do. The direction is OK. Elly Kenner & Norman Thaddeus Vane do an OK job here with decent camera work, and doing a good job on their low budget, however the pace is very inconsistent to my liking. The acting is really good. Stephen Knight is great as the lead, he was scary, twisted, sick, and gave a very scary performance, the scariest thing about it though, was that he looked like a normal person. Linnea Quigley did well in her small role. Christopher McDonald is fine, I think his sin is little. The rest of the cast is also fine. Overall, I would pass, but I think it's worth watching if you do not have anything absolutely better to do. * 1/2 of 5
