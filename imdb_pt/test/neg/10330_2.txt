Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress ..... But this movie was so horrible that I could not help laughing throughout the movie, in disbelief that I was actually watching something so bad. Ha ha The audio editing is horrible, they try very hard to create creative camera angles. Because they're just strangers and idiots. The script sucks. Act was horrible, plot is not very good. Very unrealistic, even for a movie. But it's a 20 year old movie ..... so I'll give you a bonus point for that. And yes, the music was terrible. But we all started to start somewhere. And sending these things is a nuisance ..... minimum of 10 lines ... annoying. Well, now I know why I could not find this movie in the movie store .... I had to buy it offline to see it ... good thing it was only $ 0.58 cents .... although shipping was $ 2.59. Ah well ... I do not recommend anyone wasting time and money watching this movie ...
