Ewe, The opening screams zero budget. The titles whooshing in resemblance to my grandson was released with iMovie. The DVD box gives the impression that you'll be treated to the old days of the 80's boobies movies. NO! Hardly any nudity in a movie that stars Traci Lords! This movie really needed nudity as well. Instead, you have a lot of Lords perks pointing through a shirt, however, they appear to be activated by the hot steam. This is strange, in my world the headlights light up COLD. <br /> <br /> The plot is pathetic, the blind guy is just a joke, and it's not funny. Your antics are so forced and predictable. He stumbles on things and you see him preparing for the fall. He needs to work on his physical comedy. <br /> <br /> Most of Frostbite's nudity comes from a hot tub scene that seems to have been taken months later and inserted to get a dispenser. And nudity is not worth it. <br /> <br /> NamoiBucks; It's only a matter of time before Starbucks processes it. Not even funny. When Billy arrives in town for the first time, they come across Namoi Bucks, he comments "Wow, they have it everywhere." This leads you to believe it's a parody at Starbucks, but surprise, behind the counter of that location is Namoi herself. Apparently, she loves coffee so much that the owner of this huge network decided to work in a small cold town. <br /> <br /> The only thing this film has to do is Warren Miller's snowboarding shoot. Yes, all of this is Warren's stuff, so if you want to see a great action, get a Warren Miller movie. Leave the Frostbite alone. <br /> <br /> There's nothing good about this movie. There is no reason to rent it or buy it, and if a friend offers to lend you a copy for free. Hit him and end the friendship.
