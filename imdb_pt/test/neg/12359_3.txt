So I caught an afternoon like "What Lies Above" and actually watched because the beginning was a bit promising. The heroine, Diana Pennington, is an expert on mountaineering ... but that does not help her when her fianc√©, Brian, hurts himself on an escalation. When she goes out to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again. <br /> <br /> Two years later, Diana is still a climber ... but she does not come close to Snowman. Pass. That is until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of his lost fiance with a new satellite program. She agrees and they take off on the mountain with Curt's two assistants: his "bodyguard" Hugo and the computer Tyler. From the beginning, you know there is some hidden reason going on, but unfortunately the twists are not good and lead to a ridiculously bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural subtons that never materialize. The object of the sky that fell in the mountains (which turns out not to be so supernatural), the story of how the Snowman Step came to be, and most memorable of all: the sequence of Diana's dreams in the middle of the film. But what disappointed me most was when they dropped the ball. Most of the film revolves around the quest for Brian, and that's why I can not, for my life, begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never resolved throughout the film. This was the big plot. That's how the movie started! How can you not wrap it up? <br /> <br /> I would not tell a lot of people to worry about this ...
