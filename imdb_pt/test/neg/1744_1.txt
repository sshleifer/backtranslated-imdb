I recently waited 8? going and seeing this movie in the movies. It was a waste of time and the only feeling of getting out of the theater is a little sick of all the nasty social porn. <br /> <br /> It could have been interesting if it had an absurd twist, but it was not, it was just horrible, maybe with one or two scenes that could have been taken and made for very short short films. Another thing I thought of was the way the director uses all of Finish's stereotypes as characters. It's extraordinary how you, as a Finnish director, can make a movie with the worst stereotypes of your own nationality. It was sad to sit and listen to the audience sitting and laughing at things they thought were typical of Finish, but usually they were just mocking people.
