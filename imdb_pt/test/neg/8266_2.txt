Definition of a documentary: a work, such as a film or a television program, presenting political, social, or historical matters in a factual and informative way, often consisting of news or real interviews accompanied by narration. The key word here is informative. I love They Might Be Giants, and I barely learned a thing about them. <br /> <br /> The interviews with all the celebrities were practically useless. I do not care what Sarah Vowel thinks of anyone and Syd Straw was downright annoying. And are you listening to people recite TMBG's lyrics as if they were funny / interesting? It was not even. I think that was the problem: the film spends some time discussing TMBG's love for coffee. And?? Millions of people love coffee. Was the presentation of the material fun? Not! There were indications that both men were married, but it was never discussed. And what soil material did they do? What motivated them to do this? This type of question is neither addressed nor answered. <br /> <br /> I could go on with the negatives. I found the Dial-a-Song segment very interesting. If you want to know more about They Might Be Giants, just buy some CDs and listen. Seriously. This movie is a gigantic disappointment. I can not believe that so many people gave it a 10. Amazing.
