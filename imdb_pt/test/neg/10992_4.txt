You know, this is one of those "Emperor's New Clothes" movies. It's like, so off the wall and strange that you're supposed to like it, if you're really into film. Well, I think it's a bunch of bologna. Movies like this, that hide under the mantle of Dada or surrealism, drive me crazy. Someone has this nightmare, perhaps caused by eating the mortadella before going to bed, remembers for the most part (unfortunately) and then puts it in the movies and we should all marvel at their creative genius. I have bizarre dreams too, sometimes, that make absolutely no sense, but I do not feel the need to put them in the film, expose everyone to them and call it art. Strangeness does not mean, in itself, that something is interesting. True Dada or Surrealist expression has some intellectual intent and thought behind it. If other people do not understand this, it does not make it deep, it just makes it incomprehensible. Bizarreness because bizarreness, for me, is not good, much less great, art. And comparing "Tuvalu" to "Delicatesen" is like comparing "The Godfather I & II" with "The Godfather III" - same genre, NOT in the same championship.
