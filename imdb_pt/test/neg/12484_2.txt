Yes, what did I expect? I thought this would be a movie about young adults at their turning point in life, something like "Sonnenallee" or "American Pie", which I really enjoyed. I wanted to see a funny movie, perhaps with a wry look on the idyllic Wuerzburg. And what did I get? <br /> <br /> Attention, spoilers ahead! <br /> <br /> This film begins with a long dialogue that gives you a good clue to what will inevitably follow: longer dialogues. Sometimes I thought that Moritz Bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and tried to hide it by improvising and just repeating what he was saying before. But as I think of Bleibtreu as one of the best German actors, I believe that this effect was really planned. I think the author wanted to show how annoying it can be to talk to close friends - especially when they're stoned. But in fact, I do not need movies to get bored with the chatter of friends. Boring dialogues make up the bulk of this movie. <br /> <br /> But okay, that's one thing. I can handle it, I've seen good movies with abominable dialogues, just think about the work of Schwarzenegger's life. But the next thing is that the characters are cheap and flat and that the plot is as predictable as anything else. Just one example (SPOILER !!): Why, you think, does someone take a garden hose to their hemp plants in the middle of the forest? To water them? Of course not, normally you do not find water pipes in the depths of the forest, do you? The only reason this water hose is there is that a hunter who happens to appear while the two protagonists are picking up their drug can be drugged, mistreated and finally filled with three bottles of Jaegermeister. I really hated this scene, because it's really violent. Normally, I do not care about the violence in the movies - the comedies are full of it. But in this type of comedy there is a silent agreement between you and the movie that people do not get hurt if they fall on their faces or are beaten with chairs or things like that. But if this happens in a movie that is realistic enough, the slapstick scenes also seem real. In this particular scene in "Lammbock" I really thought that this hunter must be seriously injured, if not killed - the final scene really invoked in me the impression that he is left to die there, totally filled with more drink than anyone could to endure. And the protagonists simply move away. It would be different if the author consistently followed a style; the scene could have been quite funny. Talk about being consistently - was what I missed the most in this movie. The whole movie seems to be a list of little episodes that came to the mind of the author. Things just happen for no apparent reason - yes, I know, it's life, but this is not cinema, because the cinema is to tell a story, not to show boring episodes without any meaning. I found myself asking "Where's the point?" all the time. Characters other than the top two are not elaborate, you never know why the protagonist's sister wants to sleep with her best friend Kai, in fact, she tells you, but I could not buy it at all. I think she was just there to give Kai a chance to make that sketch of the AIDS children's test, which you've certainly seen a thousand times before, and especially better. The protagonist's girlfriend you meet once, then she leaves Germany (which you do not even see and the guy does not seem to mind) and finally is mentioned in a phrase that she met someone else in America and splits with the protagonist. It seemed to me that the author wanted to tie up some loose ends. He really does not, you never really know what's so bad about studying right, being a daddy's son (dad fixes everything in the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night, which in my opinion made him one of the coolest characters in the whole film) and living in beautiful Wuerzburg. Even dinner with Daddy's friend, who might be meant to show how awful it was to have to live up to his father's expectations, seemed flat, just another nice dinner with family friends (except for the trip the guy does later, but I think showing that eating marijuana before dinner with parents is not healthy was not the purpose of this scene, if there was any). I've had far worse dinners in my life than this one and I've even finished my exams. I could not understand a single character throughout the film, they seemed flat and implausible. <br /> <br /> All this made a not so good movie, but not one that I would not watch again television. It really had some good scenes (most of them were not new, like the one with the nice and understanding cops), some were really funny, some dialogues were good and I like Bleibtreu's piece, although he repeated his well-known stereotypes again this time. It's not good, it's not disgusting, that's what I thought after the movie was over. <br /> <br /> But then came this scene of incest and this I really found repulsive. Incest is simply not funny. I do not even know if this was meant to be funny, some people in the audience laughed, so it could have been done that way. This scene spoiled the whole movie for me, I could no longer feel sympathy for the protagonist - I can not feel sympathy for anyone who fucks a defenseless person, for me, this is rape and rape is not funny. So it may have been a hint of drama, but incest is never mentioned again (though we thought this might have been one of the reasons why the protagonist left Germany at the end, but as never mentioned again, I do not know.) , is totally unnecessary. I almost expected her sister to get pregnant at the end, which would just have added the finishing touch to this tasteless story, but not even that final clich√© is fulfilled, just as nothing is really solved or thought through to the end in this film. It's not really funny, it's not really a drama, it's not at all a road movie a la Tarantino despite desperate attempts at violence, it's definitely not pleasant. <br /> <br /> Skip this movie. Watch "Final Fantasy" which is also bad, but at least with beautiful photos and not that in bad taste.
