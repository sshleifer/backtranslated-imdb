What a production, what waste of screen time and money. Here is what some European producers think so, of a science fiction film. Bring former model Alexandra Kamp to team up with a US C-class actor and hire one of the biggest film producers, Harry A. Towers. Torres then finds some obscure prods based in Munich. home, Tandem communication, Rola Bauer, and then mix everything up with no script and you'll get "Sumuru" - an invaluable jewel among the worst movies ever made! Get a live people and do something else, what you do, no movies please !! To complete, the producers went to South Africa to film, what you see on screen is a gigantic sand pit, where "action" happens, between extremely bad and extremely bad actors that any movie student would do better.
