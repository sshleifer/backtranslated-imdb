Every time I pass this show on TV, I absolutely and sincerely want to rip my eyes out and rip my ears out. It's so incredibly horrible. The jokes are not funny, the acting is completely terrible, and the whole show is a big disappointment. I hate Charlotte Arnold's innards, and I just want to punch her in the face or stab her with a knife every time I hear her talk. She's a no-talent, low IQ, a big waste on society, and I think she'd be doing the world a favor if she just shut the f * ck and walk away for a long time. Please, I say this with all my heart, DO NOT ANSWER AN EPISODE OF THIS SHOW !!!!!! Not worth 30 minutes of your life, and there are thousands of better things to do, including killing yourself, than watching this show for half an hour.
