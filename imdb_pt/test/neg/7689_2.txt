I'm a big fan of MD. But I call it the way I see it. This movie stuck together. The plot was absurd. Getting access to heads of state in this movie is easier than having access to the local grocery store. Let's go! Tom Loc has the thrill of a wooden plank. Let yourself go! Editing is unstable. The actors, and I use the term loosely, sound as if they are reading their lines about valium. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been better. Dudikoff has potential, but he chooses scripts that just shout "Stinker." <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good Dudikoff movie, I suggest Crash Dive or Avenging Force. If you've never seen one of your movies, this is not the only one to introduce you to your work. You will come out with a bad taste in your mouth and think that all your projects are so bad.
