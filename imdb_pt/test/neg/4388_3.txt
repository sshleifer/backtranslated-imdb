See all the positive comments from users of this movie and then check how often each one will post user comments. They post once. It seems that companies are probably paying for services that post pro-movie reviews about IMDb. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible. The plot was stupid. The acting was bad. The jokes were not even funny. The film included lesser nudity than they appeared to be pornographic actresses, but none of the other characters. It was clear from the first 15 minutes that the movie was not funny. There was some slapstick here and there, but most of the humor was to be derived from the characters talking on each other's backs and spreading rumors. This is not even done well. Every joke is obvious and you see it coming. <br /> <br /> The film is worthy to advance or, better yet, not watch. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to watch this movie and if I could charge studio and distributor for 1.5 hours they stole from me I would.
