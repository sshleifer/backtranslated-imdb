I've never seen Killjoy's first movie, and I've also never heard a good thing about it. So I see Killjoy 2 at the local Blockbusters, I picked it up and looked back. Starring Trent Haaga and Debbie Rochon, he is proud. Now being the big fan of Troma I'm there, there's no way I do not rent this movie, how can it be bad with these two init? Oh how wrong I was. Even Trent and Debbie can not save this excuse for a movie from being as bad as it really is. Trent frankly stinks like Killjoy, though this is probably more the writers' fault, giving him some of the worst one-liners in movie history. Debbie puts solid performance, but it is not enough. The killings are terrible, as are the bloody effects. For example, check out when the guy is supposed to be impaled on something or other. And, most of all, the ending is just one of the worst I've ever seen in movie history. The movie does not even work so badly that it's good level. Avoid like applause. <br /> <br /> 2/10
