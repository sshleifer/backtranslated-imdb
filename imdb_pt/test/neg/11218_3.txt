In fact, there are some good reasons why a person should take the risk of getting totally insane by watching this program. Breasts are good, although some of them are not true, but usually come in pairs, which is fine. Watching the beach on the screen is also a very relaxing experience as it is an ideal place to relax and not worry too much about being eaten by a shark. It is always good to remember that David Hasselhoff is a god. Not God, but a God. It's not so much about your acting skills as there are none, but your chest does a lot of talking. Also, there is no KITT coming out in this series, which is nice, since Mr. Hasselhoff said in an interview, that he always thought KITT was gay. Of course, this may make him look like an idiot, but considering the other statements he's made lately, it should not come as a surprise to anyone. <br /> <br /> In short, this is the kind of show that is totally harmless to people. It gives a lot to stare at and laugh at, which many intentionally humorous shows do not really give us. I have to say, it's no wonder that Borat fell in love with Pamela Anderson. I like to watch the show. No, it's not a great show, it's actually awful, but I like watching it. It's basically like a B-movie stretched to last for a decade.
