Few people remember "The Carey Treatment," and I can not say I blame them. <br /> <br /> Blake Edwards did this during his lean years (ie - between the "Pink Panther" movies) and for a while. story of a doctor who turned detective (Coburn) working to solve a murder at his hospital, is actually quite forgettable. <br /> <br /> Coburn is trusted as always and O'Neill is as handsome as ever, but there seems to be something missing in the process. The twists and turns of the story are not very engaging and even the climax, which should be stressful, is on the contrary distressing. <br /> <br /> A missed opportunity altogether and an unfortunate one since it was based on a book by Michael Crichton. Oh, well, at least Crichton did not write a sequel to that. <br /> <br /> A star. "Carey," Coburn.
