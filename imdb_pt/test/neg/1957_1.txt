This is the worst movie I've ever seen, none of them. From the fragile, dimly lit scenes to the laughable acting to the infantile plot and the poor action sequences, this movie is so bad, it's hilarious. For about ten minutes. After which you will be reaching for the remote control or the power socket to terminate this movie without experience. Although obviously it was done with all the production and collective language of the acting team (please God), I found Jack Frost 2 so terrible that it was unusable for over a quarter of an hour. If you have not had enough after that time, you should be indulging in drug abuse.
