Overall, this is a very bad movie. But for $ 5 at PathMark, it was not a total waste. <br /> <br /> The whole scene has to do with a guy who is with this lady infected with snakes, supposed to be a magic curse. Actors are not names that are big (even though some look like TV shows), so I will not do my usual Troy McClure. <br /> <br /> For a while, the film holds its interest as the couple get on a train and travel to Los Angeles to see a shaman undo the curse. There is a bit of other plots going on as well; like two ladies smuggling drugs. <br /> <br /> But the last 20 minutes turn out to be a total disappointment. As violent and bloody as the whole movie is, the grand finale is just totally computer-animated. <br /> <br /> I saw the unrated version that had tons of language, blood, blood, violence, everything! The bonuses were OK. <br /> <br /> General Degree: D-
