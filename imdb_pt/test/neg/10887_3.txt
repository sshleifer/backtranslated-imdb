SPOILER Wolfcreek meets the Saw Massacre ... if you've seen it, do not waste your time on this one. Typical slasher movie, nothing new here, except for SPOILER "visions" that just add fluff to an already weak plot. I would recommend this movie if you have absolutely nothing to watch and is watching this movie or looking at a bare wall for 1.5 hours. The only semi-interesting part SPOILER is when the girl starts drinking in the empty sheriff's office, I say it's interesting because at least she made good use of that liquor instead of stereotypically using it to start a fire to kill the villain, though she went that way to the end. All in all, lame, bad and worth the effort.
