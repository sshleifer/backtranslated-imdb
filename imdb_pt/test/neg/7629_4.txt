This derivative erotic thriller remains watchable most of the way, mainly because the viewer is casually curious about how it will turn out, and because the director, Peter Hall, manages to stage a very hot (and quite bold) sex scene. But the ending, though unexpected, is absurd, and the whole plot (complete with childhood traumas and multiple personality disorders) proves to be unbearably clich√©d, especially with regard to motivation.
