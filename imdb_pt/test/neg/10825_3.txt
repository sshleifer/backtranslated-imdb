The scariest thing about this horror movie is that the ending alludes to a sequel. 'The Cave' is really a disappointing action movie. A team of cave and submarine researchers goes to Romania (one of those cheap places to make a movie, at least for now) and after a destroyed church enters a cave that reveals a kingdom of underground monsters. Or are they daemons? The movie never decides whether it wants to be action, science fiction or horror, is a mixture of all without salt or fun, and acted in a wooden way. The best thing about the movie is cinematography, but even the dark cave landscape becomes boring soon because the movie has no rhythm and the characters just are not interesting. Waste of time.
