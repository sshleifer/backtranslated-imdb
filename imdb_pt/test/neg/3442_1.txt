Tim Taylor is an abusive acholoic drug addict. He is a coward and a child and has absolutely no redeeming quality as an actor or person. The only movie with him that is enjoyable is "Galaxy Quest" and that's just because his character - a drunk actor from an old TV show - was so close to real life for him. The rest of the cast is equally bad. I hate the mother and the actress who played Patricia Richardson, she sucks! Always clichéd is there, the stupid woman who is fat and fond of opera and only cares about her children, while in real life she proclaims the values ​​of the family and divorces after having twins. And the children's actors were as interesting as a root canal.
