This film seems well done, and more efforts must be made to promote films by women. In addition, this film is also deeply disturbing, as it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a deeply disturbed character. If you have seen some promotional material, you may find this to be a moving film about a relationship that has come to an end, but none of that suggests how disturbing the central premise is: a woman threatens suicide unless she is soon able to revive here the most precious memories of your relationship. When it was said just how unfair (to say the least) that such a threat is, Tessa (the supposed protagonist) suggests that "life is not fair". <br /> <br /> Huh ??? This character also uses tears to manipulate her ex-lover to stay, and persuade him into sexually oriented behavior (which she initially denies as a motive) all the time, assuring him "this is not sex." <br /> <br /> Reverse the genres, have the protagonists played by Tracey Gold and Brian Austin-Green and this could air on Lifetime with a title like "Hostage to Obsession". There is no medically accepted definition of mental and emotional stability that encompasses Tessa's behavior in this film. Props for Kristen Thomson for playing an ex manipulative, psychotic and manipulative, perhaps very well. because there is not a well adjusted person, man or woman, who can observe this and not have chills in the spine.
