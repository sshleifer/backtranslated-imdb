I find Herzog's documentary work very uneven. Fata Morgana, a companion piece to Lessons of Darkness, has not only the harrowing spectacle, but mainly the insightful gaze of an author. It is by comparison an amateurish appearance, aimless pans, left and right across the desert, the kind you would expect from any German tourist equipped with a camera, the camera left running out of a car window picking up all kinds of meaningless images. fences, abandoned buildings and dirt stains that cross the lenses in random order interspersed with shots of sand dunes. At one point, Herzog finds a group of hungry cattle rotting in the sand, but the image is presented as if you and I, perhaps worse, the camera looking from one animal to another. For a documentary that tries to be a visual feast, a hypnotic and surreal excursion into unexplored landscapes, it lacks the visual orchestration and conviction of a disciplined author. It is everywhere, myopic and tedious, myths of the Maya creation recited aloud, then some other text that Herzog liked literature. It's not until the end that Fata Morgana jumps alive through a series of bizarre encounters. First with a man and a woman playing music in a room, the man singing in a distorted voice through a microphone, both apathetic in their task. A man holding a turtle. A group of older people trying to get out of some holes in the floor. Other than that, this seems to have very little substance to offer or visual splendor to offer.
