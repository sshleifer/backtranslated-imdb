Do not get me wrong, I love Stephen King! And this is a very good movie. The rabid Cujo is very scary and the movie is suspenseful. But after the first few minutes that poor Donna and her little Tad were held captive in their Pinto by the furious St. Bernard, I began to wonder why she did not do something to help herself. <br /> <br /> She could have put her foot out the door and pushed the car back (I mean, it was a Pinto for Pete's love and they were on a slope) and rolled safely, but then it would have been a very short movie. When she started the car, did she put it in reverse and hoped she could at least get down the driveway? No, she tries to make a three-point curve on a car with a bad alternator. She managed to get out of the car and look around for 45 seconds or so at one point to try to get to a baseball bat that was lying on the floor nearby - what a waste of time! I mean, if you go running to the club, do it and at least you'll have something to hit the dog. But forget about the bat. There were no tools in the car, like an iron tire or something? I did not see her looking at the spare tire of the car. Really, why wait until you are bitten and weak by dehydration and your child is having seizures before you make a stand against the animal? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie she was beaten and ripped, but by God she was still high heels!
