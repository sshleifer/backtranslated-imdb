Let me start by stating that I lived in Louisville, Kentucky all my life. I grew up about Â½ mile from Waverly. In winter, we would pull our sleds down the Maryman Road and cross the Dixie Highway for a sleigh ride on Waverly Hill. Often, during the winter of 76 to 77, we would climb into the tunnel to warm us up. The site was still being administered as a "Geriatric Center" at the time. We would go all the way through the tunnel up the hill to hit what we thought was the "Door to the Morgue". I have to be honest. The only feeling we felt was that we were moving away from something we should not be doing. I would have to say that we went up that tunnel more than 50 times that winter. Nothing stranger than teenage boys acting stupidly happened. I love the fact that it's getting attention after all these years. One night, when I was young, we looked out the front porch and it seemed the whole hill was on fire. There was an older hospital on the hill that burned. It burned for hours while the whole neighborhood was sitting outside and watched. What gets lost in Waverly is that many people survived tuberculosis there. Let's face it Doctors back then did everything they thought was right to save people. It took a lot of courage for people to work there knowing how tuberculosis was contagious. Much is focused on those who have suffered. I have also traveled to the building several times in the early 70's. We would go and visit people locked in the Home for the Elderly through a group of young people from the church. Incidentally, the doors there were not of prison like steel doors with chains and locks as portrayed in the film. They were wooden and open, sometimes too open. She did smell of urine and feces and you saw the occasional open dress associated with patients with dementia. It was true that it was closed by the state in the early 80's. Much of this may have to do with the age of the building or the right guy was not paid. That's Kentucky at last. The part of the documentary that most excited me was the stacking of bodies in a cart. If I'm not mistaken, it seems to have been footage of the Holocaust. This was added for dramatic effect. That left me with a bitter taste in the mouth for the filmmaker. I'm a skeptic when it comes to "ghosts." I believe that many around here really think of the place to be haunted. Waverly for me however symbolized a fun place to adventure a boy with a sleigh.
