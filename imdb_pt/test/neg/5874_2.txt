Clint Howard, brother of the most talented Ron, stars in this horrific comedy about a mental case that serves ice cream to children and kills people. Striving to be a movie that is "so bad that it's good," this movie misses that mark a good distance away and instead has to be seen as "so bad it is ... well .. . BAD". Whether it's the constant shoe-ad film, the stuffed 'fat kid' pillow or the sleep-inducing 'horror' that sourened me in the movie, I do not know, all I know is that I loathe the movie a guy who has a crush on horror movies B). Paul Norman chose to continue making movies in the porn industry before and after that, his only mainstream movie. A wise choice, in fact, such as horrible acting, mindless plot and ridiculous dialogue are MUCH more palatable, at the same time you see a porn actress doing what she does. Curiously, this turkey has absolutely NO nudity (another reason to avoid) <br /> <br /> My Note: D-
