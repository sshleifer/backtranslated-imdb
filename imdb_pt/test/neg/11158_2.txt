End of Days is one of the worst big budget action movies I've ever seen. Confusing direction, sinuous script laden with idiot dialogues and plot holes, fast MTV style editing and poor acting to the end. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the End of Days is not watchable. The film got me interested because I found the latest ridiculously stupid Ah-nuld action movie to be so inept and silly when it comes to logic. Without a sense of logic, the movie dies faster, which is why the End of Days deserved a huge box office drop in its second week after opening in the US. <br /> <br /> I will not go into details. explaining why End of Days violates the law of logic of the film, but here are several problems with this film: SPOILER After the Devil leaves, the restaurant explodes without any trace of how he did it. No finger cracking, no energy gas tampered with to ignite the fire, nothing. How could this happen? Arnold and his annoying helper, Kevin Pollack, somehow magically appear under the name "Christine York" after examining the phrase "Christ in New York" carved into the body of the victim, runs the bank data on the computer, and viola, Christine York, the only person with the exact name throughout New York City! Beyond my suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> How did the characters who came in contact with Arnold's character turn against him later in the movie? I laughed aloud when I recognized that the stepmother who became a bad stepmother is the same actress who represented a nanny in Romeo + Juliet by William Shakespeare. Your ironic transition from the movie to this movie was absolutely hilarious, if you can imagine. <br /> <br /> All the huge explosions and shootings. What did you expect from Arnold Schwarzenegger's vehicle? <br /> <br /> The devil took the body of a man made up of flesh and blood, but he is invisible to bullets and explosions as he heals through that body. Of course, this is impossible. As the devil demonstrates the illusion in the apartment, Arnold's character finds the solid Christmas tree that is supposed to be an illusion and falls on it physically. <br /> <The Devil is able to pierce a person's brains and twist a victim's head 180 degrees, but he can not kill Arnold's character as he always intends. <br /> <br /> How the parents of the Devil's Desire object died and why evil New Yorkers chase after Arnold and the object of desire was never explained at all. <br /> <br /> Following that is a fraud of Speed, Arnold and the object of desire of the Devil manage to escape the subway train wreck by the short distance inside unharmed. This is beyond my comprehension, since the force would be enough to cast Arnold and the object of desire around violently and die of fatal wounds seconds after impact. <br /> <br /> Arnold suffers the brutal beating of the Devil's sanctioned crowd and put him on the cross to hang against the wall, but the devil forgot to have the time and opportunity to kill him for convenience. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, after the devil took over a man's body, suddenly Arnold is his bodyguard ??? Is this a coincidence or just an example of bad editing? <br /> <br /> The recital of Arnold's inducing dialogues in particularly laughable scenes like "YOU ARE A COMPARED CUT TO ME!" are the perfect food for the MST3K, just as Eraser did with the classic line "You're the luggage!". <br /> <br /> The whole theory about 666/1999 is absolutely ridiculous. So are the pseudo-religious babblings about Christian theology involving the end of the world precisely at midnight and the fanatical assassins who know the location of the Devil's object of desire. <br /> <br /> (END SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> It is highly ironic that End of Days uses the scattered profanities that abuse the deity as they dwell on Christian theories. The level of violence in the film is excessive and repulsive and therefore it is unnecessary to serve the conspiracy. The Director's over indulgence is a factor here. He certainly does not know how to make a coherent action movie with the scriptwriter of Air Force One, who was only forced to write the script for only a large sum of money. <br /> <br /> So, End of Days is a useless movie with no redeeming value except for camping - the worst of Arnold since Hercules in New York. eur-lex.europa.eu eur-lex.europa.eu
