So that's where the head of Columbia's Short Affairs Unit got his board start, huh? Yes, it is none other than Mr. Jules White who is credited (or is, instead, "exposed") as the Director of this entry in the DOGVILLE Series of MGM. Given co-credit as co-director is a Zion Myers; whose name is hitherto unknown to us. Mr. Meyers was undoubtedly the guy who controlled four-legged men and was responsible for training and "acting." In short, he must have been the Dog Trainer on set. <br /> <br /> The title of this short comedy is undoubtedly a play on the MGM film of the same year, THE BIG HOUSE; who starred Chester Morris, Wallace Beery, Robert Montgomery and a supporting cast. We must plead ignorance in relation to this title; not having seen until this point. (Sorry, Schultz!) But there are lots of jokes that relate to what we read about the movie *; without mentioning any specific particularities. For example, we observed a doomed canine st-stuttered and correctly deduced that the actor Bow-wow was imitating character comedian, Roscoe Ates. We later came across the cast of BIG HOUSE and ready, his name is there! (Shining deduction, a fit for Holmes & Watson!) <br /> <br /> The practice of ridiculing popular traits was already a tried-and-true practice in the field of short comedy. It was one that did not seem to object to the producers and copyright owners of the major films; but on the contrary, it has received a lot of tassive approval. After all, imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery; in addition, any producer would appreciate even some seemingly irreverent parody. ** As for the film itself, we thought it was interesting in a rather perverse way. Seeing so many "Man's Best Friends" being so artificially animated in a single, long, boring anthropomorphic gag seemed very tiring to us, who compose the audience. I mean how many dogs were made to bark, unnecessarily, in order to achieve the illusion of 'talking'? When you get to pets, or "Animal Companions," as the Politically Correct crowd prefers, we are rather eclectic; favoring not only dogs; but also cats, hamsters and parakeets. We do not like to see any exploited animal in an extensive and non-funny game format. As incredible as it may seem, Mr. Jules White's step from the MGM Shorts to lead Columbia's 2 Roll production seems not to have been just an increase in the financial arena; but al $ o in the Artistic Content. We never thought to be director-producer for the likes of such luminaries as the 3 Stooges, Andy Clyde and Hugh Herbert, as well as some who had certainly seen better days such as Charley Chase, Buster Keaton and Harry Langdon; would be a step up in the movies. <br /> <br /> IN CASE, we have not yet made our point; we're officially doing this here. So, watch this at your own risk. We'll let you know! <br /> <br /> NOTE â€¢ We read excellent reports about the BIG HOUSE and about the farewell of Laurel and Hardy, PARDON US (Hal Roach / MGM, 1931) in both MR. LAUREL & MR. HARDY by John McCabe (1962) and The Laurel & Hardy Movies by William K. Everson (1967). Both books have our most enthusiastic endorsement. <br /> <br /> NOTE ** The Prison Board has become a Genus of its own; all due to a debt to the big house. In PARDON US, Laurel & Hardy, Hal Roach and its director made a first appearance, the first of many; for a prison comedy has become a must subject for so many a funny screen man to come.
