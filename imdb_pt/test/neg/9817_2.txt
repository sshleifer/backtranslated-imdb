An absurd fool executed in a disconcertingly amateurish and inept manner - or perhaps several since the incredible lack of continuity, tone, realism, plausibility, suspense and more combine with Walter Pidgeon's bovine attempts to create a cinematographic curiosity of the other stupendous failures by Fritz Lang. (I thought the German ambassador was actually interpreted by Lang, but apparently not - they could have been twins.) If you can not predict the end of several time zones away, you're not really alive. <br /> <br /> I was eagerly waiting for this DVD and was totally surprised and disappointed with this terrible crap (even with George Sanders and John Carradine - maybe I can wash my mind by watching Viaggio in Italy and for the umpteenth time). /> Anyone want a once used DVD? (There may be a movie to be made about the making of this atrocious movie and how so many talented people could be wasted so completely.)
