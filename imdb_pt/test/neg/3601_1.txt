This is the worst waste of time I've ever experienced. nor near the first. The plot difficult to follow - plot was weak - at best. The whole thing seemed like three stories trying to somehow tie them up and make a movie. There were a few good lines here and there-and the attempt at the message was admirable, but they went from Houston to New York to get to Dallas. It was really difficult to tell in what period of time the present time was given. The film lasted only an hour and it seemed we had stayed there watching the movie all afternoon. Respect points for being honest - but a son should not have to do everything Kronk thought he had to do. Do yourself a favor - Watch Kuzco again.
