Negotiating on the success of the success of 1975, this film is a cheap story of a plantation where Massa descends with the women slaves, and the Missu lies with the great black stallion, and with the son masa'a also. In fact, there is so much going on, that I really do not know why someone bothered to dress. <br /> <br /> So if you want to see white women wrapping their naked bodies all over Slaves, or you just like a movie with boobs on display every five minutes then this is for you. <br /> <br /> There is a funny / sad story here, but it only comes at the end so as not to interfere with all the hot sweaty sex going on at the plantation.
