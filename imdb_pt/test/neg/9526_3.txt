As a person who knows the ship filmed and some other ships, I also can not see the movie as a movie. As a movie has great and wonderful pictures of the ship, most of them made on an existing vessel - other than those in the disaster scenes, of course, and a certain room under the deck. But in relation to the story and the dialogues, I can only call it big shit. None of this would happen on a real sailboat. No wonder, the movie had a negative impact on the existing ship - if I did not know better, I was not tempted to take a boat trip for sure. Definitely, for Europeans, I recommend hanging up when the ship ran aground. After that, the very emotional, very American part begins, which I could not bear. The photos are really great, not surprising in a Ridley Scott movie, but if you can avoid hearing the text, it will become much better.
