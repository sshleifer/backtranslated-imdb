Return home; what a huge disappointment !! After reading the plot summary (the dead going back to vote - AGAINST George W. Bush !!!!!) I could not wait to see it. It started interesting and immediately caught my eye. Unfortunately, however, he slowly descended into a boring political satire that I did not need to see (I can just watch a good old Australian comedy for that!). There were practically only one or two scenes of horror and they were not even so scary. I could not believe this came from Joe Dante, who could easily have achieved this with an equal balance between emotions and satires. <br /> <br /> The worst episode so far. <br /> <br /> 2/5.
