The first time I saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching the movie Kim Possible. The commercial showed Sadie and her friend discussing the meaning of the word nothing. It's one of the stupidest commercials I've ever seen. Basically, they go back and forth with lines like "Nothing is a thing, so technically nothing is something". When I saw this, I figured it would be another imitation of Lizzie Maguire from Disney. But I had no idea how bad. <br /> <br /> Fast forward about 3 weeks, when my sister turns on the TV. Of course Sadie was on. What I saw had to be one of the most unintentionally funny shows I've ever seen. How was it? Something like this: <br /> <br /> Sadie, a vegetarian tree hugger, has an unbelievably unhealthy and obsessive fall from Owen's monotonous and misunderstood tone. For some reason, her friend Margret decides that Owen needs to be "tested" to see if he's as good as he looks. What exactly do these tests involve? Well, one thing they do is put a cockroach on her notebook. Because? So she can be picky and ask her monotonous knight in shining armor to take it off. How is this a test? Because if he crushes, he is stingy and indifferent and does not believe that insects, as Sadie says, "are also innocent animals." THEY DISCLOSE DISEASE AND PESTILANCE! THEY DESERVE TO BE SUCCESSFUL! But of course, Owen just opens the window, and Sadie is still in love. But that is not all! Margret says he needs to be challenged once again, in something "no guy can get by". This involves stuffing scarves in your pants (yes, you read them right) and walk buy it to see if it notices your big butts. Predictably, he does not notice and we see Sadie in her strange, strange world of notebooks. Sadie decides she wants to stay with Owen forever, raise a family with him and, as she says, "live like wooden ducks with her brood." This is simply wrong. <br /> <br /> In short: This is the strangest and most insane show I have ever watched. For those who like to make fun of stupid things, you'll love it. For anyone else, skip this show.
