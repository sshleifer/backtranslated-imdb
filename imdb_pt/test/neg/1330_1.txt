This movie was terrible! My friend and I were so bored with this that we went through the last half of the movie just to see what happened. It is the typical sport, it wins or loses. The only thing remotely interesting was when the guy referred to someone as a Veg-e-tab-le. This will be a line my friend and I will mention in the coming years, reminding us of this colossal clich√© of wasted time
