Ugh This movie has so many unbelievable plans that it turned what could have been a good movie into a heinous mess. The story is kind of decent, but the holes in the plot make the execution literally laughable. In fact, we should believe that the Secret Service would go against all common sense and allow the President of the United States to face an unbelievable risk. If this is an indication of the kind of thinking that goes through good judgment among the president's protectors, then we are all in trouble. Roy Scheider does a good job as president, but unfortunately he is compensated for by the truly disgusting performance of Patrick Muldoon (who somehow continues to find employment in Hollywood based only on his good looks and his way of smirking at every opportunity, regardless of whether the script requires a smile). Maybe someone will see this and be inspired to make a good movie from the premise - or, maybe someone will see it and say, "Hey, if they can make such a bad movie, maybe I can too!"
