When I first saw this movie I was literally rolling on the floor laughing (especially when they were being chased by the water, and when the guy drove through the people's gardens, I mean would it hurt to drive around the wash line?) Effects! This movie clearly does not have a big budget. Either that or the guy left his child in charge of the controls. the water coming out of the damn thing looked like a close-up of a beer can that had foamed. What were the actors thinking? Did they really believe it was a good movie? or do they really need the money? not that they would have gained much. When I first saw this, I was like 'God, how old is that?' When I looked at the information about it and saw it was done in 2003, I thought my TV was broken. <br /> <br /> This is really a disaster movie in more ways than one.
