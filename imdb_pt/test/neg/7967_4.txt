This is unique in Hitchcock films I've seen, which I really did not like. <br /> <br /> In fact, I found this quite predictable and irritating. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine are a newly married couple. He's the kind of "lovable and dishonest" character you've seen in many movies, never being kind to me. <br /> <br /> In fact, it was an almost impossible relationship to believe, at best. at times it seemed particularly false and implausible. Unable to keep a job and try to live an opulent lifestyle, Grant is lent to borrow money that he can not afford. <br /> <br /> Fontaine is convinced that he is trying to kill her to get the money for which she is insured; and, presumably, what his late father was worth. <br /> <br /> Average and quite uninteresting in general, in fact, but as usual, you can see the influence on movies that happened later.
