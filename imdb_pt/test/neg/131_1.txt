Dawn begins at a Californian college as Professor Simon (associate producer Joe Morton) tells his students that they have to undertake a six-week intensive study of a mental patient at Cape State Hospital as a crucial part of their education, and they fail become qualified physicians. An intelligent, young, attractive and intelligent student named Eve (Kelly Overton) receives a particularly difficult patient to study. His name is Don Wake (James Haven) and is a convicted murderer, he was found covered in blood, in addition to the body of a woman (Diane Verona) and his daughter (Jenette McCurdy). At first, Don will not even look at Eve, let alone talk to her, but, like the soldier who is Eve, persists in trying to figure it out. Eventually Don starts talking, but what he says scares Eve, he says someone is looking at her and mentions the name Malachay. Eve then begins to see an obscure and somber figure at every moment, while Don produces conspiracy theories and bizarre statements. Eva slowly begins to lose her head when the line between fantasy and reality becomes more and more blurred. Is there anything else in the supposed foolishness that Don speaks of besides being the insane delusion of a psychiatric patient ...? <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Mark Edwin Robinson I have nothing but negative feelings about Breaking Dawn. Now, we all like a good turnaround, the kind of ending that takes us by surprise, surprises us, works well with the rest of the movie and remains in our memory as the legal end of The Sixth Sense (1999) & Fight Club ( 1999) to cite just two good examples and, to a lesser extent, the finals of such films as Scream (1996), where the identity of the killer is a good surprise and not so obvious. So of course, there are films whose endings spoil everything that happened before and, as an example, let's give, oh, I do not know, let's say Breaking Dawn, because I've never seen such a horrible ending to a movie, ever. Breaking Dawn begins as a decent psychological horror thriller with frightening things beginning to happen to Eve, not the most action-packed movie of all kinds of imagination, but it has interest, not the most absorbing film of all time but is more than watchable and not so bad a movie by the end of the twist, I have to keep mentioning this because everything else up to that point (which was OK to be fair with that) suddenly becomes irrelevant. I'm sure there are people out there who think they have this mess of an end that was solved to the last detail, all I can say is that no one will be able to explain this in a way satisfactory to me and as far as I am worried, it does not make a bit of sense and it will never be. Breaking Dawn sucks and it's a waste of time to see it to be rewarded with the most pitiful end in movie history, it's as simple and straightforward as that. Director Robinson does not make half a mess of what could have been a decent suspense, maybe he thought that what he had done would be good or maybe it was ruined in the editing room, but I imagine which was more likely to be a litany of junk as he tried to tie all the absurdities together within the confusing space of a few minutes & give us all a final shot happier than happy. It builds up tension pretty well during the first odd 80 minutes, but it's all for nothing at the end of the day. <br /> <br /> Technically Breaking Dawn is fine and is generally well done everywhere. The acting is very good, Overton is good and easy on the eyes and puts a decent performance. It was just me or the guy who played Don looks like John Morghen, star of Italian classics like Canibal Apocalypse (1980), City of the Living Dead (1980), House on the Edge of the Park (1980), Canibal Ferox (1981) Stagefright (1987) and The Church (1989)? Okay, maybe it was just me ... <br /> <br /> Dawn is bullshit, I hated everything because of the last few minutes. Do not get me wrong, it did not exactly excite me to this point, but it was okay. Definitely one to avoid as far as I'm concerned, although it seems to have a fair share of positive comments on IMDb ...
