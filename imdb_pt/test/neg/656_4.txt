A wildly unequal movie where the biggest problem is the uncomfortable mix of comedy and suspense. For me, the unusual premise is clearly a comedy, and they should have gone for a total comedy. For example, Rock has some funny lines, but occasionally it's very unpleasant for a comedy. The scene where Betty's husband is scalped is very unpleasant for what should have been a less violent comedy. An even better example is the leftist Hollywood writer who tricks us through Freeman's character early on about the plight of the Indians; I mean - yawn! They should have given Freeman something funny to say in that segment, but that's of course much harder than simply writing him a boring PC speech. <br /> <br /> There is even more New Age PC on the PC. shape of the end: the girl not only does not pick up the boy - she does not receive any boy; In fact, the message is that the girl does not need any boys! Little of a feminist statement there. The first half hour is weak, but the film improves - ironically - when Zellweger arrives at Kinnear. I say "ironically" because I'm not much of Kinnear's fan although he's solid here. Zellweger is very cute, as usual; she has the kind of cute American look that should appeal to almost every guy, and I wonder why more of these women are not "represented" nowadays, instead of dogs that have inexplicably become stars, like Diaz, Roberts. Aniston, Lopez, or Barrymore. Since the movie tries to be very serious at times, I have no choice but to criticize the character of Freeman, who is the equivalent of the gangster of the movie world prostitute. -Heart of Gold. There is also absolutely nothing in the relationship between Freeman and Rock to suggest, even remotely, that they were father and son.
