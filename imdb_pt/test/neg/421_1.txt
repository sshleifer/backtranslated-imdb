It's hard to imagine how Dan Brown's engaging novel "Angels and Demons" could fail as much as this film version. Here are ten reasons why the film was a failure. Due to spoilers, please do not read unless you have already seen the movie. <br /> <br /> (1) In the film, there was no love relationship between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra. Worse still, there was no chemistry between the two main actors. <br /> <br /> (2) Breathtaking venues in Rome, as described in the novel, were not performed visually in the film. I am aware that director Ron Howard has encountered difficulties filming on location. But there are superior photographed representations of Rome in The History Channel than in this film in which the Eternal City was presented in eternal filming. The great works of art described in the novel were briefly described in the film. Bernini's magnificent sculpture of the "St Teresa's Bliss" was only momentarily glimpsed, and the Western Ponente relief in Vatican Square was not visible. <br /> <br /> (3) The filmmaker's most insipid choice was in the portrayal of the late pope who really resembled beloved John Paul II. In the novel, the pope is clearly fictitious, without any resemblance to any true pope. (4) One of the most colorful (and important) characters in the novel, Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN, was the script cut. <br /> <br /> (5) There were numerous cases where the lines of dialogue were inaudible due to strange background noises. <br /> <br /> (6) character faces were not visible due to the shadows and illumination of the chiaroscuro movie. This technique worked on "The Godfather" movies, but Ron Howard is not Gordon Willis. (7) The College of Cardinals was quite heterogeneous, with one of the voters speaking in a southern accent. This guy would have been more comfortable on a ranch in Texas than in the Sistine Chapel. <br /> <br /> (8) The crucial relationship between the Camerlengo and the late Pope was not defined in the film. This relationship was central to the theme of science versus religion and the relevance of the Illuminati to the conspiracy against the church. <br /> <br /> (9) In the novel, Hassassin's character was an unforgettable villain. In the film, the role of that murderous character was a villain of cardboard clipping. <br /> <br /> (10) As a whole, the filmmakers did not trust the workings of the successful novel. <br /> <br /> In the novel, Langdon makes an impossible fall from the sky to the Tiber. In Ron Howard's film, it was the very film that landed on the Tiber.
