(r # 64) <br /> <br /> No redeemable, no merit and, most of all, sad junk. You know a movie will be bad when its only star power is Lance Henriksen. The French title for this movie says it all: "Inexplicable." How can you make an incredibly bad movie in this day and age? Whatever Jonas Quastel's trick worked. This is rubbish, I'm talking about a crap like 'Manos', meaningless, unassailable, not even so good, a cinematic bile of the highest order. <br /> <br /> Lance Henriksen It's Harlan Knowles, a character who might have been interesting if he was not so devoid of character or personality. He, along with a bunch of idiots, goes on a field trip to look for an evil Sasquatch, who is believed to have attacked a plane that fell into the woods, or something. Not much else happens. There are some soft-core nudity (which means: Teletubbie Level) and some cheeky "Predator" plucking. After 92 minutes of pain and another scene ripped out, this time from "Blair Witch," the film finally staggers along the finish line. As a bonus, we only see the monster itself for about one or two scenes throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about this movie. All you need to know is that this is a very bad movie and it's not even worth being seen as a movie "so bad it's good". "The Untold" is for entertainment value what Orlando Bloom is for character acting. Avoid as arsenic.
