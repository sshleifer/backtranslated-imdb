I do not know about what the Chasidik movement was this movie? I saw this movie a year ago. Am I an Orthodox woman, living in an orthodox Chassidic? And I can tell you that I was offended by this movie! It's so far from reality, it's scary! The director could at least hire a Rabbi Chasidik for a brief consultation, before making a "Realistic" movie about ultra-Orthodox! For example, the Meir Davening (Morning Prayers)! Or a Jewish wedding, or a Mikveh (ritual bath) customs. <br /> <br /> The movie is loaded with technical inaccuracies .. but it is not them that bothered me. It is the spiritual side. Orthodox are portrayed alongside the Taliban. Women are impotent, while men are the final rulers! Please, no one can force a Jewish girl to Chuppa against her will! We Orthodox, too, live by the law (Halacha) that clearly states man's responsibilities towards his wife. Not beat and not rape, too! And no man (even a rabbi) is allowed to hit the woman in the Mikveh. And Balanit is not putting his hand on the woman's head while she is taking a ritual bath, the idea is to immerse the whole body in one go! The director was clearly trying to attack the ultra-Orthodox! But could he do so at least in a more pleasant and learned manner? <br /> <br /> Love story? Cute ! But it is not credible. The dialogues are long and boring. The end was totally sucked. Despite all this drama, I was, at least, waiting for a good ending, for all that session I felt I deserved! Obviously, someone was trying to make a nice comforting film for less observant Jews, or for non-Jews, maybe ... (look at those fundamentalists, they are so bad and bad ...) and they do! Long short thing: I was hoping for a good Europien film (Kane level), instead it has a bashing, unrealistic tradition, erroneously guiding rubbish. I mean, today we live in a time of free will like never before. Everyone has the right to choose. Malka chose a rock singer. Rivka made her choice. Meir made his. Many people of non-observant backgrounds are choosing Orthodox Judaism these days. Because, in this crazy world, religion can be a good portal!
