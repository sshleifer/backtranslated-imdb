It's true that I can not watch Comedy Central anymore just because I can not stand watching the repeat commercials for this show. I'll tell you the truth, this is a terrible show not because I'm offended by it, but because Carlos Mencia is one of the worst comedians I've ever seen. I'd rather watch Carrot Top making an impression of George Bush than watching this hack without skills. And believe that he calls himself the greatest. Even though he has not stolen the jokes, he's still bad at telling them, it's out of time and not original. I remember a joke he said "Why do whites go camping? Pretend they are poor for a week?" Now, what does that mean? That all white people are rich? Another one I did not understand was when he made a satire of Price is Right and he said to some fat guy "You should know how much a refrigerator costs, you're fat" and the fat guy had the saddest look on his face. But what does it mean? What "fat people" are always looking for refrigerators? These are just the two I've seen in your commercials, God knows what his show is like. <br /> <br /> This show fits into the epic movie and date movie.
