The other reviewer was completely correct about this. The writing was horrible, the acting horrible, the subject horrible. The actors looked like they were not really in the movie, as they almost had to be there. There were some unique camera effects, but they were not really pertinent to the story (or what there was of a story), and they were not produced particularly well. <br /> <br /> I suppose they were trying to hitchhike on the success (I might say?) of the other eschatologically influenced films (Omega Code, Left Behind). And yes, it makes Christians uncomfortable when these types of films are produced. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially a non-Christian.
