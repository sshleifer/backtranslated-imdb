While watching this movie, with its deterministic cause and effect, wall-to-wall cliches and banal feeling, can anyone be so naive as to think that this is really how Barrie's life unfolded? You watch in a position of disagreement. Hollywood biopics programs are no longer based on individual lives, they are only rewritten from previously successful biopics. If Hollywood made a film about your life, it would be filled with such perfect timing that you would hardly recognize your own story. Any personal complexity would be obliterated by some simplistic and explanatory background story. His story would look like "Rocky" because it's the only arc of life that Hollywood knows how to produce the most. We could not leave the audience thinking about something left open when they left. This movie does not trust an audience to discover things without being taken to them. I realized the hook reference of the captain / mother eons before the movie would literalize it for me. I could see the turn of the 25 children coming in for days. <br /> <br /> This is a completely medium-length movie. Not horrible, but not great. So it is likely to be watered with some Oscars next year. There is nothing the Academy would like more than to congratulate on finally realizing the standards set over the last thirty years. <br /> <br /> From the New Yorker's "Lost Boys" article by ANTHONY LANE: <br /> <br /> Arthur Llewelyn Davies, also adored his boys, and it may be unfair to "Finding Neverland" omit him , for the purpose of rationalizing the scene, by the time Johnny Depp meets Kate Winslet, she is already a widow, while Arthur was very much alive when Barrie first entered consciousness and, little by little, the home of the Llewellyn Davies family. Finding Neverland is a cry. From the moment Barrie met George and Jack, and we began to reflect on the ways in which they might be immortal, the story is sad, but the reality is even more discouraging: 1907 - Arthur Llewellyn Davies 1915 - George is killed in the first Wo War, wrestling with his regiment in Flanders 1921 - Michael, one of the undergraduate student at Oxford drowns in nothingness The two bodies, when recovered, are caught together. <br /> <br /> On April 5, 1960, Peter Llewellyn Davies, then the esteemed editor, threw himself under a subway train in London. We should not presume to read a tormented mind, but we may note in passing that if he had lived another month, he would have reached the centennial of Barrie's birth and, therefore, it is thought, a wave of interest in "Peter Pan." "??" what a terrible masterpiece, "in the words of Peter Llewellyn Davies.
