This movie is little more than an ersatz Verhoeven. The footage is supposedly tele-realistic, but it's just disgusting. The parody disappears after about 15 minutes to be replaced by a story that seems to take itself seriously. Brechtian breaks for nonexistent ad brakes are tedious and even painful; no doubt there was no real intention to make this Brechtian film, it was just an accident that happened like that. If you want to watch a parody of reality TV, watch Celebrity DeathMatch - it's funnier and interesting, and more importantly, shorter. I rarely felt so much pain while watching a movie. To be avoided like a rabid rabbit.
