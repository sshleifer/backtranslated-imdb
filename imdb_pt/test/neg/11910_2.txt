Jack Lemmon was one of our great actors. His performances in Days Of Wine And Roses, The Apartment, Some Like It Hot, Missing (to name the first ones that come to mind) were all worthy of Best Actor nomination. His only win was for Save The Tiger, and that's a shame. He gets melancholic about a science, but never puts it in balance with the driver in his character. He actually made a much better looking character at the end of his single-note career Glengarry Glen Ross. <br /> <br /> As for the film, Jack Gilford's wonderful supporting work as a partner with Lemmon and Thayer David as an arsonist, is worthless because the rest of the script is a confusing mix of vignettes, anguish, neurotic nostalgia . and moralizing without meaning. It is worth seeing once as a time capsule in experimental direction style 1970 by Avildsen.
