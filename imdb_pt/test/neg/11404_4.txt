As of 2002, Dutch cinema has finally improved again. This film is still a part - and a school example of the bad period of Dutch cinema. <br /> <br /> The story is told unnecessarily in flashback style. All the 'present' sequences established in France are completely redundant and add nothing to the story, emotions or power. For some reason, European filmmakers often find it necessary to tell the story non-chronologically. I never understood why, or what his appeal is. <br /> <br /> History is not exactly the best either. It is not always clear if the film is trying to go and what it tries to say. The story of an inexperienced young man falling in love with a wild young woman who later turns out to be quite psychotic may look good enough on paper and even show some parallels with Paul Verhoeven's "Turks fruit" to which this film was often compared to before and at the time of its launch. However, the end result is far from comparable. The story fails to capture the right emotions, which is also due to the unimaginable performances of the actors. The way the story is told also makes the film far from being always interesting or attractive. I lost interest in this movie in about 40 minutes through the movie. <br /> <br /> At the time this film was made, both Antonie Kamerling and Angela Schijf were promising rising stars with great potential and ambitions, but both careers have dried up so far. Angela Schijf seems to give her family more attention than her career (this is not a bad thing, of course) while Antonie Kamerling attempted to start a career in Hollywood. He never went beyond playing some small pieces on 2 flops by Renny Harlin. To be honest, I'm not surprised. It's not that he's a bad actor and he certainly looks right, but his English is not good enough, to say the least. Just listen to him speaking English at the beginning of this movie and you'll understand what I mean. They are not really bad actors, but for some reason they do not appear in this movie. It is probably also due to poor dialogue. I still liked Beau van Erven Dorens. He has been much criticized, but his acting seems very natural. He always keeps the characters close to who he is. <br /> <br /> It's by no means one of the worst movies ever made, but it's not exactly one I would recommend as well. A bad and uninteresting narration makes this a bad movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
