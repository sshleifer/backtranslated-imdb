Mario Racocevic of Europe is the only user who has posted a comment so far and covers the main points of the film. Again, another difficult film to buy in the UK. I had to go through "Midnight Video" which has a Swedish branch. I went to the mail and bought by mail this and a similar title in just one title for the SKR30. <br /> <br /> This movie is under many aka's depending on when and where it is marketed. previously bought "The Bloodsucker takes the dance" (which you will find if you look in Imdb under "people" and entry "Krista Nell"). The actor who plays the Count on his private island in the last film had his words dubbed Italian to English by an actor with an unmistakably sad and rather tired voice. I smiled when I heard that same voice nicknamed the English soundtrack as the police inspector investigating the murder of the dead prostitute in the woods in the movie. My choice, of course, was to see another ride through. There are a number of rather inconsequential sub-plots in the movie involving blackmail / extortion, obscene affairs with girlfriends' mothers, a motorcycle chase resulting in a gang attack, a gang by a "customer" motorcycle friends, scumbags, cross dressing by transvestites etc. which give a flavor to this film summarized in one word - SLEAZE, (but artistic sleaze). The above-mentioned contributor liked this movie but the humble rating suggests other fans of Imdb did however, without explaining their "wheres and whyfores" .Personally , I thought there were many subplots and it was not enough to put in the main story and in the relationship of these subordinate characters to the central plot and the development of their screen characters. Also a professional film the editor was extremely necessary, since some of the scenes seemed to last a long time, having made his argument, so that the film seemed to creep in some places; for example. Kristen Nell appears in a fruity scene with a client, but this is also just a vignette and I've been wanting more from her, the director and the script. <br /> <br /> I love the political wrongs shown in older movies (ie 30 years after their creation), for example smoking in offices and the way some characters react to each other in the office! I would suggest 4/10 as a more realistic rating and I'll grant it as such.
