This movie is TRASH of the word goes. First, it tells of a season that happened 16 years ago! Who cares? This film had as much depth as a bottle cap. This makes a complex person like Bob Knight in a cartoon character. <br /> <br /> Swearing does not bother me, but I'm still amazed that ESPN has shown a movie with more curse than a Kevin Smith movie on a basic cable channel. The word "F" was discarded at least 20 times before the first commercial break. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible and anyone associated with it should be ashamed. I rate this on the same level as Jaws IV - The Revenge and Everybody Wins ... 2 movies that are in the Craffest Hall of Fame.
