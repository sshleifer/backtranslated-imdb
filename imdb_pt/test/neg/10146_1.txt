In my opinion about this movie, the whole video part of this movie was absolute rubbish !!!! However, the soundtrack that was used contained the music of a great heavy metal rock band, I recognized the song as being a band called Firstryke and the album was "Just a Nightmare" and it was very well written !! and I'm curious to see what the rest of your movie fans think about it, if they remember going back so far. I would appreciate the feedback, I collect old movies and obscure movie soundtracks. It's a very time-consuming hobby, but it's very rewarding. I saw this band music being sold in Germany for about fifty dollars per album. Not for the bad Hugh?
