Despite many positive reviews, this is a very slow movie, with three essentially good actors improvising the most banal dialogue you'll ever hear. This is another road movie that really does not go where. The camera often gets out of focus and the constant panning in some of the long scenes is annoying. <br /> <br /> The three characters are attractive but remarkable. The cast also defines what should be an intergalactic record for the use of the tired word "face". (Even Howard Stern abandoned that pesky pronoun). <br /> <br /> The three main actors and a supporting actor are a great promise. They are clearly comfortable and bravely allow themselves to be described as superficial and even goofy. All character actors seem to be amateurs who generously volunteered to speak a few lines. In fact, they all fit physically well. <br /> <br /> All in all, 90 minutes that seem like an eternity. . This is one of my ten worst movies ever.
