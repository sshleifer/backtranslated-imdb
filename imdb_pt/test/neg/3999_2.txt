Emotionally insecure Tom Russo (Asbestos Felt) reads the secret diary of his sexy wife Leeza (Courtney Lercara) and is dismayed to discover that the love of his life has apparently slept with every subject she knows; this shocking revelation sends poor Tom out of his rocking chair, and he goes on to avenge himself with the blood of the men he believes to be tormenting his old woman. In my experience, really bad movies can be as entertaining as the really good ones, and no film with a decapitation by a machete-enhanced ceiling fan should be considered completely useless; but even if Killing Spree occasionally manages to entertain with his inventiveness and cheap and cheerful blood, I have discovered that the dire direction, horrible production values, ugly filmmaking, muffled sound, dreadful lighting, tediously boring, and foolish narrative (which includes a stupid plot that is telegraphed from the start, plus a nonsensical zombie ending), a nasty punch on the synthesizer, a perfunctory dialogue and a completely amateurish performance, all to make that writer / director Tom Ritter's effort virtually unhurried.
