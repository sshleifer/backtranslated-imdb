Once I heard that the largest and oldest preserved Germanic poem was transformed into a film that almost became my obsession to see it. The first reflections of his appearance that I have taken have never disappointed me. A futuristic interpretation With Lambert, our favorite Highlander and tomb tormentor Mitra, in leading roles, seemed appealing, although some doubts arose (an important female character in Beowulf?) ... Two hours ago I saw the film. After I read the director's name, my world collapsed. As I said-from that point on, there were not many surprises. Firstly, the movie has nothing to do with the original Beowulf if we ignore a couple of names stolen in a violent and useless way. If they had not stolen the names and declared it was a new story, it could have passed as a f-class action stupidity with nice outfits and scenarios. In this way, it is simply a crime! An attack on a legend and its ideology, as well as common sense. Okay, let me be positive for a second ... beyond the general electro-gothic atmosphere that's cool, it also has great music. This was both on the positive side and for this review.
