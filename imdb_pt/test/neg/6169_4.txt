Let me first say that I rarely review movies, I only comment if I am impressed or disappointed with something that I thought would be good. Killshot was a big disappointment on many levels. The script was horrible, the acting was below average (especially coming from heavy weights like Rourke and Lane) and the editing and effects were comical, (exploding cars etc. etc.) Rosario Dawson played a horrible role, I did not I can believe that until I accept this, it was a misuse of talent that I can not even put into words. I should have known after I saw the trailer of this movie 3 years ago and it kept being put on the shelf that yours was a serious problem with this movie .......... B movie all the way .... ..... do not bother unless your really bored ........
