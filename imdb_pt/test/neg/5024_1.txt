It may or may not contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> Inuyasha is not a good anime. In fact, it is very overrated. Because? There is absolutely no plot, no plot, and the show just creeps ... and on ... and on ... That's because there are more stories and fills than episodes that make the plot progress. And the fillers are just the same stories being repeated several times. The same episodes seem to have the same plot: Kagome feeling a fragment of jewelry, a demon / slime / tentacle thing appears, Inuyasha says "Wind-Scar", "Iron Reaver Soul Stealer", etc. and kills the demon, they take the piece of jewelry, and then we just repeat that scene 160 or more times. <br /> <br /> In addition to the repetition of episodes, there is the repetition of comedic devices, and they are no funnier. Wait, they never were. Sexual harassment is not funny. Viz rated the series Older Teens, 16+. I have no idea why they rated it. There's nothing wrong with that, except for the so-called funny sexual harassment, which is kind of suggestive, and that can trap you today. <br /> <br /> Now, that's how we know Inuyasha is overrated. The video games. They all sucked. Especially the mask game. I threw this at my friend's house. It was nothing interesting. The game was slow, boring and had Nintendo 64-type graphics. In a magazine, it received a 4/10 rating, saying "... this RPG game is slower than the milk shake rising at a cocktail party of straw. " So there are all these idiot Inuyasha toys, action figures, business cards, stickers and coloring books. COLOR BOOKS! We thought Inuyasha was 16! Maybe not ... But after being a member of Inuyasha's MSN groups, about half of the people there were 10 to 13. I think Inuyasha is a kid anime after all. (I think only a little editing made for this show could be shown on Toonami.) There are more than 40 manga volumes. I can only help but wonder how many miles of forest have been cut to make them. Sad ... <br /> <br /> Then comes the music. The music is so boring. We hear the same 5 songs each episode. After 10 episodes, the song gets very boring. In another anime, they have music to suit the mood and we do not hear some music very often. There are about 15 different Inuyasha soundtracks. Do not waste your money on this crap! <br /> <br /> And how do you think I know all this? Because I used to be a fan of Inuyasha. I feel ashamed of myself. I'd rather watch Kim Possible or Pokemon instead. Unfortunately, these two shows have more romance between the two main protagonists than Inuyasha will ever have ...
