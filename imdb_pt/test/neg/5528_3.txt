... but memorable because it includes an actor that I really recognize! James Horan is, by the standards of these types of films, Lawrence Olivier. He's given some decent performances on things like Highlander and several Star Treks, so it's kind of fun, if slightly depressing, to see him down here. Okay, yeah, there's a plot. The character of Horan and his wife are fighting, he is having an affair with a film critic while trying to make his film "masterpiece", and his guest decides to take advantage of the wonders of disassembly. But watching Horan is really the only pleasure to be found here.
