While watching this movie, you immediately notice the cheesy elements of a standard TV movie ... although throughout the picture the plot changes (if you're bold enough to say this movie has a plot) is in the book and not original ... and with each one the movie has become worse! Candace Cameron Bure, famous for her role as DJ Tanner in the hit TV show Full House, is not very convincing as a Possessed of twenty-something ... trying to avenge the death of possessions. I believe she's a great actress ... just not in the thriller. <br /> <br /> The filming was bad, and like I said, the plot obsolete ... although I watched it, I knew it was ready to be automatic. Cheese, I had no idea how much this movie could get worse ... <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie ... unless it's a joke Filmaking and poor writing is what you're looking for
