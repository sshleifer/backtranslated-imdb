The limited views of the setting were the only saving grace for a boring and monotonous movie. The acting was absurd that I blame in the script and script. Nicole Eggert did not look the part, did not play the part and was totally unconvincing as a mountain guide. After watching this, I got the feeling that some friends had some free time and decided to make a movie. It must have been produced with a pocket change budget. The plot was fine at best and with the low caliber of acting, sometimes asked the question to be asked: "Why are we doing this?". I was able to sit through the movie, but I also asked myself, "Why?"
