As this character has already been hired by the post office is way beyond me. The test that the postal workers take is so difficult. There's no way such a stupid guy can work at the post office. Everyone in this movie is just plain stupid and this is probably the purpose of the movie. How they could spend their whole lives and not see an elevator is also intriguing. I did not take this movie very seriously, but it was so stupid. So he tries to start the car without the keys? Lots of horrible scenes and horrible acting and this movie is not funny at all. It's just a stupid and sad mess. I liked Mother's dress though. <br /> <br /> Send it back to the sender as soon as possible.
