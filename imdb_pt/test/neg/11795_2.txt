This movie is a good companion for Blair Witch because it does so much harm that BW did right. Like BW, this one pretends to be a ghostly event documentary, with every member of staff taking care of their own camera. <br /> <br /> The sense of reality is never there, though. Participants are poorly written cliches characters and the events that happen are just as clich√© (the cat jumping out of a closet, falling from a candlestick, etc). Also the flamboyant dialogue and inept work of improvisation by the excessively attractive cast detract from the documentary sensation. And, worst of all, the cameras supposedly recorded by the participants record too many events to perfection to be even remotely believable. In fact, with some reissue, this thing could have been a parody of Blair Witch. In fact, there is a scene where the blonde historian is eating a sandwich with a huge cockroach that is really very funny, reminding me of a coarse scene similar to "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Broke Me." But in the end, the event is played straight, with no end line. It's hard to say what the intention was with the St. Francisville experiment, besides taking a look at some of BW's lost bucks. But it's very sad when the only real interest I could find in him was whether the blonde historian would have her T-shirt tied to her belly in a specific socket or not.
