Fred "The Hammer" Williamson makes another movie cheap. He could have set a new standard for himself. Look at the painfully obvious special effects mortar cannon that is visible on the street during a chase scene. You do not see it just once, you see it several times. Look for the out-of-focus picture in a scene and the camera operator tries to fix it while the scene is playing. Check this out with a group of people and make your own Mystery Science Theater!
