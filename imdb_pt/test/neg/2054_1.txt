I rented this movie today ... worst movie ever. It was a total waste of time and a horrible story. The acting was horrible, mainly by the actress of "Sai". She was so bad it was ridiculous. I can not tell if it was his bad acting or because the character was so stupid in the first place. I can not even think how this whole movie was horrible and meaningless. I'm surprised anyone thought it was a good idea to film this movie and bother to cast it. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good Vampire / Horror movie ... this is not the movie for you. Move on! It is a waste of time and money. Heck, I would not even lose this movie if someone paid me. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that it does not even deserve a "1". I wish I could give a "0"!
