Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance are legendary actors, and director Kostas Karagiannis was the man behind the successful Greek thriller Giallo-esquire Death Kiss in 1974; and yet when you combine the three talents, all you get is that full load of nonsense! God knows what led Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance to star in this cheap devil worship movie, but I really hope they have been paid well, since neither deserves anything as amateurish as that on their résumés. The story centers on a group of devil worshipers who kidnap some children, leading another group to go after them. The rhythm of the plot is very slow and this ensures that the movie is very annoying. The plot is also a long way from being original and anyone with a passing interest in the horror genre will have seen something a bit like this, and certainly done a lot better. The obvious lack of budget is felt throughout the film and the film can not get over it at any time. This is really a depressing and miserable watch, and not even a decent enough end can raise the bet enough to get that movie off the back of the barrel. Extremely poor things and definitely not recommended!
