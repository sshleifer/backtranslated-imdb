I really do not know much about the Marquis de Sade, having not read any of his books, but I never imagined him as a flaming queen. Carson Kressley, from Queer Eye to Straight Guy, or Jack from Will and Grace, would have fit easily into the role that Nick Mancuso gave us. The film itself was rather thin and looked more like a parody - or an excuse to show the brothel in Paris several times with men and women having fun on the sofas in the living room. What? Can not they afford a room? I found it cute that Madame (Irina Malysheva) felt she was doing her patriotic duty taking care of the soldier's needs. <br /> <br /> The movie was just an excuse to show a lot of breasts - and I mean a lot! Fans of Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) may be interested in seeing him in a different role as Inspector Marais.
