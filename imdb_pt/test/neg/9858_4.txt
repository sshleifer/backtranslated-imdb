This documentary was not done professionally or objectively. The whole thing unfolded as an IBM conspiracy theory to win the game in question just to earn some money. Garry Kasparov has an ego problem. He was bloated before the game and when he lost, he did not like it. I remember playing chess against computers in the 80's and it was not too difficult to win. Over time, I started to lose and I did not like it. Today, I simply do not play against computers anymore because they are too good. Not only that, the games are uninteresting and lack the appeal of human games where both sides are more likely to miss and open the game to exciting possibilities. This documentary continues to show us images of The Turk which is an ancient chess that plays automaton and which was actually controlled by a human being. From the beginning to the end, we are led to believe that IBM literally hid a human GM on the back of a cabinet-sized computer. I am a computer scientist and I am offended by the notion that just because Garry lost, IBM must have cheated. I know how computers play chess. It is not magic and it is no mystery. They can be trained, have an enormous amount of knowledge about chess, and certainly see positions and possibilities in unprecedented detail compared to humans. It's no surprise that Deep Blue has won. Maybe the moment it was. If this happened today, given the increasing processing power of the machines; people would hardly blink. If a machine could not even draw with a GM today, people would think the program was weak.
