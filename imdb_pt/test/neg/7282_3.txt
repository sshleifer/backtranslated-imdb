So it came to that. In the most highly rated commentary in this movie, someone says "Nishi is an honest man". Same? This is a guy who kills and kills people in the movie. He pauses to steal a bank. Honorable? How would you like your children to go to school with the children of someone who calls it honorable? Wait, there's more! The person also says "we can say that he is constantly thinking". How can we do that? Well, you know that joke "How can you tell when a CEO / politician / lawyer is lying?" ... "His lips move." Well, Nishi's lips never move, so I guess that means he's thinking. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is existentialism to warm the hearts of the cult of victimization. Existentialism supposedly emphasizes that an individual takes responsibility for the consequences of their actions. Not Nishi. Borrow money from the yakuza. What do they want back? Kill them. The cops find out. Kill yourself and your wife. <br /> <br /> Really honorable.
