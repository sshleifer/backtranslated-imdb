A reporter named Bart Crosbie (Pat O'Brien) blackmails gang boss Heinz Webber (George Colouris) for the money he must pay for his son to have a life-saving operation. In return, he agrees to indulge in the murder of his publisher, whom the gang killed to prevent an incriminating story from being printed on them. <br /> <br /> Typical poverty-row b-pic of the era directed by far more than worth it by Terence Fisher, who months after doing so would become one of the top directors of British horror films in the Hammer studio . The script is absurd and teen idol Tommy Steele (guitar in hand) was chosen to sing a poor number of rock and roll called "The Rebel" in a cafe that functions as a legitimate facade for the activities of the gang.
