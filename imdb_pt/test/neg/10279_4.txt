"Electra Glide in Blue" is a slow move in which Blake plays a desert motorcycle cop who wants to be a homicide detective and engages in a murder investigation. A mediocre movie at best, "EG in B" features some members of the Chicago band, a breath of action, some philosophizing, and very, very boring dramatic stuffing. Not worth the time.
