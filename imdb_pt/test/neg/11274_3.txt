Thank God I have fast forward. I think this is a movie about a guy who gets up and falls. Whatever it is, it's a stupid cliché. It makes no difference. There's this guy, Javier Bardem, who builds buildings or something. Does not matter. He's handsome, this Javier Bardem. Who cares? I think there's a car accident, but I watched it fast-forward, so ... who cares? Car wrecks and beautiful heroes fighting against them smell like a melodrama to me. Javier likes someone, but he marries Maria de Madeiros. She is magnificently, poetically beautiful, with a heart-shaped face. So Javier has an oral interface with Maribel Verdu, who washes his vulva in advance for some reason. You'd think Maribel Verdu, with her hand-washed vulva, would be sexy. No, she is not. This is a tedious story about a lot of people that do not interest me. Javier, Maribel and Maria have a ménage à trois: that annoying. This movie is boring. I think this may be a minor theme of (some) Spanish language films: The rise and fall predictability of a guy who succeeds against the odds. Let me clarify: this is a high class melodrama or maybe a novel. Not worth your time except for a laugh.
