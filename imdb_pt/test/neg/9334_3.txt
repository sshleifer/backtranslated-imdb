This film and several other 1950s films with a religious tone, such as The Robe, Quo Vadis, Samson and Delilah, unfortunately portray all pagans or anyone who is not Jewish or Christian as morally depraved and decadent. The focus is only on Bible-related stories that ignore the world outside the Bible. As for them, no good came from pagan Egypt, Greece, or Rome. Any movie that preaches about the "only true God" gives a little change to freedom of religion. The films ignore the fact that the lack of religious freedom in ancient Judea made it fertile ground for religious extremism. Most religious films of the 1950s also neglect the loss of liberty that occurred after Christians took over political power in the fourth century.
