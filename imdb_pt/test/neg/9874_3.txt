I'm almost a two-decades-old human who's been reading comics most of my life. I'm not a big fan of the Fantastic Four, but I'm pretty familiar with them. In 1994, Roger Corman (film legend B) produced the first, I think, feature film Fantastic Four. The result was a shock so pure that it was never given a launch. Still, there are copies, especially in the network and in conventions. If you're looking for a laugh and can find a copy, do yourself a favor and check out this thing. <br /> <br /> The film basically recounts the origin of the FF and a meeting with Doctor Doom and a villain named The Jeweler. , essentially the Mole Man with a fall for theft. As is the case with these comic book movies, everything has to connect to everything, so FFs play a vital role in creating Dr. Doom, and he and the Jeweler play a vital role in theirs. <br /> <br /> First, I'd like to mention that despite everything going wrong in this movie, I kind of liked the guy who played Doom. He does not get many decent lines, but when he does, he hits them. The armor looks pretty good too. <br /> <br /> As for the rest ... it's a dirty, dirty mess. Bad plots, bad acting, bad effects, basically bad. Boos especially for Jay Underwood, bringing new meaning to the exaggerated word like Johnny Storm. <br /> <br /> As for the FF, well, they all seem to be right, and Sue is played by a very attractive actress, but they do not look like a real team. On the one hand, they have no reason for Sue and Johnny to go into space. In a previous section, Ben and Reed will visit both, Johnny likes 8 and Sue is about 12 years old. This just makes your eventual romantic couple incredibly scary. The Thing costume looks more reptilian than anything else, not rocky, and the only time the Human Torch is actually a Human Torch he looks like the Silver Surfer in red. I could type for hours, but I think the scene that best sums up is a climactic encounter with the aforementioned not-so-human torch. He is running a laser beam, and he finally destroys it with a punch. Yes, a punch. A laser beam. With a punch. Then he flies and goes "Yippeee!" too much, with which the camera tilts and it flies back to the ground. Of course, Reed, the intellectual, forgot to tell Johnny that fire does not exist in the vacuum of space. This and many other scenes work like Looney Toones, if the character does not know they are on a cliff, they do not fall. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I was glad it was never released.
