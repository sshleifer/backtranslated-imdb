One of my favorite actors, C. Tom Howell, starred in this warm WOTW remake. It runs a lot, while a spider-like machine, generated by CGI, leaves killing everyone. The budget for this obviously was very low. It was also one of Asylum's productions. Have you seen any of these? Damn it! I do not know why anyone would have done this while Spielberg's big-budget version was killing them at the box office. And if the truth be told, no version is so hot. George Pal's version of the 1950s remains the best representation of H.G. Wells's novel, primitive special effects, and everything. Maybe because Gene Barry was far more convincing in lead than Howell or Tom Cruise.
