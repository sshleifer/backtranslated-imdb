This is one of the worst films ever made. I can not believe how bad it was. I was shocked by the horror of ghoulies. They are obviously Halloween masks! The mouths do not even move when they talk !!!!! Why did they feel the need to make ghoulies comic and goofy? Whenever they do something, there seems to be circus-like music and overuse of the BONK and BOING sounds when they hit people. The dominatrix lady of slavery is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. This movie is just plain bad. The plot is non-existent. The mother of ONE TREE HILL is in this and she's obviously had a nose job since this was done. Why did the main character of the first movie come back to make this crap? Film BAD BAD BAD.
