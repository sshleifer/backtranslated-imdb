I always liked Bill Murray in movies like Lost in Translation, and the trailer for this movie looked pretty good, but the result was very disappointing. Basically, Murray plays Jack Corcorin, who recently discovered that his father has died, and is expected to hear his will. He discovers that his father was a clown because he left a big shoe, his nose shrill and his main inheritance, an elephant! The only way Jack can get rid of this elephant is to travel 4,000 miles in four days and deliver it to a safe zoo for $ 30,000. Also starring Pat Hingle as Vernon. There are small little moments of humor, like the front of a truck leaning forward, and screaming Murray, but overall, it's useless. Very poor!
