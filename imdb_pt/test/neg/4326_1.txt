Look, some movie has to be the worst of them all. I suggest it may be India Song. When I saw the movie in 1976, it was playing at Carnegie Hall Cinema, a place frequented by people who care a lot about movies. From the middle of the way, people were simply leaving the theater. My girlfriend would not let us out, but in the end, the theater was practically empty. I kept telling people when they left that "the good part is yet to come". And it was. The good part was the screen at the end that said "end". It was the only good part. I'm still upset about this movie 24 years later. It was useless, stupid and derivative (Marienbad, part 2). See it only if you want to spend two endless hours learning to distinguish between just bad and simply terrible.
