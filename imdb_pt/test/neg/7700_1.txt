There is nothing good to say about this movie. Read Revolution for the Hell of It or any of your other writings. Abbie was often dismissed as the clown prince of the 60s, but he was a man of ideas who used his cleverness, his sense of humor and pop culture, and his extravagant personality to draw attention to his ideas. The media often focused on the man, not the ideas, and that's the problem with that movie as well. Later in his life he suffered from depression. But this movie is like a version of Abbie's National Enquirer. He deserves better. If you do not know Abbie or his time, this movie will not help. <br /> <br /> This movie is. I give a zero. <br /> <br />
