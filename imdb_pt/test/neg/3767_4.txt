Rocketship X-M should be seen by any serious movie fan for the following reasons: 1) It is one of the first - and few - movies that do not have a happy ending. Undoubtedly, the effect was deeper in post-World War II America than it would today, but the sad ending adds to the film's message. <br /> <br /> 2) It is also one of the first films to deal with space travel in a serious way, using space as a valid scenario for the drama. Despite the lack of scientific background, the film stands out as a dramatic passage. It's not so much a space drama, it's a drama set in space. <br /> <br /> 3) The anti-nuclear war message is conveyed in a serious way, which is not lost on sfx involving large grasshoppers, men, or animal. The effect of Martian society on nuclear devastation is presented clearly and frankly. The fact that the survivors of the expedition have fallen and, as such, can not preach the lesson learned on Mars adds another element of sadness to the tragic ending. Sterno says to take a ride on Rocketship X-M.
