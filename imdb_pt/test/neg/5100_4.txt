River Queen tries to make a complicated and comprehensive historical narrative in just under two hours. There are breathtaking battle scenes and the scenery of Wanganui is beautifully captured. However, the film suffered from a few clueless clues - Samantha Morton (Sarah), in particular, did not seem convincing. There seemed to be an indecision about how the role should be played - as a defenseless child cast by fate or as a strong, determined character with a clear vision of his destiny. The character of Kiefer Sutherland - Private Doyle - seemed to be useless and for the most part - unintelligible. Keifer's Irish accent needs a bit of polish. On the other hand, Cliff Curtis, Temuera Morrison and Rawiri Penny (as the son of Sarah "Boy") were well rounded and believable. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of River Queen seemed particularly depressed and rushed. It seemed that they decided to tie up all the loose ends before the 120 minutes ended. For example. How did Wiremu know how to find Sarah and Doyle? No explanation and very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> I went to this movie with an open mind. I had not read or heard anything but his problematic production. What I experienced was a hodgepodge of New Zealand's history, beautifully photographed but, in the end, disappointing.
