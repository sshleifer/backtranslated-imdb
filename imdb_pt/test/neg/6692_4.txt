The blonde strawberry has a great script, but I just wanted Errol Flynn to be in it instead of James Cagney, he's not the person for the role. I think Olivia did a great job. This movie is also a dream of the day, so it's hard to follow. I do not like the attitude of the male character; the way Cagney introduced him was out. I give 3 for bad acting of the main male character. (If you like tough men who like to fight all the time and argue, then this is your movie). The blonde strawberry would have been better if the main character had a more positive attitude, and would change the script so that he would be happy with Oliva. <br /> <br /> This movie shows that Money does not bring happiness, women certain jokes Pure and simple, not the best film, but each one must decide for himself.
