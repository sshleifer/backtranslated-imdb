Why bother watching this movie? It is probably a prize for being the worst career move of a great movie star since the laughable game of Clark Gable about an Irish patriot in Parnell. <br /> <br /> It is inconceivable that Bergman chooses both this film and its director throughout a film. a lucrative career in Hollywood where she could choose among the best scripts and directors offered at that time. For starters, there was no road map to work except a few notes. So we must believe in the polished Bergman as a poor refugee willing to do anything to be released from a refugee camp, including marrying a poor Italian fisherman she does not even love. I read where Anna Magnani was the original choice for this part. In that case, that made much more sense than casting the luminous Bergman into such a proletarian part. But since she was in love with her director, common sense flew out the window. <br /> <br /> So she goes to live in this poor village where men must work to extract a poor life from the sea. A place she obviously hates to be and where she does not fit. His only friend is the village priest who knows that she is not fit for the life of a poor fisherman bride but tells her that out of love she must suppress her true feelings of repulsion and to accept the poverty and despair that he finds every day. On top of all this, there is this volcano always on the verge of erupting and drowning them all in hot lava. But as a true heroine, Bergman revolts against his misery by declaring war on almost everyone else in this grim movie. It even tries to seduce the priest of the village, in a scene that would generate laughter if it was not so pathetic. Since her poor husband must lock her in a room to keep her from running away, she is forced to use her body to bribe a married man to take her off the island. For her, no sacrifice is too great; No man is inaccessible if he is willing to help her escape the island and its misery. I will not bother telling you how it all ends. The end of the movie without script is as plausible as the rest of STROMBOLI. I even remember (to watch it on TV late at night) that had two different endings! So be warned if you should feel brave enough to sit through this king-size turkey and catch the mischievous Bergman. This led to her downfall in Hollywood for the next seven years and she was convicted of sleeping with her director while still married to Peter Lindstrom. None of the movies she did with this director (whom she later married) are noteworthy, except as evidence of a lost career. I'm not kidding with you. It's very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> - SoundTrack
