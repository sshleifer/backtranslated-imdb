I loved the beautiful Greek scenery, but the story, which is not something you can follow anyway, was even harder to keep up with in the movie. I can not imagine how anyone watching the movie might have some kind of control over this if they did not read the book, and then like me, you would probably wonder why the Australian Allison turned into the French Anne and many other seemingly pointless changes in story. story. The mysteries of the book seemed to be cut or sidelined in the film. I saw it when it first came out and had the same problems with it then, since I had read the book several times. I recently watched with my granddaughter (very intelligent at age 20 and usually in movies I like) who was most impressed by how young Michael Caine and Candace Bergen were in it but otherwise could not imagine why anyone would watch except by the scenery.
