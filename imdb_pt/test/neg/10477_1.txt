I saw this DVD for sale and bought it without thinking twice, even though I did not even know it was out, since this is one of my favorite books of all time. As soon as I got home, I ran to watch him just to see me totally disappointed. While it is true that this film is somewhat based on the book, the similarities end there. The characters are altered (that is, Finny seems more of a pompous idiot than anything else while Gene seems to be a hick), scenes are shifted or completely altered (ie. Lepper), many characters are missing and famous lines / thoughts are missing . The movie tries to portray some sense of what the previous one lacked, but it is done in a non-glossy way that makes for a boring boring movie. It is the depth of character and feeling that makes the book a classic and this film takes these things and completely destroys them in its rewriting.
