I do not usually write reviews, but this "movie" was special. I could not hang up. I do not believe I've ever seen a movie worse, but there I sat, watching. It was like a horrible car crash with blood flowing all over the road. It was disgusting, but I could not walk away. Where do I start? The movie seems to think it's a sports thriller, but it's so ridiculous, it can only be a comedy, but it's not funny, not even stupid. It's like watching your cousins ​​try to make a skit at family gatherings. It's painful to watch, but at least it's only for a minute or two. The second rope continued for more than an hour. <br /> <br /> Whoever was involved in making this movie should not work again. The writing, direction, acting and all was simply terrible. The problem is that I can not describe how bad it was; you just had to see. And I'm sure this will never be shown again, so unless you've seen it, you're out of luck. I mean, it was almost worth seeing just for the fact that it gave me some appreciation for all the other "bad" movies I've seen throughout my life. And for every movie I see in the future that I can not stand, I'll think to myself, well, at least it was not bad as the second string.
