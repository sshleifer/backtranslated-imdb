This is defiantly a DVD rental movie. I'm a big fan of cast members, but the story never really got me. Do not expect "Oh brother, where are you" in any way or form. The funniest part, in my opinion, is when the war hero explains what happens in Argon. It looks like they were trying to copy some of Clooney's funny facial expressions of "Oh brother, where are you" but you could tell they were trying for it. John Krasinski was the bright spot and was solid throughout. Renee Zellweger plays a zealous reporter willing to do anything in history. Overall, it's a movie worth seeing at home.
