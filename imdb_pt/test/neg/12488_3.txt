What happened to the RGV? There are so many things wrong about this movie that you have to stop and decide where to start - first and worst - the song. Each scene was accompanied by this pretentious background music that told her the humor, very pathetically, I might add. Second, the lighting - do we really need such dark scenes, where are we wondering if the projector is still working? And finally - if you are going to indianize the godfather and godfather 2 - please realize that many of us have already seen. Nayakan was a ripoff of GF1, but better done and more fun. I have seen a similarity both in the company and in Sarkar and while Ab Tak 56 of the RGV was brilliant, these two movies are not to be desired. People will not be more impressed by corrupt politicians and the batch. Maybe the RGV should see the Maqbool, which is good enough to be a RGV !!
