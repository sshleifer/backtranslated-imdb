Well, I watch tons of movies and this really sucks ... BIG TIME. I'm sure we're all sick and tired of the low-budget stratagem to make vampire movies using some kind of "actor" movie. I'm also so tired of the guy who knows some form of fighting technique and then he's able to fight a rather boring movie. I forced myself to watch and one of the main reasons was that the main actress is quite beautiful (Ha-Ha) Well, I hope this has helped a bit and if you have time and want to give your brain rest. Well, I hope one day this kind of movie will not be released, but then, where are all the actors in the Low Budget :-) <br /> <br /> The movie also contains a lot of Bloops, but I'll let you find out because it adds a bit of fun while watching and also if you a bit of a perfectionist will bother you; -) Cheers !!
