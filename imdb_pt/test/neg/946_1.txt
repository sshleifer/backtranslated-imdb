Synopsis: Kid is not accepted in any college. He creates a "college" where he and his friends can party using their parents' tuition money. <br /> <br /> Wow. A Paean to ignorance. <br /> <br /> If you believe we're all well, man, then this movie is for you. Also, you should understand that: 1. Children have everything inside them - they just have to let it out. <br /> <br /> 2. Teaching really stifles the innate creativity that everyone is born with. <br /> <br /> 3. Someone should pay for you to follow your passion. <br /> <br /> 4. 300 teens can live together in harmony as long as you take these restrictive rules. <br /> <br /> 5. Out-of-date speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation. <br /> <br /> 6. If the Board of Education allows you to open a "charter school" with "non-traditional teaching techniques," it is because they have your best interests at heart. (Not that they are willing to let go of badly-performing students who will anyway end up working with fast food.) <br /> <br /> This film is one of the genres of college comedy, Animal House. It follows the pattern very closely. What is new here, however, is a complete attack on higher education, not a parody of the bad elements. He is missing the nice insider, a teacher who incorporates the important part of college life. <br /> <br /> This lack of balance will condemn this movie to the back row of Blockbuster. It's so one-sided that I wondered if it was an ironic self-reference about the whole genre - for about a minute. The film has no deep meaning, no layers, no introspection. It's as if they let some children who have never been to class do what comes naturally. And what is natural is the name of the school: S ***. <br /> <br /> (I never thought I'd say this: go see something with Will Farrell instead. <br /> <br /> Your comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated.)
