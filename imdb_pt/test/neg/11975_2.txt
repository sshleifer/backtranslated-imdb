Usually I love finding old (and some not so old) westerns that I have not seen, to be the entertainment for the night. It's a great way to sit back, relax and get away from the politics and problems of the world for a few hours. But this was not the case with this version of The Magnificent Seven. The cast and story of this series closely follows the Hollywood formula for politically correct entertainment; good old revisionist history, where the "bad guys" must all be white, men, confederates (in this case) and preferably Christians (if they can somehow be worked out in the script). It's sad. The best movies out there are now and have always been about simply telling a good story on the big screen - not about forwarding someone's political ideology.
