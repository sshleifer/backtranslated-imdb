In the 3rd part of "Left Behind", the creators did not bother to put ANY KIND OF CONTINUITY in the plot. Although all the weapons of the planet have been confiscated by the United Nations, the Third World War suddenly begins with the snap of a finger. In a few seconds, the former lover of one of the main protagonists goes from seductively to seducing him to total hatred to a melancholy confession of love, with no trace of direction. <br /> <br /> But most of all this movie is really an irony-free zone. After the President of the United States accepts Jesus as his savior, he immediately becomes a suicide bomber and explodes a skyscraper in the middle of the city. Osama Bin Laden will be very jealous when he sees this movie!
