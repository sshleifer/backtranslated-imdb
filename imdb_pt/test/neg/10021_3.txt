I think it would have been a more appropriate title for this movie since it is filled to hell and back with pictures of various insects and animals. Recently I found The Prey in its original VHS form and I was very excited. I love finding horror movies on VHS because the cover is fantastic. Usually, however, the movie itself is less than fantastic. The Prey is one of those films. <br /> <br /> To be fair, everything started well, with the killer chasing teenage cliches in the woods. The heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that leaves you tense while watching. This movie is basically a big, fat clich√©, and when the "campfire" section comes in, the movie takes a new direction and spends almost half the execution time on the killer's story. I really thought this was a pretty unique idea. However, the story ends abruptly and shows us some images of a burning forest (the lack of budget really begins to appear now). After that, we are returned to teens being caught in the woods. The killer is not shown until the end, which is a shame because it actually makes an effective killer. Kind of like Cropsy from The Burning, but better. As for blood, there is not much, although there is a crushing moment at the end. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone other than slasher experts - it's really a big mess.
