There is something intriguing about disaster movies. The simple and primitive premise can lead to several great stories. Granted, most disaster movies tend to explore familiar territory, but I usually can live with it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Flood probably marks the low point in the history of this subgenre. Robert Carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the film, although the length of the show is divided between different venues and characters. It gives almost decent performance. Also, Joanne Whalley is very uneven. Veteran actor Tom Courtenay (he played Doctor Jivago for the love of God) is particularly bad. I mean, his time is completely off most of the time and his characterization is extremely poor. What an embarrassing performance for that man. The rest of the cast ranges from decent to very bad with one exception: Jessalyn Gilsig, whom I thought could be there as a plot / eye candy device gives by far the most convincing performance. It does not mean much considering how bad everyone is, but it's still good to see that she cared. <br /> <br /> The script is very bad, confusing and clich√©. Some of the worst lines I've heard in a while are being broadcast by the actors one after the other. You've seen this story a thousand times. He employs all the dramatic shots you've seen in "Outbreak," "Armageddon," the Poseidon movies (original and remake) and many others. <br /> <br /> The direction is horrible. No sense of time, nothing inspired. Photos are bland, dialogue and action do not flow. Editing is bad, but how do you edit this mess? Undoubtedly, this movie tried to rely too much on CGI (rather poor). The human factor, the drama and the character struggles are covered up. Scenes where the characters really must face the flood are rare and poorly made. The touch made for the TV gives nausea. Should some guy get down a rope from a helicopter? No problem, we'll show him inside a helicopter and do a very bad cut / edit job and have the next frame with him safely on the floor in the most obvious way possible. <br /> <br /> The result of the film is rather poor. All over the place, no time. <br /> <br /> The ending is probably the worst I've seen in a while. Much like them they ran out of ideas. Scrap this, you can not run out of something if you've never had it in the first place. He must have run out of money. <br /> <br /> This is a really amateurish work. I give 2 to use London as a venue, which is a nice change, for Gilsig being really decent in a key support role and for the few CGI images that were decent (those of London closing water and the gates) Do yourself a favor and check out Day After Tomorrow or just about any catastrophe movie before this one. This includes older classics, such as Tower Inferno.
