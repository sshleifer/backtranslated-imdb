Wow!! This movie is almost too bad for words. Obviously the writers wanted to somehow link this to the Ghoulies franchise, so they caught Pete Liapis from the first to reprise his role as Jonathan ... only now, he's a cop and has no character traits similar to the first. . The ghoulies in this are not the last ghoulies. The cheap-looking dolls have been replaced by people with even fancier costumes. Instead of being a main antagonist or being evil, they are more like the comic characters of relief that have come out of nowhere for no reason. <br /> <br /> When I first watched this movie, it seemed like I've seen it before. Why that? Because all this was stolen from another movie. All the police scenes and action scenes were from Lethal Weapon. The ghoulies were very similar to Bugs and Dwarfs, except they were not fun at all. Even scenes from the original Ghoulies movie were scattered throughout this film. <br /> <br /> I think the target audience should be adults, but the mix of black magic, cartoon clowning, police drama and bad acting does not work at all. I hope they do not make a V Ghoulies because I do not want a movie studio to waste their money. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 78 min. R for violence.
