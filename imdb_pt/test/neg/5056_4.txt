History teacher, Mrs. Tingle, seems to have received student Leigh Ann Watson, who is pursuing a scholarship for the writing school. She gets another low grade from Tingle, which does not help. When one of her classmates Luke steals the role of the final exams and puts it in her bag, Mrs. Tingle realizes she's leaving. She threatens the three that she goes to the director about this, but he is not available. So, before she reports the next morning. Leigh, her friend Jo Lynn and Scott go to their place that night and try to persuade her not to tell the director. However, due to Tingle's stubbornness, they found themselves reverting to drastic measures to prevent this from happening. <br /> <br /> I was not a fan of this when I first saw him, and after another remark, I'm still not one of them. . Writer Kevin Williamson was on a roll after pawning the horror films of contemporary teen success; 'Scream (1996)', 'I know what you did last summer (1997)', 'Scream 2 (1997)' and 'The Faculty (1998)'. He was building success (not to forget the Dawson's Creek TV show), but this project would be the last hurdle. The difference there, compared to this entry, was another that after writing the script, he was also making his directorial debut. But the strangest thing was that I thought his direction was competently done, but the material he invaded was tasteless and tired. He seemed to be caught playing a comedy of dark humor and a direct, non-gel thriller. The script is filled with quick, trivial jokes, trivial passages, and references to other films, but the problem is that it is very diluted with so many artificial developments and moral currents that it spoils the flow. The fractured script had to be stronger and potent since it's a small-scale production that looks like you're attending a stage show because of your more confined sets. He tries to play mental games with the characters, but these moments serve only for the poor progression of history in a pool of stupidity and folly. The end of the movie takes the cake. Williamson's polished direction is solid, but still more pedestrian, and therefore lacking in suspense and the pace, even with its tense environment, can really creep. You end up feeling halfway there, and that shows how small the story is. The performances are quite tolerable, although, were it not for Helen Mirren's elegant and cool portrayal of manipulative skill like Mrs. Tingle and a floating Marisa Coughlan, we would be stuck with an insipid Katie Holmes. Barry Watson is modest in his laziest part and Molly Ringwald plays a minor role. The soundtrack contains enough energy, but I find it terribly exaggerated and misshapen in its choices. <br /> <br /> Watchable, but mechanical in all respects.
