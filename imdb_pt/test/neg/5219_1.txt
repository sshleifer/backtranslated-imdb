Okay, Chuck Norris has appeared in many entertaining movies over the years. This is not one of them. I will not even bother trying to get into the plot about a bible shipment that went awry. The "acting" of the main characters is as wood as, Pinocchio would have done a better job! The soundtrack of the synthesizer is even worse than that of Deathstalker. While traditionally low-budget scary movies often try to capture their audience by adding a lot of graphic violence, this is trying to catch an audience by playing religious jumbo mambo at the viewer. The plot comes down to different versions of the Bible.
