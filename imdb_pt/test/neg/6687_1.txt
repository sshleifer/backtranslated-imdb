Seriously, I could not find anything that constituted rational human thought in this film. For some reason, the writer decided to have a lot of actors in random places grunting, crawling and screaming like Cro-Magnon bipedal. I understand this was about gymnastics, but seriously, with the human roar and bleat? I also saw at least five actors with hyperactive terrets syndrome and syphilis stage 10. <br /> <br /> Although this movie has real human acrobatics, I must say that it is surprising that you can make a film like this without having any intelligible. form of human speech patterns. This really is a milestone in film history because there has not been a conscious decision to make the characters express something more than an urgent Urrrrr! or Rfff! sound. <br /> <br /> Incredible.
