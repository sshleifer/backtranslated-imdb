I lasted almost ninety minutes through this terrible movie waiting for some revelation about dance or spirit or inspiration or something and I gave up! What did filmmakers have to do that? This is an old woman of limited talent who is obsessed with herself and nothing more. To fill a story without a point, we have a few things about other people in their slavery, their help for donkeys and, of course, their ten cats! I do not see this movie. And you have nothing to do with the one you loved - they have no idea. There are fascinating people in this world with wonderful stories to tell and ideas to share - but Marta Becket is not one of them. The people I took to this movie say they forgave me - but they will never stop playing with me about it.
