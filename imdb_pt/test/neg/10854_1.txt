Well, I went to a British university, actually I went to the one in this movie, and it was not any of that. This is a horrible movie, badly made and acted. The worst thing is that it could have been very good, if they bothered to spend more than 12p, in fact, if they really wanted to represent the real British students, they should act like they were one and get a Â£ 15,000 loan. It says nothing about Uni life, where the dive was in the woods, the tea to drink until 4 in the morning, the endless conversations about group dynamics ??? Where was the diversity and fun? Maybe I'm just being romantic, but I do not remember Fresher Week being so awful and I'm abstemious. And in the end the question still remains ... a bed or a wardrobe?
