One of the biggest lessons I've ever had about watching a movie happened this way: I was working in the offices of Roger Corman, like so many other wanabees before and after, I was doing internships and trying to understand how everything worked and how to become indispensable ( hah!). One afternoon, Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and producer, asked me to carry a tape. I do not know why she wanted to watch. I got the impression it was a student movie or a coil show, something like that, some kind of business card. Whatever the reasons she had to see, the only free video machine in the office at the time was in the room I was working in, and I was the closest person to the machine. I started the tape. <br /> <br /> Fade in: On the screen a figure sat on a table facing the camera. Behind him, the screen to the left, was a door that opened into the bedroom. Against the opposite wall was a hanger. A second character entered the door and began to speak. The first character, the guy at the front desk, turned to answer, (this is all a take, static camera, no cutlery pans or dolly shots. Just one locked out of the camera). The second character turned to hang his coat on the hanger and handed over his next line. Julie Corman said "I've seen enough." And left the room. <br /> <br /> What she saw in the ten seconds of filming she watched was that the director was an idiot. Opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs to the camera delivering lines? Do not apologize. Next! It's how much time you have. Ten seconds. Arm him in the opening shot and you're dead. <br /> <br /> I remembered that moment as I watched the opening of this piece of garbage. After a long period of endless jungle travel, we see several monkeys seemingly throwing themselves into cages. A man carrying a gun laughs. A jet lands and we see him taxiing all the way to the terminal. God, this is annoying! Cut to the interior of the airport. Two men meet. Aha! Something is happening! They shake hands. Cut to a different angle of the two men - and the director crosses the line. <br /> <br /> The first two planes of the movie that have some sort of spatial relationship with each of them. <br /> <br /> another and the guy got up. 'Not Crossing The Line' is one of the basic rules of grammar that prevents characters from jumping back and forth on the screen and confusing the audience. The public does not like to be confused. Mystic? Confused? Intrigued and intrigued? Yes. The public loves it all. Confused? No. You let them go. They leave. 'Not Crossing The Line' is one of those things that you hit at film school, or should. It's a basic thing. It is not an inviolable rule (there are no inviolable rules) the directors break all the time - but not in the first real cut of the film. <br /> <br /> I thought, "I've seen enough." And off.
