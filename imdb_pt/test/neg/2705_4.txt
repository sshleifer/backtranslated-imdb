I like Errol Flynn; I like biographies and I like action movies. That showed all three ... but I did not like that movie. It lasted a long time, although the last 20 minutes have been excellent, especially in photography with great low angle photos. However, it seemed like it took me six hours to get to that point, and I really can not say why I feel that way. <br /> <br /> The action is interesting, Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland are fine. In fact, it was comforting to see De Havilland actually supporting Flynn instead of his normal role as antagonist to him. However, something is missing in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has been criticized for its historical inaccuracy, but I do not hear the same criticism for many other films that did the same. In fact, it's rare when a film is historically accurate. For some reason, this revisionist story offended most critics. If the movie had made General Custer much worse than he really was, he would probably have liked it. Well, very bad. In a distorted way, critics prefer villains to heroes. <br /> <br /> I really wish I had enjoyed it more, but I'm going to take a lot of other Flynn adventures.
