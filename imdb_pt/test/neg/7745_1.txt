In 1990, I saw Kathy Ireland in person - I was at the UNT in Denton during the filming of "Necessary Roughness". Strangely, the voice she is using in this movie is not far from her spoken voice. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot is like this: Kathy receives a letter saying that her father is bottomless pit in Africa. She goes and investigates the location of her father's death, only to be sucked into an underground world that is part of the dystopian nightmare, uninspired fantasy part, and inhabited by Plasmatics rejects. This movie really misses the talents of Linda Kerridge, who, in my opinion, could have been someone if she had gotten that great role that was right for her. Anyway, the main hero in the story, Gus, is a lousy Mark "Jacko" Jackson. The original is annoying enough to begin with, but this guy really is a torture to watch. Eventually the misty Wanda comes out of her shell and ends up wearing a bikini top and a sarong at the end. If you're going to have Kathy Ireland in a movie in tiny clothes, it better be a bikini. Anyway, the movie was all bad and just stuck by MST3K. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if possible.
