Anyone else think "Reba" is basically an imitation of "Roseanne"? Just look at the characters of the two families, Connors (Roseanne) and Harts (Reba); the older daughter (Becky Connor and Cheyenne Hart) who is married to an idiot (Mark Healy and Van Montgomery), the sarcastic younger daughter (Darlene Connor and Kyra Hart), the younger brother (DJ Connor and Jake Hart) , and the peculiar relative (Jackie Connor and Barbara-Jean Booker Hart). <br /> <br /> And of course there is the greatest likeness, Reba Hart and Roseanne Connor. "Reba" tried to copy her sarcastic and tough-looking mother without giving her the kind qualities that Roseanne had. Or perhaps they made her * very * lovely, for Reba Hart seems to hesitate between being mean and scary (hence Van's line to his wife Cheyenne "I'm not afraid of you, I'm afraid of your mother!") And being sweet and affectionate with little transition in the middle. Roseanne could at least understand that she was being cruel to be kind, since she was always mean and sarcastic, and whenever she tried to open up, it was difficult for her. As inconsistent as Reba's character is, it is difficult for her to be credible. <br /> <br /> But even if the characters were not completely stolen from "Roseanne", nothing could have saved the show from being insignificant in the plot area. The writers try to give substance to the show, but they really can not let go of the cheesy jokes enough to make any impact. And you better believe that jokes are cheesy; it's as if they were written by a twelve-year-old who thinks any joke is hilarious. Although occasionally they go out with something that is funny (I do not pretend I have not laughed at a few episodes) these gems are very few between making "Reba" witty. Overall, "Reba" is a very mediocre show, with obvious copies of "Roseanne", sub-par plots and sub-sub-par humor, and (let's face it) terrible acting. The show may be a bit better, in fact, if they replace all the actors, especially Reba herself, who has more community theater quality than the quality of prime-time sitcoms. <br /> <br /> I give him 3 out of 10 just to be fair with the good jokes that make it happen.
