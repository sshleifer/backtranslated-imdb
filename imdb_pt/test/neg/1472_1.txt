I usually enjoy underground movies and anti-heroes, but this is a bad joke. I wonder how this can be called a movie. All these people are losers and the filmmaker can not make them interesting. They are not funny or tragic, just stupid and boring. <br /> <br /> I may have missed something, but I will not watch it again to find out what. Anyone with a camcorder can do better than this ... <br /> <br /> I give the note 1 for originality. Everything else sucks.
