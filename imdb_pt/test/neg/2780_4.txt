Dark Harvest is a very low budget production made by a group of rank amateurs who manages to emerge as a sort of semi-professional film. Unfortunately poor effects, wood acting and unoriginal story make it a very mediocre horror slasher at best. By no means is Dark Harvest the worst horror movie I've ever seen, it's nothing special and has nothing to guarantee a second watch or the hope of a sequel. You know a director has doubts about his own horror movie when a) there is some pointless nudity and b) the movie is so short that they add some credits to the final credits that no one cares about because the movie was not that good! A slightly better film than I can not help feeling was the inspiration for Dark Harvest is the eighties movie 'Scarecrows', which is an OK movie, but still quite average. <br /> <br /> Dark Harvest is not as bad as some of the other reviews say it is, but do not think you'll have too much fun too. One thing I also have to comment on is the Angela character who has a really terrible English accent! What was the point of that ?! To maybe give a touch of class? Okay, right! English people do not say "WAAHTAAH" when they want to say "water" and I do not care what part of England they are! If you can not find a genuine English actress or a non-English actress who can put on a glossy English accent (there are not too many of them) then DO NOT BOTHER ME! Sheesh! Final Score: 4/10
