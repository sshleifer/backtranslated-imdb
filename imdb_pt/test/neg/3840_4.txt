Like most people watching this movie, I did it for the stars Michael Madsen and Dennis Hopper. Both are extremely underestimated and, unfortunately, because of this, have to head much crap. In this film, Hopper plays a guy who accidentally kills a blackmailer and gets help from the mysterious Madsen. <br /> <br /> The movie is not really as terrible as it could have been. I've seen the two in much worse, both independently and working together (LAPD, horrible movie). The direction was very poor and the script needed some rewrites, but both gave the best possible performance with the material offered. Also the ending is quite strong, so you can tell that the story had potential. But when a brilliant review of a movie is, "It could have been much worse," it does not say much about the movie itself. <br /> <br /> In short, this is one that can be easily ignored. if none of these actors attracts you. But if you are a fan of one or both, give it a watch. Both give strong performances that obfuscate the obvious flaws of the film. Trust me, there are far worse options out there.
