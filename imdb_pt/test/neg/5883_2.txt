I was hoping for this to be hilarious and was mediocre at best, the only funny character is, believe it or not, Andy Dick. The timing was just awful on most of the jokes and gags and the writing was bad, I mean, I know it's supposed to be like blaxploitation but it just worked. plus all this genre has already been beaten to death, with all Austin Powers & Brother movies in disguise, it looks old, but it also seems like a brother robbery in disguise (which was also not hysterical, but much funnier than that). Also, for a comedy / action movie, the direction was kind of bland. I do not know if this is going to be released in theaters, but it's definitely made for TV.
