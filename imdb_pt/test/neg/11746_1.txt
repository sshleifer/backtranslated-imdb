OK, first of all, who in their right mind would remake Hitchcock and second, who would give the shot? I admit I had no intention of watching this movie for that very reason. The original Psycho is one of my all-time favorite movies and it just seemed like a degrading photocopy of it. I watched because my girlfriend wanted to compare him to the original and we both agreed in less than five minutes to that crap that was horrible. First, as mentioned, they did it for shooting. Where is the originality? Why redo a movie that is almost perfect EXACTLY the way it was done the first time? Why redo such a movie to begin with? If you are going to redo something, redo something that does not work and make it better! <br /> <br /> Second, they used the same script as the 1960 version. The dialog box no longer works. It works well and looks perfect for the 1960s version, but it looks weird and flamboyant coming out of modern actors. Why not update the dialog? Hitch did not write the script, you could have rewritten it. <br /> <br /> This film had a very good talent and was wasted by the imitation of the original actors. The actor who played the car salesman looked like he was playing the performance of John Anderson as a car salesman in the original. All the actors seemed that the only direction they received was the characters from the original film. Vince Vaughn may have looked a little more chilling than Anthony Perkins, but in doing so, you lose the sympathy you should have for Norman. Having Norman masturbate while watching Marion undressing was going too far and lost the innocence of the character that I think Tony Perkins captured so well in his performance. Viggo Mortensen's accent was annoying and Rita Wilson was too old to play Caroline. Her lines seemed more desperate than just young and fun like Patricia Hitchcock's performance. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I saw about the movie was that Gus Van Sant was able to open the movie with the shot that Hitch had imagined. Hitch wanted to open with a long shot passing through Phoenix but could not at the time, so he had to settle for a series of crusader shots dissolved together. This movie fulfilled that vision with a helicopter shot going to the hotel window. After that, although the film became a useless waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> If you are curious about how to destroy a wonderful movie, watch this, but do not under any circumstances watch it before you see the original. This is a faded photocopy of the original and should never have been lit green. Stick to the master's movie, not imitation.
