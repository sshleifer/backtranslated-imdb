Just a few words: it's a good thing George A Romero is still among us because if he were dead, he would be forced to rise from the grave to vote against the people who made this 'political satire'. And the saddest of all is that I really agree with the feelings of these people. Yes, there are zombies and they have a good reason to come back from beyond: to vote. Oh, and one of them ends with the Doctor of the Startrek Voyager. This is as scary as it can be, people. If you're looking for a horror movie, I suggest you keep looking. And if you are looking for a witty political satire, you are also in the wrong place and not just because this series is called Masters of Horror. But do not let me hold you: maybe you'll see something I missed. Although the chances are that you will be wasting your time with this as well as I have. Let's just say that I prefer my zombie movies with the zombies standing in the camera frond.
