Ruggero Deodato is often credited for inventing the cannibal subgenre with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST in 1975. But director Umberto Lenzi, generally acknowledged as a Deodato idiot, directed THE MAN FROM DEEP RIVER 3 years earlier in 1972. It's a decent start for the genre ? ? Well ... it's not really ..... <br /> <br /> A photographer accidentally kills a man in self-defense and, while retreating into the jungles of an Asian country, is captured by a native tribe who secure captive, force him to slave labor and eventually accept him when he marries the boss's daughter. Throughout the movie, I've never felt like this was a horror movie. It was more reminiscent of a drama, like A MAN CALLED HORSE, which I liked better. Ivan Rassimov is very good as a photographer, but it is Me Me Lai the boss's daughter who is both memorable and great. I've always been a fan of Me Me Lai since her breathtaking performance in JUNGLE HOLOCAUST and she is never credited for her acting skills because she barely talks about her movies. She is still very talented and charming. Much actual animal mutilation is the only thing about DEEP RIVER that could make it a horror movie, but even this does not perform well. THE MAN OF THE DEEP RIVER is good to see for those who want to see what started the cannibal subgenre, but as an entry into the genre, it is easily eclipsed by the entries of Deodato and even by the later entries of Lenzi . Recommended only for finalists and fans of Me Me Lai.
