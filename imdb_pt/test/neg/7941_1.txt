The original "Assault on Precinct 13" is gritty, witty and - perhaps most importantly - short. This remake is mercilessly filled and talky. Worst of all, the African-American hero of the first film is replaced here by the handsome white boy Ethan Hawke, who makes this "assault" less progressive than the 1970s. God, how I miss John Carpenter and his unlikely plot and his weird sense of humor. I even miss the B-list actors, who are better than Hawke and company. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I care about the new villains in this version - they extend the little credibility that history has ever had to the limit. The female characters are useless, the criminals are all generic chapters and Gabriel Byrne gives another of his bored performances. The music is all wrong too - it's a dull thing that really lowers the tension. Simply awful.
