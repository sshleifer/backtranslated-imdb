This was Chan's first film made by Monogram. What comes from the values ​​and standards of Fox! I was shocked when I saw my first monogram after watching the big Fox movies. This is boring and uninspired, with wild music playing as Chan walks quietly down the street. Chan is now working for the US Secret Service, not for the Honolulu Police Department. He is assisted by Benson Fong, who plays the third son, Tommy, for the first time. He also has a daughter, Iris Chan, played by Marianne Quon. Mantan Moreland also makes his debut as Birmingham Brown. He is a cab driver in Washington, DC, here instead of Chan's last driver in later films.
