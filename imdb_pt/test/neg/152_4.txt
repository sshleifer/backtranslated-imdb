Frankie Muniz plays Jason, who is a high school student. His biggest problem is that his life is based on small or big lies that put him in trouble most of the time. However, he can not escape his teacher and he finishes his creative writing task before its deadline. While he is pedaling fast to deliver his homework to the teacher, he crushes himself in a car. As he explains the situation to the grumpy man (Giamatti) in the car, he gives him a ride to his school. But the problem is that Jason leaves his homework in the car, the other way to say it is Marty Wolf (Giamatti) steals. <br /> <br /> After a few months, Jason goes to the movies and sees a trailer that takes him in surprise. Because the story of the movie is based on your homework. He tells this to his parents, but of course they do not believe him. Especially his father uses words that insult him. Jason decides to go to LA and find Wolf to tell his father that Jason is not a liar. When Wolf refuses, Jason takes action and destroys his life. <br /> <br /> This is the tale of the Big Fat Liar. Well, as a children's movie might be a little light, but there are some mistakes that might even ask if this is possible. Like, have such a small amount of money and go to Los Angeles with a friend to solve the problem, have access to the highly protected home and office of this film producer, creating a telecommunications system overnight. Does it seem believable? Not that. Well, this is a kid's movie, but kids are not that naive. <br /> <br /> Big Fat Liar offers a little pleasure to your target audience. Unfortunately, I'm not a big liar to say that this is a good movie. ** outside of *****
