This movie was Flippin Awful .... I wanted those hours of my life back. For the love of God, stay away from this horrible movie of balls at all costs. Not worth mentioning the title, but the ratings in this movie are quite generous for a vomit movie like this. And where do I start? The dumb A ** children in the movie ..... The zero plot or story? ... the garden-variety college / frat boy-esque scenes of towel tapas? Or the insinuation of teen angst really bad? $$$ # @% @! My God, it's NEVER over! ..... I remember thinking that I would have preferred to kiss the movie floor, and then sit back. <br /> <br /> But what do you expect? Most people with the power of the brain to search for reviews, will not be the target audience here - then SEE THE Pyrite 2 again, or Jet Lee, - if you are debating with yourself. Look, this movie will cost you your soul, your money, your energy and your brain cells. He sharpened the warning.
