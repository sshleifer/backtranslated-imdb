I'm working on the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and THE MAD MONSTER is one of the set movies. <br /> <br /> I'm sure George Zucco was a good actor; but this was only the second film I saw him, being the first DEAD MEN WALK, in which he played two parts. However, even good acting could not save the MAD AMOUNT. <br /> <br /> Zucco plays a mad scientist, Dr. Cameron (who was banned from academia because of his unethical and inhumane experiences). He believes he can control evolution by bringing the characteristics of one animal to another. <br /> <br /> In this case, like many others of its kind, it is a transfusion of (I suppose) wolf blood into humans. His goal is to create an invincible army, which he can control through the antidote. The subject of his experiments is his servant, a retarded gardener, whose dialogue slows down this classic with a snail's pace to almost an end point. <br /> <br /> In addition to his experiments, Dr. Cameron also plans to take revenge on those who discredited him by using his transformed gardener. However, he loses control of his subject, which begins to transform without the transfusion - yikes! <br /> <br /> Werewolf transformations are classic Hollywood action / makeup effects. Undoubtedly, these were innovative techniques of the time; but in today's digital age, it's hard to imagine the audience scared of it.
