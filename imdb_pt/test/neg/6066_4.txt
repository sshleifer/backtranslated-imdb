I am the only person who has seen and remembers Amadeus. Each "Copy" scene has its counterpart in Milos Forman, Amadeus - from the galloping carriages accompanied by frantic ropes, to Anna's entrance through the dark corridor preceded by the man with the key, to the very dialogue of completion with Anna at the feet from Beethoven to la Salieri before the dying Mozart. No one else remembers the dialogue in this script: Salieri "Time?" , Mozart "common time". ..... "We start with the strings ..." and then "copy". <br /> <br /> Remember Cynthia Nixon leaning against the door, tears falling on the freckled face - the same scene, just replace it with Beethoven's nephew. Even the eschatological humor (fart jokes) is the same. We even have a cardinal followed by a plate of sweet biscuits that reminds Salieri in the banquet hall. Does anyone else remember? ! <br /> <br /> And the scene where Anna cries to God "Why did you give me this gift?" ... Salieri said the same thing! <br /> <br /> And besides all that we have a youthful script with an opening exhibit that looks like the character IDs that you would find in a children's story. "I am Mr. Beethoven. I am the composer ..." And what, after all, is the purpose of the bridge builder? In addition to juxtaposing the technician against the artistic ... a comparison that is not fully developed - probably because it makes no sense, especially when it comes to Beethove, who was a master of the technician. <br /> <br /> There's only one big scene - the ninth game. First, music, which alone leads you to tears. But then there is the highly erotic interaction of Anna, the copyist, keeping time and leading Beethoven, who transcends the more explicit sexual intimacy. So intense, it's almost embarrassing. <br /> But, please - the rest of the movie - Where is the collective memory of the world? You've seen this before ... and better!
