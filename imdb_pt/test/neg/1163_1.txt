All the great horror films from the '70s,' 80s, and 'til the early' 90s, from Psycho to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Silence of the Lambs. The characters in these films were based on the crimes of Ed Gein. The writers and directors harnessed the true story for the inspiration of creating some of the greatest * fictional movie killers * of all time. The old horror movies were great because, although the crimes were loosely based on The Facts of Ed Gein's case, they were really fictional and far removed from the true story. <br /> <br /> In the case of this film, they created a fictional horror film in which they tried to capitalize. about the true story in order to sell a cheap, misinterpreted love story between two characters that no one really cares about. In fact, in a * good * horror movie these two characters would have been excellent victims. <br /> <br /> End of the Lecture ... <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was like wearing underwear on a cold afternoon taking a good cup of cold vomit.
