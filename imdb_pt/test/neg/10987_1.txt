I hated it. I hate self-conscious pretentious inanity that disguises itself as art. This movie is stupidly insane or totally stupid. After the first half hour, I quickly went through the DVD version and saw the same juvenile shennanigans over and over again. I was annoyed that I had spent money sweating with a palpable trap. Tinting drivel in sepia or blue does not make something a movie, let alone art.
