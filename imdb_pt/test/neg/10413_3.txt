Jim Lonely is like a romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two boys are total losers. Both boys are about 30 years old, living at home with absolutely nothing for them. I live in the Midwest and I can not name a family like that. I got it because I like Buscemi acting humor. Now I realize that I need a neutralizing agent for this mood to work. The acting, camera work and editing were fine. The first 15 minutes made you prepare, and the last 15 minutes helped prevent the movie from being totally depressing with the kind of Jerry Springer trailer story. The women in my family were asking me to hang up, but I prevailed under the premise that there had to be a turning point near the end, and we watched the whole movie. The male members of the family, as expected, simply left after the first 30 minutes.
