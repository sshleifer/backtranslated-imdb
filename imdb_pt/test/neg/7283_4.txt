HANA-BI has many moments of tranquility and a rather slow pace. Unfortunately, during the many thoughtful interludes, the viewer is left to reflect on the recent scenes they have just watched and many issues arise and bother. For example, why did not the guy in the wheelchair drown in the ocean when he was stuck in the sand and the tide went up around him? There was no rescue seen or insinuated. <br /> <br /> Can it be true that the Japanese police are so inept and awkward in detention proceedings that it does not first remove the suspect's ability to pick up a weapon? These detective-level Japanese officers seemed to have no experience of dealing with a suspect. <br /> <br /> Why does not the main character's right eye blink? Having a blinking eye distracted and was inexplicable. <br /> <br /> What exactly did the main character spend all his money to have to borrow so much from moneylenders? He was not seen playing. Being a government employee who is not entry-level, your spouse should have complete health insurance. <br /> <br /> What was the single man doing everything alone in the middle of nowhere in the natural park? What was the reason he was there? <br /> <br /> How could the gangsters find the main character and his wife in the distant nature reserve? It did not make sense. <br /> <br /> And again, as the thugs could later find the main character and his wife on the remote mount. Fuji resort? There was absolutely no clue available to these gangsters to know in which country the main character and his wife were, let alone the correct specific location at the correct specific time! <br /> <br /> And a third question, how? Could junior detectives know that a few feet from the Japanese coast line they would find the main character and his wife? The Japanese coast line should be vast. Would all these characters have psychic powers? <br /> <br /> Two final questions: The beautiful girl trying to fly a kite on the beach - where did she come from? She seemed to have no transportation or company with her. And why in the world does she still keep trying to fly what's left of her kite after she was ripped to pieces? That was weird. Without Python-esque intent. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I loved the background music. It was dramatic and fluent and added a lot to this movie. Photography, imagery, and art were pleasing to the eye. <br /> <br /> One last point, the wife was extremely pleasing to the eye. Not once did he come close to looking like a sick and sick person. She looked very healthy. If anything, these people seemed depressed and mentally sick and not physically sick. The husband treated his wife as if a newly departed gay man could treat a respected wife-a love of friendship, but not an intimate tenderness. <br /> <br /> A mixed movie, for sure.
