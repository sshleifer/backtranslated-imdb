Well, they sent it on TV between midnight and 2:00 in the morning - it seems like the right time to watch it, and then go to bed later ... No, I was not really living to my expectations. I think the concept of Dogma is good because the film approaches what is really happening between the characters involved when you cut out all the unnecessary effects and the music that does it. But again, this concept requires some interesting action between the characters. <br /> <br /> I can not say, that I know King Lear (Shakespeare's version) very well, if I had known the play, I probably would have been able to predict much of the film. <br /> <br /> Well, a crisis can bring the best and worst sides of a character on display - and we certainly see some bad sides. Ah yes, the painting of civilization and culture can be very fine, and behind that ink you can find an animal. <br /> <br /> If you compare with "Italiensk for begyndere" (Italian for beginners) or "Mifunes sidste sang" (the last song of Mifune), you see the same, but the opposite: a crisis can certainly lead people to see their life in a more constructive way. And if you dare, you can win. <br /> <br /> When the movie ended, I thought to myself, "Oh, that's why I have not seen this before ..." The movie has its own beauty. The quality of the cameraman's work, actors, etc. is good. But the script may need something more. A plot might not hurt.
