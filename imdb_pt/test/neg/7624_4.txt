After his success with A Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984, director Wes Craven for some reason decided that his next project would be this TV movie. I'm not a big fan of this director overall; The Last House on the Left, as well as his modern slasher, Scream, feels good to me, but the rest of his work is very hard to get right on, and I would hesitate to call him the master that others labeled him. The main theme here is cryogenic freezing, although it's more of a stepping stone to the plot than an important part of the movie. The main influence here is obviously the great 1974 film, Deathdream, and we focus on Miles Creighton; a businessman cryogenically frozen for ten years before an accident, which means that it should be thawed immediately. Miles is part of a project for people who are sick; they pay to be frozen in the hope that they will be revived in the future when their illnesses can be cured. Miles is revived successfully and is seen as a miracle ... but the person who wakes up is not the person who was frozen, as Miles returns without a soul. <br /> <br /> This movie could really have been pretty decent. judging by the idea behind it, but instead we have a plot that does not really have much to do and it has to be said that Craven does not get the best out of the movie's potential. The "soul" is the main focal point, but it seems that not having a soul and simply having a killer intent / without compassion are the same thing, which seems a little unimaginative. The film was made for television, so it is not particularly unpleasant and it is obvious that not much money was spent on the whole production. Michael Beck has never become a very popular actor and this is not surprising to judge by his performance here; while it is passable, largely lacks charisma and is not formidable in the central role. The plot does not flow very badly but there is a real lack of suspense and / or tension and things slow down too often, which results in the movie being quite boring on some occasions. It all boils down to a predictable end as well. Overall, I have to admit that I was not impressed with the film, and as far as Craven's filmography was concerned, Chiller would have to face Shocker, the Scream sequences and The Hills Have Eyes II as a foul.
