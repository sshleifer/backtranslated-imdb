Life is too short to squander in two hours of Hollywood nonsense like this unless you're a naive, naive 16-year-old girl with no sense of reality and nothing better to do. Dull characters, poor acting (artificial emotion), weak history, slow rhythm and, most importantly for this film, existence failed - no one cares about the overly dramatic relationship.
