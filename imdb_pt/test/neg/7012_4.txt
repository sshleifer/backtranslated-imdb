Well, in all honesty is beyond the limits of stupidity, but "Killer Pussy" is still an insanely funny little movie. No plot, tons of oiled cha-chas, cheese effects, and a monster eating penis! What is not to love?! Pretty much - a couple of explorers find this creature that likes to nest inside the curtains of a woman's flesh until a schwang is unfortunately ... ah, thrust into his mouth. He discovers that he is the host who is later found frozen in a house abandoned by a group of idiot guys and their vagabond girlfriends, equally brainless, whose van is undone. The creature jumps from each girl while they all fake themselves like drunken rabbits ... There's cheap blood, a "girl's blood fight," a vomit of KY Jelly, puppet monsters and lots of soft-core sex. Ridiculous, but a waste of time ...
