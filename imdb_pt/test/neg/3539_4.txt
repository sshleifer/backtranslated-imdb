A 1995 Wes Craven presents, directed by Joe Clayton and starring Lance Henriksen. A group of scientists saves a dying man they meet at their outpost in the desert, injecting their experimental virus into it, of course, one of their colleagues exaggerates and the virus turns the man into an almost unstoppable monster they trapped inside. Lance Henriksen portrays the morally offended researcher who leaves the project before all of this, but returns after receiving a call for help to save man (death machine pre-unstoppable mutation). <br /> <br /> Deciding to combine two trips into one he brings his family along with him (they are going on holiday afterwards) and proceeds to give them entrance to the top secret government facility, thus putting them in the middle of the chaos inside. In case you can not tell, it depends on the viewer to work a little with it and leave aside some small details (see: bigger and more obvious). <br /> <br /> In general: Watch with light pieces of pleasure. Note: Outpost is commonly known under the heading 'Mind Ripper'
