I'll give this a try. He tried to make it look good and even involved Luke Wilson. Luke Wilson is good, but he can only do so much. He can not compensate for the fact that the story was very flawed and the characters were underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> The "gag" with the bully was asinine. He was never funny and I got tired of the gag too fast. And the barefoot boy was a bit weak too. He took a ride in Florida? Yes, OK. <br /> <br /> The film looked like an ordinary children's movie, sometimes with this mantra to underline: stupid adults, smart kids. And that bit is tiring. <br /> <br /> But the only moments that were funny were the police car that Wilson drove when he lost his patrol car. I loved that stroller, especially when Wilson turned on the sirens. But besides, nothing was worth it. "D-"
