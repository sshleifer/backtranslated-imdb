Ever had one of those sneezing that seems to last forever? You choke and convulse and pick up the nearest paper product in preparation for the largest tissue paper in the world ... and then fail. "Frankenhooker" was the cinematic equivalent of this lost sneeze. Now, I'm big on B movies, and I always look the other way when a boom microphone pops up on the screen or an actor speaks his lines with all the enthusiasm of Gerald Ford, but this one really blew me away. The cover of the video, for example, is the slogan of the whole movie. Using parts of murderous prostitutes in New York, Dr. Franken rebuilds his deceased fiancee, only to have her out of control in Manhattan as a kind of superprostitute with a bad attitude. After an hour and a half of accumulation, those ten minutes, quite funny, seemed a bit anticlithic.
