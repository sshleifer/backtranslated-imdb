I really will not waste my time with a thorough analysis, I'll just say that I'm extremely disappointed that Catherine Zeta-Jones has made the mistake of being in the lead role in this absurd, meaningless, in this boring full of clich√©s until unthinking death pathetic attempt at cinema! There is no sense in trying to find the positive sides to this movie, because as a whole it is bad in every respect, and the saddest thing is that Zeta-Jones is dragged so uncompromisingly into the cliches that she has absolutely no chance. to show up to 1% of your talent! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie even with the opportunity to spend the night at home starring at the wall !!!
