... Or better yet, see Fandango if you want to see a movie about the really clever and funny male college age. Rolling Kansas looked promising (in fact, the program guide gave it 2.5 out of 4 stars, which usually means it's pretty watchable), but I pretty much went through it. Road trip movies usually have great music, but I can not even remember if there was music. The only high point was a small role with Rip Torn as a wise old mega-guru. Otherwise, the jokes and the time lost along the way. The four main characters are unknown actors and I do not remember seeing any of them in another movie. (Oh, yes, I see that Thos. Hayden Church was in it, but he's in everything, good, bad or indifferent.) This movie is as funny as watching someone stoned when you're not.
