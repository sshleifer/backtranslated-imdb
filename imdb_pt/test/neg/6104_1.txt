The movie opens with a scene that simply could not be. A man wakes up and while his wife remains in bed, he begins his morning prayers in his bedroom while his wife sleeps peacefully. Morning blessings are recited, but only those that Gitai considers controversial. the rest is conveniently omitted. so while in philactories and a tallis he kisses his wife good morning !! This is not an accurate description of Jewish prayer in any home, let alone a Chassidic home. Amos Gittai is not interested in accurately portraying Chassidic life. He is interested in adding to his growing list of melodramatic and empty films. The scenes of mikka (ritual bath) are far from precise, and their Jewish marriage was laughable because it does not even come close to the atmosphere of a Chassidic marriage. I have many problems with the Chassidic lifestyle, but I have no use for Amos Gittai's comment on these issues. He would like you to think that the Chassidim are all dense conformists with severe bouts of depression. I may not agree with the Chassidic way of life, but I recognize that Chassidic life has many layers. Amos Gitai is blinded by his secularist pseudo-intellectual stubbornness and is therefore unable to depict an accurate depiction of Hasidic life. In addition to his poor research and unbalanced portrayal of Hasidic life, Gitai fails in other respects as well. The plot is full of holes, the dialogue loaded with silence, the soundtrack is very repetitive and the performance, although sometimes powerful, was often charged with melodrama. The film continues and the ending is not worth it. see if you should, but be warned. If you want to learn about Chassidic life, go to the communities and talk to the Chassidim. Do not trust the Gittai movie!
