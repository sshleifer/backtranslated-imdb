This must be one of the worst movies of MGM and FRANK SINATRAS. An eccentric musical comedy that fails in almost every respect. The silly storyline has SINATRA trying to take their father's reputation as a KISSED BAND. He is not a bad guy and does not kiss !! He plays the "nerd" character as well as could be expected, given the dialogue he has to speak. The scene thieves are J. CARROLL NASH and MILDRED NATWICK. Too bad they did not have any more scenes together. I gave the film two stars because the scenery and costumes are superior and one of the songs sung by KATHTREN GRAYSON "Love is where you find it" is sensational. I could have had a repeat of that. In addition, a number of dance-type comics from RIDCARDO MANTALBAN, CYD CHARISSE and ANN MILLER have fun. So, for these reasons and only for those reasons, it is watchable. KISSING BANDIT is part of Frank Sinatra's early years collection.
