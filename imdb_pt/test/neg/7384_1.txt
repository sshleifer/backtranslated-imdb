This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. No story, no point, it was not even funny, not sure why people say this movie is gay because it sucked a lot !! Felix Bean the main character sucked. Susanna sucked. This movie was made in 1996 and was actually created in the 80's. What's more, I never let my friend choose movies ever again. Hmm, the cover of the movie said that it was from the super soldiers producers, who kidnapped them and stole their identities. Wow, what a waste of time. The only funny thing was Crazy Ricky, he was funny, especially when he and Emily ended up together. That was funny. Everything and everyone, sucked, wasted time and sleep. Wow, I never thought a movie like this could be made, so stupid to watch it until the end.
