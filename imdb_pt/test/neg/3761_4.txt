Although it can be very tedious, sometimes this movie is not so bad. The acting is reasonably well done, if stereotyped, and production figures are quite high considering some of the science fiction films coming by the end of the decade. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with this movie are a few. of the very outdated characterizations in it. There's the Texas guy, the "professional" scientist, and the worst of all, the scientist who finally realizes his femininity. For a movie that claims to make a statement about humanity, it loses some of its impact by reducing its characters through sexist stereotypes.
