I'm a big fan of Randolph Scott so I was surprised and disappointed to find out he's in this bad movie! The film really belongs to Robert Ryan, who is the hero in the jam, and what is involved in the love triangle. Good pain, Gabby Hayes gets more screen time than Mr. Scott in this movie !! To many viewers, that's not a problem, but I'm from Walter Brennan's school of helpers, not from Gabby Hayes ... although I would say that his lines were a little funnier than annoying in this movie than in many of his movies. with Randolph Scott and John Wayne. <br /> <br /> Personally, I found the film very slow, with a complicated plot that was further crazed by the unnecessary novel subplot. Out of foolishness, I do not mean impossible to understand or understand, I just mean too much for your own good. <br /> <br /> The direction is not inspired, and the two main villains have the most unsatisfactory things. uppance at the end. The whole movie appears as fake, unrealistic and poorly filmed. <br /> <br /> Just so you do not think I can not find anything good here ... <br /> <br /> Plus, Anne Jeffreys is very sexy in her very brief parts of this movie. I'm not sure if it's really her singing, or someone else, but whoever it was, had a very beautiful voice. Jeffreys also had some good acting moments. The script needed her much more, or completely remove her character. As it was, his good times were not enough to help the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is Mr. Scott. He looks fantastic in this movie and is the out-of-play thief to get things right. Some people complain that their characters before 1950 were too perfect, but that never bothered me. I'll take it to me before 1950, or violent and violent after 1950 ... anyhow, Randolph Scott was a true hero of the West. <br /> <br /> It saddens me to say it, but I would have to recommend passing this movie, unless you are a diehard fan ... there are so many better Scott films out there that this will not be lost.
