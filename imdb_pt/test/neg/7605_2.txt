This sequel is awful to be honest. I'm a fan of kung-fu movies and this is by far the worst I've ever seen. Bride with White Hair 1 was actually quite good and this is a big disappointment. BWWH 1 was brilliant in some ways with an evil villain of strange ball. <br /> <br /> The couple in the first movie played a small role in this film. Instead, the movie revolves around a bunch of uninteresting characters trying to take revenge on their fallen clans. But there are no antagonists in this movie, so revenge is mute. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is kung-fu or lack of it. They literally had a street-style knife fight. The character in the end refused to fight because there was lack of choreography.
