Not all the films made in 1931 are so shocking, and the fact that this was "Best Picture" must have given even more impetus to the development of television. <br /> <br /> Typical of all Ferber's novels, it is not possible to bring the whole story to the screen, not to mention the character's development. Dix - so impassive in the first third of the movie - makes a turnaround, but no one knows why and does not make sense. And what about Dunne that makes her so stoic? The scenes of Edna May Oliver are invaluable as usual. <br /> <br /> This movie has a role in the history of cinema, but it is long and boring.
