The cast and crew of this cheap horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that occurs throughout the movie itself; we have Barbara Payton, Raymond Burr, Lon Chaney Jr, Tom Conway, Paul Cavanaugh and Woody Strode in front of the camera and screenwriter and director Curt Siodmak, cinematographer Charles Van Enger, editorial supervisor Francis D. Lyon Herman Cohen production behind this. The ill-fated Payton turns over the heads of nearly every male with whom she comes in contact with the African jungle where she lives on her husband's plantation Cavanaugh: Doctor Conway secretly wants her while Burr's approach is literally more hands. in. On the other hand, Chaney is (surprisingly) the authoritarian figure relaxed but knowing and Strode is a native cop. The plot is very simple, but frankly, it does not make much sense: after a particularly busy dinner with thunderstorms, Burr and Cavanaugh (art imitating life - more about it later) arrive in the garden because of their affection. to Payton and, conveniently to Burr, a large snake is crawling near where Cavanaugh hits the ground! Witnessing the event behind the bushes, Payton's enigmatic maid (a native witch, no less), for some unexplained reason, puts a curse on Burr (who in the meantime married Payton) who periodically turns him into a gorilla. .. starting from the day of your wedding (when his hand turns briefly to shaggy)! Consequently, Burr leads to get lost in the jungle for days on end? even though the monkey's own creature is little glimpsed throughout the film. It should be said, however, that the version I watched ran for only 56 minutes, when the 'official' length is anywhere else given as 66, 70 or 76 !! So the film seems understandably rushed and disjointed, if not less than faintly agreeable, as it culminates in the pursuit of Payton in the woods, with the first pursued by Chaney and Conway. To get back to the tragic main blonde of the movie for a minute: after a promising start in films alongside Hollywood legends like James Cagney and Gary Cooper? in, respectively, KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE and DALLAS (both 1950's) ?? her career soon plunged into B (and minor) territory thanks to her own extravagant "colors": her most notorious misdemeanor was the cause of a much-publicized bar brawl between the suave husband Franchot Tone and the brutal former lover Tom Neal, who finished with the first coma and Payton, actually abandoning him to the last shortly after !! But that was not all: the nymphomaniac Payton also boasted that Woody Strode was among his conquests (a controversial issue at the time); Tone's short-lived husband, having taken Payton's infidelities on camera, spread the damning photographic evidence around Hollywood and this practically served to wipe out his days as a star? his last appearance in the movies was MURDER IS MY BEAT (1955), by Edgar G. Ulmer, that I happen to have in my pile "Unwatched Movies". The last 12 years of her tumultuous life were spent on Skid Row in the midst of drinking, drugs, prostitution, beatings, prisons and even a stabbing ?? before finally dying in 1967 at the home of his parents at the tender age of 39!
