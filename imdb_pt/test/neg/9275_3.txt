I rented this film version of 'Troilus and Cressida' from my library last Thursday, and I just could not believe my eyes. Where do I start? No effort was made to make the play look remote as it was about the Trojan War, all actors wore Elizabethan dress. In addition, most of the actors were too old and horribly bad - Aeneas (with his white beard) looked older than Nestor, Troilo was at least 30 years old, Hector looked like a Spanish pirate, Ajax was misunderstood and Thersites was a transvestite. Just as the action is bad, the duel between Ajax and Hector is short and amateurish, the angle of the camera focuses more on Nestor's face, so we can only see what is happening in the background that is frustrating in itself. Nor is it the "battle" at the end, given all due respect. We do not see Troilus and Diomedes fight, nor do anyone else, Paris and Menelaus seem to fight muddy in front of Thersites. Even Patroclus's death was omitted. All of this was a big disappointment considering I wandered through a very dull 2 ​​and a half hours of BBC fantasy drama to get to that point. <br /> <br /> However, it was not all bad. I thought that the Incredible Orlando as Thersites and John Shrapnel as Hector were well touched, even if they did not look good. I would say the same about Kenneth Haigh as Achilles, since he did not look impressive and at times was a little dry. SPOILER: The climax at the end - Hector's death - was perhaps the best part of the film, the Achilles dialogue here is excellent and sums up the attitude of a cold and experienced killer. However, the horrifying scene (when Achilles marks what was Hector's head) sets him apart anyway. Charles Gray as Pandarus was charming as an old pervert and I thought the actress playing Cressida did an OK job. The warlike Troilus, however, was boring and I think the move would have been better, perhaps if he had been murdered by Achilles instead of a pacifist like Hector. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? OK, but it could have been better if she had had a younger cast and fantasies that at least tried to look like an old Greek, not to mention the lack of action. 5/10
