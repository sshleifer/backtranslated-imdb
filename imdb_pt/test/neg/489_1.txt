Contains Spoilers <br /> <br /> But if you were not knocked over the head as a kid and then used as a football, then you would agree with me that this is one of the worst and still hilarious series ever made. Focusing around a woman who when girl was beaten by her father who also killed her mother, she spends her time drawing but wait for her then she becomes her superhero drawings and goes on to fight crime, being "drawn by pain." "The story itself is really OK, but that's how it's done, Jesse, the writer and director, has no idea how to write a screenplay, just listen to a monologue with the hero's 8-year-old version and it seems which was written by A 30-year-old man while his father, who bears a big mustache, walks the house all day while looking angry, showing how bad the characterization is, especially the part where he gets angry in the first episode and begins to repeat sentence "no more" by holding his wife's head before killing her using the marble work surface.The next rumble effect sound and only his terrible acting as everything he can convey is angry only is brilliant even after he is going to beat his daughter wearing the belt that is all done with him moaning and looking angry in slow motion.The episodes themselves can easily contain a good clean script with more than 5 minutes but no, Jesse not that Little Jesse is abandoning postmodernism as if he had just eaten Donnie Darko and then tamed himself to death. Nonsense camera cameras, all at odd angles, overly repeated lines and even nonsensical sequences, only confusing from time to time to fill in the exaggerated episodes. In conclusion, the idea is not bad, it's just how it's done, there's also a great character from a fat guy on a bench that does not show up enough and it's great, I just want to hug your chubby lil cheeks because they look so soft. The development of the character is non-existent, since the main character only says the first sounding philosophical thing that comes to his head, although they all contradict each other. But in spite of everything, especially Indiana Jones 4 however is much better, type "Jeeharv" in you-tube too, the results can make you cry with the beauty of the world too you you'll hear a lot of cheap, mostly gay, sex jokes.
