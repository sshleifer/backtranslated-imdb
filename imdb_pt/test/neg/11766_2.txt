There are interesting pieces here and about the likes and dislikes of Bruce Weber. Maybe if a professional editor had gotten together for the Biography, I would feel more satisfied. Instead, I spent $ 8 on a movie festival. For an autobiography, almost nothing is revealed about Bruce Weber, except that he likes to look at photographs, photograph interesting people, especially beautiful teens, and listen to jazz. The director of "Crumb" would have made a much more interesting and cohesive film.
