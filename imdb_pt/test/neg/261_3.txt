When I read the reviews of Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye, I thought, "Huh?" That was confusing. To be sure, I went to watch the movie and what do you know? It's a remake of "The Wedding Singer". Several scenes have been altered to suit the whole essence of indianity, but the rest is a direct survey of Hollywood's success in 1998. Bollywood is not a stranger to the remakes, but this is such a bad one that it hurts me just to watch it . I groaned so much watching this and realized that I was not the only one doing it! One guy really left the theater and never came back! Salman Khan should seriously stop doing comedy roles. He screams and complains too much. Why can not he just take it easy? He does not do justice to the role originally given by Adam Sandler. He does not have Sandler's sense of comic timing. Rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites, but she is not Drew Barrymore either. The scene in which she stands in front of a mirror practicing to say her new surname ("Hi, I'm Mrs. Pugalia") does not match the version of Barrymore ("Hi, I'm Mrs. Julia Gulia"). I felt embarrassed watching that scene, even if I had loved the original. The music is not so bad. It's probably the only saving grace of this horrible movie! Avoid this at all costs!
