I'm a fan of the 1950 original and about 20 minutes into this remake I started to think that this was going to be as good as the original, but it was not. The motive for the murders was incredibly stupid. Two of the movie lovers end up being brother and sister - excuse me while I vomit. The main character stops in the middle of the movie to have sex, which does not make sense considering the situation in which he is. If the filmmakers wanted a sex scene, they should put it before in the movie before the main character (Dexter played by Dennis Quaid has discovered that he is about to die and that he is accused of a crime. At the beginning of the movie, Dexter is not living life to the fullest, so he's not interested in sleeping with Meg Ryan. I still feel it would make more sense for the sex scene to have been cut or earlier in the movie and the two brothers were not lovers. <br /> <br /> One of the most stupid parts of the film involves armed struggle, some people being killed and a person being run over in a 15 meter radius of a crowded carnival and yet NOBODY NO It's not just hard to believe that things would sink so fast on the tar, but, in fact, it's not just hard to believe that things would sink so fast on the tar, more i important, who builds a university in tar pit. I would say more about how stupid the end of the movie is, but I do not want to put a spoiler on my post.
