I'm going out fighting here because this movie was so well filmed and so well released that I'm twice as angry with its de-evolution as I would have been with a minor job. Without revealing much of the plot, I can only say that part of my set of 2 VHS was an unnerving unfolding of bizarre but plausible developments. The protagonist was suitably naive, but also intelligent and very open. The events he is quickly forced to accept are the separation of his parents, the cultural shock when his Pakistani roots collide with the total collapse of English society in the 1960s, his father's dubious transformation into the revered Suburbia Buddha, and the transformation of her cousin into feminist militant as her best friend suddenly becomes an icon of the rising punk movement in the seventies. Among other things. <br /> <br /> What made me so angry was the amount of detailed work each actor put into creating and setting up their characters in the first part, just to make the whole thing turn into really bad pornographic episodes. the second part, too much to justify the development of the plot, and very explicit to look erotic. My biggest concern is when directors let their private fetishes interfere with the truth of the film, and for me that was a supreme example. <br /> <br /> I felt like I had been invited to a party of very clever, funny strangers, just to have the doors locked and the guests can not interact, and we all forced to watch bad sexploitation movies of the seventies. What an insult to the hard work of these incredible actors! Why not just make a cheeseball movie to get started? And why climb a big main character that can really act and then cut him down whenever he's building a great performance? I almost felt like he was also getting tired of the endless sex scenes, where all he did was stay there, pumping his pelvis to another panting actress. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - Part One is a minor genius, Part Two is the perversion of the second level soap opera. I know the book is quite explicit, but I felt that these actors were as exploited in real life as their characters were in the movie, and it made me very angry and very uncomfortable. Only John Waters can remove such a dubious degradation of actors and plots and make it look artistic. My suggestion is to just observe the first part, play the second on the proverbial garbage heap, and you will love the Buddha forever. Score A + F = 0
