I mistakenly thought this was the 1970s art film about the bed that people eat, which seemed interesting. It is not. Interesting, I mean, let alone about a bed that eats men. <br /> <br /> I assume Stuart Gordon has put his name on it in the same spirit that Lloyd Kaufman puts "Troma" into almost everything that was filmed with a video camera in the interest of building a library of franchises. Little more can be said about this opus beyond the execution time is less than 90 minutes. It is, of course, about a bed that is haunted by the spirit of a man, or something, that once killed a woman with a wig and long false eyelashes. Along the way, we get a sequence of opening credits of five minutes (is it the same as Lawrence Of Arabia?) ** a killer with contacts from Marylin Manson who kills using the same technique as the troll in "Cat's Eye" ** demonstrations of a sexual practice Michael Hutchence may have hired ** a preview of what Emilio Estevez will soon look like and act like ** softcore pornography that Cinemax broadcast ** manbutt and a topless scene ** a nutcase (or is it "whack" -ee?) ending involuntarily involving hilarious hammer beats and strawberry pie remnants (well, it looked like that to me) ** and a rudimentary surprise ending posrros nothing much. It's how the screenwriter even fell asleep on "Deathbed" before finishing the last draft. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not sexy, it's shot on high definition video and it does not look bad, but it does not. Not good, acting is good enough not to be bad enough to be fun and so is everything else. No one would probably have seen or heard of it unless it was on an album with another movie, the modern "double feature." I was not paying attention to parts, so maybe I missed something. But for some reason I doubt it. Rating: PASS
