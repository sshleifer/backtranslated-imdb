This movie is ridiculous. It's trying to be a comedy, but the script is horrible. The whole movie is done in low light and you can not understand the fact that it's a comedy. Truly it's bad cinematography. You really have to sit there and watch it to realize that there are some jokes here and there, but either way they are all inside jokes to each other. This is more like a wannabe drama that was bad. It really is a very meaningless movie. Their expressions reveal nothing but consternation and disaster, which ends up being the same. Unless you want to be bored, I suggest you stay away from this movie joke.
