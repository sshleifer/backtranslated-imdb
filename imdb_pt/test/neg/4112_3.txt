I'll start by admitting that I like many movies that have low ratings on this site. I think if I can see what the creators were trying to do, I'm grateful for their work. Sound of Thunder was a story that interested me. I wanted to see what angles filmmakers would attack when telling the story. In general, they tried to create a fun movie. The plot was invented, but most of the action movie plots are. Ed Burns does not know how to carry a rifle, but still retains his own well as an action leader, considering he is not much wanted. The main problem, it destroys the whole movie!, Is the horrible CGI. It is totally unacceptable that the animals and the funds seem very false. In addition, animal conceptions could have been really good, as well as the action scenes, but failed because production failed. This could have been a really memorable movie if they had finished. It really looks like they wanted to go back and fix all the horrible CGI, but they ran out of money and still released it. Save your money because someone else has failed this movie. I give three stars because it really could have been good, but it was totally flawed somewhere that I can not say enough.
