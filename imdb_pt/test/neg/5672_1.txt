Yes, we all know about Dan Schneider's little fascination in doing shows with kids and iCarly is no exception. Watch young girls wiggle their toes and stick their tongue in the direction of the camera and wear tiny clothes and bikinis. Yes, that makes you wonder if these shows were made for teenagers or for an older, degenerate crowd. Anyway, the show is not as good when compared to Dan Schneiders other shows as the much higher Amanda Show & Drake and Josh. <br /> <br /> The show is about a brother and sister (Carly and Spencer) living alone and having to turn themselves on while their father is in the Army and their mother is strangely absent from their lives. Carly has a petty friend named Sam and they do a very well-crafted and award-winning web show called iCarly with their little school friend Freddie. The episodes deal with their lives in and around the web show and their hex at school. <br /> <br /> Carly Shay is a young / woman / business woman / producer known by Miranda Cosgrove, a young actress. who trusts to speak very, very loud and fast to show their point and make strange faces. His brother, Spencer, is a petty, impetuous, eccentric and eccentric performer played by Jerry Trainor, who struggles a bit to be like Jim Carrey and whose comedy style seems to be aimed at young male audiences who would like that. kind of humor from Joey Gladstone. So there's Sam Puckett, a small, lying liar of a brat who needs an attitude adjustment played by Jeanette McCurdy who clearly uses hair extensions as you can see them disappear and reappear from scene to scene. And finally there is Freddie Benson on the web shows nerd cameraman and technical consultant who has a great passion for Carly but obviously will have no place with her that is played by Nathan Kress. <br /> <br /> Other minor characters come and go, like Freddie's mother, Carly's grandfather, annoying teachers, and many of his annoying school mates complete the cast. Most of the comedy is petty, like blowing up Lewbert the doorman like a gag, throwing a water balloon at a teacher and knocking over the table of young Boy Scouts selling cookies. All adults go off like complete idiots while the kids are all aware, and certain main characters have absolutely no morals. Lying, cheating, stealing and violence are all acceptable in the children's program created and written by Dan Schneider, yes ... it's a spectacle for children! What more young viewers could ask for ?? Well, with Dan Schneider, we can expect the girls to dress in tight suits and bikinis and do some weird things like sticking their tongues in the camera and eating bananas. <br /> <br /> Shows like this are exactly what young audiences like and I think it's not worse than any other junk that Nick pokes at young audiences. There are always fans that can be found for anything seen on TV, at least that's a little better than most things seen on Nick, like that horrible Naked Brothers show.
