C'était complètement minable: à fuir absolument! <br /> <br /> This was an idiotic attempt to destroy classic, and completely successful source material! <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie under any circumstances unless you wish to have your ten euros ripped and pushed your nostrils through a lot of insipid, atrociously unamusing characters. <br /> <br /> This type of film clearly illustrates the gulf that still unfortunately divides directors and audiences. If the individual (who forbids the collective could have conceived this scum) behind it had been considerate enough to watch the version being played in the French theaters, he or she would have endured what I was forced to endure and mercifully rewritten it, or completely. The vein of adult humor being drawn here dates, in my opinion, back to Fritz the Cat, but it lacks the avant-garde status of the film or even its basic attempt at social commentary. With the proliferation of remakes and increasing reliance on preexisting source material to fund storytelling these days, one would expect to choose Snow White, and not have to worry about conceiving characters or a radically new story, would have allowed more time, ah, I do not know, interesting animation, smarter jokes, maybe a coherent film that has something to say and not telegraphed its emptiness of the opening picture? <br /> <br /> Obviously terrible production.
