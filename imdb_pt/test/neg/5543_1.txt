Well they made it again a new pumpkin movie, the first pumpkin movie was perfect for the time, a stupid bloody monster movie and clich√©. So here it is, someone loses their loved one, goes to the witch in the forest, causes her to raise her pumpkin head and have all those responsible killed. unfortunately, the filmmakers found it irrelevant to try to do something other than this, for the fourth film showing, considering it much more appropriate to add some subgroups of Romeo and Juliet, involving an idiot family fight (because of a car !!!) and surprising to surprise some bloody, hitherto so stereotypical pumpkin head murders, but does not stop there the acting talent in this movie is terrible ... oh so bad half of them can not even keep a southern accent without slipping in their accents native and often posher. Lance Henrikssen is on board, so surely he would bring some seriousness to the proceedings of the cinema ... but no one just launches a fan on the screen lets the words fall in the mouth without any emotion or apparently direction, and moves away again, I honestly think that he turned to the money, then went to his trailer for drunk and reminded about aliens. <br /> <br /> This movie is totally false, there is another redeeming feature besides finishing credits that signal everything again. <br /> <br /> despite the faults of ph: bf ... if you want a no-brainer that will make you laugh for all the wrong reasons watch it. <br /> <br /> If you want something with a little more meat and originality avoid.
