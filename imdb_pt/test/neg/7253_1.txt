And I'm afraid I can not imagine why. It really is a truly terrible and exceptionally annoying movie. In a way, it is reminiscent of primitive science fiction when all the ensembles were ripped off in a Hollywood lot of what was out there. From the tiny, unconvincing set (the shooters seem to be about ten feet away) apparently made of plaster, for actors who are also apparently made of plaster with finely painted "fun" stereotypes at the top, to the strangely hot pool at a frozen cave, for the survival of the uninjured cast when medium artillery shells explode a few feet away in the open, and finally the horrible script that looks more like a training manual than a movie ... I really can not tell how boring this is. Even the opportunity to see if the young James Dean survived was not enough to keep me watching for over an hour. This really is one to be avoided at all costs.
