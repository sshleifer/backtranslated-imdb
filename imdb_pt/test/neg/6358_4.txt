* Spoilers - sorry! * The first word that came out while watching the movie is 'Gremlins'. It's the only bug movie I've seen of all four movies, but I liked it. It was not as complicated as I had not seen the last two, but I thought it was a very good movie anyway. <br /> <br /> The animals begin with a man, his son and his daughter stopping on the way to vacation (although it ends up in his own house - that I have no idea what the hell happened. (Leo DiCaprio) and they go out in a nearby forest They find this strange guy who tells them to be careful and things because of the creatures He seems a little psychotic and if I was in this situation, I would not talk to him The creatures steal a ride from the girl's and boy's car and end up in their flat thing They hide in the basement and end up killing this lazy idiot They then almost kill this fat woman and the girl's father. (Spoof from the kitchen scene of gremlins ???) And I can not remember (not a good thing) but I'm sure they have to go back to the apartment to hide in the attic. for something / someone. they end up coming out and saved. The psychotic guy comes back and before he kills the last two creatures, he is told that he can not because they are in danger and so he sends them home. <br /> <br /> The ending was disappointing and I was pissed that only the lazy guy died as there were some annoying characters that I personally would have killed. It's an exciting and thrilling movie that is worth watching. But if you're looking for a better version of this genre, I recommend the gremlins movies. Excuse!
