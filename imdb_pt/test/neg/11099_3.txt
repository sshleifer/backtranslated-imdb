The film is apparently based on a popular French horror novel by Arthur Bernède in 1927. Not that I've heard of it before, but Belphegor has been a popular subject before for films and miniseries. The first film was released in 1927, simultaneously with the novel. Arthur Bernède was part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously. The character Belphégor is one of his best known creations. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time Sophie Marceau was a promising new European actress who would conquer Hollywood. She now, however, has fallen back to movies like this. Nothing wrong with playing French quality films, as it is the country from which it originates, but this film is just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the movie depends on its special effects, to make the movie good and scary. . Well, horror and special effects were never a good combination, with a few exceptions here and there. It's not as if the special effects were bad on this one. Especially for a European film, it's simply good, but it's simply out of place, since the film gave the impression that it could have been made without its effect. It would have really made the movie a better and more scary to watch, no doubt about it really. <br /> <br /> The film is not only tense or engaging to watch, also because the film seems to have difficulty choosing the right approach. Sometimes the film chooses a milder and less serious approach, while in others it clearly tries to be a good scary horror movie. This is mainly the reason why the film simply does not work at any level. You might say the movie is a bit boring. Everything also definitely worsens to the end. After a while, you just stop to care about this movie and its story and start wishing that you decided to watch something else. <br /> <br /> The issue seems to be totally wrong. It uses very quick cuts, without much style, while the fast editing was obviously intended to give the film a good, modern style. Also the timeline is simply messed up sometimes, as if some sequences were edited in the wrong order. <br /> <br /> The musical score is also really annoying and sometimes does not even sound like it fit the soundtrack. movie, as if everything had been tagged before the movie was filmed. I can not believe that composer Bruno Coulais is an Oscar-nominated composer. The soundtrack is almost as annoying as the movie in its sound effects. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of many characters, with whom you do not care at all. It also seems very unlikely that a woman like Sophie Marceau would fall in love with a man like Frédéric Diefenthal. The film also features Julie Christie, which is cool, but does not add much to the film. <br /> <br /> A horrible clock. <br /> <br /> 3/10
