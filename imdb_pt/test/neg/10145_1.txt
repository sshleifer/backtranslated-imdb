While it's easy and accurate to investigate why "Reba" is the heart that indicates many family-oriented sitcoms in the way you get rid of other better sitcoms, the truth is that the show is repetitive, full of stereotypes of more shows funny and innovative, and the main star is completely out of its element. While I'm sure Mrs. McIntire can sing and have a fan base that supports this, being on a sitcom taking zingers and calling her the next Lucille Ball is far, far from reality. <br /> <br /> Reba herself has no presence that is necessary here to establish the fact that she is cast as the woman who puts her whole family centered. However, after watching a few episodes, there is no real connection with the character. I could care less about your adventures, because your whole character seems to be MIA. Reba McIntire has no onscreen presence, and making a show around her seems very nearsighted and indicative of most family-oriented shows: to push a comedy full of stupid stereotypes / women-all-that do not attract anyone but those who they can not pay for cable. <br /> <br /> The show is a waste of time. The only good thing is that at least it has better production values ​​than your standard PAX ripoff .... just.
