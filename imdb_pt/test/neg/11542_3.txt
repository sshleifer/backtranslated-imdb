Simply horrible. It is almost unbelievable that, with characters and situations provided by Dashiell Hammett, such a heavy and unfocused jumble could result. But this is television for you - fill in between commercials. The first warning signal sounds from the shake of the re-creation of the period, which shouts "1928" on the banner type. Flivers and touring cars, fedoras and vests, cloches and jazz speakeasy (jarringly played) - with all the attention given to useless, arty details, the important issues are ignored. <br /> <br /> Like narrative clarity, or plausibility or competent writing and acting. The plot defines one of Hammett's agents ("Hamilton Nash", so if he's called "Ham" or "Nash", we think of "Hammett" or "Dash") investigating a false diamond robbery. Thus is presented the young woman who supposedly carries Dain Curse (the dull and untalented Nancy Addison, who returned to the soaps where she belonged); she belongs to a crazy religious cult led by Jean Simmons and seems addicted to "drugs" too; there is also a mysterious gaseous drug that penetrates the rooms ... <br /> <br /> But enough. Writing is never more pedestrian than when one arrives at the poetic or at the top, and the parrot cast is the only way they know: grotesquely exaggerating. Simmons is treated as lesser royalty than the old Hollywood, but the treatment of the great lady does not wash. Hector Elizondo, for some reason, enjoys a second billing (after Coburn) for an expendable part. Other familiar faces pass by, doing little good for their resumes. <br /> <br /> The actors are not even photographed to be well; Jason Miller is a special scare, but extreme close-ups of Coburn are also ruthless. Coburn probably accepted this role because, with a mustache, he bears a strong resemblance to Hammett. He needed more guidance than that; no one gave him the vaguest suggestion about how to interpret his character, or about the tone of the story, or about how the different strands of the plot combine (they do not, at least not in that statement). Then he shows off his great chesire cat smile, whether called or not. <br /> <br /> Dain Curse is available in video in various lengths. For those reckless enough to "see for themselves," the shorter abbreviation is the kindest cut of all.
