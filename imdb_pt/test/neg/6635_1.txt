Yes, the votes are inside. This movie may well be Plan 9 of the Outer Space for our generation. But while Ed Wood's film, despite all its flaws, retains a certain charm, nonetheless, this film defines the word "no charm" to the nth degree. In fact, I suggest to the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary that they cite this film as a key example setting the word in the next dictionary update. The Carrot Top is a performer of such abysmal skill that normally rational people I know once they hear his name become homicidal maniacs dedicated to wanting to kill Mr. Topo as fast as possible. In fact, if someone logs in to Amazon.com and looks at customer comments about the Carrot Top movie and another presentation DVD, you can find several that could be interpreted as death threats for Mr. Top. Another curious fact about this movie, I remember that Mike Nelson, the lead author of MST 3000, in his book Mike's Mega Cheese about good and bad movies, said that he saw this movie and soon after could not remember anything, including the movie. title. Obviously Mike was suffering from a classic reaction to the trauma. Seeing this atrocity was so numbing that Mike Nelson had to block it from his mind. (Evidently, in a later chapter in his book, Mike Nelson had regained his memory of this film.) By the criticism he offers, Mike Nelson was definitely not grateful for the memory he had recovered.) <br /> <br /> The only comment I offer about the movie, and it's not a spoiler, it's simply the honest truth of God, not funny. None of this is, not even a nanosecond is funny.
