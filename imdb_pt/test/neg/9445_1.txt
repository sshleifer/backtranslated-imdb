I have to say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, I can not believe I lost $ 10 in blockbuster; this movie should be recorded and anyone who has ever thought about it has problems. Who really spent money to make this movie was insane = D This movie has terrible actors and some of the scenes make absolutely no sense. Well, the whole movie does not make sense. Also the part where these "men" enter the restaurant (department of national security) which is the worst part of the film. How dare they say Frank Sinatra's name in vain? Besides, what's with these glasses? When the guy and the girl are in the car and she "drinks" water, you can tell she is not even drinking! Besides, what's with the weird dinner guy. And everyone knows you do not stab the tires, you cut them off.
