The film by Olivier Assayas stars Asia Argento as a woman who had a relationship with Michael Madsen. Madsen is a businessman who is in financial trouble. In desperation, he will sell his share of a business to a company called Golden Eagle, a Far Eastern company. As Madsen begins his moves away from his company Argento returns to his life. The couple had a torrid love affair that included her doing business favors for Madsen (with the so-called Golden Eagle). Once Argento enters the movie, the movie follows her as we see the tangled web she's weaving and how the complications spin dangerously and violently out of control. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan. In fact, I was really bored, since the movie seems to go back and forth for most of the first hour, during which I wondered what the point was besides providing an important role for Argento. Argento, daughter of director Dario Argento and director, is a unique actress. Sometimes incredibly good, it is more often so it will not give you a peculiar interpretation of a damaged human being. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. I do not think this works completely here, mainly because the script is too "complicated" to support it. I did not care what was happening, so the injured girl rubbed me the wrong way (she looked crazier than anything else). I'm not blaming the actors, but the writer / director Assayas, who once again has built a tale complicated with the kind of plays actors love to face but that leave audiences scratching their heads because they do not really work. <br /> <br /> If you must try on cable
