There is a lot of ketchup, but it does not make much sense in the third, supposedly explanatory sequence that adds to the nefarious effect. Good old Alan Smithee directed this, in which several members of the same family (all misunderstood by Bruce Ramsay) are terrified by Pinhead (Doug Bradley, taken from mothball for the umpteenth time). Peter Atkins tries to imbue his script with poetic touches but does not seem to realize that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a sick plate. The incoherent plot can not adequately fill the film's meager running time, though this may have more to do with studio interference than anything the filmmakers intended.
