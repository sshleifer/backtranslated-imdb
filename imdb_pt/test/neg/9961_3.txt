A scientist (George Zucco) wants to create werewolves of American soldiers to fight against the Nazis, but is considered crazy. He uses a simpleton gardener (Glenn Strange) to experiment by mixing his blood with the blood of a wolf. Strange, constantly incorporating his dialogue with the tones of Lon Chaney Jr. in "Of Mice and Men", he has no idea what is happening, only he dreams of being awake. The victims begin to pile up (including a girl, which modern viewers may find quite disturbing, and two of Zucco's rivals). There is a good dialogue about how man should not mess with nature (still prevalent today) and play God. Zucco's motives can be honored, but his methods are more questionable. And then there's his daughter, Anne Nagel, who is sympathetically sympathetic to Strange, but has no idea of ​​her father's deeds. Johnny Downs is a reporter who sits on the bad side of Zucco, questioning him, but wins the heart of Nagel, thus creating the usual and always tedious romantic subplot in classic horror movies. At 77 minutes, this is about 15 minutes longer than usual for a horror movie from the early 40's (especially one of the PRC's who released this movie), so the romantic story could have been reduced to costs and speeding up a little things. Zucco, fortunately, is never hammy; He left it to Bela Lugosi (who always treated it in a delightfully theatrical way that charmed him to the public) and Todd Slaughter of England. But try not to think about the "Bride of Monsters" lab while you look at what Zucco works, or some of Lugosi's dialogues in that classic cult movie. "Mad Monster" does not have a cult that follows more because it is not deliciously bad, it only has a monotonous rhythm in more than a few points. For RPC and monogram lovers, I would recommend "The Corpse Vanishes" or "Fog Island" louder than this
