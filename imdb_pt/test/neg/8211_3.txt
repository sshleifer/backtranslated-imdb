This weird Texas movie is about Fallon, a wealthy dilettante boy in the late 1800s (though he looks like a 1960s C & W singer with hair and greasy chops) whose ship was shipwrecked on an island of Earl DeSade (pronounced -sayd) with his captain. The earl is afraid of pirates and torture a young woman who was once hostage of pirates and also torture the captain. Meanwhile, former nurse Cassandra tells Fallon the secrets of the castle. The countess has leprosy and has gone mad! Fallon is stuck, but supplies supplies. The captain is killed by a racist cartoon slave. Fallon is thrown into the dungeon with the leper, who always thinks it's her wedding day. The leprous bride is horny, but Kassandra kills her. Fallon and Cassandra escape from the castle, but the count and his slave chase them with dogs. DeSade kills the slave and Fallon kills DeSade. Fallon and Cassandra fall in love over the next year, but when the supply ship arrives, the crew refuses to take our lovers, because they are both lepers now. They live for years in the castle ... Fallon's hair turns gray and Cassandra goes crazy. Fallon puts her in the dungeon. Our tale of love and leprosy ends. <br /> <br /> So bizarre is watchable, and you can smell the drive-in popcorn.
