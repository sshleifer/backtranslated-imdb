This movie is available as a special bonus on the double disc of Horror 101 & Horror 102: Endgame. It has nothing to do with these films except that it shows that the producers / directors Dudelson and Clavell are in a rut. Like these other films, this one features young people who go to a building where they get trapped inside, and run through the aisles, while being picked up one by one. In the end, one or more characters are revealed to have another identity. This is by far the worst of the three. <br /> <br /> Here, people are invited to an opening of the Museum of the Dead only on Halloween night. The museum does not have many exhibits, and all of them are related to Central America. There are also meat-eating zombies scattered throughout the museum infection, as well as an old cannibal warrior and two female warriors. <br /> <br /> The film is very repetitive. It kills people quickly, to the point where you wonder who they will leave to kill - and at that point more people appear without explanation so they can be killed. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, one of the characters has a cell phone and is able to call the police, who really takes it seriously and pops into the museum. When someone tries to get the padlock to enter, the other says it would be "forced entry." If you have people trapped in a building that are injured, I think that's irrelevant. The cops are also stupid when they shoot a zombie in the head, he falls, but they shoot at other zombies in the chest and do not fall. They hit another zombie on his head and he falls. They continue to shoot the rest of the zombies in the chest. Stupid. <br /> <br /> The opening credits and a nightmare sequence are made into a kind of animation effect on the video, a kind of Waking Life thing of the poor but not so caricatured. It is interesting, however, parts of some of the attacks are done in the same way, so there is no logic in this. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
