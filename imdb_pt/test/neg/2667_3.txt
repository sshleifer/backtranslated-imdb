Okay, just what the hell is all this should mean ??? Halloween 6 (let's just call it that, OK?) Is undoubtedly the most CONFUSOR movie in the series (and from what I've heard, seeing the original "producer cut" does not sound like something that makes things less baffling than the official release"). What a mess. <br /> <br /> This is not a very bad movie, as some have already said. It has its scary scenes and some intense moments - it just DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSES! Do not tell me that Michael was "designed" from the beginning to be evil and kill and destroy, and blah blah blah. It was bad enough when they turned Michael into Jamie Lee Curtis's brother (just to have an excuse to keep it in the second film) - that's awesome. <br /> <br /> It seems like this is another case. of the creators of the film trying to be "very smart", coming to a new premise that will shock and impress us all. Bad move, folks. We're not looking for an explanation of why Michael kills, so please do not try to feed us this crap. Show me Michael looking menacing and killing a lot of people. Show me Dr. Loomis trying to locate him and, as usual, coming up pretty fast. Do not waste (what turned out to be) Donald Pleasance's last performance telling me (in the most confused way possible) that Michael was "created" by some cult from hell and that his "seed" will be passed on to another and ... oh, brother. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 has its moments, do not get me wrong, and we all know there have been worse sequences than that (Hell, anyone?) so take what you can do outside (the scene in direction to the end of the movie with Michael charging a deep red runner is particularly effective) and try to ignore the crazy storyline. I hope one day we can all see the "cut of the producer" and maybe have the chance to make (a little) more sense of it all. Until then, this will have to do ... <br /> <br /> -FTM
