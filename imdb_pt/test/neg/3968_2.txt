This movie was originated from my mother's friends who worked in a charity store. She handed it to us along with a load of other unknown cassette tapes. The movie itself is a bit crap. There are some notable pieces to laugh about as when your girlfriend uses her head, but in general the film is bland. Interesting when I saw the trailer for "The Island", I could not help but notice the similarities. Could Clonus have been the inspiration for this movie? All in all it does not bother to watch this movie as it is boring and annoying. We liked it so much when we were 16 years old that we named our band after her. Another sign that this movie is a bit bad is that the scenes on the back of the video do not appear in the movie? weird
