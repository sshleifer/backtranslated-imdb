The opening was a robbery of "Oigh-legged Freaks", a movie that's all this is not. Stilted and pedestrian are the words that apply - along with others that can not be repeated ..! Drifter type returns to his hometown (?), Meets old friends, etc .... the usual boring boy, single mother, local speaker and so on..Bad special effects, alien ship, atmospheric disturbances , (hey, didn the director see "Immediate Contacts"?). Good acting? Good story? Good camera angles? Good cut? Not here! Do not rent, unless you are sharing the cost and have lots of beer on hand. Do not watch TV, go and drink lots of beer - you'll like it better!
