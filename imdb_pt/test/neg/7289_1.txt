This movie was horrible, and does not even deserve to be called the movie. The way I see it, it's more like three mediocre episodes of Disney cartoons on a day-to-day basis to make a single video that pretends to be the sequel to the first Atlantis movie, which was much nicer and nicer. And where do I really start with the problems of this DVD? The story? The characters? The images / animation? To me, they are all bad and unassailable. First, the story on this DVD straight to the video is ridiculous and meaningless. The only good thing about it is that it is consistent - that is, consistently bad, from beginning to end. After the movie is over, I still do not know why Milo returned and how the incidents occur in the three little stories are related to each other or to Atlantis itself. And all I could remember about this movie was how much I feel bad after seeing it. The characters look like wood and have no personality, and the designs look very different than at first. You can say that they are obviously not the hands of the very first animators. As the DVD played, I found myself less concerned about what might happen to the characters and just hoping the movie would end soon. In addition to the story and the characters mentioned above, the picture quality is also bad in this, probably one of the worst of the direct video products that Disney has already released. As a fan of the original Atlantis: the lost empire, I could not be more disappointed with Milo's return, which is a total waste of time and money. Thank God I rented first instead of buying it. Even so, I still wish I had never seen this crap or even known its existence.
