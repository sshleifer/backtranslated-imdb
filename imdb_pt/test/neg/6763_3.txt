Jeff Morrow is Leslie Gaskell, Barbara Laurence is Vera Hunter and John Emory is Hubbel Eliot. Together with some Air Force auxiliary staff and a comedic geek, they are responsible for a super-secret underground lab on the West Coast. Morrow is thrilled to discover a meteor passing through the atmosphere, but perplexed when the meteor decides to take a dip in the Pacific Ocean and emerge as a fantastic machine on the Mexican coast. <br /> <br /> Nobody knows what's colossal. block structure is. Obviously, it's some kind of carpentry artifact because it's all made from right angles with a kind of bald sphere partially visible at the top. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the machine, nicknamed Kronos, is from somewhere far away. planet and was sent here to steal the earth from the energy. You see, here on Earth, we learn how to convert matter into energy, but on the planet of Cronus they discovered the other half of the equation - how to convert energy into matter. And now they are running out of energy on the other planet. Are you taking notes about it? Good. <br /> <br /> Maybe you can tell me about some of the scientific issues raised by the Kronos mission. For example, if Kronos builders can convert energy into matter, and vice versa, why do not they simply convert some of their own spare energy into energy, instead of sending elaborate earth machines to extinguish LA lights? But it is doubtful that the writers can also explain. Reversing the polarities of the two antennas is described as an "anthropic conversion," which means a "human change" that does not make sense. But it does not seem that some science makes sense. The diagram Morrow draws on the board has the current going in the wrong direction, from positive to negative. <br /> <br /> There is also a problem with Kronos locomotion. It marches along the coast, threatening "populated areas" (read Southern California) but has no joints in its two or three legs. These stumps just hit slowly up and down, crushing some people. The movie does not make much of these people crushed. They are shown as Mexican peasants, so maybe they do not count much. The USAF also launches a hydrogen bomb at Kronos - while in Mexico, remember. No one raises an eyebrow. <br /> <br /> It does not take much action and it does not give much. Jeff Morrow has a distinctive, resonant voice, great for radio or voice over TV. Your face is less expressive. He has only one expression, no matter what the situation - a tight smile, as if he were taking a photo on the Universal Studios Tour. Barbara Laurence had a good quality of gold when she created "Street With No Name" a few years earlier. She was a skinny young woman of seventeen as Richard Widmark's wife. Here, her looks and behavior reduce her to the level of actress B, although she is still beautiful. It's always good to see Morris Ankrum in one of these movies. He made so many, I confuse them. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie looks flat, I'm afraid. (There are some good pictures of a B-47 in flight, however.) The sets reveal a low-budget company. This is not necessarily bad in itself, but there is nothing to compensate for the sterile settings. Little tension in the script, no direction display and little effort put into the performances. <br /> <br /> You can have fun with it - a relaxed tone - because this is clearly indisputable. It's just that there are so many better movies of the genre out there.
