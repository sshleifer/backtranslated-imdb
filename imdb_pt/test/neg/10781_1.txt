Sometimes there is such a bad movie that you simply stare at it with admiration. This is one of those movies. Of course I can not avoid being partial. I'm from Chicago so I watched the scenes closely for accuracy and did not find Billy Crystal funny at all. And I can not stand all that English-style photography (Tony Scott etc) with the smoke machine working overtime and all the soft and flourecent lighting. I suppose we must believe Billy Crystal is really from Chicago because he wears a Cubs shirt. Oh and the plot. If you really think about it, these guys should be arrested, not the bad guys, since they are more dangerous. And, of course, there is the clich√© of the police officers about to retire. But the funniest scene is the climax in which good and bad guys shoot another to death at The Thompson Center (a state building!) Of course it's a legal building, but it's the equivalent of doing a huge drug deal on White House.
