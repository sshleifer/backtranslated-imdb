CAN CONTAIN SPOILERS. This movie was the worst movie of all time. I could not even see it was so bad. This movie is actually worse than the scarecrow killer, which is saying a lot. This was worse than terror toons, that at least the terrorist toons were funny at times. Not even the movie's blood was good. The shootings were fake and the acting was worse. Please do yourself a favor and skip this one. If you see it at the rental store, then run to the other side. There's nothing good about this movie. If you want to see a good scarecrow movie, watch Scarecrow Night or Pumpkin Head. If you want to watch a new fight movie, watch the Scarecrow. I rate this film 0.2 out of 10. This is how this movie really is horrible. The worst movie ever.
