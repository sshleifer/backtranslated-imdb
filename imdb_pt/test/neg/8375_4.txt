I realize that the line in my resume is not very polite. <br /> <br /> This film written and directed by Scott Caan & starring Giovanni Ribisi, himself Don Cheadle & performs a long 88 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a dog in this puppy from a movie. He is cute. <br /> <br /> The movie debuted in 2 US theaters at the end of April 2007 for a week and grossed all $ 914. for DVD in early August 2007. <br /> <br /> We could only take about 40 minutes before we unplugged the DVD. <br /> <br /> This was the kind of movie that played in the lower half of double counts. You saw the main movie and imagined let's see how it is, you may have left before we closed. <br /> <br /> The 3 actors and the young people in the film did and deserve better than that .. <br /> <br /> Ratings: ** (of 4) 54 points (of 100) of 10
