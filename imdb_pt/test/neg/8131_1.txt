I inadvertently slipped into this "trap" of a movie. <br /> <br /> If I could go back in time or just get a refund, I would be happy. It was 7:30 p.m. and Cinderella Man did not start until 10 p.m., so I ran to the movies to watch the movie that started at 7:20 p.m. and I daresay that God stretched out his hand (or portrayed) and allowed me to punish myself for my film. Glory to sit down for this movie. <br /> <br /> It may be unfair to criticize a movie that was not directed at my male heterosexual cohort, however, there is no excuse for poor sound and video editing. This film was at most worthy of a high school project budget ... and I think I've seen better in those French plays that we used to do about Louis Laloupe. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because I'm Canadian and this movie went to LA's fudge packaging team and its sympathetic ladies. Woe to me when I realized that then the whole public saved me from all the jokes and insinuations ... I fully understood the humor hinted ... but I just could not relate. <br /> <br /> This program did show me, supposedly, how gay men date and build relationships. However, even if it was their purpose in the film, I feel that "Gayness" was too focused ... humanity seemed to be missing ... but then again, maybe that was the point ... simply being avant-gard ... and to make a splash. <br /> <br /> I think with a low budget and poor equipment, you have to make your movie as "loud" as possible in order to get crowds and cash back. I really wish I had read my Sheldon Van Auken. Hehe ... I was totally the wrong audience.
