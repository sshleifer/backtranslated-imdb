Love the TPB, but this was a lame episode. It did not have the same feeling as the series or the movie has. It looked like it was mounted in a hurry. I did not like it at all. The so-called acting was horrible. The cast appeared as if it knew that this was a cash gain from an episode to hit the market quickly. I hope we do not have a special Easter then because that will be for me. The writing of this episode was definitely the worst of Mike Clattenburg in the history of this show. The direction left a lot to be desired and I almost felt badly about the cast and crew of this faint attempt at a Christmas special. Like I said, I love TPB, but this one goes to waste.
