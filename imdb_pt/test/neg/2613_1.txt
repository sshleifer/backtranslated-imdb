You know, I'm sure the kids were sitting in the office one day and they said, "HOW CAN WE MAKE MORE MONEY?" They had made every possible variant of toys they could do with their current characters. So they decide, let's steal the idea of ​​Star Wars, PREQUEL, and we can invent all the new characters and sell them as toys. Incidentally something they did in the puppet master 3, but who cares? Either way they choose a point in time before the first movie, when Toulon is still alive, he and the dolls are sitting around, and a wooden head rolls on the floor and the dolls wonder if this is a family member or something like that does not matter. Then begins the story of the ancestor of the puppets. It is long, boring, without body care. <br /> <br /> The funniest part is that they tell the origin of these new characters in the movie, but they do not give hints of their fate. So suppose that once the new toy recipes make up for it, they'll be able to come up with a new sequel (and the rotten fourth) called "MASTER FILM 8 THE SEQUEL TO THE NAIL OF DESTINY OF THE DEAD RETRO MARGARENTS!" hold your breath!
