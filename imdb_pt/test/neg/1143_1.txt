I loved the original, I watch it every year. but the second one is a piece of garbage and should never have been made. The second could have worked if there had been a different location. The son was not original nor even acted like one of the children of Eddie. The third was very clever for Eddie, who downplayed his father's role. None of the other children are there. It just could have been so much better. I do not know why they tried to make this movie. There was no continuncy from the first movie. I'll pretend this does not even exist. It is sad that the actors did not even see that they were made fools. A really bad movie. I just think I lost an hour or so in a bad movie and I really love all the national legends movies.
