Anthony Wong stars in this and the original (much higher) story of Untold Story, but the similarities stop there. Wong does not repudiate his role, obviously, and instead plays a clumsy cop who engages a rather suspicious woman, Fung (Paulyn Sun, 1994, who is repressed), for sure. But his jealous taming "I want to be with a guy who's with a killer girl" is not nearly as attractive as what Wong played at first. The movie itself looks tired and by the numbers. Yeung Fan as the unfaithful physical-loving girl tries to keep the person from total boredom, undressing whenever possible, and Sun has a nice butt, but even this can not save this failure. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> Mei Ah DVD Extras: Interviews under-titled with Cheung Kam Ching and Paulyn Sun; Filmography by Anthony Wong; a brief synopsis; Theatrical trailer for the film; & trailers for "Chinese Erotic Ghost Story" and "Twenty Something"
