I just watched this movie and I'm disappointed to say I did not like it at all. It's so slow Slow and uninteresting. This Harry Potter boy plays a shy teenager with a rude mother, and then one day the rude mother tells the boy to find a job so they can accommodate an apparently seemingly old man with no place to live and start living with his family and then child will work for an old lady. And this old lady who lives alone teaches you about the girls, driving the car and life! I could not how an 18 year old guy enjoyed spending time with a horrible lady in her 80s. Sorry if my comments on this movie bothered people who might have liked it, I may be wrong, since I am not British and I may not understand the social and their family structure and way of life. Mostly the film is made for the British public.
