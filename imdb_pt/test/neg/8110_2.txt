I found this movie to be a complete waste of 96 minutes. Jones was a strange child and very confused! According to my memory, which may be wrong, he was not only 16 or 17 years old? ** Spoiler ** Why did he leave college and rented an apartment with two crazy girls who rivaled boys for a while? and the cowboy who lives under Jones also scared me, as I knew that what happened in the apartments did not pass me by for a minute. I do not understand his thinking about the girl who took pictures for fun and stayed in her room when mandy moore was always over and it was obvious she wanted to be more than his friend. I really did not find this movie funny or artistic or dramatic or anything, I thought it was stupid and a complete waste of time (D-F +)
