Not the best of the Lone Star series, but it moves quickly with good performances. Presented as "Sandy's Singin" in the main title, John Wayne as a "singing cowboy" is not successful - you never see a close-up of him while he's singing. 'The current singer is the director's son, Bill Bradley, who sounds like many popular singers of the day such as Hutch or Joseph Wagstaff. The film features: Cecilia Parker (also seen on "The Lost Jungle," "Tombstone Canyon," and older sister Marian in the Andy Hardy movies) doing her best Katherine Hepburn - "Really they should not, actually I'm not"; Al St. John, before he literally became "Fuzzy" filling up all of his screen time available with his characteristic head-scratching, scratching hat and chin business, grimacing and clumsy physical gestures and motions; George (pre-Gabby) Hayes as a pipe-smoking gentle father; and Forrest Taylor, a veteran of 395 films and TV shows, playing the oily villain with bow tie and cigar. <br /> <br /> Fun or strange moments: the great trick of Yakima Canutt 'under diligence'; the 'gay' scene when Singin 'Sandy ties Bert and Elmer face to face, drags them tethered to their horse and tosses them into Kincaid's office, where Kincaid says, "You're a handsome pair of lovebirds!"; Denton's enthralling commentary after atrocious music and a guitar playing by 'Sandy' - "Ummm. I could hear this all night!"; Kincaid's response, We will not get into it, "after being told by a farmer" You have the soul of a snake! "And, of course, he utters the immortal," I made Denton an offer he can not refuse. "<br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is saved by Kincaid fooling Sandy, and then saying the three magic words in many of those films:" I'm from Washington. "FDR saved us from the Depression!" (That's why villains are always bankers or real estate?) <br /> <br /> The sequence of shootings was taken from Bradbury's "Man from Hell's Edges" (1932) Lone Star westerns are special because of their unique mix of interesting characters, the actors and stunt troupe, and the spin on the clich√©s and background repetitive stories and situations, which is a bit low, spoiled by the inappropriate and - I used the "Singing Cowboy" trick.
