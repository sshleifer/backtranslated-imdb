So this ugly guy with long, nasty hair and his girlfriend end up in this house and argue and argue about his old girlfriend. It was supposed to be scary, but he did not see anything scary. There is some mention of a sea demon, but that is not going anywhere. I wanted it to be because then I would take the strain out of the jealous love triangle. The title of the movie makes it look like it would be a scary and exciting movie, but it's so far from it that I could not believe it. I waited and waited for it to end and I was so happy when it happened. It did not live up to the title as it should have been so boo hoo hoo. The cover had a nice image, but I should not judge a bad movie by its cover.
