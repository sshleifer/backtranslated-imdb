In this movie everything that was possible was wrong and I do not know why I bothered to watch it until the end. It would have been more fun to see paint dry. For crying out loud I even liked D-Tox and it was so much better than that. Here's the basic plot for you: A rustic is bitten by snakes who hold the evil of 13 murderers and becomes a killing machine undead that kill teenagers who have no personality. During the movie I lost hope when it did not scare me when the killings were bad and there was blood CGI and CGI snakes. It got worse with the thin cardboard characters killing her friend, holding her off her legs and not letting go, so she was impaled by a tree and when the bad guy moved under the water like the Jaws shark. I'm still annoyed because I still bothered with it. I think because I'm a fan of horror movies.
