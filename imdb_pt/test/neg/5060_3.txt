Having spent six years writing and producing, Luc Besson returns to the board of directors with Angel-A. I'm a big fan of LÃ©on, and I really liked the prospect of a French black and white movie of the same guy. <br /> <br /> Andre is a liar and gambling addict, owing money to almost all the moneylenders in Paris. Unable to pay his debts, and tired of being trapped on the edge of the Eiffel Tower, he decides to kill himself. He happens at the same time as a mysterious woman, whom he decides to save. Determined to thank him, she begins to help him fix his own life. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a few laughs, which go well everywhere. The visuals are quite nice and work well with the sights of Paris. But that's it. That's all the movie has for it. And these mere two facets can not do anything to contain the torrent of films that the movie sets off. Although I can not criticize the main character immensely (his inconsistencies are close), the namesake is hideous. A terrible presence on the screen and bitterly annoying. The plot is ridiculously inconsistent, and sometimes bizarrely silly, particularly the ending; an end that completely bleeds the incipient redemption engendered by the scenes immediately preceding it. Maybe the most ridiculous scene I've ever had the shame to watch, be stupid, indulgent, melodramatic, and pretty awful too horrible to be "so bad it's funny." The film's general premise may have had potential, but it is brutally massacred by the relentlessly terrible implementation of its ideas. The film really was a chore to watch, and one that made me scream on the screen all the time. <br /> <br /> Massively and immeasurably flawed, Angel-A is simply bad. Although his occasionally entertaining dialogue succeeds in bursts of laughter at odd intervals, in the end it is clear that this film is nothing but disgusting.
