This is a perfect example of the crap terror of the 90's. Nothing is scary here and the movie is almost bloodless. Yes, there is some violence, but everything is politically correct as in a TV movie. This is not a completely bad image, I can safely say that I found it very enjoyable. However, the lack of originality really hurts "Voodoo". All in all, if you are a part of the mainstream public and pseudo-horror movies as "Scream" are your favorites, then you love "Voodoo", but if you want something very horrible avoid this movie.
