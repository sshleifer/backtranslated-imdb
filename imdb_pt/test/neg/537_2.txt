I would have to agree with the previous reviewer: This movie has an incredible animation, but it has problems throughout the rest of the film. The plot holes are huge, the dialogue barely explains plot concepts - the PLOT'S MAIN POINTS are not even explained until the last five minutes of the movie. The characters claim the obvious, while they can not explain the film's most confusing points. There are characters that appear and matter in history that are never explained - most of them have names that are mentioned only once *, and is extremely confusing to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. Unless you're in it for a good laugh and as DUMB is.
