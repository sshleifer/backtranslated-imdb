It's a pity, in fact, that the script for this movie had more holes than you could imagine (intentional mixed metaphor), because Kinski and Coyote - both extremely talented artists who are capable of great subtlety and nuance - have wonderful chemistry together and always provocative Fairuza Balk also did not hurt the mix. Jeremy Piven would have been great here too if his character (and all the other supporting characters) had not been written as a plot device. As for the main proceedings, the writers simply did not know how to create the appropriate tension to blame or to blame the character of Kinski - instead, they gave us confusion, contradiction and, in the end, frankly let's wait for the viewers - do not realize the claptrap.
