The movie "The Cave" has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There was no plot, no plot, and the lighting was terrible. During most of the film, I could not understand the scenario, as it was being highlighted by flashlights. The persistent "gray" spaces throughout the film were tiring. The only scene that really came out clearly was in the cave lit by what appeared to be a poor simulation of the conditions found in hell. All in all, the movie was not worth watching. If producers can not do better than that, they must find another occupation. The underwater scenes were particularly terrible, mostly made of bubbles and lanterns, with an occasional glance at the actors. In short, a really horrible movie with poor lighting, strange flashes everywhere.
