My paraphrase above the slogan on the back of the DVD box summarizes: this movie was much more horrible than horrifying. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've seen since I remember. My wife accidentally rented it thinking it was the Tom Cruise version. The ridiculously rude special effects on the menu screen should have given us the impression that we were losing interest. Free nudity already at the opening scene has left us more suspicious. <br /> <br /> But as the movie went by, we were numb by the awkward acting - both above and below - not continuity in the direction. and editing, banal writing and gross special effects. We give up after half an hour or less; Once it started badly, it could not get any better. <br /> <br /> Since I despise criticism that shows a product without giving details, here are some examples of especially difficult times, even if they are spoilers. : The leader says goodbye to his eldest son, since the latter is about to leave with his mother, the last because it is his wedding anniversary, but the leadership is not coming due to sudden business. The son asks, quietly worried, "Am I going to see you again?" Maybe it should seem like a premonition, but instead it seems like incongruous behavior to a child of that age in that situation. <br /> <br /> - A huge alien spacecraft crashed to Earth and sits in a huge crater. . A crowd of people are nearby, looking at him uneasily, but otherwise looking generally helpless. A woman finally says "it's gi-normous!" After this office ruined a village and its inhabitants, the lead and a spectator, now alone near their houses and trying to load their cars for an escape, make a change like this, in a tone silently intrigued : "What was that, anyway?" "I do not know ..." - A crowd trying to evacuate on a bridge is blocked by the military, since part of the bridge is destroyed. When an alien ship shoots an explosive, the crowd begins to flee, apparently only because a director told them and not because they are frightened or in any real danger, let alone unusual circumstances. <br /> And so on ... writing about the film falls short of the experience of actually seeing it. But please, PLEASE, save yourself the hassle, even if your morbid curiosity is aroused! The film is so bad that it can not even be enjoyed as unintentional humor (versus, say, King Vidor's "Solomon & Sheeba," starring Yul Brynner wearing a wig). Life is too short to waste watching such nonsense. There must be something more productive and enjoyable to do, such as walking the dog or cleaning a cage.
