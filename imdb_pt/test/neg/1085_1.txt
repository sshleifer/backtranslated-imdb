This movie was pure boredom from beginning to end. Okay, so I greet Boorman for raising world recognition of events in Burma, but that's all he achieves. About 10 minutes after the movie I thought "oh no, here we go again", and I could have told you exactly what would happen in the next 80 minutes. Patricia Arquette was out of her importance in such a role, and her acting was wooden and unconvincing. Remember to be overwhelmed with such a conventional script, maybe the boredom would set in, and that was reflected on the screen. Much of the film was simply laughable. At one stage, Arquette's elderly companion is shot and lying prostrate on the ground. In the next scene, he is running through the forest, obviously trying to break the world record of 100 meters! Or maybe he's just trying to get away from Boorman !! If you find it difficult to sleep one night, then play Beyond Rangoon on your VCR and you will be snoring in no time. I very rarely criticize a movie as heavily as this, but in this case it is completely justified.
