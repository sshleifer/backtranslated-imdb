In order not to be bored during "Love and Sex," I first tried to think of all the movies that it imitated: "Breaking Up," with Russell Crowe and Salma Hayek (despite having a more original ending), "About Last Night" with Rob Lowe, and many TV shows. <br /> <br /> Second was to admire how beautiful Framke Janssen is, so I could not believe for a nanosecond that she might have a problem getting a date. She's certainly in line to give Julia Roberts a chance for her money, literally - and Julia was not in some movie with that same plot or another? <br /> <br /> Third was to try to find out why the writer / director bothered to give the character of Jon Favreau the Jewish name of Adam Levy; he even refers with admiration to eating a ham sandwich. <br /> <br /> Fourth was trying to figure out why some critics gave a good review and that's why I was in the theater. <br /> <br /> (originally written 9/2/2000)
