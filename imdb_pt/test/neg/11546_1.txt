This movie intends to show a middle-class family's attempt to find out what is sinking in late 1960's America. Their trip to a rock festival is as far as their old refurbished bus sits. Without exception, the characters are superficial stereotypes. <br /> <br /> If you want to know which well-established Hollywood actors were desperate for a salary in those days, just look at the credits. Sal Mineo, I had forgotten how much his career had hit the skates! Thank God, his career has recovered before his untimely death. <br /> <br /> The writers of this television turkey had no idea. Out of weeding, his ideas about the "hippie movement" were laughable.
