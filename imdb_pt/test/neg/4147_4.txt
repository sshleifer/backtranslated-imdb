I really wanted to like this movie because I love Troma and I loved the trailer and I loved "Ghouls", another Ferrin movie. He had some good times, such as the old people's love song playing in the scene of the car accident, and a scene near the end, where the protagonist gets some closure. But overall, it was just annoying and slightly unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The "unimaginable" shocks that Ferrin created were actually predictable and worn out. Coconut, murder prostitutes, incest. It could still have been good but badly done. I'm not sure if I was trying to offend, amuse or both. In the end, none of them. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, we watch Troma movies because we want movies with hearts. This movie did not consistently feel as if it had heart. There were some good scenes, but it was monotonous and unpleasant after all.
