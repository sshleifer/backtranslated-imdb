Imagine an ISLAND OF GILLIGANs in the African desert in modern times. Add people not nearly as excited as Skipper or Marianne - and enough distress to fill the office of a German psychiatrist. Add a plot that gets interesting only episodic and literary parallelism that never deepens enough to really satisfy. Season with a truly dark theme that has been explored since the world's first travelers found themselves very, very lost. <br /> <br /> If THE KING IS ALIVE was not a product of Dogme 95's czares du jour, is this film getting so much attention? Dogma 95 is the Hollywood as the modern Dane is rococo. A by-product of digital technology, this Scandinavian movement seeks - quite dogmatically - to eliminate artificiality in filmmaking, using more natural elements and returning to the essence of the narrative. PEARL HARBOR, for example, is the Antichrist Dogma. The saga of director / co-author Kristian Levring ponders about interpersonal relationships and human nature when placed under the fire of a life-threatening situation. Eleven people aboard a bus passing through the dunes of Namibia suddenly find themselves stranded in the remnants of an abandoned city. An African inhabitant who does not speak his language serves as an observer and narrator (whose insights are among the most incisive in the film). While the strongest go for a five-day hike to the nearest village, the others are left behind, surviving from pickled carrots and circling to their future likely as vulture food. The former thespian Henry decides that this unattractive crew needs a detour, and writes KING LEAR by hand by rote. He assigns roles, and the group spends many days learning lines and rehearsing in an effort to divert their attention from the seemingly unavoidable. <br /> <br /> Gradually the cast begins to lose it, and the wildness of its nature? Or William Golding could say that human nature begins to emerge. If you've seen Lord of the Flies, you know that these things can get ugly, that being in a life-saving situation can turn even Mother Teresa into the PMS spa in Calcutta. <br /> <br /> The film was shot using an international ensemble of American, English, French and South African actors who, according to dogma dogma, develop themselves and their roles in a very organic way. The king was also filmed in chronological order, adding a sense of realism to the growing despair of his characters. After up to three handheld cameras recorded in digital, the results were transferred to the 35mm film. <br /> <br /> The most compelling performance comes from Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays a Boho Pop Tart trying to reinforce the spirits of the group in any way she can. Henry (David Bradley) is another finely-played character, whose passion for the work of his life ultimately saves the gang from utter despair. It is difficult to feel sorry for others - cruel wives and despicable husbands, old bristling old men, moody French intellectuals, rich men who have more important places to be abandoned than in the Namibian desert. Beckett may hate this question, but why is this group riding a bus through remote Africa? Life-threatening morbidity! Total despair rendered in graphic detail! A relentlessly tedious rhythm! Appreciate.
