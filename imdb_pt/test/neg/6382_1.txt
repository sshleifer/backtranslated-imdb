I got this movie from the library, and I saw that there were a lot of actors that I like (John Cleese, Ian Holm, Ralph Richardson, etc), so I got it and watched it. I had hoped Cleese would play a big role since the first billing, I was surprised to find that he had about five minutes of screen time, along with everyone I liked. This movie is incredibly useless, the characters are no one, the plot is non-existent and the ending is one of the worst endings I have ever seen. There were some funny parts, but that's about it. Stay away from this movie if you want to avoid "What?" and "Huh?", a lot. And if you do not want to waste your time. Ignore people who say this is a really funny movie ... it's not. Just stay away from her at all costs ... please.
