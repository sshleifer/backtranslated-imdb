I watched this movie by accident on TV and it was so incredibly horrible that I could not turn it off. Each piece of intelligence and intelligence was removed from Oscar Wilde's story by the inept screenwriter. That matters little, because clandestine camera work and nauseating music, which acted in a frightful way, would ruin anything resembling a decent script anyway. The worst performance comes from Patrick Stewart, who appears as the most imposing, untalented, mocking Shakespeareer as the ghost. "Get out of here!" He screams in an internship while waving his arms like a pantomime villain. A really terrible movie and why you wonder why Stewart, who can act when called to do so, has dirtied his reputation by making useless pieces like this and XMen.
