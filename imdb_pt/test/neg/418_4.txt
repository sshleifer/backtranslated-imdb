Why they did not follow the book ... I am very sad and disappointed. I was so eager to see this movie, however, if you read the book (maybe recently), it can be very difficult to stay objective. My wife had not read the book, and she loved the movie. <br /> <br /> Reasons for deception are: 1) Cern's involvement ... gone with the wind, a shame, there is a very small part at the beginning, where antimatter is created, but even that does not clinging to the facts (why not, the fact that Vittoria's father was burned with the first Illuminati brand, which is how Langdon got involved would be a perfect start to the movie_ 2) History line between the (deceased) Pope and Camerlegno completely gone ... this completely spoils the motive for antimatter theft 3) History line between Langdon and Vittoria Vetra completely non-existent <br /> All-in-all, very strange plot, and can not understand that Dan Brown allowed them to put his name on him. Maybe I should revisit this film 10 years from now, when I can not remember the excellent book anymore (a big chance to forget the book I'm afraid of) <br /> <br /> I'm really sorry for the negative criticism that was spoiled by expectations
