I totally agree with Greg in Ontario. I saw this movie today with a friend who went to the theater manager and told him, "This was possibly the worst movie I've ever seen." I've seen a lot of movies with this person, and he's very forgiving, so I was really shocked. (The trainer gave him a free pass!) I was offended with great humor in the movie (yes, the baked potato scene was at the top of the list!). My friend and I are white and we saw the film with a basically black audience. For a while I thought, maybe I can not get this movie because I'm white. Then I realized that no one was laughing. The writing was bad; the direction was bad; the timing was almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> There were some funny moments, there was a long time between them. Even Airplane Two was funnier than that, and that's a lot. <br /> <br /> I was so blown away by Snoop Dogg in Starsky and Hutch (like Huggy Bear) that I felt I was right to enjoy this movie. No. DL Hughley was funny, as usual, but his role was quite small. Tom Arnold had some funny moments like "the white guy", but most other attempts at humor were far short of expectations. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I could not attribute to this movie a rating with negative stars. .
