I've read a lot of Jane Austen in my time and I approve of several film / TV adaptations, but this one we do not need. <br /> <br /> The rating is a 2 as I would not say it's horrible so annoying that you will feel like you have wasted 90 minutes of your life. Shady script combined by acting even more dull. I heard that Billie Piper is well on Dr Who (she's not a fan, so I can not confirm), but in that she just sucks. There is absolutely no chemistry between leads. This is Austen, it's supposed to be a novel! <br /> <br /> Please do not let this get you out of Austen or historical dramas. There are many better programs to view.
