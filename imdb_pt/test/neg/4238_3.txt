Maybe in your day this movie was special. But five decades later, it seems strange, just another cinematic relic of the terrible 1950s. Stereotypes abound in this cute story about three female gold girls who settled in Manhattan penthouse in an effort to attract wealthy husbands. <br /> <br /> I do not care about the superficial theme. But the premise of the film is lame. And execution is worse. It's a romantic comedy, but I did not find it funny to laugh. The plot about an extremely short-sighted woman is about the only intelligent element in the story. The general dialogue is flat, and so is delivery. And the script structure is disconcerting. The plot keeps jumping back and forth between the three ladies. It is as if the writer could not mix the roles of the set. The result is a storyline that seems agitated. <br /> <br /> Marilyn Monroe was a good choice for her role. But Lauren Bacall was too old for her role. And Betty Grable, in her shrill voice and horrible hairstyle, was simply annoying. <br /> <br /> Color cinematography is conventional. But there were many scenes using the projection of the rear screen, contributing to a dated look. The visuals are made even worse by fantasies that smell of 1950's cheese glamor; they are terrible. Viewers must go through a fashion show, a plot that amplifies how the director of the film was hit by these cheerful rags. <br /> <br /> And then there's that orchestra. In what is possibly the worst film opening in film history, the first part of the film has an orchestra playing a somber tune. At first, I thought I was watching the introduction of the next attractions. But no, it's actually part of the movie. And the orchestra plays, and it goes on and on. There is nothing, absolutely nothing, what to do with history. What were they thinking? <br /> <br /> I liked Marilyn Monroe with her breathless voice as she bimbos her way through the plot. But the film would have been much better if they had abandoned the other two roles, abandoned the orchestra, reinforced the comedy dialogue and downplayed garish and extravagant costumes.
