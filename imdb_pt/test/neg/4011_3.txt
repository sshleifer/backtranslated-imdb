I watched this last night at Sundance. Altman must be the most successful director of all time. This show, despite its "stellar power," is totally irresistible, and its political insights - which I, as proud liberal, are by no means discordant - are shallow and awkward, and seem to be torn from the USA Today headlines, the fact is that it comes out of the mouth of someone as dear as Mario Cuomo. The drama as such is not very dramatic, and the comedy is not funny. The only points of interest, in fact, are to see how New Yorkers live their lives, and the loyalty of a cast and crew to reassemble a show that keeps insisting on some cult of 1988. Sometimes it seems that Altman's only contribution to the movies has been the art of having all his actors talking at the same time, and the effect of it is to feel depressed as if he were a stranger in a marriage.
