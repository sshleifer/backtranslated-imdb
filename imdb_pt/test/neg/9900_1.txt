This made for the TV movie is about every clich√© you can concoct for a disaster movie. The only problem is that it is not very well done. <br /> <br /> My brain is still insulted by scenes in which Brian Dennehy is supposedly looking at a computer monitor looking for weather patterns and showing that the monitor is working. scenes of meteorological turbulence wings The commercials of Meteorological Channels. Why watch local news footage of a collapsed side street reveal global weather patterns? You got me. <br /> <br /> Also interspersed in the first two hours are some of the worst CGI effects known to man. Pay attention to the truck and the airplane that appear to have been processed on a Commodore 64. All the harangues in this "movie" are made with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, the dialogue is forced and I do not I can think of a nice character that I want to survive in the second half. <br /> <br /> The character I hate most is the stupid wife that the husband is cheating on. Maybe if she lifted a finger at any point during the show, instead of being a defenseless woman standing in the same 10 square feet of the kitchen all day, her husband would not be sleeping with the PR representative of a rival energy company. She is so helpless that, in fact, I want to get her out of her and my misery. I hope everyone in this "movie" dies in the second half.
