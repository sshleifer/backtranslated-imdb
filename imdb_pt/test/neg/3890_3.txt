Before you begin, a "small" correction: IMDb claims that Richard Gere is 180 cm tall. Wrong! I went through it 10 years ago, and it can not be an ant ** greater than 165. I'm 183 years old, and he looked like a child by my side. <br /> <br /> It should have been called "Wheatlands"; an appropriate title to complement Malick's previous (and much better) "Badlands" film. This film shows that not all directors have as their main goal to entertain. In fact, some of them have as main objective to show the wheat in all its splendor. <br /> <br /> The film is depressing and relatively unfathomable, with the tragic end obligatory. Nothing more than an average and predictable drama of the love triangle, with the male two-thirds of the triangle not surviving the film. Praised for its visual quality; although it has the realistic 70's, there are limits on how wheat fields can be fascinating. You can shoot them with 1500mm cameras, for all I care about, but they're still wheat fields. <br /> Generate, which at first seems rather like a low-class factory worker who turned into wheat field. -worker, is quite solid, while Brooke Adams appears distant and cool for most of the film, making it a wonder how much she loved either piece. But for those looking for a movie that displays all the glorious colors of a wheat field, look no further: you've found your dream! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my "biographies" of Richard Gere and other Hollywood intellectual heavyweights, contact me by email.
