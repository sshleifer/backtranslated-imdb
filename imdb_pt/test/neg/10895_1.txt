This movie has to be the biggest disappointment I've ever experienced with a movie. The acting is horrible, the suspense increases the minimum and the plot in general is ridiculous. I found myself hoping the victim would simply hurry and become a victim because she obviously had to be driven from her misery. Anyone with rudimentary knowledge of how the world works will be immediately disgusted with the leaps we ask for in logic, and the so-called suspense training would be lucky if it made a 3-year-old slightly worried. I'm appalled that a sequel is planned because that means they're going to ask us to swallow a secondary line again. If this is an example of Raw Feed work, I think I'm going to avoid any and all of their future films.
