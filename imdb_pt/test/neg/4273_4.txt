This is a big disappointment. The main problem is the acting. Sylvestre le Touzel is very poor as Fanny, and the rest is not much better, everyone is very formal and unnatural. Also the camera work is much of 1980, ie tight and bouncy, compared to the likes of the 1995 P & P, for example. <br /> <br /> The script is very, very faithful to the book, and there are some decent expressions that should have been cut. <br /> <br /> In all respects this is far inferior to the recent film version, which although it has taken great liberties with the book, seemed much more faithful to the spirit of the book and was much more enjoyable.
