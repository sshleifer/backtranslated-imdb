This movie basically uses conjugal rape as one of its main comedic devices. Now I turned it off at the point where it literally tied it to the bed and raped it, but I can not imagine how it turned out to be something endearing and funny. This film not only squandered a wonderful cast and was consistently bland, it actually managed to be quite brutally disturbing and misogynist. How so many people seem to find a sweet family movie is beyond me. "I certainly enjoyed canning those apricots last night" is not a funny joke when you know this refers to forcing an unwilling virgin to have sex with you in the hope that she eventually learns to like her. Watching an idiot is not fun for the family. I honestly feel worse for having watched half of this creepy "comedy" and am totally baffled by these positive comments.
