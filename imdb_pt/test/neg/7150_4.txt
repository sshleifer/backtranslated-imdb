Everything this movie has tried to do is done better - and superbly in "Run Lola Run." The Red Haired Hip Cutie, the Critical Term (s), The Lover in Peril, and the "Crime-Pay Times" message. BUT, unlike "Lola," it simply is not believable or well placed. It's hard work that could have worked for me if I had seen it before "Lola" - but it's nothing compared. Yes! The falling beetle was good! But that was the only surprise in the movie. Do yourself a favor and see Real McCoy - (and the REAL hip Red Head!) - in Run Lola Run!
