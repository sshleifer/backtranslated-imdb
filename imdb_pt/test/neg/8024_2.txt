It's funny ... the day before I saw this movie I was watching a documentary about Leni Riefenstahl, so the comparison came automatically ... of course there is none :) <br /> <br /> movie is weak in all aspects ... acting is not convincing (especially who plays Simona ...) and is not natural ..., confusing edit and always leaves an unfinished shooting taste, music does not fit, history does not flow, it gets boring and the movie goes out for a lot longer than it is ... oh, and the characters are not very well shown, you really can not talk much about the girls (except what you see). .. The movie also tries to bang explicit shenanigans (which is very ridiculous :) <br /> <br /> So ... 2/10
