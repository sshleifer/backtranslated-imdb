Horrible, stupidly empty movie dealing with corruption at the Louisiana Timber Company. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the state of Louisiana seems corrupt and inept. A member of the English Department of the college can only sign his name with an X. When it seems that a Senator (Victor Moore) is coming to the state to investigate, everyone there tries to blame the character Bob Hope innocent, but foolish. <br /> <br /> It is no wonder that Vera Zorina did not get the role of Mary in 1943, "By Whom the Bell Gates?" <br /> <br /> Of course, the corrupt officials along with Hope try to show pictures of Zorina with Moore, in order to ruin him politically. Moore marries the head of the restaurant that he had insulted when he ordered a ham sandwich. He thought the reason she was upset was because it was a kosher restaurant. This is the extent of humor that is the absolute mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> When Hope tries to defend himself in Congress, he takes a picture of James Stewart in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington". Until then the film is far too far away for any good response. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics are absolutely terrible. This song praising Louisiana, sung in many ways, is absolutely terrible. Did Irving Berlin have anything to do with the music of this absolutely terrible movie?
