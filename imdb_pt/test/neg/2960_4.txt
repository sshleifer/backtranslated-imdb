This elaborate, sloppy spy melodrama with two boozy Californian sons (an idealist, a drug addict) who treat secrets to the KGB never seems strong enough to sustain any tension and suspense before dying very slowly two hours later. John Schlesinger's final product gives the impression that he was sleeping in the director's chair most of the time, while the film stands still and the actors sleep on foot, except for Sean Penn's highly annoying performance. Chris (Tim Hutton) and Daulton (Penn) plan to sell secrets to the KGB when Chris gets a job that gives him access to secret government materials. Disillusioned with what he sees as US meddling in foreign affairs, drug-hungry idealist Chris and Daulton make contact with the Russians and begin channeling them to secret materials. When Chris decides he wants to leave things begin to unfold at an indifferent pace. <br /> <br /> The 80s were not kind to the illustrious director John Schlesinger. In the 1960s and 1970s, he had a number of critically acclaimed films in England and America, but then came Honky Tonk Freeway in 1981 and marked the beginning of the end. The Falcon and the Snowman more or less put a cap on it. Missing the suspense of Marathon Man and the quality performances (Hoffman Voight, Christie, Jackson, Finch, Olivier), he had been persuaded of clues in the past. Falcon walks in circles most of the way. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn chews on landscapes from beginning to end in such an unpleasant way that you find yourself encouraging your torturers to do more with it. Tim Hutton is governed by his limited acting skills and most of his scenes show the need for more rehearsal time. Lori Singer as Hutton's girlfriend plays dumb most of the time with Schlesinger's content to film his insipid expressions. When it emits you understand why. Only David Suchet, as the manipulator of the KGB, with a penetrating introspective presence and restraint, absolves himself well.
