Okay, this movie was not good. Video games are not what I would boast about if I was over 15 years old. Cool to play, but writing a comment about video game players might like this movie, it's weird. Just play a video game, do not invent a sad story about getting stuck in one. I use my cell phone, I hope I do not lose my girlfriend in this. Grease being the worst of them all? OK, Grease has a very well thought-out story as well as being a musical. Even if you do not like musicals, anyone would say Grease is good. My brother plays video games all the time and he watched 30 minutes and left because it was so horrible. I feel sleepy.
