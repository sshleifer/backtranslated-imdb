Move over Hands. Get away from Boogens. You do not have to be a Baby Genius to know that Malibu Beach Vampires (MBV for the rest of this volume) is now and always will be (unless someone makes a sequel to Zarkorr The Invader) the worst movie ever. The only horror of that is watching him. I wonder if this was an attempt by someone to meet girls through a movie. If this were the case, babies are not babies so this is not a movie. It's the dreck. Do not wait. I dishonor the word dreck by calling it dreck. Ulli Lommel (of Boogey Man's fame) would call it "uber dreck" or Schei√üe. It should be used to torture prisoners. If you find him on a shelf at a music store, walk away from him in silence and notify the authorities.
