In the wake of the matrix, this farce of a film with loose connections to VR was re-released with the slogan "The Matrix has just won Deadler!", In a box with a very Matrix-inspired cover (still called "Expect to Die"). . Although). Due to the choice of source, however, the tag-line looks to everyone as if it says "Beablier." Anyway. <br /> <br /> To complete the transformation for the aspiring Matrix, they mocked a fight scene with a Morpheus-a-like on the back of the box. It may be important to know that this character DOES NOT APPEAR ON THE MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a farce on all levels. Jalal Mehri is a horrible actor and does not impress with his martial arts. However, his partner Stone is played by Evan Lurie, who in this movie is simply the worst actor I have ever seen. Clearly he was chosen to make Jalal look good in comparison. Worst movie I've seen in a long time.
