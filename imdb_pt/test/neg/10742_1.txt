--------- SPOILER ALERT ---------------------------- This was The worst of the series, is terror disguised as political satire and is as subtle as a sleigh, not too scary and not very insightful. Micheal Moore has something to do with this garbage? <br /> <br /> I am very tired of Hollywood using entertainment as a political campaign against George Bush and constantly repeating the same points of discussion over and over again. This movie wants to be DeathDream, but unlike that movie that subtly tackled the problems of soldiers who came back from Vietnam making the main character come back as a zombie who wants blood and slowly built on this theme: it was a true horror movie that was also a good social commentary, because it has not become hypocritical, exploitable and prejudiced. I think Joe Dante thought that this was trying to make a horror movie to scare Republicans, Conservatives and Libertarians and I being the last on this list found this movie totally ridiculous, manipulative and exploitative at the same time and I do not mean the good kind of exploration you often find in drive-in movies, I mean exploitation in the meanest and vile way: using the deaths of our soldiers as a manipulative political statement disguised as a horror movie . <br /> <br /> This film assumes that all soldiers who died in Iraq would vote against a Conservative president if they came to life as zombies, which is a wrong premise because, from what I mostly remember, and following the rules of George Romero; zombies are stupid, carnivorous creatures, operating with pure impulse and even though the zombie Andy in DeathDream could talk, he could not really hold a conversation and he was driven by his addiction to human blood. Okay, zombies are stupid creatures driven by impulse and not by intellect and obviously they are dead, so why would dead people vote in the first place? My interpretation of this film is that the only war that a Liberal Democrat can win is having dead, mindless people voting him, I think they meant that people who vote for presidents like George Bush are the irrational zombies while the real stupid zombies, actually are those who make the decisions of intellectual sounds. Yes, whatever. Dawn of the Dead approached this idea much better, but used the idea of ​​irrational consumerism. This movie is not Dawn of the Dead by any stretch of the imagination. <br /> <br /> The film addresses the issue while the soldiers are alive that most of them voted for Bush as president, but after they die they would vote for a liberal anti-war Democrat after they are zombies, who normally are considered brain-dead creatures and ridiculously have them destroyed after voting. <br /> <br /> If you are going to do a zombie movie, Mr. Dante and invoke the name of George Romero, you'd better have stupid zombies who like to split people and eat their intestines, not zombies that vote I also like how zombies are just "evil" conservatives who support war. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie with social commentary, skip this trashy garbage and watch DeathDream. <Br /> <br /> The worst of the Master of Horror Series hands down.
