I loved the first film, the second was good, disappointed John Cleese was no longer jean bob as he is my favorite character. But the third ... what happened to the animation ??? It seems low budget like a cartoon Saturday morning! with the exception of the flashback that was taken from the first movie. They really should have stopped after the number 2, this just makes the rest look bad !! Derek's voice changed, but it's not as recognizable as jean bob. Rogers also seems very strange. I also do not understand where Rothbart came from. I thought he died! This movie made me want to turn it off as much as I love the first one, I was very disappointed with this plot. They will never hit the original! :)
