Ha ha! Firstly, if you've never seen a "movie-size" for a real treat! Known mainly for horror films / slasher SUPER LOW BUDGET, "Beowulf" was no exception. <br /> <br /> However, this video was more in the ultra-tacky style. I missed the K-R-A-F-T tag on the side. <br /> <br /> Consider the anachronisms! (something out of place and in time) <br /> <br /> We had: candles, armor, swords ... <br /> <br /> However, we saw: telescopes, soles, lighters, tall Speakers, Electricity, Body Bags, Aluminum cans and spoons / forks. <br /> <br /> Not bad for something that happens as in the 8th century! <br /> <br /> This is not a horror movie, it's a horrible movie. It's very laughable. It really is a comedy made to look like a horror movie! I could not stop laughing! <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert ("The Highlander Series") - must have really fallen into his career if he's working for Dimension Films. <br /> <br /> I learned my lesson though. I'll be looking at the movie studios in the videos, much more closely now. <br /> <br /> CLASSIFIED WITHOUT ROLLS OUT OF FIVE. If you want to have a good laugh, it's hard to let go of this job! <br /> <br /> This movement had some cleavage on some points - I especially liked the blond bimbette! <br /> <br/> Wayno <br /> <br />
