First, let me clarify that I am a big fan of bad science fiction, especially when it involves gigantic and domineering monsters of the city. But this one is so fantastically stupid that I can not even like being bad. They apparently did not cut enough money out of the budget, leaving out the props (the only prop we have to indicate the size of the alien girl is an oversized pencil, available at Spencer's Gifts for about fifteen bucks). to disburse by concept or plot. The monster looks fine, in my opinion, but does not have enough interaction with the funds, meaning there is not enough destruction to suit most fans of the genre. The general rule of giant monster movies is: if you do not have many fake-looking buildings to crush then you'd better have another fake-looking monster to fight. This movie does not have any. I can not make my final complaint about the movie without revealing the ending, but just say the origin of the monster, and the method found to get rid of it, just do not hold water. Not as good as most of these movies. Skip this.
