I tried to watch it twice, although I have not been able to do any episode. For me, it's basically not funny. I can tell you where to laugh, but I can not. I've never seen the original so I'm not comparing. I also love comedies, including exaggerated comedies like Married ... With Children and Family Guy, but this show does not do it for me. The jokes are lame and weak, and the acting is the most annoying part. The commercials did seem interesting, but it's not. They are trying to be very different, and tying to force the mood. This style generally does not work very well. I do not think this show ends the season. Of course I could be wrong.
