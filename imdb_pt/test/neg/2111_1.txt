Can I start by saying that I'm a fan of bad movies? And this is a really bad movie. He states in front of 100 passengers, 3,000 snakes, but I think it's more accurate to say 12 passengers and about 20 snakes. <br /> <br /> Snakes do not do anything particularly interesting, the whole movie actually just mistakes with little happening. Although there is occasionally a great shot of pulsing arms and green vomit (bad movies have to have green goo, do not you?). <br /> <br /> But then the ending appears and it will literally hurt you. of his seat in hysteria. and for that, this movie has an increase of up to 2 *. <br /> <br /> There are certain movies in the world that you will want to show to your friends, just so you can watch a reaction when a certain event happens in them. <br /> <br /> For example: The arrival of 'Big Man' in R Kelly's 'trapped in the closet' 'The LINE' in 'Shark Attack 3' (you will know when you hear) The arrival of the breast shark in 'Shark Attack 3' Almost all 'troll 2' scenes The end of 'Dracula 3000' (only for total disbelief and confusion) and the end of this film proudly falls into this category. It's worth sitting for just that. So get drunk, stoned, whatever your poison and watch this movie with some friends. <br /> <br /> Simply, if you like bad movies, take this, but do not confuse with 'Snakes on a plane' ... it has no relation. <br /> <br /> And do not pay more than a fiver for it too ....
