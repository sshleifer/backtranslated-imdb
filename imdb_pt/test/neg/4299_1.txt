I found this movie at the flea market for cheap. I was so excited because I thought it was a skateboarding movie. I got home to put in, the rules of previews and the opening scene with the old guy rolling down the street on the skateboard was amazing. At that moment I realized it was a post-apocalyptic movie, but I still had high hopes for it. This movie was awful. A friend of mine was stoned when we watched and even he thought it was horrible and a waste to be high. I kept falling asleep during the movie because it was so boring and the music was totally awful. I do not know if during the apocalypse all good music, and all music that is just kind of crap is destroyed and the whole memory of how to play this is clean, but I think I'd rather die than have to endure that crap. Also what the hell was going on with the TV studio? I can only assume that this film was adapted from an old Greek piece with the names and title but some pieces should not be adapted into a futuristic science fiction setting. Or at least not by the people involved in this movie. If you are forced to watch this movie, I can only suggest bringing a handgun and ending before the end. It would be a good movie to kill yourself too, everyone will understand why.
