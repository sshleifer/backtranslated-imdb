In a word, horrible ... many plot holes .. um, yeah ... Who takes your son to unearth a corpse in the middle of the night? and what about his wife stealing the skeleton ... who does that? Why exactly did the psychiatrist stab him in the neck? and that whole dog thing ... I mean, really! Having Sparrow narrating from the beginning also completely destroyed the suspense for me. I mean, if he's telling the story, clearly he's lived to tell, so there's no chance he's going crazy. Where's the suspense there? <br /> <br /> Of course you expect to make a hole in a movie like this. But there are so many that I have completely lost the story because of them. What kind of name is Fingerling? Or Toppsy? Why did the wife unearth the body? (Who does that?) Or go into that crazy madhouse alone? And where did all those candles come from? Why does the writer have his mailbox in the damn book? I mean, come on ... And the book just found its way to the bookstore next to the wife's bakery? Very convenient ... Oh and Happy Birthday Dear, here is a book about a serial killer .. What a PENSIVE gift! The book has 20 pages, half of which are empty, and it takes ALWAYS to read it. If he's really obsessed with this book, would not he have read it all at once? <br /> <br /> Somewhat convenient for him to bump into his future wife (carrying a cake!) About 23 seconds after being released from a psychiatric hospital .. how old was he playing? 36 ?? <br /> <br /> I was the only one in the end cheering for the bus to end the guy? Not good when you're cheering for the protagonist to bite you in the end. <br /> <br /> Looks like this was written by the committee .. I guess the first draft probably had nothing to do with the number 23 ... It looks like they needed a hook to lure the audience into thinking that there was something supernatural going on, when in the end it really did not seem to have anything to do with anything. I mean, I was not expecting the godfather or anything, but everything about this movie was a complete disappointment. Without all the material of numerology, this movie could have been really good, rather than some imitation of Se7en. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, with no hilarious intent and, otherwise, a total snoozer.
