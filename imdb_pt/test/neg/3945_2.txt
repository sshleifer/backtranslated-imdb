Stay Alive has a history very much like some Asian horror movies that include technology in history. Some of these Asian horror movies are One Missed Call, Ringu and Pulse.So, the idea of ​​Stay Alive is very cliché and obvious, but the filmmakers behind it did not know how to put something new or interesting to the clichés in staying alive.This All the elements of Stay Alive belong to the worst class of "horror" movies: shallow characters, no suspense, stupid 'horror' that makes you laugh and light violence. It's easy to notice that the '' director '' is unable to create something original or disturbing. I do not want to waste any more time writing about this pathetic I only give you one piece of advice: I do not see this movie. I really hated that.
