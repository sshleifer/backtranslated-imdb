Could someone please explain why anyone would want to make a British neo-noir thriller with an almost entirely American cast? The accents spoken in this movie are terrible! But entirely according to the performances, which are so wooden, one fears a game to hit the cast. <br /> <br /> Really, what kind of disgusting, stupid, cynical trash is that? Even the neo-noir movies have some character you feel or want to feel, even if you are a miserable and doomed; they at least have some decency for them, some sense that what they did is wrong, or that a seemingly good plan went awry, and that somehow they are stuck with the responsibility for it. <br /> <br /> <br/> Not in this stinking stew. These characters are putrid, betraying each other, themselves and the public. <br /> <br /> Also, note that they are of low quality - okay, nothing wrong with that - except they seem to be living a life. luxurious. For a movie supposedly about desperate thieves, the tonic here is - boring. It's all so awfully boring and scaly, I do not know. So let's rip some people out or kill them and go and have sex in a luxury hotel. What ambition! <br /> <br /> Gooping all this mess to some marshy dirt bottom are: uneven boring rhythm; predictable sequences of 'action' that are not; banal and incoherent scenographic design; Made-for-bad-camera-work and editing; forgettable score; and a whole lack of imagination or innovation in production and direction. <br /> <br /> Totally unbelievable, unacceptable, and to the less dedicated moviegoers (or masochists) like me, totally unattainable. <br /> There are other nasty things I would like to say about this nasty movie, but they would not be printed here. Suffice it to say that you'll probably find something more useful to do with your time than watching this movie - in fact, almost everything.
