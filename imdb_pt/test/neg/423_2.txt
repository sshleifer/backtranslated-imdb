I think I probably would not hate this movie if I spoke Polish. I selected the English version in the first menu, but she gave me a Polish dialogue with English subtitles, as well as the Polish version. Perhaps the dialogue was so disjointed because the person who did the captions could not translate it into English very well. To make matters worse, some of the dialogues had no subtitles. The acting was very bad, especially the female protagonist, who was melodramatic about everything! One scene that bothered me was when a German woman was caught stealing and as the crowd pushed her, her shirt opened and the director showed close-ups of her naked breast for the next 15-20 seconds. I could not see how her chest increased the drama of the scene or the movie. Maybe the director was trying to increase the number of teenage boys in the audience. Much of the film takes place at a death camp liberated by the Americans. First, the "American" uniforms looked nothing like the uniforms of the US Army. Second, none of the extermination camps in Poland were liberated by the Americans. I would have thought that a Polish filmmaker who turned 19 in 1945 would know better than an American born in 1966 that all six extermination camps were liberated by the Russians. All in all, it's not a very good movie if you do not speak Polish.
