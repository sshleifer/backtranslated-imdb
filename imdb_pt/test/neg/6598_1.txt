The writers and creators of this film should be sued ... For polluting the world with this crap! "Man In The Mirror" is actually beyond horrible! Very, far beyond! <br /> <br /> ... and people, I'm not saying this because I'm a Michael Jackson fan! Or due to the fact that this is actually one of the most retarded representations of your life that I have ever encountered! <br /> <br /> I'm saying this because this is a waste of time, money and celluloid! I feel ashamed to have seen all this! That's 1 hour and 26 minutes of my life, I will never go back! I'm telling you; watching grass grow is literally more fun than this movie! <br /> <br /> Consider yourself warned!
