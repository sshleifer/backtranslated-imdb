I just saw this movie at the Fantasy Filmfest BERLIN. I'm not impressed. <br /> <br /> As far as history goes. Also girlfriends come back from their vacation in Mexico. While waiting for their luggage, they meet some guys, who then take the last and of course the wrong bus to the city. On board is also another older man, so weird that you guessed instantly that he is one of the bad guys. The other is the driver. <br /> <br /> The bus takes them to the industrial wasteland and then one after another, a little blood, a few extremities, a little violence, mostly playing with fear of the end, after some highs and low, here are some scary moments, all are dead, but the driver and the girls. the girls end up in some garage, where one of them is dead, after confessing that she slept with the boyfriend of the other girlfriend. The other girl, which is the conclusion, is sold by the abductor who left (yes, the weirdo was killed) in some cargo box to Asia (a freight port being the final photo). First. Story. Tons of loopholes, questions you ask yourself, loose ends and a conclusion that is not a good revelation, but a total disappointment. I can not see how such a professional loser should have kidnapped dozens of women (as indicated by a drawer full of driver's licenses ... aha) Second. Mediocre performance at its best. <br /> <br /> Third. Fear factor. IT'S OK. but I AM buried by torture as a means to nothing but himself. Trading with humans may be a good reason for a horror movie, but it is not used as one, as a backdrop. Fourth Music and Sound. Some good attempts, but the sound possibilities of the industrial landscape, warehouse garage and truck sounds were not really explored. Music? It would have been worse without it, but that was it. Some pseudo-moving string theme synthesizer to emotivity when the girls arrive at their final destination. Okay, I think. <br /> <br /> Verdict: AVOID!
