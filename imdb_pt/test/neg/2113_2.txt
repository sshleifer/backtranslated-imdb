If I were British, I'd be embarrassed by this picture of incompetence. A Special Branch protection officer unable to defend himself against a sick, unarmed and untrained assailant? Does the Interior Ministry send a single "Science Advisor" to investigate a possible Level Four biological hazard, and that "Counselor" has no sense in wearing a mask and gloves? Totally unprotected London cops working side-by-side with technicians in full biologically-minded attire? Are the "Counselor" and his bodyguard holding the lair of a sociopath doctor experiencing humans with no support? Puh-leeze! One might ask whether producers could not hire technical advisors or if for some mysterious reason they consciously decided to portray the directors as hopelessly incompetent. Even my wife, who has neither medical nor law enforcement experience, was rolling her eyes in disbelief. After the first episode, I was discouraged; now that I've seen two episodes, I give up.
