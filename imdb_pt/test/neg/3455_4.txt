(Caution: various spoilers) <br /> <br /> Someday, somewhere, there will be a post-apocalyptic movie that does not stink. Unfortunately, THE POSTMAN is not that movie, although I have to give credit for trying. <br /> <br /> Kevin Costner plays someone credited only as "the postman." He is not really a postman, just a wanderer with a mule in the desert of a Western America devastated by an unspecified catastrophe. He deals with isolated villages, performing Shakespeare. Suddenly, a band of bandits called Holists, the self-declared warlords of the West, descends upon a village that Costner visits, and his evil leader, Gen. Bethlehem (Will Patton), draws Costner. After much misery and numerous efforts to break Costner's spirit, he escapes, thus ending a long section of the film that could have been best told in a three-minute flashback. <br /> <br /> Now, finally, we get to the big Premise: the runaway Costner finds an abandoned delivery truck and delivers the letters to the nearest town, hoping to get some food under the pretext of being a postman. A number of people in the village led by young Ford (Larenz Tate) want to get into this postman act, which does not fit Bethlehem and his thugs, and Costner finds himself the unconscious and involuntary leader of a band of mailmen at war with the Holists. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​The Postmen versus The Bad Guys is not as ridiculous as it sounds. Holists rely on their support for the fact that the villages they attack are isolated from each other; the Holists can destroy any village, but they can not resist all their united victims. To unite, the villages must communicate with each other, and a work mail system would therefore be a great step to put the Holists out of business. So, it really makes a lot of sense for Bethlehem to become medieval in our heroic postmen. Unfortunately, the eventual defeat of Bethlehem is not the result of the villages united against him, but his old cliché of reserve, the quarrel between him and Costner. Nor is there any real attempt by communities to use the mail to work together to solve their problems; all mail seems to be the standard material "Hi, Auntie Debbie", played for maximum sentimental value. <br /> <br /> POSTMAN is one of the most predictable, shot-to-shoot movies I've ever seen. Now, I do not purposely propose to ruin movies for myself, striving to find out what will happen next. But here we are talking about the kind of predictability that does not require effort; I only knew what would happen if I wanted to or did not know. After a lion is featured prominently eating people, a holistic bandit looking for the fugitive Costner ventures into the bushes after a noise, and then we are "shocked" when the lion devours him. A bunch of harmless villagers are surrounded and shot by a firing squad, and one of the villagers sings some Last Words Famous before being shot to my immense lack of surprise. A covert statue is revealed to show exactly what everyone knew would be there: Costner bent over to pick up a letter from a cute kid we saw earlier in the movie. A man tells Bethlehem not to sir, you can not just take my wife; Bethlehem commands the unsuspecting lawn, although he is the only person in the theater who does not suspect. <br /> <br /> But it's a sickening sentimentality that really undoes the POSTORY. Olivia Williams, who plays Costner's lover, Abby, is worse than ever. She pours her heart into the material and gives her best effort to make it look natural and sincere. She tries so hard, it breaks the heart. But no one could have made the lines "I have a gift for you, postman ... You give hope as if it were sweet in the pocket" sounds like anything but the paparazzi they are. Another example is the scene where Costner mounted thunder passing by a little boy, ignoring his offered letter, just to turn around, stare at him for what seems like five minutes, and then come back to get the letter. Why did not Costner get it the first time? No real reason; it's just an artifice that tries and fails to give us a sense of euphoria, throwing the kid's hopes and then restoring them. <br /> <br /> Schmaltz and predictability come together at the end when the postman's statue is revealed. I sat down thinking, "Please do not tell me they're going to show the statue and then cut it back to the scene with the cute kid. That's certainly sucrose, very obvious to even this movie." Then, sadly, the music swelled and we actually cut the dreaded little boy smiling while his letter to his single aunt was taken, and I held my head in my hands and thought, "Somebody throw me." It looked like I had thirty pounds of apple pie in my throat. <br /> <br /> Gen. Belém is a more humanized villain than normal. Its standard post-apocalyptic villain is the most severe and difficult. no vale Bethlehem is shown to be a little man inside, who tries to make himself feel important by beating others. Although some threat is thus sacrificed, Bethlehem is credible in a way that most villains are not. Unfortunately, Will Patton gets over it. And while they tell us early that Bethlehem completely destroyed their last opponent in five seconds of melee combat, Bethlehem's fighting skills shown at the end of the movie are absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The acting is otherwise very good. Costner did better, but his Razzie was an overreaction. As mentioned, Olivia Williams is very impressive. Larenz Tate as Ford does a sincere and credible job. The score of James Newton Howard is competent, although short the epic standards that the film was following. But it is not enough to save this movie. Rating: * 1/2 of ****.
