This movie was difficult for me to watch. Stan looked very old and sick compared to what I remembered, and Ollie was heavier than I remember in another movie. The most difficult, however, were the gaps in the script / production, where I found myself thinking, "How did they get from here to there?" It took almost half of the film before I could handle the dubbing of non-American actors - this was also a distraction. <br /> <br /> Although I miss great actors like Laurel and Hardy - will there ever be great actors like those from the old studio era ??? - this film helps me understand why actors sometimes "give up" at their peak.
