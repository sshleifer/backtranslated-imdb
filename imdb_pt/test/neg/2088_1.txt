This movie is bad, yes, but if the producers had used a REAL KANGAROO, he would have killed the actor with whom he was boxing. I am Australian and I have seen two male Roos seven feet tall fighting each other, it is not a pretty sight, because the objective is that either mate your opponent, (this is the way to guarantee the herd of females) and there is incidents where someone knocked down a kangaroo, was injured or killed, so when you see a kangaroo on TV or in the Cinema, it is likely to be a female, or Animated, since it is a good idea not to hurt the actors (they can get bored by losing the ability to breathe). There is a strange notion that Australian animals are cute and cuddly, that they are fake, many are dangerous (10 of the 12 deadliest snakes live here) and most are simply ugly (Koalas are as soft as stealing wool). So, if you come to Australia, BE CAREFUL !!!
