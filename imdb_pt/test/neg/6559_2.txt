I saw this movie recently, and I said to myself, "This movie is bad!" William Shatner is a great actor, but he is not a director! <br /> <br /> It's not just that acting is bad, it's terrible. And instead of a plot, we have a really bad script that's called a plot! What I really thought was bad was at the beginning, where Kirk and McCoy were teaching Spock to sing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat!" <br /> <br /> I have something against William Shatner? I do not. But when it comes to being a director, he sucks! This movie is not one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But it's the worst of the Star Trek series! <br /> <br /> I noticed that after this Shatner did not return to direct another film of the series. They apparently did not want him to direct another movie again after this happened! <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie sucks! <br /> <br /> 2/10
