This movie is supposed to deal with the frustrations of cinema. This certainly frustrated me with his endless boredom. The setting is an attractive Spanish seaside resort with its usual large cast. The script is very poorly written or maybe there was no script. Just an ad-lib. A far superior film about the frustrations of the cinema is Fran√ßois Truffaut's "Day For Night" made in 1973. It shows all the delays and how the cast can behave badly in an intriguing way. It does not bother the viewer and you gain sympathy for the director who somehow must complete the film.
