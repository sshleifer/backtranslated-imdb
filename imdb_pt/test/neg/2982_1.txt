The ABC people forgot to do their biographical research ... so many scenes were simply wrong! The actor who made JPII was very rigid, there was no personality there. It is very obvious that this movie was on the bottom of the programming totem, the movement is so low budget. The script is terrible. Conversations such as "You must follow the rules" "No, people are starving." Lame. Also, the movie was jumping like crazy from event to event to fit in at two o'clock. Terrible! A better use of your time would be to watch a PBS documentary on JPII. In addition, CBS has placed a miniseries in JPII that is better than ABC by far. JPII was a wonderful man, and it bothers me to think that my grandchildren can get hold of this ABC movie and think that's what it really was!
