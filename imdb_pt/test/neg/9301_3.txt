This movie stars Ben Kingsley as Frank, a killer of some Russian mobsters based in Buffalo. He is also a furious alcoholic, and this has made his work performance decrease. After he falls asleep in his car during a possible success, his uncle sends him to San Francisco, where he must attend AA meetings and get a job as an undertaker's assistant. If you are thinking that this makes absolutely no sense, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> It gets worse. Well, it actually gets better, but not before it gets much, much worse. Frank suddenly becomes a funeral home master, despite a complete lack of training, but his reactions to people at the funeral parlor and AA meetings are interesting. The viewer begins to cheer for him when they see positive changes in his life. Luke Wilson is a welcome addition as a sponsor of Frank, although he has almost nothing to do (his character tells us that he is gay, but this ends up having no meaning). The film plunges head first into idiocy with the introduction of the character Tea Leoni. She is completely unrealistic, and her role as a love interest for Frank sinks, since the two actors have no chemistry together. By the time she gets on the scene, Frank becomes much less engaging as a character. His characterization is apparently random; there is no consistency in their behavior. The comedy is discreet and just intermittently funny, especially disappointing considering the comic pedigree of the cast. <br /> <br /> Problems abound in this. Kingsley's accent is terrible and inconsistent. It alternates between Italian, Russian and Hispanic. Throughout the film, Frank tells countless people that he is a killer (including an entire AA group), but no one seems to care, or wants to do something about it. The film draws on clich√©d scenes to get him into his final act, most notably when Leoni's unbearable character chases Frank at the airport just as he is about to board a flight back to Buffalo. <br /> <br /> Although it has a strong premise and an interesting first half hour, the film quickly becomes a total disaster and turns into complete nonsense. At the end of the film, Frank celebrates a year of sobriety. I hope to celebrate many, many years without having seen "You Kill Me". <br /> <br /> My notes: D +
