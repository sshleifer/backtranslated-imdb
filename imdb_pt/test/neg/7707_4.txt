A college professor is working on creating zombies and, you do not know that, things go awry. The next thing you know, the whole campus is outdated. Thank God there are a couple of super-commands trained for such a situation. Too bad they have to be accompanied by a group of idiots, led by a rapper (he does not even bother trying to make a military guy, he just responds to his superiors as if he's doing rap with his hands). hood). The highlight of this part of the movie is the cloakroom scene. Male and female idiots share the same locker room, and military regulations apparently require all women to wear bra and black panties. Hey, if you can not make a good movie, at least you can have women in underwear. My hat is for the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> So, after much discussion about how well prepared these idiots are for work (Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq), they are all dead in a short time. . His biggest fall seems to be that it never occurs to them to turn on the lights. A typical encounter makes them enter a room and see someone at the other end. Human or zombie? I can not say. Turn on the lights? No, the idiot command protocol requires them to walk up to the person, making sure to hold the gun in such a way that it can be easily yanked out of your hand, and well, you know what to do. The disappearance of Sergeant Major Sticky Fingaz is especially entertaining - my favorite scene involving a rapper in any movie I've ever seen. Fortunately (and once again, hats for the filmmakers), the hottest baby among the idiots can survive. She and the female uber-commando end up in tight T-shirts for the rest of the movie. Now this is how a military operation should be carried out! There's a lot of rush, punctuated my humorous stuff like the super-commands being unable to go through a simple ventilation (obviously it's a thin piece of aluminum that you could easily go through with the handle). This requires a plan to rub the guts of zombies themselves, and even though we have not seen anything in the movie that indicates that zombies locate their prey by scent, they are good enough to start smelling the zombie guts and leaving our heroes leave. Some other funny bits - Paris Hilton's gag, "Can you hear me now?" the gag, and the fact that while zombies immediately bite secondary characters, the main characters are able to fight on dozens of them without being bitten. Another laugh is provided by Mr. Fingaz, who can not pronounce the word "toe-no-kit?". <br /> <br /> Overall, it's kind of fun. I could have used some more interesting characters, but for an original Sci-Fi Channel, I was slightly impressed.
