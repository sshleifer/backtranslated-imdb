This movie is recommended only for insomniacs: it will relieve them by putting them to sleep. Five-year-olds can also have fun. But for anyone else (including fans of the genre), that annoying! The "old" plot is reminiscent of "Return Of The Dragon", and this movie is so inept, but Nero is not Bruce Lee, so "Enter the Ninja" is an even worse movie. So far, this is the second (the offensive "comedy" "Bachelor Party" was the first) movie I gave 1/10 to.
