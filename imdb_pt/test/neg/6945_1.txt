This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. They said that was the man's answer to Waiting to Exhale ... All I'm going to say is that we do not really respond. I could not believe it really was done. The director must choose another profession because he can not make a movie. The script was not good. It did not make sense and was very confusing. The wagering films are way better than that, and I was terribly disappointed to see the talented actor Terrence in that bad excuse of a movie. If I could get back in the hands of time, I would not go back to Media Play to never buy the movie, I would just keep it wrapped up on the shelf instead of wasting my time watching.
