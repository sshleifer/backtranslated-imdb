I just saw You die today. It's bad, almost too bad. <br /> <br /> 1) Direction and editing are horrible, just horrible. Almost made me turn off the film, Fauntleroy (the director) has no idea what he's doing, he seems to be filming things randomly and some scenes make no sense at all. Also, I hate it when the same scene is used again in the same movie, in this movie some scenes have been used 3 or 4 times. Too bad. <br /> <br /> 2) The dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes horrible. I like the fact that they wanted to make the character of Seagal and the character of Treach look like they were in a similar relationship with the characters of Lethal Weapon, but it did not work simply because some of the dialogues DO NOT MAKE SENSE, and I speak English very well, it is not that I did not understand the words, it was the fact that the jokes and lines of dialogue had no meaning. <br /> <br /> 3) The script is pretty bad. Why do they always try to complicate DTV action movies? Seagal's wife in the movie has psychic abilities, why? Is it useful for the movie? DO NOT. Seagal eliminates a lot of people who work for the guy who betrayed him and he knows these people without ever having met them in the movie. STUPID. The story sometimes goes astray and the jumps recede for no reason. The story is confusing and pointless at times. They should have kept it simple and would have worked. <br /> <br /> 4) In some action scenes, it's not Seagal, it's his stunt double. You can tell because they just film you from behind and never show your face. He also outnumbers guys with martial arts, not real ones like the aikido Steven knows. The stuntman uses cheese kicks and punches. <br /> <br /> 5) Steven is good in the movie. 90-95% of lines are spoken with your real voice. The rest is dubbing, but it's not that bad. This was good. Also Steven seems to be having fun in the movie and is more involved with the action he was in Submerged. He likes Treach as a partner; At least he does not seem to like it. In addition, he seems to be in better shape than in some of his recent movies. I hate the fact that he wears clothes to hide his body but in the same clothes he wears on the cover of the DVD he looks more than OK and he should have worn these clothes for most of the movie, not the long leather jacket it's stupid. I really think Seagal was willing to make a good movie. The fact that he arrived late and took off early from the set ON TWO MOVIES directed by Fauntleroy does not seem a coincidence to me. I think he realized that the crew was amateur or just for a quick buck and he did not care. <br /> <br /> In the hands of a better company and crew, this may have been very good. action movie for Seagal. Something like Out for Justice or above the law. I honestly believe that. But the people who made the film are not very good at their jobs or do not have enough money to do the job properly. Too bad since I liked Steven in the movie and Treach was cool (Ice Cool) too, but the rest was bad. Hey, at least that gives me hope for Black Dawn and Shadows of the past. I think Mercenary can be treated badly. But hey, Steven seemed to be back in the same mood as he was making his best movies and at least that's reason enough to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked it, but it could have been so much better. 4/10
