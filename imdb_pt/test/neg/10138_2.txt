Reba is a very stupid show. You can predict just about anything that is about to happen. Barbra Jean is very dumb. It's like she's not even a character. Such a program should have at least someone who looks like a real-life person. I think Barbra Jean represents a retarded person. Keira or whatever her name, Reba, Brock, they're all stupid! Keira is like the smartest person on the show, and she's still stupid. ALL ARE STUPID! That's my take on Reba. Since I said all I can say about this show, I'll just take the next lines of text saying what I'm saying now and do until there are 10 lines. Over there. Reba gets 2/10.
