If you took all the elements of a Shrek movie stock (grumpy ogre, dumb ass, fluffy kitty, compulsory dance number, etc.), put them in the blender and condensed for 20 minutes, you'd have that mess. Painful to watch; I may have laughed once. History and dialogue are rushed beyond comprehension, with the voice actors sounding as if they had phoned in their lines. The reworked final version of the poem "The Christmas Story" seems to have been written by a committee in five minutes. And the boy, a little Eddie Murphy, goes a long way. With its desperate attempt to be cool and current, this show will be far outdated and forgotten, while classics like "The Grinch ??" will remain timeless. A sad waste of effort for all involved, a real "shark jump" for the Shrek franchise.
