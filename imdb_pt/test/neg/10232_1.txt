I'm the kind of person who never watches animated movies, but I make an exception for Thumbelina and Princess Swan. Being absolutely in love with the first part of the series, I bought it and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind, determined to love it because I spent money buying. I finished the movie, and all I can think about is terror! I wanted to like it, I really liked it. I tried very, very hard to like. But I could not enjoy a second of this tiring movie. The songs made me feel like pulling my ears out of my head. The dialogue was so stupid that I felt shuddering with frustration and irritation every time someone opened his mouth. The villain was laughable and I felt like wanting Derek and Odette to die in the end ... and I was absolutely in love with them from the first movie. <br /> <br /> I will try to suppress the memory of this movie because it almost destroyed the first one for me. There is a song in the movie in which there are a series of flashbacks from the first movie. The difference in animation between the two is very obvious, and I began to yearn for the first and wishing I had never set eyes on the third. <br /> <br /> Do yourself and please and do not waste your time.
