Of the thousands of movies I've seen so far, this is the first one that made me think of the term "wasting talent". I've never seen so many fine actors giving such terrible performances (Frédéric Pierrot, Elsa Zylberstein, and so on). The "aging" make-up is quite awful and, to make matters worse, lit up broadly. The use of music (for example, love at first sight for the young country helper) is sometimes so caricatured that I could feel the majority of the spectators around me grinning awkwardly. So far, Antoine de Caunes has been a good actor, but seeing this and "les morsures de l'aube", I think he should start thinking about quitting. Please, Antoine, give up this "master of balantree" project; I doubt you deserve this.
