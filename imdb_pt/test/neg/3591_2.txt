Following the good words of my friends, I hired this movie, hoping it would at least match the laughs of the similar film, "House Party", but I was very disappointed and very bored. <br /> <br /> Falling asleep while watching a movie is never a good sign. I do not know if this did not appeal to me because I do not live on the "cover", or if I'm not black, but it's probably one of the two. <br /> <br /> tries to fake some movies, just coming up with a few laughs, but in the long run fails miserably. Miss you.
