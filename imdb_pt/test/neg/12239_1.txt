I'm sorry for myself, you know why. I feel sore with the showing of this movie. I went to the theater with some friends to see this movie, and I still have not had the satisfaction of watching it in its entirety (I left with about 20 minutes left ... hoping God could make me at least comfortable for a moment. ) most movies now, even the bad ones ... when I watch them, there may be a small part in the movie in which I feel some joy sometimes because of a quirky joke or a good phrase ... this movie in the the other hand made me feel uncomfortable and angry at myself the whole time, especially since I lost money on it. It was badly written, misdirected, poorly filmed and definitely acted badly ... <br /> <br /> Please, for the good of mankind, I do not see this movie, even if your guy that means he has seen like all the usual movies ... just do not ...
