Black and white satire of a Madison Avenue advertising agency being taken over by blacks. They are led by Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson), who is determined to change things. However, he turns out to be even worse than his white predecessors. This is as original as this happens. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this was considered bold and shocking in 1969, but it seems silly today. The jokes are either bland (the president is a dwarf, how funny is that?), Cruel or obvious, and the movie is full of nasty characters. It is done in a very experimental way, which makes it even harder to understand ... or understand. The film becomes more bizarre and surreal as it progresses. The end comes out of nowhere. To make matters worse, with the sole exception of Johnson, ALL the acting is bad. Antonio Fargas (a regular in these types of films) is especially annoying as the Arabic. This gets three stars because the commercial parodies (made in bright colors) are fun and there is a good rare line here and there. I heard this was a cult classic, but that's more interesting than good. Ignore this ... unless you're into experimental 1960s movies.
