And again, Columbia Pictures decides to simply "hash" using the original version with Curly and without any of the jokes or jokes to boot! Near the end of this pitiful movie when Joe gets stuck riding the bull, the studio did not even make a big effort to re-record the sound so if you listen carefully you can still here Curly going "Woo woo woo woo woo." Also, when Moe and Larry play the darts to "slow down the bull so it can leave," this is raised from the original because you can actually see Moe and Larry "magically" look 15 years younger. Why, oh, why did Moe allow all this to happen? It's a burning question that probably can never be answered because, as far as I know, in real life he was quite sensitive to any kind of criticism and had pretty high standards for his work, as did Larry, Curly and Shemp. Do not waste your time on this.
