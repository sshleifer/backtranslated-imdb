I liked the prequels, and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan previously hilarious. RH3, however, was a rehash of the first two without the charm or humor. I think I may have laughed once - and it was during the NGs. Tucker was extremely annoying in this movie, and his character seemed to have no other purpose than to ruin everything in the most annoying way possible. Chan is always nice, but he seemed tired in this movie. I was able to predict EVERYTHING - who was the villain, who was the girl, (SPOILER ALERT) who was the villain who turned into a bad guy, etc. I hope to see more of Tucker and Chan's films in their separate efforts. , but not in more sequels than Rush Hour. You're very tired. I recommend a rental, but not a purchase.
