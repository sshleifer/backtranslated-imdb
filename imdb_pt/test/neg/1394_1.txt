Yes, that's right people, this is undoubtedly the worst show in the history of television. If you want to watch a sad, lonely and bland comedian, try to entertain the masses with half an hour of pale and tired social ramblings that your moderately retarded cousin has commented on at the Thanksgiving dinner table, this may be the show for you. This is called nervous comedy my friends, but to be honest this makes Tim Allen look like Richard Pryor. Avoid at all costs. Unless you're a masochist.
