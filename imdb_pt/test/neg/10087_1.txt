This is by far the most insipid, stupid and incredibly stupid show that has ever been on the air, and this comes from someone who remembers "San Pedro Beach Bums". <br /> <br /> My wife loves to watch reality shows - and there was an episode of this drivel where the aspirants had to develop a "walk". The final result was straight from Monty Python's "Ministry of Silly Walks" sketch. I could not laugh enough. <br /> <br /> And then there's the ubiquitous Ms. Banks (as in laughing all the way to the ...). She has to be the most annoying and selfish woman on TV since Rosie O'Donnell left The View. As if modeling was doing great things for mankind. Please. I never found her attractive, and I do not find her clever now that she has the temerity to open her mouth. <br /> <br /> Someone needs to tell these human hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women.
