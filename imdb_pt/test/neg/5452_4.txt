AALCC informs us that 14 year olds can be very unfriendly and cruel. For those who do not know, the movie performs a public service. Otherwise, it's a lot of flashy videography with little or no reason to be. I will allow the camera to work sometimes, but also that it can be madly self-indulgent at other times. Actors occupy screen space and screen time, but do not calculate as attractive humans. I suppose the email that flickers on the screen means you have to figure out which character has that nickname, but I just could not differentiate it enough to do that, and I really did not care anyway.
