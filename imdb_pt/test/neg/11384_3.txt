To start this movie was sick. Here your wife is dying and you're going to walk around town with that chic blonde at your side. Then your wife dies and within 2 months you are together with this chic. Hank (James Brolin) is definitely moving quickly throughout this film. I called him Fast Hank. Fast Hank marries this beautiful lady and, before she realizes it, she fucks her best friends. The part that gets me is when she's "doing" in the barn with Kevin and is caught by another friend of Hanks. Kevin gets up and leaves, she drops her robe and BAM !! Straight in the arms of this other guy and they start to "do it" right there. I think he's ending what Kevin started. HOW GROSS !!!! I am so is the movie of life ??? It's a typical OLD MAN YOUNG WOMAN movie that says you can have my body if I get your money ...
