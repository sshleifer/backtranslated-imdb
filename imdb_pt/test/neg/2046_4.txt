The thing that is really terrifying about it is that the filmmakers thought they were doing something clever and sexy. Instead, they probably made the stupidest horror picture of the year! <br /> <br /> This movie begins with a lot of snobbish art friends in a gallery. This weird, ugly European man appears and starts talking pretentious fruity to the main character, sounding like he's just come out of an episode of Dark Shadows. He then offers her a little smoking stick (yes, a damn ****), which she readily agrees! He picks up some red crap and puts it in a spoon for her to free! If this happens to you in real life, do not do it! <br /> <br /> She is transported to a strange underworld of Jean Rollin, who is supposed to be sexy but is not, where there is this thing that looks like a rotting creature from the black lagoon! <br /> <br /> Soon she turns all her art-weak friends into her new supernatural crack form. No matter how stupid these freaks turn blue, they can not just leave it alone. At one point she still does with the rotten creature! <br /> <br /> After the final battle and the stupid woman is sprayed or anything, the so-called hero is left alone to pack her copy of Michael Moore's Face Where My Country is and I can not resist smoking that stuck more one time to try and rescue his dumb friend. What the hell. <br /> <br /> Evaluate four stars for pure unintentional humor.
