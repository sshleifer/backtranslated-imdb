I think that after Leonard Nimoy succeeded in directing "The Search for Spock" and "The Journey Home," William Shatner thought he could drive as well. Although he is a competent actor, he shows here that he is simply not a good director. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie is hard evidence to support the Trekkies' claims that William Shatner is an arrogant egomaniac. Although his character, Captain James Kirk, has always been the most important role in the original film, "Star Trek", it seems that in this film he is the heart of the film, the two other main characters, Captain Spock and Doctor Leonard . McCoy, are there just to support you, and the other characters are just there to add comic relief. <br /> <br /> The plot is that some Vulcan's emotional outcast named Sybok is struggling with people and releasing pain within themselves. them from that traumatic event early in life that changed them forever. Gratefully, they join him in their quest to make the whole world free from pain and thus in peace. Sybok and his followers command the building in which a peace conference between a human diplomat, Klingon and Romulan is taking place. This attracts the Enterprise that is still being built, since none of the other Starfleet ships have "experienced commanders" (honestly, with how the Starfleet is managed, the Klingons and Romulans should have conquered them years ago). Sybok adds the Enterprise crew, except Spock (who turns out to be one of Sybok's secret brothers), McCoy and Kirk. Sybok orders the Enterprise to decoy to "the center of the universe" to find "God," which seemingly every race has a word for. However, it turns out that this is only a minor entity when it requires the use of Enterprise and Kirk asks "what God needs with a starship." The entity is destroyed, but not before Sybok, realizing that he has been lying for years, sacrificing his life and gaining Spock's respect in death after the company's photon torpedoes destroy the entity and inexplicably Sybok as well. <br /> <br /> OK, science fiction movies are not known for realism, but at some point, rationality must be strengthened. Why do people follow Sybok just to release their pain? Why are all humanoids defined by a single traumatic event? I certainly lived a life free from trauma. Why does not Kirk tempt his crew for riot and betrayal after they join Sybok? What was the point of Sybok sacrificing when the torpedoes were going to kill the entity anyway? <br /> <br /> So the plot is weak. Another problem is that Sybok, although well interpreted by Lawrence Luckinbill, is poorly portrayed. Just because he is an emotional Vulcan does not mean he should act just like a religious human fanatic. Shatner (who was co-writer, as well as the director) could have at least developed a proper dialogue for an emotional Vulcano. I think he feels that any emotional being speaks as we do. Wow, I guess that means Klingons should say "no" and "no" more often than "no" and "no." And the Cardassians should not prolong their sentences because they like to talk (yes, I know it's sad to know that). Please ... every ST race uses a unique dialogue. Why is Sybok the exception? <br /> <br /> The only thing not to complain about is acting. I always knew that "Star Trek" has great actors, and this movie is no exception. The accolades also go to Leonard Nimoy, as it had to be difficult to interpret the dispassionate Spock in his old age. Some other things I did not like: Shatner and the late DeForrest Kelly twice shows what evil singers are singing "Row, Row, Row your Boat" in this movie . I think Shatner wanted to silence his detractors from his ability to sing. What he did was prove his point. <br /> <br /> Uhura does a fan dance while using nothing but bark to lure some men into a trap. After all, the dreams of all of us men are filled with images of chubby middle-aged women dancing naked. <br /> <br /> The comedy is very good as long as it does not affect the nature of "Star Trek". a lot, but when Scotty bumped into an object in the Enterprise and KOs himself, it's kind of exaggerating. <br /> <br /> Kirk is the only member of the team who can reject Sybok's offer to release his inner pain and see through the deceit of the impostor God. Can not even Spock manage one of these? Maybe these scenes were Shatner's valantines for his character, as many suspect. <br /> <br /> The concept of an entity posing as God had been used in "Star Trek" before this movie more than once. Be creative, Shatner. <br /> <br /> Speaking of unconventionality, I do not care strictly about the music trait of "Star Trek: the Next Generation." <br /> <br /> All in all, very bad "Trek" movie. If you are a Trekkie, watch it once, because it is "Star Trek". Otherwise, watch "Star Trek II: Khan's Wrath". It is way better.
