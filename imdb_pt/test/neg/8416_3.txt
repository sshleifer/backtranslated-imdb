This is a silly parody of private eye thrillers as a novelist (Michael Cain) is called to "ghostwrite" an autobiography of a colorful and waning Hollywood star (Mickey Rooney). Sometimes nonsense becomes unpleasant. This is not Cain at his best. Rooney is way above the top. Outstanding support from Lizabeth Scott, Lionel Stander and the graceful Nadia Cassini. Not easy to watch.
