I have seen comments from the Turkish people (which I am not saying) that this film is fantastic and accurately portrays Turkish life. All I have to say is ... Turkey must be one of the most boring and depressing places in the world, because, in my opinion, that's exactly what this movie was for me. If I were Turkish, I think it would have a greater impact. But if you are not from Turkey, I advise you not to waste two hours of your life on this. <br /> <br /> "Distant" seems to last forever. Many scenes are meticulously long, with little or no purpose. I do not understand the director's goals including even many of the scenes. It is pointed out that the director used his own car, apartment and friends to make the movie ... Well, guess what? It shows. It seems low budget. The acting is weak. If it's a cultural thing, then let it be. I just do not understand the purpose of basing a movie on this story. It's incredibly annoying.
