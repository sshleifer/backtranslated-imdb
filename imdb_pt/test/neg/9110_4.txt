A cut above the usual direct to video actioner, Airborne has enough in the tank to keep him going for the full 90 minutes, though you can not help but think of how low former 80s gold boy comedy Steve Guttenburg has been inclined to be in such a cheap production (and throwing a hard man too!). The plot is simple, the bad guys stole a deadly virus and Guttenburg and the rest of his friends are sent to retrieve it, Not bad of its kind, but not in the same league (obviously) that the movies in which it is compared also cover such as AIR FORCE ONE and AIR. The cast is good, with Sean Bean replaying his British character, which we had a glimpse of box office like GOLDENEYE and PATRIOT GAMES.
