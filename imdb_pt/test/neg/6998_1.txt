It is high time for American critics and fans to begin to unleash their unquestioning and sloppy veneration of films such as Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in America." The troubled history of this opulent film (and the grand and fanciful myth associated with its production and many versions) hides its mediocrity on a narrative level. The film swings back and forth more and more, its central figures adrift and seemingly out of place, surrounded by the decadence of imposing ensembles, the minutia of details of production and, in 1984, clich√©, but beautiful cinematographic making on offer for the audience. The timeline of the plot is confusing, enigmatic and laborious, leading some critics to imagine that the opium of the Macaroni figure is the antecedent of some future 'reality of dreams', as well as sepia-toned memories. This interpretation of boy apologetics, excessively fan, masks the blatant narrative irregularities on display. Even in this full time, the numbers appear and disappear with alarming rapidity: Deborah's character is quickly established in childish form, a cold, unattainable woman, without even suggesting the gravity with which she will recover. his relationship with a post-prison Noodles, the referred re-union hereafter sounds completely false. The pace of death is a bit guilty, certain sequences drag on stagnating for too long, meaning very little, hinting at a director with so little restraint and narrative economy that he often feels compelled to usurp all possible screen time to show out of his production, fatal to a movie that contains figures so bleak and distant. The trajectory of the lives of the figures is presented to us as a microcosm reflecting the historical trajectory of the adolescents of America through prohibition and their spoils, ending with the (debatable) ruin of their central moribund figures (except Deborah - a makeup department or intentional a wonder). This notion is common, even banal. The cast of characters, as imagined in the script of a note (written by no less than seven Italians), is played simply and awkwardly by all but the younger actors, who at least risk some variant facial expressions. This is understandable given the almost non-viable material. Some critics argue that the characters may seem so impenetrable and selfish, but actively seek their own goals, taking on the conformity of others (for example, when Noodles gets out of prison, Max picks him up and offers him a prostitute without asking if he whether or not that is what he wants, and later makes agreements assuming Noodles will be in compliance). This explanation of its abrupt and abrasive dispositions is unsatisfactorily irrelevant and serves only to point out the complicated ends for which unshakable defenders will defend their positions against a sadly unsound film. Although Ennio Morricone's score is highly revered, it is undeniably weird and repetitive, it flows with an emotional redemption that the very violent scenes themselves simply do not justify. At some points, it is questionable whether or not Morricone was watching the same film in which I was so incongruous in his work. As a hymn to American film production, it succeeds in humor (aided by a few brushstrokes of magisterial editing following periods of time) and visual (not aided by such punctuation), but lacks cohesiveness and fluidity narrative.
