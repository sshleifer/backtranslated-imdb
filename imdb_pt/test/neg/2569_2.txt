Wow, I have not seen such a bad movie since "Fire Down Below". Wait, this is also a Seagal movie. Like "On Deadly Ground" and "Fire Down Below," Seagal centers the film around his environmental awareness message and how the military, the FBI, and the CIA are incompetent idiots. The problem is that both reality and a sensible plot are secondary to any social commentary that Gagbleygook is trying to convey.
