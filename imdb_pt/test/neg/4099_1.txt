This photo is a copy of the short film by Michael Pohl, EXTINCT, 1995. Although the idea of ​​Michael Pohl was original and perfect for a short film, the plot of A SOUND OF THUNDER was poorly adapted from Pohl's story and did not serves for feature length film that is expected from a large Hollywod studio. The tragic flood situation that ruined the scenarios in Prague was only a bad connection in a long chain of rusty film production in this case. For a studio to launch such a product ... it's a shame. Especially for Warner Brothers, a studio that broke new effects fields with programs like BABYLON 5 in 1993. On TV. Visual effects for pioneering CGI television shows on episodic television in the mid-1990s were far more sophisticated than what is brought to the screen in this photo. In such cases, however sad it may seem: the film may.
