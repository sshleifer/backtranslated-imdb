After seeing Shootfighter 1, and the buckets of blood they spilled, I was ready for another exciting ride of open heart massage and chiropractic in a cage. But nooooooo, this was like Barney's version of the first movie, with that lick of the Karate boy. At least Bun Yeung still kicks booty, although he needs to make more movies like Bloodsport and Caddyshack.
