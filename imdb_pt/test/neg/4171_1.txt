Apparently I'm swimming against the tide of the brilliant comments about this movie. I have not seen this since I was 4 or 5 years old, but there is one thing I distinctly remember ... <br /> <br /> Bunyip was TERRIFYING !!! Nightmares induce terrifying. With the scary music and the little girl and the kangaroo running / jumping off for their lives ... <br /> <br /> As a child I also remember the animated Hobbit ... do not worry. Sunken boat? He did not blink an eye. Dot and the kangaroo? It still haunts my dreams. And I have several friends the same age who also think it was frighteningly immense. Maybe we can get a group rate on therapy. <br /> <br /> In short: a weird movie for your time.
