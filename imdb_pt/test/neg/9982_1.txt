As a movie aficionado, I had heard of this infamous movie a long time ago. I had heard that it was basically a $ 15 million movie about the tyrannical rule of Roman Emperor Caligula, complete with heavy pornography. What struck me was that it was a porn movie, but there were great playwrights like Peter O'Toole, John Geilgud, Malcolm McDowell and Hellen Mirren. A week ago I saw a documentary about Caligula on the History channel and this movie came back to my head and finally my curiosity made the best of me, I stupidly rented the DVD and even more stupidly watched it. <br /> In the first 30 minutes I was seeing sex acts and especially violence that would gain an NC-17 by even today's standards. It was really necessary to have a scene of a man having his urinary tract closed and then having gallons of wine poured into him and then having his stomach cut with a sword (all in very graphic details). And a scene where a guy gets his ass cut and fed dogs (again with very graphic details) ... and that just scratches the surface. The plot for this movie of whom it seems seems that it is the only film that honestly portrays pagan Rome and its excesses. When in fact what this movie really is, it is pure exploration. From beginning to end, you see nothing but endless torture, beheadings and all kinds of violence and gross behavior imaginable (sadomasochism, rape, necrophilia, it just never stopped). There is no insight into Caligula himself, which could have driven him to go mad, the horrible childhood he had that turned him into a sadist as an adult. This is not a historical movie, it's sleaze. Even the pornography in this movie stinks, and for the most part, when I was not choking, I was incredibly bored. When it was over, I was depressed, I did not feel much like eating and this movie does the impossible, in fact it can make you not have sex. <br /> <br /> What did these great actors think when they arrived? in that. I read that the pornography segments were filmed after the main shooting was completed (which explains why none of the main actors is in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so bad). But still, and all these actors must have known what they were getting into. Soon in the opening credits says "Penthouse Magazine and Bob Gucionne Presents". And the scenes of which the famous actors actually participate are completely repulsive in themselves. Apparently, director Tinto Brass wanted his name removed from the complete film, as well as the screenwriter (Gore Vidal of all people). Even John Geilgud and Peter O'toole were begging for people not to see it when it opened at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> For the amount of money the producers spent on it, the quality of the film is terrible. Everything is blurry and obscure, as if the movie had fallen into a swamp before it was developed, and that is where you are fortunate enough to see a scene that is really in focus. The sound is poorly dubbed, much of the music is clumsy and the editing is horrible. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I brought this movie for me. My advice ... do not watch this, do not watch it, do not watch it ...... as for me tomorrow night I'm going to watch something lighter .... like DAWN OF THE DEAD!
