I just saw that in the movies. I have not read the books. There's nothing new about this movie. <br /> <br /> Bandits seem to die with a couple of blows, no matter how many times our hero has been stabbed with a big sword, he keeps looking the same (ish)! There are several action scenes, but they are very false. Filmmakers seem to get the impression that whenever they do not mind choreographing a fight scene, they just move the camera up close, move quickly, and increase the music. It makes me nervous again. <br /> <br /> I admire them for trying to deal with a dark plot without the usual Hollywood cheese, but I regret to say that the filmmakers have failed miserably. The characters are two-dimensional. We hardly know or feel for them. The lead has a charming farmers' accent oo arrr ..... although it seems that he does not have much to say ... <br /> <br /> Do not bother to watch this unless you're bored and have kind of price of blockbusters ....
