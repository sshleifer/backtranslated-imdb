Where I start, it's one of the most frustrating movies I've ever seen, because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point, but it seems to be seriously stupid. A movie about an inhabited ghost bed? The first 2 minutes of the movie show a black and white flashback of a weird fat guy who goes dominatrix in a contest winner Fabienne looks like Pulp Fiction and strangles her with his tie. This supposedly shapes how the bed influences the story. Still, if you want an opening to keep people interested or send them away early, having a bottleneck is the way to do it. Moving on to the present day, a couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins to unpack their things, so far everything is normal. So one night, while they did hippity dippity on a single mattress, they realize they need a bed frame. That's where things get suspicious, why did not they bring or buy a goddamn bed-sheet before they got there? We learned that the door leading to the attic where the first 2 minutes happened does not open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame, the door opens magically. They go to the attic and discover the old bedchamber and decide to bring it down and their days of love are saved ... or so they thought. The rest of the movie revolves around both being haunted by the bedframe. The female is an artist, so she begins to draw the ghostly images she dreams of and the man is a photographer, so he begins to have his models acting as if they were tortured or tied up (one of which has gray hair and appears over the top) and finds that the house she has lived in has been a haven for serial killings and killings that have led to the end of the film. They think the friendly landlord is murdered (which does not make sense, since ghosts need take a human form to kill) and decide to get out of the dodge.While packing, the husband goes moronically to the attic where he is possessed by the fat and crazy guy and the female beats his skull before the cops appear and take her to a mental ward where she kills a guy trying to hit her Well, if you've read this far, you have to be thinking about something.Why the hell did not they throw the mattress out the window? Seriously, they never said anything about the real house being haunted, just the bed ... so why not get rid of the damn thing and move on? That's why the film is so frustrating because it's actually a good storyline and the actors follow suit, but there are more holes than Sonny Corleone on a toll. The couple tried to leave the city as if compared to all the other films that have the old scheme of "let's give this place a chance to honey", so stick to it. Still, me and my friend who watched the movie kept saying it every 5 minutes ... why did not they just throw the bed? Especially when they knew he was haunted it would have been a good time to set him on fire or something. <br /> <br /> After all, it's almost a movie with almost a lot of porn, such as bed scenes and a plausible plot (to some extent), but the solution is so simple that you're scratching your head up the end of the movie, wondering how stupid the couple can be? The highlight of the film is when the husband tells the 50-year-old to open his legs and his assistant tells him that he can not shoot her like that. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (a low budget porn The Man Show would love)
