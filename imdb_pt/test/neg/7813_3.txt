"There are a few things you just do not do," says the slogan, a 2003 David Zucker comedy about a young man stuck in a horrendous situation after another, entitled My Boss's Daughter, and it's the slogan that should speak so much to the people who made this garbage and those who watched it. In fact, there are some things you simply do not do, by placing all sorts of content that can be found within My Boss's Daughter, counting as things you should not do to the movies, including them in your photo . . My boss's Daugther is a sordid; creepy; grotesque experience, an awkward and heavy play that is infantile beyond words and disgusting beyond expression. To see is to endure, to endure is to survive and to survive is it an accomplishment by itself ?? if any of the cast; writers; extras; Hell, even the guys who worked as runners on set, helped produce anything as terribly poor as this again, so it will be because they were sent here by the devil himself to destroy the movie medium or, it is because they probably got jobs on behalf of the Friedberg / Seltzer mafia. My boss's Daugther, (which I'm sure should be titled "My Boss" Daugther, grammatically speaking), revolves around his unfortunate male leader, Tom Stansfield (Kutcher), and a night at his boss's house while he pursues that seemingly objective "which is his young blond daughter Lisa Taylor (Reid). - someone who works within the same department he does in an imposing Chicago office block, under the strict eye of Jack Taylor (Stamp). Tom spies Lisa at first, she is taking the subway to work with all the other shmos despite the fact that she owns a car and her father is the boss of the damn company. After trying to talk to her, but having her attempts foiled by a vomiting baby and a blind dog more interested in Tom's groin than anything else, he finally gets his chance in the office when he talks from elsewhere after the darkness. that he should come to her house to visit her - and yes, she still lives with her father. Think of Hitchcock's Psycho movie of 1960 with the gender roles between Norman Bates and his mother reversed and then fought off with laughter. <br /> <br /> The distinct establishment of character is painfully apparent in the opening scene where Tom is on the subway. train and travel to work with their yuppie cohorts. They are a cruel and smarmy bunch, who is made apparent stealing the folders of the unfortunate enough to get them stuck in the door in the next morning rush without ever returning them. One day this happens to Tom there, and his desire is to give it back, so hitting on us that he's not like the other guys (!) That's when he sees Lisa for the first time in the carriage and is a bit shy approaching her as the other men treat the whole situation as if it were a breeze if they were in their position. This rather obvious and svelte attempt to try to "put away" with Tom feels uncomfortable with what is supposed to be necessary to gain a place among these co-workers in this company. <br /> <br /> It is, however, as close as My Boss's Daughter reaches any level of filmmaking. From a seemingly harmless premise of a boy meeting a girl and wanting to meet her, comes the comedy of Hell. Tom arrives at the house will not see him invited to the party, instead he is accused of sitting Jack's pet owl house and usually keep out damage while maintaining a flawless home. It has been established that the character of Terrance Stamp means business more rigidly, firing people for the smallest things, like making a bad cup of coffee. It's not that Jack is a shy business man, he's a cleaning maniac; obsessed with control, and a bordering sociopath in his placement of traps for bears in the garden, so as to keep the children at his side. You can imagine that when we are taken to your large and refined house with the orders that nothing should go wrong, obviously there will be problems. <br /> <br /> The movie has fun with this danger premise for about ten minutes. The first time someone uses the bench to open a beer, thus marking the spotless spot, you can smile, but when half of the house is destroyed and Michael Madsen has appeared urinating all over the rug, you have the head your hands. Each joke in the film is ridiculously clumsy before being played in a way that is slower and excruciating than slippery and flawless, the only thing missing as it goes to the next gag is the improper sound effect of someone else changing the gears to a car as it locks and cracks in the next falls. Amid the crass madness, the movie takes time to roll through a route of extravagant romance and saccharine, while Lisa and Tom team up to talk about characters in the workplace and outside the workplace, and who may have more in common than first. thought. Up to the mark of the hour, the movie opted for gross jokes and hate full of jokes more than anything when there is a whole scene that exists only for paraplegics and a dumb subplot of a neighbor sportsman who suffers head injuries in a blind date in which some truly unattainable visions are unfolded. All along, Stamp's character likes to put people down and ask if the simplest tasks are too difficult for them, what the commonplace response should be while channeling Jack Taylor: he was reading the script too complicated - one concept for you, Stamp?
