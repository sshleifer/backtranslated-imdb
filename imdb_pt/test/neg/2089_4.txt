I chose this DVD for 3.99 in video rogers in order to get enough points to get a better movie for free. I was never really planning to watch this, but he started poking my curiosity and I finally decided to put the DVD player in it. The effects in this movie are horrible and cheap. Some of the dialogues in this movie seem to have been written by a happy 12-year-old boy. The acting is really tacky in parts, and the "action" scenes are completely laughable. You're going to fall into the chuckle of some parts, which was good for me because it kept me slightly entertained. The plot is that a girl has a curse on her that causes her to vomit snakes, so some shaman has to take her to Los Angeles, there are also two girls trying to smuggle drugs there and some other people who are not important the plot, not that there is nothing to do with this movie and not listen to the cover, there are 100 passengers and 3,000 vipers, there are 10 passengers and 20 random snakes. <br /> <br /> As for the DVD, there is a trailer that is almost as laughable as the movie, a blooper roll that is just a shot over and over an actor trying to say train, and the deleted scenes are really useless if were not good enough to stay in this movie, they must be very bad. There is also a very bad making-making that does not show much, except that the people involved with this movie were a bit of an idiot. I can not recommend it unless you want a really bad movie with which you can laugh with your friends. I give 2 kitten cats in 5.
