A young man who has never met his biological parents receives an old farm in a secluded section of West Virginia after the death of his natural father. He visits his property with a cross-section of potential victims, including the comic relief black guy and a couple of fashionable lesbians. (Hmm, will there be a thin dive? Guess.) Unfortunately, the party comes to an end when the spirits of drifters killed by their evil grandfather and used as scarecrows come back to take revenge. This movie starts well. An ingenious assemblage of photographs from the depression era and fake newspapers against a speech by FDR - this, I believe, is his first appearance in a shocking killer movie - sets the mood. I developed some hopes for the film, which were partially realized. The story was helpful enough. The scenery was bucolic enough. Photography was mainly in focus. The acting, while there are no major jolts, was a bit higher than expected for horror movies in this budget range. The film could have worked within the strict requirements of the genre if the scarecrows were scary. But they were not. They seemed cheap. They were not scary at all. The better the monster, the better the movie. These scarecrows would not scare Dorothy, much less Toto.
