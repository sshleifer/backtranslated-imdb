Because it came from HBO and based on IMDb rating, I watched the first season of this series, what a waste. The characters are occasionally interesting, but mostly like cartoons. The performance varies from good to mediocre talent, with an emphasis on the second. Not only prisoners, but viewers should leave all hope in the door of the cell that this story is credible, it is a load of manure so large that you will need exceptionally strong testicular strength to continue watching. Violence, like most developments in history, is stimulating and whatever the supposedly served morality is of the light variety. If your idea of ​​excellent television includes the quality of writing, performance and overall production seen in THE SOPRANOS, DEADWOOD or SEIX FEET UNDER, avoid OZ. If you want to see a Disneyland for illiterate idiots, watch OZ. Things like that give Edgy a bad name.
