Brainless movie about two girls and some guys they meet at an airport taking the wrong bus and ending up in a world of trouble. Big twists are totally, and I mean totally wasted in a movie with such an incredibly stupid plot to the point of defying description. What's happening in a general sense is good, I mean, the idea of ​​a boy kidnapping unaccompanied girls for nefarious purposes is good. The problem is that the details are so unbelievable that I would be shocked if you did not turn off the film in total disbelief. Heck, a guy who should take you home does not follow any of the ways you know, and you stay on the bus? It gets worse from there, thinks about all the bad choices and this movie causes the characters to do it, to the point that they can leave, but never do. What is annoying is that some of the twists and turns could have worked if there was something clever before but there is almost no intelligence anywhere in this movie. Okay, maybe there is, the end, the end is smart. The end is the kind of thing that should scare you. should be the "oh # $ * @ !!!!" moment and become a horror movie classic. Instead, just stand there among the stupid ruins of a stupid movie. One of the most brainless films of the year.
