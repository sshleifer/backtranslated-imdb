Dir-Brad Sykes: A ridiculously lame 3D movie that follows the plots of many horror films of the 1980s. Idiot boys go to a known and murderous camp, they are hunted by a stranger. masked, and then we try to find out who, if anyone, is going to live. We really do not care who's behind the mask, but it's still hard to figure out if you've ever seen any kind of movie. What a waste of a 3D viewer, despite the decent 3D effects.
