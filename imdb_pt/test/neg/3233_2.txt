Corey Haim will never be known as one of the great actors of his time, but at least in films like "Licensed To Drive," he was more into his element ... humble mood. <br /> <br /> Dean Koontz's book, "Watchers," was one of his earlier works and probably his best until today. Unfortunately, this magnificent tale of a brilliant dog, a disturbed mutant, and a genetic experiment that went awry is horribly quartered. The acting is so lifeless, you may think you're watching a zombie movie. Only the dog gives a respectable performance, and if you want to see a decent movie about a dog, it would be best to watch "The Incredible Journey", "Cujo" or even "CHOMPS" ... ok, maybe not "CHOMPS" /> <br /> If you have read the book, avoid this movie at all costs. If you have not read the book, read it and avoid this movie. You'll thank me later. <br /> <br /> A slightly better translation of a book by Dean Koontz is the capable thriller, "Phantoms."
