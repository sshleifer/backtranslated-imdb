I enjoyed the whole scene with Ceasar's Palace, the Roman guards and the announcers in togas. This event also marked "the passage of the torch" as far as the voice of the WWF goes. Gorilla Monsoon, who made the play-by-play for each WWF PPV to this point, opens up and gives the typical introduction, making it look like he's there to announce another PPV. But then introduces Jim Ross who is making his WWF debut and JR continues to make the WWF comment to this day. But other than that, this event is pure rubbish. The good old sci-fi wrestling was thrown out the window and went into the birth of tricks. This to me was the event that the WWF began to go to the toilet, and did not recover until the attitude era of the late 90's. Here is a review of the event. <br /> <br /> Match the IC title: Tatanka (Challenger) vs. Shawn Michaels (champion): An opening well, but given what Shawn is capable of, it was very disappointing. I have no idea why the WWF was determined to put Tatanka. They should realize that Shawn was the future and Tatanka was just a hyper fighter in an Indian Gimick. The end of the game itself was very lame. Shawn grabs the referee and pulls him out, then is called for a count out. While it was fun to see Sherri be beaten later, this game was forgettable. Shawn had to take this game and had trouble doing it. <br /> The Stenier Brothers vs. The Headshrinkers: Steiners get the win through a Franknsteiner. This game had its moments, but the crowd just did not seem to be in it. There was no heat behind, I think it was a game just to play two tag teams. <br /> <br /> Crush Vs. Doink the Clown: TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! This game has been completely sucked. Two very lame tricks. A clown and a Hawaiian dressed in bizarre colors. The end caught everyone by surprise. Over the next few months, Crush turned his heel and Doink turned his face, but none of the fans seemed to care. Unfortunately, this was not the worst game on the card. <br /> <br /> Razor Ramon Vs. Bob Backland: You have a new jump that is much more than a fighter that was forgotten about 10 years ago. The fans laugh and laugh when the Backlund leaves. And as Hogan / Rock in WM18 and HHH / Owen in WM14, the heel fighter gets louder screams in the face. Luckily this game was short. The right guy won, but I wish they had Razor totally defeated and crushed Backlund instead of winning by a small pack of nothing. <br /> <br /> Tag Team Championship Match: Ted Dibiase and the IRS (Champs) Vs. Hulk Hogan & Brutus Beefcake with Jimmy Hart I would still like to know the full story of what happened to Hogan's eye. Oh well. The crowd was really in this match, but had no flow to it, so never. Hogan and Beefcake were clearly suffering from rust as the fighters had been on the shelf for at least a year. Dibiase, being the great technical wrestler he was, helped lead the game to be a complete waste. The final was a surprise with Dibiase and IRS winning the victory via DQ. But to please the crowd, Hogan and Beefcake made their usual presentation to the audience at the end, as if they had won the match. <br /> <br /> Lex Luger Vs. Mr. Perfect: The best part of this match was four hot ones that accompanied Lex Luger to the ring. Other than that, this was completely forgettable. Mr. Perfect's trick was born for a heel paper and he simply did not have the heat as a face. And Luger is just a waste of time, no matter what trick he's on. Luger wins by a setback, although Perfect's feet are on the ropes. Then Perfect passes the post game getting his butt kicked. First Luger knocks him down with his elbow running. Then when Perfect regains consciousness, he returns to the locker room to find Luger and ends up getting the crap from Shawn Michaels, creating a HBK / Perfect fief that had the potential to be a classic, but the WWF was misused. /> The Undertaker Vs. Giants Gonzales: ABSOLUTE EXCREMENT !! What was WWF thinking about bringing a wrestler as horrible as Giant Gonzales? Of course he had size, but I'd rather watch the Brooklyn brawler in a match than him. This is not even worth commenting on. <br /> <br /> WWF CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: Bret Hart (champion) vs. Yokozuna (defiant) You have one of the greatest technical wrestlers of all time against a guy who is the only advantage is that he is a gigantic asshole. Bret was able to take the game, but a fairly predictable end with Mr. Fuji throwing salt on Bret's face. <br /> <br /> POST MATCH: Yokozuna vs. Hulk Hogan sheer crap right here. Hogan arrives at the ring for no apparent reason and Mr. Fuji challenges him to a game after Yoko has just won the title. Even stubborn Hulkamaniacs think this is totally normal.
