I would have little to add to the bullofsoul23 bulls-eye comment here. But as the first Brazilian (born, raised and living in Rio de Janeiro, in a neighborhood a few miles from the favela of Vigário Geral, portrayed in the film) to comment on the "Favela Rising" financed by the United States here in IMDb, I have feelings mixed: on the one hand, it is good that the terrible situation of the Brazilian favelas is getting more attention from the filmmakers and the media, both from Brazil and abroad, since local governments seem to have given up long ago. On the other hand, it is incredibly frustrating that "Favela Rising" is a missed opportunity to enlighten the non-Brazilian audience on the subject, because first-time directors Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary (who are from the US and, understandably, neophytes about the subject) transform the biography of group leader AfroReggae Anderson Sá into a glamorous canonization in this shallow, one-sided, under-researched and misleading documentary. Good intentions, confusing results. "Favela Rising" looks like a TV ad, it's shallow like a primetime TV interview, and biased as a promotional video. "Favela Rising" seems uncomfortably false to a Brazilian viewer, and not only because of its visual treatment of a somber reality, and its happy ending to feel good. "City of God" is an obvious reference here, with COG actors Leandro Firmino and Jonathan Haagensen appearing for no apparent reason but hype. "Favela Rising" is supposedly a documentary about the AfroReggae group and its leader Anderson Sá, but beware: when you see scenes filmed in favelas overlooking the beautiful coast of Rio, you may be warned that Vicar General AfroReggae and Anderson ) is located in an area of ​​the river away from any beach. Strange choice of rental, to say the least. "Favela Rising" is probably confusing to non-Brazilians, who do not know many of the interviewees (and the film does not count for them either) and will have to wait for the final credits to discover that many of The soundtrack is not from the AfroReggae band (although you're suspicious when you start listening to the Pink Martini, among all the people!). They will not know that important issues have simply been left aside: why does the film push the notion that AfroReggae is a one-man project? Why not recognize the many partners who provide you with substantial financial and logistical support, such as the City Council of Rio, private Brazilian corporations, multinational labels and international NGOs, without which AfroReggae may not even exist? Why not state clearly that Vicar General is still plagued by violent drug wars and that his residents still live in constant fear of attacks by traffickers and police officers? Why not state clearly that many of the archive clips showing police violence and corruption did NOT occur in the Vicar General? HOW and why did the kid Richard Murilo finally join AfroReggae? WHY on the damn land he was not interviewed again at the end of the movie? <br /> <br /> As for Anderson himself, the movie leaves many loose ends for the viewer: what is the story about Anderson having "two" mothers? Is the baby in your arms your baby? Why is he inspired by Shiva? Is he a Buddhist? Why does a woman of candomblé appear on the beach when the movies mention Anderson's "miraculous" recovery from the accident? Is he a follower of Candomblé? Why not let him explain the contradiction of starting a group that fights drugs and simultaneously praises Bob Marley? If AfroReggae is also a proud building movement for blacks in the favelas, why do girls from the AfroReggae band limit themselves to butt-heeled routines? No, you will not receive any answers to these questions either. <br /> <br /> Instead, filmmakers are interested in turning Anderson Sá into a pop-star mix, Malcolm X, Gandhi and Christ (check out that last image of the statue of Christ the Redeemer at the top of Morco del Corcovado, immediately after showing Anderson "miraculously" walking after his surgery. And that's the WORST thing the filmmakers could do for Anderson and his cause: turning him into a special CHOOSE (when they show your surgical scar, you're ready to believe it's a mark of God.) <br /> <br /> Because what's remarkable about Anderson - who's the most common guy you could ever meet - is that he helped change his environment NOT being "special "but by copying and adapting winning projects (such as the Olodum movement in Bahia, among others) to his own community, with strong support from friends, artists, intellectuals, politicians, businessmen and the media. Elmente will not notice that Anderson is not particularly intelligent or articulate (unlike his good-natured partner Jose Junior), however much he is not particularly talented as a singer, lyricist or musician. However, his "ordinariness" may have been the true "inspiring" core of the film: to show that ANY person with idealism, perseverance, and constant support can indeed contribute significantly to his community, does not have to be Jesus incarnate. Because what really matters is the movement - AfroReggae - not the guy, see? Have not we had enough of personality worship? <br /> <br /> At the end of "Favela Rising," you probably will not know much more about the Rio de Janeiro favelas than when you entered - you've just seen how some of them look alike.
