Here's a fantastic concept for a movie - a series of meteors collides with a small town and the resulting alien infection is captured on camera from a single police camera monitor when the city is slowly dominated. Leave it to Albert Pyun to ruin everything! Do not be less than 30 meters from this movie! Holy shit, what a bomb ... it could be the worst of Pyun yet! The craziest thing is that there is the germ of a creative idea here - an entire outbreak counted from the POV of a dashcam. When I learned that, some time ago, I imagined the car smashing things, people being run over and infected guys breaking the windshield and surrounding the car in chaos. That would be cool right? Instead, we have the lead driving in circles all the time in a wooded area, occasionally finding the three infected types that just stay there. The last bit is literally a 15 minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera, only noises are heard off the screen. To stay away!!! On a little note of relief, I think I'm officially calling an end to my Pyun watching ... it only took me 20 bad movies to realize that I have better things to do.
