I checked the box "contains spoiler" in case I say something that is a spoiler and I do not realize I said it until I re-read it after I posted it. So it's just the case. <br /> <br /> Anyway, going back to review this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in skymovies earlier this afternoon, and by the description that Sky gives you (these people must be with acid) sounded pretty good, but when I actually got about 30 minutes , I was shocked. This movie, in my opinion, has the worst screenplay and actors / actresses of all time. The girl who falls in love with the LA boy about three hours later is a dumb and stupid character with an annoying, irritated voice and messy hair. "Then there's her lover, who's an idiot, and she's also very whiny." In fact, maybe they do. Then there is the boy's mother, who is with him on vacation and surprised, surprised - she is a doctor and - oh my God, wait, there are even more unsuspected surprises! Suddenly, a virus bursts into the island and it knows all about viruses! = O. HORROR OF SHOCK! Okay, right. I laughed a lot. Then there is this insane religious boy, who keeps talking about "erbs" or something, and how the Lord knows everything. Everyone on the island seems to love it, but in fact he is a stubborn, arrogant, pumped steroid (you really need to watch this movie just for the scene where he comes out of the sea after swimming, his head is small, and his body is MASSIVE, it's hilarious) buffoon who drank too much to drink. <br /> <br /> Anyway, after all these weird characters, including a flat cabbie, the religious finally gives in to the doctor. , and she takes a blood sample, and they go straight to work to find a cure for it, because, for some reason, it has been drastically saved, all up to "erbs and God." AND OH MY GOD Yes, there is another surprise! You will never guess what !! Just in the hour, with 11 minutes to go before everyone on the island actually falls dead, including his son and his girl, she finds the cure, and injects everyone, and everything is solved !!! What a pathetic movie. I mean, I knew it seemed like an obvious ending since when I started watching it, but I really think it would be nice and have some twists somewhere, but no, no, it was just boring and dry. /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. You'll end up like me - stunned for 3 hours and then demanding the hour and a half that you spent of your life watching back.
