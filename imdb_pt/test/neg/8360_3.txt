In the real world of art, Elizabeth Wurtzel is the sexy queen of the drama that every guy wants to do, but no guy wants to wake up on the side. His on-screen portraitist, Christina Ricci, is the artistic wannabe girl who desperately wants every guy, but no guy will touch her. That's why in the 2001 Prozac Nation, the unreleased 2001 movie from Wurtzel's bestseller book, there are immediate problems. OK, trouble starts before Ricci's miscast, which has the emotional reach of a thimble - is it any wonder that his best performance has been in the two Addams Family films by far? Firstly, she is bizarre looking-with big eyes and a protruding forehead, making her resemble the fetal Starchild of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Secondly, she always plays with brats. But third, it's how movies try to make it look like any guy would be attracted to her. In a scene in the film, her colleague Ruby (Michelle Williams) and Liz walk through Harvard, and all the tongues of the guys are wagging at Ricci, not at the super cute and sexy Williams. Hello ?? .. reality check time ??. This material begged for Andy Warhol's treatment. Here's your version of the movie. A five-minute shot of a hypodermic needle. A five-minute shot of Wurtzel's furry pudding. A five-minute photo of her sleeping naked and stoned in bed. She stands up, gives the middle finger to the audience. Suggestion Credits. See, less than twenty minutes to distill the whole life of Wurtzel. And, oh yeah, Warhol's movie would not have rocked Ricci. Even Michelle Williams would have been better, and after seeing Ricci's pale chest, I would take anything Williams or any other baby had to offer me cinematically. Ricci is almost the kiss of death for a movie, and how she continues working is a mystery. Think of her performances in mediocre bad films like Monster, Sleepy Hollow and Anything Else by Woody Allen, also co-starring Jason Biggs, and now imagine another actress in her role, and immediately the films might look better if not great. She is the female counterpart to banal, woody and heavy actors like Tom Cruise and Leonardo Dicaprio.
