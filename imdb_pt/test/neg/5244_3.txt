Another B movie for teenagers, based mainly on CGI effects, industrial soundtrack and some medieval images. It's a shame that Beowulf's legend is used in such an uninspired way. I'm a fan of Christopher Lambert, but I have to admit that he's getting worse as an actor and his films as well. Rent it if you're just a teenager.
