Altioklar's populist approach manifests itself in all its titles, from the worst to the best. He does not care (or has no idea) about art, all he cares about is making people think they have a groin kick watching their movies. The problem is that the effort is too obvious, and as events unfold with all the nonsense cluttered exaggeration, effort fails. <br /> <br /> In this "Turkish" film (who knows where the original or originals were made, since it seemed to me extremely Hollywood), Altioklar is trying to be some kind of Tarantino. (Mr. Tarantino, if you're reading this, please watch the movie for the best comedy of your life!) He does not use subtle moves to do this, all he does is use extreme things, and it's absurdly absurd and laughable. <br /> <br /> Levent Üzümcü as the forensic guy with licked cow hair is simply hilarious. I hope to meet you in person and ask how he felt about this movie. Because I really found the role insulting to him. Demet Evgar groping his genitalia was also unnecessary, and did nothing but make it all look fake. Another specifically idiotic aspect of this film was the 100% defect rate setting. When things have to be taken slowly, the scenes flow abruptly. And at other times, you become drowsy to see the slow ridicule happening. <br /> <br /> If Altioklar is so deeply in love with the shallowness of Hollywood, he should use Michael Sixarrows as his name. Even such a move would not be as ridiculous as what he did in this film. He must first learn not to imitate directors whose levels he will never approach, then realize that he is not in Hollywood, and then take private lessons from Zeki Demirkubuz or Reha Erdem on how to put the flow of ideas in the plot. This useless film could not be saved either by those, but maybe it can make watchable films in the future by taking these measures. <br /> <br /> By the way I've seen some infamous failures like Propaganda and Otostop, and I still can not help but say that this was the worst Turkish movie of all time.
