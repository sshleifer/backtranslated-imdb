I love Das Boot. I expected something along similar lines - a realistic war film, portraying soldiers and civilians on both sides as real people, with the joy and pain of combat. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Stalingrad seems to have been written. by a third grader and directed by a fifth grader. Large parts of the film simply seem lost, leaving them completely disjointed. The dialogue in translation is ridiculous, but it does not seem better in the native language; you just have to watch the faces of the actors during the bad times of the dialogue to realize how bad this movie is.
