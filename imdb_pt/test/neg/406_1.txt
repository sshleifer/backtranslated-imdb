I picked it up because, having spent time in the Albany area of ​​New York, I met some people in the movie and came across it by accident. The comedy attempts are thighs, the compulsive girl-in-girl scene is sick, the plot is non-existent, acting is among the worst I've ever seen, and I did not even start special effects. I realize that this is a very low budget movie made by an independent small business, but if you're going to make a science fiction horror movie with giant bugs, do not make the giant bugs completely unbelievable. People want to see giant bugs. That's half the fun right there. And if you're going to make giant insects completely unbelievable, at least make the actors make a kind of allusion to that fact ("You guys are idiots! It's not them! You caught their trick doubles!"). Be prepared to waste two hours of your life that you will never get back.
