When a group of businessmen begin to die in the presence of the mysterious mr. Coulomb, FBI agent Dick Martin is assigned to the case. As the killings continue to increase, Martin is obviously not having much success. At the end of the movie, the strange truth is revealed, which I will not reveal here. <br /> <br /> One of the other reviewers commenting on this states: "This is a classic movie and should be enjoyed rather than separated." I'm sorry, but I have to respectfully disagree with this opinion. It is "classic" only because it is ancient, not in any sense relative to its quality. I really enjoyed low budget "B" movies from all that time period, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> The pace is unbearably slow, the camera work is pretty dull, most of the acting is quite wood (even Lugosi is not great in this one in my opinion) and the plot, although it has a interesting premise, seems to be played together in a very difficult to follow.
