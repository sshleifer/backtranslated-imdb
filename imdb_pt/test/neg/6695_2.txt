<br /> <br /> I tuned in to this movie not because I'm a fan of the American basketball team (actually I rarely watch NBA games), but because I'm a fan of Gene Hackman, who can usually bring a impressive depth for their performances. In this case, however, I was very disappointed. This was not one of the bright stars of Hackman's career. <br /> <br /> To be fair to him, he did not have much to work with. As Norman Dale, the new coach of a basketball team from a small Indiana town, he was not called to do much acting. Basically, his performance consisted of walking from side to side on the sides of the basketball, complaining about the referees. I did not find him particularly convincing on paper to be honest. I was also not impressed with the necessary romance between Dale and Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey). Honestly, there was absolutely no chemistry between Hackman and Hershey. The novel never caught my eye, and neither did the "action" of basketball, which was very predictable. <br /> <br /> There were many problems with this movie to make it worthwhile. I never understood the depth of the sheer hatred that many of the townspeople had for Dale, almost from the time he arrived. The development of the character was poor and the story itself was poorly developed. Lot of basketball and little human interaction, in my opinion. How many pictures of children filming baskets do we need to see to understand that this is a basketball movie? There was no suspense: is it possible to even doubt that Hickory will win big? I realize that this is based on a true story, but I think that proves that not every true story should be a movie. Frankly, it was not a very interesting movie. Definitely a movie that Gene Hackman would like to forget. <br /> <br /> Nothing better than a 2/10 in my opinion.
