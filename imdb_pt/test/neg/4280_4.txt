As an avid fan of Disney, I was not entirely impressed with this film, certainly not motivated enough to watch it in theaters. I am, however, so happy that I got on DVD and watched the special features. <br /> <br /> You should check out the "Moose Review": the entire movie can be seen with comments from Rutt and Tuke, the moose relief comic from the story, which are voiced by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas. Two veterans of the famous comedy troupe Second City ad-lib - in character - for an hour and a half about a movie that they clearly enjoy doing. I laughed all the time. The pleasure I received from this comment completely offset the tepid response I had to the movie itself. Do yourself a favor and listen to this!
