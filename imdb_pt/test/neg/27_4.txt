"Cover Girl" is a mediocre musical from World War II with absolutely nothing memorable except for its signature song, "Long Ago and Far Away." This movie came out before Gene Kelly really hit his artistic stride, and while there is evidence of his flourishing talent here, he mostly plays sidekick for Rita Hayworth. And there's the problem. Rita Hayworth is beautiful, no doubt about it. But it simply is not a convincing onscreen presence. I've always wanted to like her more than I really do, and this movie is no exception. She's simply not a very good actress, and she's not even a very good dancer. Good-looking as she is, there's something tasteless about her, and this movie suffers because of it. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
