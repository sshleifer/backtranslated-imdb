I really do not know why I agreed to watch this movie, but as a complete idiot I did and so I deserve to be shot! I had seen the original Killjoy, well, I said I've seen it ... I started watching it, but I found it so bad that I ended up seeing this in 4x speed to get it over with and get rid of the annoying dialogue, but I said that I would watch it and I did it even if it was at 4x speed. <br /> <br /> To cut a long story short Killjoy 2 starts where Killjoy stopped. So I do not mean the plot, I mean the complete and total bag of dirt known as acting and cheapening. I do not have anything against low budget movies, in fact I kind of like them, they are something different from the Mega budget blockbusters, but this movie is just terrible! The acting is diabolical and the script ... well, I think you could give Stevie Wonder a pen and paper, and he would produce something much better! This movie is just annoying, not to mention the annoying laugh that the clown has, which is so obviously dubbed! I could not get through this movie anyway, about three-quarters of the way it was time to turn it off and throw it out the window. It may have been a rip off to buy as a DVD, but as a frisbee it was a mega bargain! <br /> <br /> Please, for the sake of humanity itself, do not watch this crap, it's possibly the worst thing I've ever seen and considering some of the dirt I've seen, that's saying a lot! <br /> <br /> My rating on this movie would be .... Nailgun to the head / 10
