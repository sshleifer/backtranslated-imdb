Oh my God, I'm really sick of all those generic Japanese horror movies about long-haired female ghosts and ghostly kids. "Ghost Train" is no exception. It is clearly influenced by "Ringu", "Ju-On", "Shutter" and "Pulse". Two years ago I was in such modern ghost stories because they usually managed to give me some creeps, unfortunately there is nothing new or interesting in "Ghost Train". In fact, the movie is very annoying. Noriko disappears in a subway tunnel - as a primary school classmate - Nana must investigate a mystery of multiple disappearances, with the help of a young teacher and another mother of "disappeared" child. The film offers some slightly creepy moments, but the CGI effects are laughable and the climax is illogical.
