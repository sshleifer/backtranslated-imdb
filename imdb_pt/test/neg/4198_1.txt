I hired Dark Harvest (the first) because it seemed like a kind of extravagant monster thrill in the box. Scarecrows scare me too. The film had an effective title sequence, but what followed was very bad (flat, bad lighting, acting, editing, directing ...). I recently noticed that DH 2: The Maize had a fairly extensive ad campaign. I thought maybe the first of them was marginally successful, so they raised the ante a bit, possibly delivering some bigger, fx scares from the murderous scarecrows. Well, there are no scarecrows in the video ... Not a problem. Problems begin on DH 2 with a sequence of titles that looks like an unfinished concept with strange shapes and bars erasing titles and other embellishments. As for real photography ... every time the sun shines in a shot, you'd have all of those whites blown off, confirming that you're watching a budget ultra-low budget mini-DV project that some Midwesterner filmed on their Farm uncles. The performance was not acting at all. The cheap theft of the twin girls The Shining was below the standards of freshman students. The edition was extremely amateur and lazy. The sound was shocking and agitated. (for example, every time the editor cuts to a new photo, you can change the perspective of the sound). It's as if someone gathered their friends and family (actors), took a video camera in a cornfield for three days, put a light on it for the nightly sequences (no kidding - that's what they did), burned by some tape , pasted the images on his computer, cut a (very) rough version, released some songs, ignored any imaginative sound work or mixing, recorded directly on DVD and threw it on the shelf of the video store. Any horror fan should be insulted by this kind of direct video work that has NO QUALITY or style. Just because a person owns a video camera and is able to get some image on a tape, does not mean that it should be released to the public. If I could give a rating lower than one, I would.
