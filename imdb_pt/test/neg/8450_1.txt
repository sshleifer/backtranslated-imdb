Like the above poster, I burned myself in the title thinking I was getting the other Piranha ... This movie is all that the poster above said and worse ... Poor camera, poor acting and simply horrible plot ... <br /> <br /> There was very little here that was worth watching ... How this movie was released is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Make sure the movie you buy is what you want ... and not this one. <br /> <br /> The movie I bought was labeled "Piranha" and not "Piranha, Piranha". "which is what it really is ... This is the only way they sold this movie. Peace Out.
