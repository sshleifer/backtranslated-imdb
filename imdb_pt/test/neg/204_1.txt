Well, wherever we started, there was a lot of potential for this movie with big stars playing a role. But the whole story was ruined by a horrible plot. This movie did not give me anything I would expect, the good guy comes out alive, I mean, no one wants the good guy to be successful. The finale was shrilly dignified and very clich√© did not think so ever, YOU HAVE THE LOT ALL WRONG THE MOST EXPENSIVE SIGNS ARE SUCCESSFULLY SUCCESSFUL. <br /> <br /> If you want to waste 1 hour and 2 minutes of your time spent doing something else this movie was the epitome of CRAP. I really think the actors made this movie for some quick Vegas money, no doubt. Save your money watching a better movie.
