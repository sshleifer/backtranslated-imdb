Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor are joining in this comedy about nightclub owners being pressured by organized crime. Eddie Murphy wrote and directed this nasty ego trip and therefore has no one to blame but himself for his failure. This is a genuinely bad movie, so completely devoid of energy and humor that it serves only as an example of Murphy's contempt for his audience. It would be incredibly easy to continue beating in this movie, but I will show more mercy than show the audience and stop now.
