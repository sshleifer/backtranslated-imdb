Lucille Ball was a powerful power on television during the 1950s and 1960s, but was still making an occasional film, most notably THE LONG, THE LONG TRAILER, and THE FACTS OF LIFE. Although her television career remained strong, when the 1970s began, her film career seemed to be ending - but Ball was determined to have one last great adventure, and the project she selected was the MAME musical of 1966. <br /> < In many respects, the role seemed tailor-made: based on the popular novel that gave rise to two different Broadway plays, Mame Dennis is a crazy and uninhibited woman who "inherits" her orphaned nephew Patrick - and takes him on a wild ride of life's possibilities, jumping from one comical wave to another. The song, which featured songs like "Open a New Window" and "If It Walked Into My Life Today," was among Jerry Herman's best works. The support cast, which included Robert Preston and Bea Arthur, was the best of the best. Expectations were high; the opening night fanfare was tremendous; The movie was a disaster. The critics were horrified and the audience gasped. <br /> <br /> No matter what Lucy's fans might say, MAME is a fiasco, so much so that it's hard to know where to start. It's misdirected, poorly filmed, poorly performed, and there Lucille Ball is at the center of everything, unable to dance, unable to sing and smiling like a wax doll while an incredibly bad choreography revolves around her. But disaster is hardly her doing alone; the support cast does not do better. Bea Arthur and Jane Connell recreate their roles on the stage of Vera Charles and Agnes Gooch; the former is stage, the latter is gloomy. Robert Preston manages to sing with a smile but he is very well on his own and clearly is not very happy about it. <br /> <br /> The DVD brings the pan-and-scan VHS movie to widescreen, but that just means there are more horrors to see. Everyone loves Lucy, but only the less critical fan can love Lucy's MAME; while I would not say it's bad enough to make you want to pluck your eyes, you may wish you had. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
