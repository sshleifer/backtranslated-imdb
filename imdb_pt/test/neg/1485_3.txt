Yes, the movie was so boring and tasteless. after a certain point, I was wanting the crocodile to eat these people just so we could finish the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is that three Australians take a fishing trip down the river in a small boat, where the fishing guide holds a gun. He says he only does this for insurance purposes, all crocodiles were hunted out of this river. He is immediately eaten by a Croc. The trio is then chased by a tree, being caught by the reptile in its attempts to escape. They spend most of the film arguing about the best way to escape. Predictably, the only survivor finds the guide's weapon and shoots the crocodile. Oh, they killed the only nice character in the movie! <br /> <br /> Where is Paul Hogan or Steve Irwin when you really need them?
