I was looking forward to this movie. Being an old fan of Robert E Howard, especially from a Conan point of view. <br /> <br /> I was not expecting too much and I thought they could not ruin everything ... Oh honey - how wrong I was ... <br /> <br /> The main flaw was that it was enough boring He needed to join in a good helping of supernatural events, sword fights and the like. <br /> <br /> You had some blood, but everything else was very lifeless. The middle section seemed to involve only 40 minutes in a muddy forest with slow and slow-drawn carts and slower character development and dialogue! <br /> <br /> On the plus side = Costumes and effects were good, but not enough to keep their interest. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been better to slow down, increase the pace and go for a 12A rating. As a ten year old boy, I may have liked this movie. Probably over the age that I was reading Conan stories for the first time funny enough. Maybe that says a lot about my expectation of the movie? <br /> <br /> Or ....... Really go "Art-House" with tone, direction, etc. But this is quite high risk, so far as Box Office is concerned. <br /> <br /> Oh well .... Maybe the next movie Conan will make up for it?
