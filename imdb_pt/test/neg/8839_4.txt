Lone Star Productions certainly produced them in the 1930s, and "Star Packer" feels like one of the most rushed. John Wayne is American Marshal John Travers, investigating a crooked crook known only as "The Shadow," responsible for stealing oxen, stage robberies and the like, and giving orders behind the door of a fake box. Yakima Canutt is the faithful Indian companion of Travers, aptly named as ... well, "Yak." <br /> <br /> Early on, we discovered that Matt Matlock (George Pre-Gabby Hayes) is actually the boss of the Cattlemens Union. The shadow; the offer is inoperative when he offers to buy his niece (supposed) from Anita, half of the Matlock ranch, since "this is not a place for a girl." Like Anita, Verna Hillie does not have much to do in the film, although in a comedic moment, she can use a six-shooter to blow up the target of one of the villains in a night attack. <br /> <There are some curiosities in the film - for example, Wayne's character alternately rides a white horse and a dark horse in the first half of the film. In what could have been a legal device, a hollow tree stump used by a henchman is located right in the middle of the street. And finally, the film does not live up to its name, since Sheriff Travers never wears a badge throughout the film, that is, a packer of stars without a star. <br /> <br /> The horse chases, the fugitive stage scenes, the stagecoach off the cliff (another curiosity, the horses conveniently get off the stage) are quite standard things. But John Wayne fans will want to see this for the charisma he showed early in his career. To the more critical, the white handkerchiefs worn on the forehead by the good squatters could only mean that they all had a headache.
