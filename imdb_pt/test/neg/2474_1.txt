No, Hitch is definitely not a romantic comedy about the bilious (and bibulous) ex-leftist-commentator-transformer and reactionary commentator Christopher Hitchens, though he certainly would have made a funny movie. A little grumpy Englishman with cigarette-stained teeth and Guinness, giving advice - and bitter political remarks - to men in love: "Look in the EYES when you talk to her, you crazy!" And remember to call someone "neo-conservative" makes you an anti-Semitic indeed! You do not get anything straight, your liberal panties? "Oh well, instead we have Will Smith, whose continued success remains a mystery to me, at least.I'm seemingly alone in this respect. Smith is the most powerful man in Hollywood to this day: Americans can not afford to throw money at him.I, on the other hand, find his presumption unbearable, not mitigated by a scene here (spoiled by the trailer), where he suffers a drastic We know that Smith will recover with his good looks, because there is a fat actor (Kevin James) in the hand playing the foolish part of the game, and we should laugh hysterically whenever the maniac begins to dance like an idiot.

Am I taking all this very seriously? Or - and here's a bold thought - maybe the writers could not conceive of a character logically designed to save their lives? <br /> <br /> Speaking of writers, they create a bad idea for Smith's love. interest: a writer of a tabloid (Eva Mendes). Since when do tabloid creeps deserve love? In what universe am I, anyway? - Everyone here on IMDb is gushing about this thing. Either you all need to raise the level in terms of entertainment value for your money, or I'm just a skunk at the garden party. (Me and about 150 million other boyfriends and husbands who suffer a lot). Anyway, if I can imitate Smith's Hitch and offer my male readers good advice: When you're dragged to see * Hitch *, tell your Better Half "Hey, it was really good" after the movie was over. Do not be overly enthusiastic; do not get excited about it - she'll know you're lying to her. Praise this in a slightly surprising way, as if the movie were better than you expected and were not the agonizing waste of time it really was. But what am I saying, huh, guys? - We guys know all the moves. <br /> <br /> 1 star of 10.
