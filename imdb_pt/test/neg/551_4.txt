In 1984, The Karate Kid had some charm, even if it was little more than Rocky of a poor man. Unfortunately, producer Jerry Weintraub did not realize that it was better to leave the story where it ended, and convinced Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita to make the extra effort to turn the film into a trilogy. Part III was the definitive low in the franchise, but someone must have thought that the series still had some potential. What other explanation could there be for the existence of The Next Karate Kid? <br /> <br /> Wait a minute. Next? Yes, Macchio is gone (at least he was smart enough to stop eventually), and his replacement is Hilary Swank (!), Playing a troublesome teenager (what else?) Called Julie Pierce. Now the girl has family problems. She also gets in trouble at school. He said the school has a sadistic gym teacher (Michael Ironside). It turns out, however, that one of his students is a nice guy, and Julie falls in love with him. This puts her in bigger trouble than before, of course. Luckily, she is currently living with Mr. Miyagi (Morita), an old friend of her grandfather who knows how to get back to the bad guys. <br /> <br /> All these factors are up to seven years old. cliches, and this is just a generic summary of the plot - imagine what the detailed scenes should be like! From beginning to end, The Next Karate Kid is a tired, flat, monotonous marathon of idiot lines and assemblies. Swank, fortunately, has the likes of Boys Do not Cry and Million Dollar Baby to rescue this mess, but why did Morita accept it back? He may have received an Oscar nomination for the first film, and it was quite nice in the sequels, but he has nothing to speak for him here - even the revival of the "waxing" wax gag is stillbirth. As for Ironside, he's a little better than Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Griffith in Part III, but that's not a stretch. <br /> <br /> So, is this image really horrible? Not exactly. There is a sequel that can achieve a strange beauty, but when the best part of the whole film involves a group of Asian monks dancing while listening to pop music for the first time in their lives, this does not qualify as a recommendation to see the rest.
