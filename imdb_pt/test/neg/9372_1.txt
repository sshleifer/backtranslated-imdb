Eliza Dushku is a very talented and beautiful actress. She manages to be the center of "Tru Calling," but that is not enough to rescue her TV series from mediocrity. It's a shame that a woman as attractive and talented as Dushku should go from an important supporting role in Buffy the Vampire Slayer to this clunker. <br /> <br /> Unoriginal and desperately trying to be hip, "Tru Calling" does not excite at any level above hormonal. The homonymous heroine spends most of her time running around in what must be a very small town in order to avoid the death of good-looking corpses she has met in the morgue where she works. Despite all the rush she does, she always comes in looking like she just came out of a portable air-conditioned dressing room. <br /> <br /> In each episode, Eliza Dushku and the rest of the cast struggle to bring to life the dull and characterless scripts, but it is a futile exercise. "Tru Calling" just stands on the slab, staring lifelessly at the ceiling.
