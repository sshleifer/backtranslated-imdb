some would argue that this is best mainly because of the performance; but is in fact much worse for reasons that outweigh the improvement. <br /> <br /> the source from which all problems originate; the story. In addition to one being shot randomly, with a shotgun, in the chest and surviving for hours without medical attention, there is a bigger problem. Nic, the bandit with the heart of gold, is willing to do anything for the friend he just met that day; and this includes asking for help from an evil spirit. Ce-Ce, who comes out of nowhere with a voodoo past, is willing to summon Killjoy, as long as Nic can "hook" her. the performance, though improved, is still horrible. these people could not convey emotion from a paper bag. the script also does not help. stupid lines, and I can only assume any direction from the director. this script was read as Shakespeare in high school with a teacher whipping them while they went. <br /> <br /> While this movie (if you can call it like that in its 80 min runtime (thankfully)) is perhaps even funnier than the first because of all these things, it is definitely more painful to watch. 1/10
