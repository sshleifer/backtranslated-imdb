* spoiler alert! * only comes to me the nerve that some people have to redo (and I use the term loosely here ..) good movies. In the American version of this Dutch thriller, someone decided that the original ending was not pasteurized enough for the American public. So what do they do? they create a new one! a stupid, improbable, I-pretend-I-am-dead-but-come-to-life-again-then-the-good-face-can-kick-my-back-more-end type. do yourself a favor and get the original.
