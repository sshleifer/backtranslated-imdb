I've been watching "LOST" with my family since the first episode, it used to be great. Last season was very disappointing, it seems like they (writers) do not know what to do with the show, so they keep trying to do this by stretching a story line in an entire episode. The current season, which by the way decided to continue watching just to see Rodrigo Santoro, and also with a little hope that things would improve; has been a disappointment after another; my husband and son stopped watching. First of all, he (Santoro) appears only for 30 seconds in each episode. But the real problem is with the plot, there is nothing really going on, each episode can be shown in 15 minutes. We watch every episode waiting for something that never happens; I'm not asking that every secret be revealed at once, but how about a variation on the story lines? In the first and second seasons, we had different story lines, we saw the story of the characters, a bit of action, a bit of romance, now it's like a big event that takes the whole episode to unravel. It's almost tiring to see you, when it's over you have the feeling that you've wasted your time. Now, it's important to note that the actors are still great. I can not believe they killed Mr. Eko (Adelawale ...) he was great, Jack (Mathew Fox) is still amazing, the perfect hero, so kind, brave magnanimous Sawyer (Josh Holloway), the "bad boy" is maturing because of Kate (Evangeline Lylli), but that's cool. I miss Sayid (Naveen Andrews), Sun and Jin (Yoon-jin Kim and Daniel Dae Kim), they are all an important part of the plot (or should be), but we barely see them. I hope that Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro) has an important role in the show; if not, why did you make a big deal of it join the show (Access Hollywood, etc.)? Sorry if I've been snoring for a long time, but I feel cheated by this show. When I started watching, it was great, I got used to it and now it's very disappointing to see how it's going. I'll be here, waiting for the improvements !!! Katia
