The gate of Hell opened under Moscow. A priest, played by Vincent Gallo, goes to the city to find a missing friend in the tunnels under the city in an attempt to find the portal. Wandering underground, he and his colleagues have to deal with the inhabitants of the human and demonic tunnels. Good idea with a good cast of second-line actors is nothing like the tunnels that are your setup. I've watched it twice now and I still have no idea why this is supposed to be scary when not much happens, so people talk about evil and we see shadow forms. Nothing is clear and honestly I have not seen the point of all this apart from providing a paycheck to those involved (Val Kilmer is second in a couple of fleeting scenes that do not mean much beyond allowing him to be billed as in the movie .) The idea is really good, the performances are good, the script does not get you anywhere. Follow the advice of several characters in the movie and do not cross the river to see this.
