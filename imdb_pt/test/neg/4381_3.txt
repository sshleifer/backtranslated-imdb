"Hero and the Terror" is a rather boring thriller - a la: no substance of real character, predictable plot and ... boring. For a thriller, I found this movie slow to its climax, which seemed to drag on until the baby of Chuck's wife was born ... and then drags itself to the end - which I can hardly remember yet, though I have seen the movie 10 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 out of 10 - for the first 10-20 minutes.
