I only supported this movie to satisfy my curiosity. It has to be one of the worst movies I've ever had. I'm amazed that this movie currently has a rating of 7.5 stars. The acting is horrible, the script is non-existent and the characters are so predictable and empty. For a funny movie, I do not even remember laughing once and I can not see how this could be defined as a comedy. Do yourself a favor and stay well away from this scum and check out some more worthy alternatives that would give you a lot more pleasure. Check out movies like Holiday or 27 Dresses, these movies offer a much more satisfying movie experience. I sincerely hope that the more educated movie goers cast a negative vote for this film in the way it genuinely deserves, giving it a more realistic rating than other movie fans could base their judgment on. Come on, let's be fair to everyone involved and give those involved with this film a real reflection on what they have produced - an extremely mediocre image that deserves to be forgotten very quickly.
