I kind of liked this movie, not a good movie, but not the worst ever. However, everyone says it's one of the worst movies ever created, I thought everything was fine. There are many immature jokes. She wants to be funny sometimes, but fails. <br /> <br /> The story is good. It can be a bit difficult to follow for the younger audience, though. <br /> <br /> The acting is very bad. Jamie Kennedy is a horrible actor most of the time. At times it's even laughable. Alan Cumming is probably the best actor here. He's funny when he's supposed to be, but some of his lines are horrible. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the main bad thing about this movie that I hated was the voice of Tim Avery when he's possessed by the masquerade. The voice is HORRIBLE. In addition, the scenes in which he is are so dull, they are almost unbearable. I'm sure they could have eliminated it, and that would not affect the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, you can live without seeing it. It's a good movie to watch, if you have nothing else to watch, though. They definitely could have gone without making the continuation, but it's a decent effort. 4/10
