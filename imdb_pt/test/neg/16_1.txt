For years, I've been a big fan of Park's work and "Old Boy" is one of my all time favorites. <br /> <br /> With much anticipation I rented this movie, only to find the worst movie I watched in a while. It's not a proper horror movie; there's no suspense in that and even the "light" part is so dumb, I did not know whether to laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> I introduced my younger brother to Chan-Wook Park and what a disappointment he got out of it. For me, an idol has fallen. <br /> <br /> If you love movies like "Old Boy", Mr. & Lady "Vengeance" or even your short films about "Three Extremes", do not waste your time, the movie is not worth it .
