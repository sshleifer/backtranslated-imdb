"The Duke" is a film based on the heart of the British aristocracy, where an old Duke (John Neville) dies and to avoid his great property and the vast riches to be taken from him after death by two dishonest aristocrats (Oliver Muirhead and Sophie E Oh, man); he passes his duke to his dog. The dog's "best friend", an American girl named Charlotte (played by Courtnee Draper) whose parents die, becomes an orphan of the ex-duke because he is her great-uncle. A young chef named Florian arrives, with him and Charlotte hooking up instantly creating a romantic sub-plot that, in its own way, acts as the weaker tone for the main plot being Hubert's, The Duke's activities and his many activities and Love interests with other dogs. All this is guarded by James Doohan, who plays a butler who is determined to try to serve his old duke, doing his best to serve his new master, Hubert. Doohan acts as the oldest character to comfort and advise the younger while he looks and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master. A great comedic performance mixed with elements of drama to end the career of an excellent and influential actor. <br /> <br /> Although, from a technical point of view, I do not like this movie, I just watched as I discovered the role of James Doohan. Although the plot is good, elements of writing and direction have to be obscured. Ignoring the absurdity of a "Doggie Duke," I personally do not like the overuse of comic and outrageous jokes about the "bad" characters because of their absurdity. The dependence on hygiene-related humor as you like is very evident and the general nonsense of many characters does not appeal to me. The director, Phillip Spink, uses medium shots with an overdubbed voice or affects the overall sound quality. In addition, the performance of Muirhead and Heyman, while good in the dramatic and romantic sequences, fall drastically short by fulfilling the wholesale demands on paper. <br /> <br /> But as a mature movie fan, I find it easy to be more critical of a simple family movie designed to make you laugh. I can admit that I found certain funny bits and other pieces playing along with a plot that may be overkill but have definite connections. I do not recommend this movie to mature movie fans, but I would highly recommend dog lovers, families who wish to enjoy a funny movie for their children and fans of James Doohan who wish to see Scotty in his final role.
