The murder of the Red Comyn at Grayfriars Abbey was a long way from one of the most terrible things ever done in the Scottish War of Independence, and the struggles (and deaths) in the churches were not uncommon. Not long after, Robert Bruces wife, daughter, two of his sisters were captured during a fray in a church in which people were killed. And to compare it with the Berwick massacre in which the English massacred at least 8,000 noncombatants (some, yes, in the churches) is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> That being said, this is not a well-made movie. It is an antidote to the ridiculous portrayal of Robert Bruce in Braveheart. Whatever Bruce was, it was not a bit. <br /> <br /> Too bad they did not do a better job of it because someone should make a really GOOD movie of a war that is so incredible that it sounds like something someone invented from complete defeat at the Battle of Methven to a return secret from the hideout to a long guerrilla war at Bannockburn. This is not it though. Badly done and largely misspelled and acted. What a pity!
