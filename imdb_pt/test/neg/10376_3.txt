Formula to the maximum No title reflects the current content of the series, "Fighting Nazis in Morocco" (actually, the Iverson ranch). The plot is just to fill the pauses between fights. The packaging claims more than 40 'fistic encounters' in 15 chapters. That's at least three a chapter! In addition to seeing Duncan Renaldo as a Frenchman with a Spanish accent, observing how much furniture is knocked over, broken, thrown, burned, or blown is what really matters to this series. When the protagonists begin to fight, you can bet that everything in the room will also be in it. So, congratulations to the fight choreographer, who is the real star of this series! <br /> <br /> Two positive notes: the characters sometimes lose their hats during the fights, and best of all, we have the female side kick (often a journalist, as she is here) really participating in the chaos , mainly shooting and killing the bad guys. Still to come is Linda Stirling killing the main villain in "Manhunt of Mystery Island" (1945). On the down side, there are only many jumps off the escape route - before the slab falls, before the car drives over the cliff, before the boat explodes, before the building explodes, before the truck hits you, etc. <br /> <br /> It is said that this series partially "inspired" George Lucas to make the first Indiana Jones film, but this is more by implicit concept than because of the real story or the development of the series. <br /> <br /> Rod Cameron 'shines' like a moving rock, a role he has played in all his films. In addition to seeing all the furniture being broken, there is nothing really going on here, compared to other shows that have less fights, more story, better actors and more developed characters. <br /> <br /> I give a 3 for all the furniture breaking.
