I read all the comments for this movie straight to video. I can agree that the film is not of "Armageddon" or "Deep Impact" quality. However, if you are looking for a way to spend ninety minutes or more then this is a movie that is bearable. <br /> <br /> I started looking at the movie early in the morning while I was doing a geek thing. It was very good because I was able to switch between what I was doing and watch the movie without losing a beat. It's a predictable film, and the acting is not up to par with some of the veteran actors (eg, Dennis Hopper). <br /> <br /> But I must point out that I paid just $ 2 (US) and as the old saying goes: you get what you pay for! If you are looking for some deep meaning movie you will have to watch it over and over again, then this is definitely the long video. On the other hand, if you are looking for something to pass the time, then there is nothing wrong with Tycus (which, incidentally, was called "Comet: Final Impact" in Mexico where I found this video).
