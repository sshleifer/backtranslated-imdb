<br /> <br /> To make this short and sweet: I hope this film is not considered the seminal work for the "Asian genre" of American cinema. the performance was unsatisfactory, relying on stereotypes, loud voices and exaggerated madness to convey his message. Chris Chan Park does not dive too deep into any of his characters, allowing them to remain caricatures of angry, frustrated / distant / non-communicative Asians. these representations do not make the characters mysteriously attractive; it makes them confused and unfriendly. I like to think that we Asians are more complex than that. <br /> <br /> I left the movie unconvinced. Not convinced that these characters had a long, blood brother's life as they connected with each other to go to the length they did to help his friend out. Not convinced that the main character had anything but a superficial attraction to his girlfriend. not convinced that hard-working immigrant parents would not pay for their son's college education. not convinced that all the characters were even needed, namely: janet, who is laid in bed in the back of the car and quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> The plot, which I really think had potential, was not allowed to come into its own for two reasons: 1) flat characters for whom I had no sympathy / affinity, 2) the plot is overshadowed by senseless non-sequitur scenes such as the Spiritist / Donut session sequence with Amy Hill that was simply ridiculous and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> I recommend the park for your efforts, since I'm sure it took a lot of work to produce the film, and I'll even give it the benefit of the doubt. time around a novice director / writer, but I sincerely hope that the next time he goes a little deeper. just because the film is one of the first of its kind on the Korean-American experience, does not mean it's automatically good.
