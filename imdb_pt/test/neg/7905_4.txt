This movie was not very funny. It was not too horrible either. Just a fun ride aboard Soul Plane. It is a black owned flight service with an incredible nightclub, a gorgeous bar and flight attendants. The plot takes you through the idea of ​​a black airplane (not race or color, but "style") with the same black humor style. Sometimes there are some great rare scenes, like when the main character uses the 'normal' lavatory in the 'normal' plane. Take a look. There are calms, however, and I find more in the character who played the Soul Pilot. Watch to find out who you are. All in all, it's a fun movie. Tom Arnold enhances the fun with his 'cracker' attitude. This is a movie to watch while playing poker, when you are drunk or just vegging.
