This movie sucked on so many levels! Have you seen the dentist? This movie made the dentist seem like a masterpiece. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, unless, of course, you're really really bored, then maybe. It was so cheesy. The killer remembers the grandpa of monsters, except he has goggles. When Jessica said, "I want you to meet somebody, my inner bitch, I thought she was going to kick his ass, but all she did was throw a trash can for him. The scene of crying about his wife, I SO felt the pain behind their tears ......... NO !!!!! So, before watching this movie, get a blanket and a pillow, stay comfortable because it is very relaxing.
