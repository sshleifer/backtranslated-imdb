Sometimes Full Moon makes fun movies. This is not one of them. Full Moon is like a Discrete Troma. His films are not so violent or off the wall, but are usually so devoid of talent. The acting in this film is not terrible, but the script is very bad, and overall it is very annoying and does not even contain nudity (like many Full Moon movies) to rescue it. Skip this, and go rent "Head of the Family".
