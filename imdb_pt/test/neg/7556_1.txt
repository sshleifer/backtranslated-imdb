I really can not remember any detail of this movie except that the setting looked very familiar. Then I realized it was filmed at the Lazy Lizard Hostel in Moab, Utah. This was one of my favorite places to visit when I was younger and wandered around the country. The guy who owns / manages the hostel got into the movie. All I remember about the movie's plot is that it involves jeeps and naked women. It's great to watch just for the scenery (I mean the rock formations) ... If you're just looking for soft-core porn, you'll probably be better served elsewhere. I do not even know if this movie is available on tape or DVD.
