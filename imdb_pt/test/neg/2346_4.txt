If you manage to overcome the slow start and poor performance, it is worth watching. The story was pretty decent. His father had a perverse temperament because he was unemployed and could barely see him except in the summer because his ex-wife had custody of him. The father became very angry and frustrated most of the time. The monster of the story was not too scary. The film breaks the consistency of the monster by being incredibly strong. The only scene in which filmmakers do this is one of the times the boy is in the basement and the monster will attack him. When the monster will attack the boy, his arm is caught in a steel trap attached to a chain. The monster is about three inches from the boy's face. All other times during the movie, the monster is strong enough to break or knock down anything. However, the trap and the steel chain prevent him from taking the child! More than likely the filmmakers did this because of the shock because nobody wants to see one of the main characters die. The filmmakers just wanted to scare us and think that it could be a possibility that the boy would die. Instead of breaking the consistency, the filmmakers should have replaced the boy with someone they could get rid of!
