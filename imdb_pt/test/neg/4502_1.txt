Having been a fan of Godzilla for many years, Gamera was for me a cheap imitation to capitalize on the success of Toho's # 1 kaiju star. ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS was for me at the time (1975) an almost painful experience. <br /> <br /> Last weekend, I attended the annual Godzilla festival, known as G-FEST, where Carl Craig, one of the stars of GAMERA vs. VIRAS, made an appearance. Of course, they introduced this movie. It was one of the most hilarious bad movies ever made. Of course, you have to be in the right mood to watch it. In one scene, for example, scouts held prisoners aboard the alien spacecraft can escape by distracting the not-too-bright aliens. When they realize they've been cheated, one of them says, "That's funny ... I think those kids lied to us." Not even the PLAN NINE EXTERIOR SPACE can boast of this kind of dialogue. <br /> <br /> <br /> This may not be GODZILLA or even GAMERA 3, but this is a decent waste of time if you watch it in the right mood. <br /> <br /> However, if you want high quality kaiju entertainment, check out the newly released GAMERA 3. Rating: ** 1/2 out of *****
