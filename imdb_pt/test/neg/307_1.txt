I checked this out at the Vancouver International Film Festival and I was not impressed. <br /> <br /> The only area of ​​the film that I liked was the commentary on the production of films. For the most part, this movie seemed random and somewhat fantastic (I do not say this in a complementary way, though) and just silly. It was as if he was mixing fantasy with everyday life, which may seem intriguing in some films, but fantasy simply seemed unnecessarily perverse. <br /> <br /> My criticism of this film is not in the actors but in the story. in itself. I found it boring and narcissistic. I wanted my money back, but considering it was a Film Festival, that was not going to happen.
