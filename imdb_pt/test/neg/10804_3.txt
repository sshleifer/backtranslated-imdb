Soultaker was written by and starring Vivian Schilling. He also starred in Joe Estevez, Gregg Thomsen and Robert D'Zar as the Angel of Death. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the introduction of Soultaker, played by Joe Estevez. We quickly learn what Soultaker's role will be in this film. <br /> <br /> Then college kids are getting ready for a summer festival, aptly called "Summerfest." In this film, the class battle is ubiquitous throughout the film. Girls come from a wealthy class, and the guys come from middle or lower class. Class roles seem to play a part in the film for some reason that is not very clear or pertinent to the story. <br /> <br /> At Summerfest we learn more about the apparent class struggles of why Zach is not encouraged to date Natalie. Soultaker also makes an appearance, apparently with his boss, the Angel of Death. Here the character of D'Zar points out who should die and who is the soul that must be taken. It is also revealed that Soultaker will have a character conflict over Natalie, and how he deals with her because of someone in her past. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Natalie is abandoned for her ride to Summerfest, and Zach convinces her. to go home with them. During the trip home, Soultaker takes an active role causing them to spoil terribly at high speeds. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story involves the Soultaker collecting the souls of the dead passengers, and Zach and Natalie trying to fool. he to return to their bodies so they can continue to live. Class and character conflicts are in history, but they are never actually brought up or resolved. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt at the end to drag part of the drama, there is a lot of chasing and running which tends to be really annoying. It is not really acceptable, and it would have been nice if this had been treated differently, somehow to perhaps increase the drama, but did not annoy the audience. <br /> <br /> The story and acting are decent. The soundtrack is good, and even the production values ​​are good. <br /> <br /> Robert D'Zar in his brief onscreen appearance does a good job as the Angel of Death. Joe Estevez does the right thing, however, sometimes his role is a bit flat. Vivian is pretty and does a decent job like Natalie, although she may have a bit of acting in some scenes. <br /> <br /> This may seem strange, but this movie could definitely have benefited from some nonsense. Vivian teases us a little, but that was not enough. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this was a very serious attempt to make a movie. The results are worth watching. Just do not expect perfect production. <br /> <br /> 3/10
