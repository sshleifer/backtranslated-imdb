I chose or about this movie. This movie has been on my "must see" list for a while because people have said it is "disturbing" and also the VHS box contains many, many quotes from people saying how "awesome" or "as close as you can reach the Texas Chainsaw Massacre "and lines like that. But, sorry guys, I was disappointed great time. The idea is interesting, but the script is so underdeveloped that each character becomes a miscreation of evolution and people actually make the film's most idiotic movies. <br /> <br /> This, in turn, takes away any credibility that the plot may have had otherwise. I could not believe how unnecessarily loooooong some "where it is, let's find it" sequences were. Some bloody moments to please the gore fan, but they are so few that when we get to them, it does not make sense. If Luther is a geek, then filmmakers must really be in the food chain.
