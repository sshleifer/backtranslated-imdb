Debbie Boone had a monstrous success with her pop recording "You Light Up My Life"; Didi Conn's film of the same name, however, was a terribly embarrassing failure. Conn plays the stereotypically silly and vulnerable girl who is in love with Michael Zaslow, who plays the stereotyped yuppie-wannabe. They are involved, but everyone knows that Zaslow is not going to marry someone who is not blond and built, so only Didi is surprised when he leaves her. Needless to say, Didi is quite ashamed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, she's done a little composition in her spare time, and she comes up with a song she thinks is very beautiful. She calls it - can you guess? - "You illuminate my life". She gets in the car and goes to the big city to sell her music and make a new life. Now, I remember sitting in the movie theater and watching her get into the car to go to the big city and think, "Well, thank God, we finally got the whole show out." Now, something interesting might happen. Credits rolled. <br /> <br /> Yes, that was it. Not only was the film misinterpreted, poorly written and poorly filmed, but also finished in the middle. This movie is really a very bad movie, and we're not talking about bad movies here. We're talking about absolute failure, a real yawn from start to finish. If you liked Debbie Boone's song, buy a copy of it. But do not waste your time or money on this movie. This is a movie that you will be glad you missed. <br /> Gary F.
