What a waste of time watching this movie. Poor picture quality, poor sound, poor acting and definitely not based on real facts. The deputy's "girlfriend" made as much effort, as did the sheriff, who was more comedy than horror. The deputy tries to make an emergency call by dialing 911 ... PROBLEM ... in 1957, that emergency number did not exist. This is just one example of blatant inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> The "scary" aspect was very poorly done. It just did not look horrible to me. <br /> <br /> I thought the actor who played Gein did the most admirable acting work of the entire film. I might as well see mental disturbances in your character portrait. <br /> <br /> Sorry ... this just did not get it !!
