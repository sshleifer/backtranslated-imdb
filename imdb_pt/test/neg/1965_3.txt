- It may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> Clearly, anyone who has ever made this movie must have had a lot of connections. I just can not see it any other way. What really surprises me is that no one used the name Allen Smithee, and most surprisingly, everyone involved did not use that name. <br /> <br /> Anyway, where to start. The bad dialogue, the miserable costumes, the sad movie, the unintentional comedy, the exaggerated characters and more inconsistencies than the university career of George W. Bush. I do not know what was funny, the guy losing his arm because of a snowball, or the slow-motion scene where all Jack Frosts babies were being killed. In addition, one of the great lines of all time has been uttered in this film. "How do we know it's him?" As there is another mutant snowman that can talk and kill people with snowballs! A great camping movie, but a really bad movie overall.
