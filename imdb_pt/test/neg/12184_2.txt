In the twilight years of his career, Charles Bronson forged long-lasting partnerships with several directors, most notably J. Lee Thompson and Michael Winner. He also made two films for former Bond director Peter Hunt - the first being the 1981 hit action film Death Hunt, the second being this indifferent political pursuit thriller. Murder is very monotonous if the truth is known, and in the end you will feel desirous of something with a little more passion and rhythm, like The Wilby Conspiracy, for example (which, in appearance, this movie looks like). <br /> Bronson sleeps through his role as bodyguard Jay Killian, whose mission is to protect the wife of American President Lara Royce Craig (Jill Ireland, Bronson's real-life wife). Killian believes that Mme. Craig was targeted by murderers; she thinks he is a paranoid and overprotective pessimist. It happens - surprise, surprise - that Killian was right all along and someone is really off to eradicate it. The two flee, pursued by the killers. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows that the wife of an American president is known as the first lady. For some reason, in this movie they have renamed it "One Mama"! What this means is that nobody knows, but it is indicative of the lack of meaning of the film as a whole. Most of the film's performances are lazy, and the script takes a long time to get where it's going. If I had to label Murder within a specific genre, I'd call it a "suspense." I would say that with some reservations, however, as to say that it is a thriller, it has few precious emotions.
