While this is terribly dated, I must insist ... PLEASE DO NOT REMAKE! Frankly, this simply will not help, as there is nothing that can be added or modified contemporaneously to make it cinematographically better. <br /> <br /> The novel on which this is based, was atmospheric, well written, truly scary work, but in the movies, it simply does not translate. Most of King's written works do not translate into film. I do not know why that happens, but when you see that work, if you see it, you'll probably see exactly what I mean. <br /> <br /> The book? It is wonderful. It's not a masterpiece, but it's more than just entertainment. <br /> <br /> The movie? Do something else. You can thank me later. <br /> <br /> He ranks a 3.1 / 10 from ... <br /> the Demon :.
