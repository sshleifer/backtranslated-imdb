This series does not present the British view of the Revolutionary War, but rather an anti-American view of it. The underlying theme of the series is that a silent majority of settlers enjoyed British rule; that the founding fathers were manipulators whose sole purpose was to bring Britain into a violent civil war; that the American supporters of the revolution and of the militia were violent racist and violent, cheated in the struggle. Clearly, the author's intention, Richard Holmes, is for the viewer to extrapolate these characteristics, in a straight line, from the American population of 1775 to today. For example, in "The" episode Holmes gathers an obscure copy of the Boston Massacre, in which he claims that the skin of Crispus Attucks, a black man and the first man killed in the revolution, was purposely "bleached". Holmes claims that portraying Attucks as a black man would be a bad propaganda for the revolutionary cause. Holmes never reveals how he knows it. And there is more Holmes strives to work on a single baseless atrocity: the desecration of the body of a British soldier. He compares the American militia to the Viet Cong and the mujahadeen - not to mention differences in the aims of these groups. The list goes on. <br /> <br /> Supposedly, this series was made in response to "The Patriot" by Mel Gibson. It says a lot when an academic feels the need to respond to Mel Gibson on any subject. Instead of presenting the British view, it seems that Holmes really wanted to give a sensationalist and anti-American view, and in the process became the historian's Roger Corman - a strictly third-rate stressor.
