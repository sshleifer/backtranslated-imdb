I do not know what movie goers expect today, but after 68 years of watching film .. (Well, maybe I have not watched many movies in the first 9 - 10 years, so do this 58 years watching movie) I hope to be entertained, not bored with tears, beaten by continual profanity (all other words) and idiotic scenes of violence that are presented with no other purpose in mind, but to show blood splatters and body parts being mutilated. Surveillance is one of those movies that were made by people who have NO imagination, little or no talent, a total inability to put together scenes and an irrational trace of letting a scene continue and continue, long after the end of its purpose. That anyone would think this was a worthwhile movie, when it's nothing but Hollywood trash is beyond me. As a combat veteran, I have seen violence, blood and blood in many ways, and movies like "We were soldiers" are as violent as a movie can be, but have redemptive value. Surveillance must have been invented by people in a drug-induced stupor, with no ability to write, no leadership training, no experience in film editing, and total lack of contact with reality. Just a stupid movie of two serial killers posing as FBI agents setting a stage to kill some stupid cops, and so on. An expensive piece of junk that only an idiot could like ...
