I'm not familiar with the other works of the producer, but this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> I've never seen the MST3K version, but I can say that Mike and the Bots probably have not. <br /> <br /> I love a z-degree film as much as the next fan of bad movies, but that was almost impossible to watch. <br /> <br /> There was no credit to anyone who did the voice of "The Dark." It sounded a little like Patrick Stewart sometimes. <br /> <br /> A group of high school students who found a super-8 camera in the trash can could make a movie better than that.
