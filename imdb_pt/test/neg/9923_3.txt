<br /> <br /> Very slow and heavy film with a confusing plot. The only hope of the movie to keep the audience interested is the free nudity released at regular intervals. Ellen Barkin is miscast and her looks do not hold up when she's on the screen with the much younger Peta Wilson. Not sure what this movie was about.
