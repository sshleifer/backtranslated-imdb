I should have realized that any two-set video being sold for only $ 6 would be bad. I even read the reviews before watching this movie, and it still has not influenced me. I loved the book, and I knew it could not be as bad as people said. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is. <br /> <br /> A patchwork of film, video, and what appears to be a film, combine to make a three-hour tour of a chapter in James A. Michener's epic novel. Well, the time span covered was a chapter, but I do not remember many of the situations actually occurring in the book. The packaging on my copy of the film gives Maria Conchita Alonso top billing - though it turns out she's just in a talking scene. On the second tape. <br /> <br /> Actors should be praised for playing their roles well, despite an exaggerated and exaggerated script. They should be insulted, however, by accepting the papers in the first place.
