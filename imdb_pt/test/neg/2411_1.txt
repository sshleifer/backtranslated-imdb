I'm sure I saw FUTURE KILL for the same reason most people did: the incredible HR Giger poster. And like everyone else, I was disappointed to find that the film could not live up to the poster (Giger said that director Moore really begged him to do it). When I first saw that, at age 14, I thought it was the worst film ever made. I still think if I had not seen certain movies in MST3K since then. <br /> <br /> The plot has a lot of annoying college kids driving into the "mutant city" to kidnap a gang leader for their fraternity. That's when they find Splatter (Ed Neal), a mutant / cyborg / psychopath who kills the gang leader and blames fraternities as an excuse to hunt them down and seize power. The rest of the film consists mainly of persecutions. A hand full of fraternities tries to fight to get out of the mutant city (which I think is LA even if it was made in Texas). There are some pseudo-political things about the fraternity boys' society being pro-nuclear weapons and the mutant society being anti-nuclear. There is talk of how Splatter has become a freak due to radiation. Most people develop radiation cancers, but splashes only attack skewers and kill girls. Yes, that makes a lot of sense. At one point, our heroes rescue a mutant girl from two pro-nuclear police officers, and she shows them "how the other half lives." The other half, it seems, are all punk boys dancing around a 1980s pop band. So our little epic is both dumb and dated. That's really all there is to it. Brotherhood boys running around in messy buildings while guys who look like cyclists try to kill them ... Oh, and it's the future. <br /> <br /> I do not think you have any questions about why Ron W. Moore never made another movie. This thing is a real stinker. If you like Giger, buy your books (they have the poster without the horrors of the movie), or just watch the ALIEN again. FUTURE KILL is a waste of time that nobody needs. <br /> <br /> If this description makes the image look good, there is another low quality film that does the same thing, only bigger and better: AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK. It sucks, but that takes FUTURE KILL off the screen.
