There should be some sort of process to punish producers for funding this stupid scripts. I feel that some kind of bad movie criminalization may prevent more of this idiot's films from being made. Of course it has an interesting cast of characters, but I do not think I've ever seen a performance more cardboard than a whole cast as in this piece of crap exclusively crap. This director must be punished in some way for not provoking at least some kind of performance of these people. So detachment is a theme (no, actually, they're going to hit your head with this one), this does not mean that every character has to recite their lines as if they were on the NPR. Did I mention that this movie was of low quality? Lastly, I'm not sure what connection a person's memories would have with terminal bone cancer, but I'm pretty sure that if you were totally dead, your cancer would continue to grow independently. This film is an insult to cancer patients, medical professionals and non-retarded people. Oh, and finally the bees fly because they produce enough sustenance for their mass, flapping their wings like any other flying insect. I absolutely despise people presenting false knowledge as fact. Next time, do a little research before using an imbecile misconception as premise for an entire movie. JUST KIDDING BELIEVE IN JESUS!
