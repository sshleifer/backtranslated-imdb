THE AFFAIR is a very bad TV movie from the 1970s starring Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood as hesitant lovers. She has polio and leads a recluse life as a pop music writer. He is an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and absolutely in love with her. Their case, as it is, has been doomed from the start, and she knows it, but she keeps going anyway. Two things to watch for if you're stuck on it: Wood's Jane Fonda's hairstyle is never messy, no matter what, and a song she sings at the beginning of this horrible movie. She sings for four or five or six minutes, so you know it's classic among commercials. It's also one of the worst songs ever written, and the woman who was singing Wood's voice should have been shot and put out of her misery. Also, be aware of all the tops and dresses of the peasants. By comparison, Wagner looks relatively timeless, with short hair and displaying a number of classic clothes.
