Bad, bad, movie, so bad it's worth watching. As long as you watch this movie knowing it's bad and you'll spend 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie, it's worth it. The special effects are cheesy and the animals look fake and the acting is poor, but watching the actors' faces while they try to look scared is just plain funny. If your sister is about to be eaten by a giant Komodo dragon, would not you do something to try to save her? If it were food, would not you fall to your knees crying your heart? This guy just sat in a chair and ran his fingers through his hair. How anti-climatic is that? Maybe he should be in shock or something. He joins his sister in the belly of the Komodo - oh did not want to ruin it for you.
