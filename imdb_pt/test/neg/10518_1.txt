There are some great Canadian films. There are some bad ones. Last night, I watched one of the bad ones. It was not the typical Canadian film that tried to be so different because it was artistic. This movie tried to be some kind of Hollywood gangster movie. It was terrible. From the beginning, I had the feeling that it would be a bad movie. He had some of the cutest dialect a movie can have. There was this voice for a scene and then it never came back. This always bothers me when filmmakers only use their voice when they can not think of another creative way to tell a story. <br /> <br /> I know I'm in the Canadian film industry, I must support my brother brothers, but this movie is rubbish. The premise is something like a not so realistic episode of soprano. The father of a banker's mafia boss is on his deathbed and orders the son to become legitimate business. It's not so original. And the workers complain about it, but they simply accept the fact that they will soon be out of a job for nothing. To legitimize, they use extortion. Irony. But not the good kind. Then a crazy girl who had a horrible wig and a birthmark of Elvis, who covered half of the face, robbed the main character and half who raped him. Anyway, this guy, for whatever reason, now likes to dress like a girl. Then this banker engages with a prostitute when he has a beautiful future wife at home. But he falls in love with the prostitute because the prostitute dresses like a man and dresses him. She blackmail him with some pictures of him wearing bra and panties. However, he still loves her. He also has no reason to leave his fiancé, but he does to stay with the prostitute. <br /> <br /> For a film about crime organization and sexual fetish, there was neither action nor sex. It was like a Cinemax porn movie late at night without the good stuff. The alleged sex scenes were not hot or sexy. It was all very amateurish. The movie had nothing, just the stupid plot. <br /> <br /> I do not think it was the actor's fault. I think they had a terrible script to work on. What stood out most were the ridiculous characters. The bandit's name was Uncle Bunny or something. But the name was not important. They were all cliché. The dialouge was laughable throughout the movie, and movie mates laughed out loud at some of the "serious" moments movies. So, worst of all. It had to be the cheapest end. If you ever remember playing like a kid with imaginary weapons or toy guns. That was basically the end of the movie. But I was more than happy that it was over, and I had to warn my Canadian colleagues not to waste time or money watching this movie.
