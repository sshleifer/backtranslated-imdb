That this movie was stapled on the wall of a chapel as proof that God is truly dead. Am I the only one who actually saw (instead sleptwalked) through this "movie"? This is the only movie I've ever seen in the movies that I regret not having left and demanded my money back - it was just so monotonous. And I even saw "Highlander 2: The Quickening" at the local cinema. From beginning to end, Gibson and Downey have absolutely no chemistry as two unlikely, bound by circumstances, who eventually work together as best friends. The action (the little that exists) is goofy and as dark as the writer's skull. Thank any divinity who is chuckling while watching our "movie" that there is no chance of an "Air America 2".
