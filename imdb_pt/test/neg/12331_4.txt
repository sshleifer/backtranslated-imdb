What about this movie? A couple has more than just each other. After playing for a while, things get more serious. A difficult choice has to be made: to continue the old situation or to start all over again by following the heart. Guess what happens at the end. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have a very low budget. But a good story does not have to be expensive. It looks like a game that has been converted into a movie just using several cheap venues (at least very few other people visible) more than just the stage in this one the house. From the very first minute future developments are clear as water. Nothing unexpected happens. Sometimes you may think watching a soft porn movie, in which case you know in advance that there is no story. <br /> <br /> I find this movie disappointing, which explains the vote (4).
