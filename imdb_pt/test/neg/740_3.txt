(This may have a spoiler) <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, I thought it was okay. The music was good and that sequence of bizarre dreams that I was willing to forgive but the lack of appearance in the main character and all the other characters left me uninterested in watching the rest of the movie. (I know, totally vain.) The music at the beginning was lively and appropriate for a fictional gothic novel. But let's go! Saxophone music for an early 19th century movie? It totally did not fit. This movie was totally annoying and if you are looking to watch a good movie or an Austen do not rent Northanger Abbey! I give 30%. 30% = low grade!
