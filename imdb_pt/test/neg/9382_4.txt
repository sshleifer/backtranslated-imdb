It starts very well, but after a while you start to expect more from this movie than you are actually getting. Everything is uncertain and not clear. Czech filmmakers were good 20 or so years ago. But after they have transferred to the capitalist country, here is an unofficial but well-known Czech mentality ... COPYING ... COPYING ... COPYING of everything they consider good, when they see it in other films, countries or other places. I think this is a good example of making "art" and "politics" and "horror" and "humor" and "movie" and money. And it remains to be / One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which can not be compared to this movie in the way of ART and ACTORS and HISTORY and POLITICS. I think this movie is boring. This could be done better. At least they tried. Sorry guys. :-( YOU CAN NOT RECOMMEND
