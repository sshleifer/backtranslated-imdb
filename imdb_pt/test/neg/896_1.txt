Sometimes it's funny to watch movies implode from your couch, but other times it's horribly painful for your eyes and your mind. House Party 4: Until the last minute is one of those rare examples of when both your eyes and your mind are begging you to turn off the movie. This last part of the House Party series is by far the worst, not just the sequel but the movie released by Hollywood. It becomes apparent very early in this "feature" that director Chris Stokes loved the Day Off of Ferris Bueller with a passion. I say this because it is very clear that Stokes had no difficulty in taking Bueller's originality out of the hands of John Hughes and chose to create a completely humorless film. You might think that by "stealing" themes and pictures from a funniest movie, your own movie could at least generate a giggle or two. With House Party 4, Stokes proved that he does not have what it takes to direct a sequel, let alone a Hollywood movie. From his confused and unstable history, his inability to make sense of his characters, and to recycle old and tired cliches, all Stokes is doing is hitting a nail in the coffin that houses the House Party movies. This reminds me of that student who forgets the project in an hour and quickly joins super-cola, pasta, cat hair, chewing gum and straws and introduces him as "Hannibal Crossing the Alps". It looks awful and you feel embarrassed by the creator. <br /> <br /> So, where did this movie begin to plunge into the realm of comic stupidity? Honestly, I do not think most places allow me to talk so much, so I'd like to find some of the biggest topics that hit me the most. For starters, I still can not shake the theft of Ferris Beuller. It was as if director Stokes was ashamed to have to run another sequel to House Party and decided to bring a completely random formula (from a funniest movie) and see if he could cut and paste elements from the original series into that formula. This was a huge mistake. When a director tries to do this, what eventually happens is confusion within the audience. We think we are going in one direction, but instead, we go in another. That's exactly what you can witness in House Party 4. In one example, we have John-John trying to have the "biggest party of the decade" while trying to make a record deal (okay, it kind of reminds me of the original House Party ), but then we go to this random island where Uncle Charles is afraid to fly, Grandma gets drunk and some stupid moments with an alleged killer. Once again, we started a little strong and we ended up chaotic. This is the confusion in which I speak. Director Stokes did not have the ability to keep his hand on the wrist of humor or the ability to tell a sequential story. He would rather cut corners, keep jokes cheap, and think that audiences are idiots than trying to revive a series of undead. One might think that when a director was given the task of filming another House Party movie, he would come in thinking that he would be the one to revive him or bring him back to life, instead, Stokes just wanted to get paid. I realize that I am slowly aging with the passing of days, but I believe I still hold my hand in the culture of the younger generation. I listened to rap and R & B growing, but the group "Imature" never got to my tape player or CD player. Because? I do not think they've ever had followers, but apparently for director Chris Stokes, it would be beneficial to cast them as protagonists in their new House Party movie. Did not anyone in a studio realize that this was going to be red fast? Or what about the option of making Stokes himself play the comic-car mechanic, nothing like a director with no sense of comic timing that is considered the only source of humor possible. It was one of those few cases where I really missed Robin Harris, and I never thought I would see myself saying that to any movie. Out of a band going nowhere doing the lead role, I also thought the rest of the cast just continued to suck the life out of this movie. Uncle Charles was annoying when he tried humor. Kim Whitely was completely wasted by her scenes (literally and figuratively) while ?? good ?? all others fall into this category. <br /> <br /> Where did Chris Stokes spend the bulk of the budget for this movie? Not for special guests because, although this movie boasted of some, there was definitely no gift at the "Unforgettable" Holiday Party, nor the possible dream that perhaps Kid or Play would make a final appearance. The House Party 4 did not follow any predefined designs, which ended ruining this feature from the foundation. Can anyone explain to me why there was any need to use the routine of the "fugitive killer who happened to be a licensed taxi driver" for humor? Stokes was getting to the bottom of the barrel and only producing more dirt instead of substance. For the first time I can admit that there is no redeeming value for this movie. House Party 4 buried the series, and while I hear there may be more in the pipeline, I just hope that Hollywood realizes that this series has died. Hollywood needs to let this series end, forget the past and move on in the future. I think a sequel to Who's the Man? would get them started in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Grade: * out of *****
