The Eastenders went from a complete circle of unmissable in 1985 to totally abysmal now. It's such a bad reflection of the nation that this crap is at the top of the rankings. <br /> <br /> Ideas for plots can consist of nothing more trivial than putting character names on a hat. The first two (regardless of their gender) will sleep with each other, the 3rd and 4th will have a fight in the Vic, the 5th will be arrested, the 6th will develop an addiction, the 7th will become pregnant, etc. <br /> <br /> Producers are smart though. The 30 minute show is actually only composed of 3 lines. <br /> <br /> 1) Someone will enter the Vic and say "What's going on?" 2) Someone will stand and say "let it go" (leaves) 3) Then a woman will say "Doan choo between and insult mah fam'ly" <br /> <br /> That's it. That's all show. In addition to the occasional "Get it-id-type / Is id-type?" <br /> <br /> The show was once a lifelike portrait of East End folk and his way of life. The buffers came out when 1) They stretched from two nights a week and 2) The Slater family turned up. How they attract viewers is beyond me. The character Kat symbolizes everything that went wrong with society, treating anyone else as something she took from the bottom of the shoe. <br /> <br /> People who vote for her as the best character in these polls should be the same as those who vote for Jamie Redknapp 'Best Sportsman', despite the fact that he has not played a game for 3 years . <br /> <br /> What I can never understand is if the show is the pinnacle of British TV, why do all the biggest names come out? Ross Kemp, Martin Kemp, the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> How long did the couple's marriage last, with them being faithful to each other? Yes, people leave, but until the writers realize that the characters, the couple can be interesting and enjoyable, without sleeping around the show, will continue to deteriorate. One episode last week had 3 separate installments of just that. And Zoe and the top doctor still Lofty & 'Shell' as 'Most convincing couple Never show up on TV' <br /> <br /> Yes, Eastenders is the most watched show, this is undisputed. But many external factors contribute to this. 19.30 / 20.00 is the perfect time to win the largest number of viewers, has a full edition for 2 hours and more than that, millions of viewers watch, from nothing more than habit, but if they were completely honest to themselves would admit that (in 2002, more than ever), it can be absolutely regrettable.
