Milla stands out in this film because of her personal sense of style and the way clothes hold her. I've learned to hate that crumpled little face of three years that she does whenever she pretends to cry. It makes any point she is trying to make as a serious actress fall fast. Of course, in a movie with a BALDWIN and Denise, she still shines as a mature actor person. David seemed to be doing Woody Allen through Howdy Doody. Not a single word or gesture in the entire movie seemed sincere or even sincerely represented. "Like Harry Met Sally" and "Two Weddings and Funeral" to "Sleepless In Seattle" had screenplays, locations and actors. The script seemed to be a series of bad, raw jokes separated by a lot of conversations. The locals seemed to be within a few blocks of each other. There are only two actors in this dishrag of an indie film, Milla and the lady who played the girl who was in the stars. I watched most of it for the first time with the sound off, just watching Milla. This subscript joke was old the first time I saw it and it's a stupid song in "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying."
