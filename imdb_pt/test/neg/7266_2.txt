What can I say about the PLANET OF PLEASURE that I have not said about many other tedious porn movies? Very little . It's just another movie with a very weak plot used to create very unconvincing scenarios between non-male actors who spend a lot of time in the gym and bimbos who obviously had silicone implants. In fact, the sex scenes in this movie are a little less convincing than you usually see in this type of movie, while cast members move together, giving painful expressions as if they had constipation or something. No wonder many people claim that sex is above average, they probably watched many of those movies on late night cable stations.
