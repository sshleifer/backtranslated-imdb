Bela Lugosi as God? Travestis discussed in a movie in the 1950s? Unfortunately, this must be an Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I felt a combination of guilt, pleasure and nausea at the same time. The story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself) and his alter-ego Glenda. Somehow, if this movie were made now, I could see Kevin Kline playing Glen / Glenda. Notice how all cross-dressers' alter egos are versions of their male names (Glen / Glenda, Robert / Roberta, etc.). He tries to portray it with sympathy as the mental disorder that is, not as a graphic perversion. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Wood manages to hide in enslavement and S & M sequences in his initial story of Glen / Glenda. Along with these daring scenes, Satan himself appears, obviously having a bad hair day. Dialogue and rhythm are nonexistent, but the film is pleasing in its context - the strange world of Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Sterno says to put on her favorite lace panties for this.
