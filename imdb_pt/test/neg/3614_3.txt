A wide variety of snakes provoke a revolt in tourists who "invade" the island due to damage caused by the captain's boat. The few remaining survivors who are not caught vulnerable by the snakes will attempt an escape mission, with the aim of fleeing to available boats that can safely take them off the island. <br /> <br /> Presented a straight face with injected doses. of visual humor with many snake jokes, Wayne Crawford's SNAKE ISLAND features many different breeds of slippery, prominent predators ready to attack their prey. Star William Katt, as a snake researcher for a novel, revels in his role alongside writer / director / co-star Wayne Crawford (as the captain of the tour boat) as heroes facing the most serious crisis. Kate Connor is the attractive love interest of Crawford, a vacation lawyer. The other cast members serve as tourists or crewmembers, primarily fodder for snakes. Like many other such films, director Crawford presents live snakes with computer-generated images, and the violence is really mild. Crawford even incorporates the point-of-view technique with the camera as the snake's eyes when she confronts the potential victim (... with the actor staring directly into the camera). To never be taken seriously, the ironic approach was probably the best way to film SNAKE ISLAND because the premise is simply too ridiculous to be accepted by itself. Thriller effects and scenes rarely work because Crawford is often unable to successfully orchestrate sequences where humans face snakes. The snake attacks themselves also never happen on the screen (one or two moles), or are presented so weakly that they leave little impression. That's a no-no for a genre like this. Katt fans will probably want to take a look because he provides some facial comedy that sets the general tone of certain scenes where he must defend himself against the snakes. The CGI scenes, where we see a large number of snakes in a general area, are not very effective, which removes the realism that Crawford could have attempted to establish. There are plenty of better horror movies with snakes as the attackers than SNAKE ISLAND. Surprising moments of nudity, relegated to a scene where tourists and crew relax after a long day with the bubbly, not knowing what danger lies ahead.
