This movie could have been great, but it was not. Between the sink of non-talented non-hopers and friends of the filmmakers who wanted to help out there, there is some evidence of talent. The main star of the film plays a good leading role. He is convincing and has those scary Italian eyes. However, it is paired with the worst rejected actors that anyone has ever encountered. The opening scenes of the film are among the worst and most embarrassing. It looks like Gay Porno. Luckily no one took off their clothes. The rape scene that keeps being mentioned is rubbish. The prison sequence was the best part of the film - albeit irrelevant. The movie soundtrack (if you can call it that) sounds like a first attempt by teenagers to use cooledit and some examples of cds. It's boring, repetitive and extremely lame. In fact, the whole movie is lame. Get out while you still can!
