When the exploiters become evangelists, they still exploit in the name of poverty! <br /> <br /> My first reaction after watching the movie is ?? God bless me that I'm not eating fish or any non-vegetarian product! <br /> <br /> The documentary is about Lake Victoria of Tanzania where there were numerous varieties of lovely fish, and one day, during the 1960s, someone came and injected the powerful fish Perch, which became the exportable product to Tanzania for Europe and Japanese Markets. Were the consequences serious? first of all all the small and large local fish were extinct; secondly, the plane that came to catch the fish could not travel empty because it does not make commercial / commercial / capitalist sense, so it is full of weapons and ammunition (this is what Europe can give to this world); thirdly, pilots (since all migrants and traveling population, such as truckers) have to survive their sexual needs, flourishing for them cheap local African prostitutes; Fourth, brokers, dealers, brokers of the chain (mainly Indian-born entrepreneurs) get richer and poverty in Tanzania remains the same; fifth poverty leads children to crime, drugs, etc. <br /> <br /> The premise for making this documentary was excellent. But has director Hubert Sauper managed to make a good documentary? It's a big NO. <br /> <br /> I say the reasons: as in India, it requires an upper caste brahman to stand up and project to the world, Indian poverty and the untouchables; likewise requires a European documentary filmmaker born in Austrain to tell the world the history of Tanzania and its ruined and ruined economy and poverty. It is the pathetic motive of the unconscious creation of that wealthy class (who has never seen poverty or the poor known), who survives, lives, wins, and fame as a plague hung to project poverty to the world as soon as they see it. There is nothing more to despise the poor people in Africa and India who see such images. <br /> <br /> Hubert's intention and motives seem totally unbalanced. The images, characters, locations, interviews are very serious and obscure, somber and disturbing. He uses exaggerated ignorance as a voice to present his case. What we feel at the end is pity and sadness for the Africans. We also began to consider the government of Tanzania and people as villains. It may be that some Westerners sitting in their air-conditioned rooms would find time to discuss and discuss the pathetic living conditions of Africans, but there would be nothing more. <br /> <br /> Does the director just show up once on the screen? so as not to be identified among the Europeans who exploit this poor country. <br /> <br /> This director Hubert can only survive being exploiters like the current media giants of CNN and BCC. Hubert did not have the nerve or common sense to talk to any European he eats or companies that import these fish products. A totally lop-sided frail effort! But do I understand the reasons for it? Hubert just wanted to steal his fame, sitting down and smiling with awards in his European comfort. <br /> <br /> There are no more words to spare for this pathetic effort. I hesitantly give the documentary a higher rating of 3.5 stars out of 10, just because the theme was correct; but was pathetically exploited and surprised by an ill-conceived amateur director, created exclusively for the non-intelligent western audience! (Stars 3.5 out of 5)
