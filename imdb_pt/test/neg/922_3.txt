Great cast, but unfortunately, a lot of underdeveloped ideas make the movie creep. One does not feel satisfied in the end after waiting for some kind of conclusion, closure, or at least an ironic twist. She had that familiar "Curb", without dare to say it, Larry as the annoying poles opposite. The music was there, the 'show about nothing' scenes appear, but without any common thread or suspense - it fails as a solo project that ran out of budget. <br /> <br /> Spoilers: The title of the movie talks about cheese, but she prefers the rice pudding. Is cheese a bestselling title compared to sweet rice? He prefers just any junk food regardless of the date of sale. Maybe I want someone to eat 'cheese-dogs' or ice cream in a pirate suit would have at least tied some scenes together. <br /> Marty: this is not just funny and exaggerated. People just do not care about a "show" inside a show. A coffee table on coffee books was funnier. <br /> <br /> Unless you're a big fan of the cast, save your time and eat some cheese. You do not even have to be with anyone.
