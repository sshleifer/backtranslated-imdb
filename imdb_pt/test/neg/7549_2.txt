Being a big fan of the bass series I was really looking forward to the release of this movie. I was eagerly anticipating a laugh a minute roller coaster ride ...... sadly. <br /> <br /> Where to start this mess? I think it's a good start to say that it's just richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and liners that usually deliver so well are funny. I was still waiting for the first laugh after a good 20 minutes of viewing. Many aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film were full of those bad times they rehearsed and decided to leave out the final cut. <br /> <br /> Scenarios and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dirty, which I suppose is fine if they want to portray the "terrible" guest house that the 2 buffoons try to run, but for me this only puts even greater damping on a sorry state of filming should never have been created. <br /> <br /> The acting is sometimes pathetic.Fenella Fielding is wasted as madman to Mrs. F Oxfur and I have seen Simon Pegg have much better rides. <br /> <br /> I would recommend Guest House Paradiso to anyone who is blind drunk because they can enjoy the terrible puns a lot more. But for any lower fan who has not seen this movie and is expecting true richie and eddie action you was warned
