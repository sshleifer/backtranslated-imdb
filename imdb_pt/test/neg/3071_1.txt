Anyone who reads these comments may think we have a great movie. I'm Portuguese and I'm ashamed that this movie became a blockbuster in Portugal. You can not really call it movies. The direction and the "mise-en-scene" are basic (even Ron Howard does better!); the script is bad and pretentious (a very bad Tarantino); the cast is covered by TV stars, models and reality shows that do nothing about acting. When you put these ingredients into a movie, of course all fans of this type of TV show will see. I'm also surprised that the people who make comments here on IMDb say that this movie is a masterpiece. I thought this site was only for people who really like movies and understand some of it. All films made to be Blockbusters in Portgal always use the same ingredients and are always terrible. If you think this movie is reasonable, please do not tell your love movies and movies.
