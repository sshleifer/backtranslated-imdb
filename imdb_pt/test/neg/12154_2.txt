I'm really amazed that this has 88% Rotten Tomatoes and a nomination for best foreign film at the Oscars. The rating of 7.3 in IMDb ... is not a big surprise, since IMDb users voted recently. I just can not get into a movie where the real facts about your main character were clearly distorted, and not in any way to make the movie artistic, but rather to make it melodramatic and less tedious. Which, in fact, makes it very boring for anyone who is expecting a serious and reliable interpretation of Genghis Khan's life. The exaggerated and super-dramatized mogul often echoes the likes of 300, a movie that could not be happier to be ridiculously inaccurate; but unlike 300, the mogul takes himself seriously. It's stoic seriousness, mixed with obvious inaccuracies, that's what makes it really the most annoying movie I've seen this year; possibly the most action or biopic movie I've ever seen. The characters were pathetically written. Honestly, I doubt that Genghis Khan was so boring and passive as shown in this movie. Which is funny to me because if there is something that I think should be changed because of theatricality, it is making a boring person get into an interesting person. The romance between Khan and Borte is equally annoying, simple and stupid. In addition, without revealing anything, Mongol contains the single most stupid scene I've seen a long time ago - where there should be a good 20 minutes of plot development, the film simply advances without any explanation. It looked like something out of a Saturday Night Live skit that parodies epic action movies with a horrible rhythm. (Did I mention how Mongol takes itself seriously?) Meanwhile, it creeps like no movie I've ever seen before. Even now, I could swear it lasted three hours. About 45 minutes, I checked the time, making sure it was almost done. In addition to some beautiful scenery and Asano's acting quality (of course), Mongol is honestly just a disaster. He completely failed to entertain me or enlighten me anyway. I would never give this movie a second chance. And it does not sound racist or patriotic or anything else, but give me an unreasonable and foolish American epic about Mongol at any time. At least then I know what I'm getting, unlike the Mongol where criticisms and ratings have led me to believe that it was really something worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about how much I hated Mongolian is that I have friends I know, no doubt I would just love it.
