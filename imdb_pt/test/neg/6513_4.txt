New Year 2006, and I'm watching Glimmer Man again. Say what you like, I find Steven Seagal's films fun. Like many reviews, good fight sequences - I particularly enjoyed his phone response at the restaurant telling how much time would be closed for catering. Bit like Schwarzenegger's humor in previous action films - although this tended to be self-deprecating. <br /> <br /> But what I like here is Brian Cox, one of the most versatile actors in the world. Pity on his hands and feet, but so much to endure prolonged interrogations - must have been disapproved in that class on the "farm." <br /> <br /> As the films continued, I wonder how the thickening thickness of Seagal affected. its movement? No matter, it's entertainment!
