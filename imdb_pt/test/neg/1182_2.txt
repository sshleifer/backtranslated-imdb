I stopped watching this movie in the middle of the road. It was just terrible! Flat and planned subplots. A complete lack of pathos seen in Norman Bates, Buffalo Bill, or Ed Gein's Steve Railsback interpretation. A film does not have to be historically accurate, but the true story of Ed Gein is far more interesting than this third-rate melodrama that was completely invented for no good reason! Ed Gein, played by Kane Hodder, is a cartoon sadist. Attempts to show the trauma inflicted on him by his mother are only weak exercises in a recycled style. And this movie wanted to be stylish, but it even spoiled everything. Luckily, there is a better movie in this story. Ed Gein, 2001, told the story efficiently, and offered some shivers when we watched a sick man without control of himself. Steve Railsback, who played Ed Gein at that time, was already famous for portraying another famous serial killer: Charles Manson. His Ed had pathos. Your movie is the only one to see. Avoid this mess.
