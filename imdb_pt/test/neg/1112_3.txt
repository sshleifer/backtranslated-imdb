Wicked Little Things has an excellent synopsis: empty house next to mine abandoned in woods with tragic past; the family moves into the house and strange things begin to happen; Frightening little children begin to appear here and there doing scary things about small children. But that's where cleverness and potential fun end. This group of children has been sealed in the mine many decades before, and now appear wandering through the forest (poor makeup) with guns looking for meat to eat. Oh, I get it, this is a ghost-zombie movie. Hmmm ... while I can appreciate someone trying something new with that genre, it just did not work. What was the motivation of children to seek to devour meat? Why did they need guns? Has anyone else imagined the filmmakers gathered around the daily footage laughing because they felt this would be a cool / scary movie? I discovered that after thirty minutes I felt the familiar resignation of having just wasted my time on another modern feast. While the acting was good, and the ambience / cinematography of good quality as well, the script itself suffered from what appears to be a lack of knowledge about the supernatural horror genre. A bunch of kids walking through the mall is scarier than this bunch of poorly disguised rodents. <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary, and although I can appreciate the story, I might have liked it if I had read it. instead of watching it, I have yet to say that Wicked Little Things is more precisely called Wicked Little Turd.
