Reloaded from Troma (which is my favorite movie company) Unspeaksble is a confusing horror movie that may be interesting but very dark and distorted. <br /> <br /> Unspeakable begins with a family in a car, they go into an accident that leaves a dead daughter and a deformed mother. the father ends up going crazy and cuts prostitutes. He sees his daughter in other people. He kills for her. Meanwhile, his now deformed wife is being raped by his order. They are sick people! <br /> <br /> Unspeakable attempts to be sick and disturbing and manages to make it like a good horror movie, is not it. Most Troma movies have a sense of humor for them, but that's not the case.
