I tried watching this, and was very disappointed. Do not expect intelligent and insightful humor, Amy's brother, Amy's brother, in the middle of this lair ... is the polar opposite. But if you like poop jokes, fart and horny, it will be in seventh heaven. This is bathroom humor, I would say, for those who have had several bongos, which can only explain why many critics have praised this crap as "the best television writing ever." I suppose those who hate such silly humor could not watch long enough to mind submitting a review, but I'm just sending a warning to those unconscious viewers who are looking for high-level comedies. The characters get over it. The shock factor is set to 10. And the laughs are set to zero (unless, of course, you look for juvenile and low-brow humor). <br /> <br /> I managed to spend 40 minutes praying all the time. would turn the corner toward entertainment that would be worth it, but unfortunately it got worse and worse. And watch out for Amy's ever-present and exaggerated expression-it will make your eyes roll. It was nice to see recognizable cameos of comic actors that I like, but I can only assume they agreed to participate as a favor to the Sedaris family. <br /> <br /> For those who loved, I'm sorry ... This is my opinion. It was so bad that it inspired me to write my first comment.
