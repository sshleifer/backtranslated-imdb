wow ... I just watched this movie ... The American people have this stereotypical view of Hindi movies like, ALL Indian movies have dances, songs and a love story ... It's pathetic how far from the truth is that is. This film simply exposes the stereotypical Western view of Hindi films. Horrible acting, horrible direction, horrible cinematography. And all this for a Hollywood director. Most Indian movies today are much more content driven, realistic, touching and meaningful than that crap. Indian cinema (not just Hindi) also covers a variety of different subjects. Like most other Hollywood movies these days, it shows a very stereotypical view of another country where the truth is thrown out the window. This is a highly recommended movie. Instead, watch good Hindi movies like Black Friday, eklavya, omkara, khakee, awarapan, gangster, don, zakhm, pain, sholay, mother India, lagaan ... These movies are the true Indian cinema.
