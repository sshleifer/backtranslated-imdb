I love Juan Piquer-Simon! He is my favorite director of bad movies and, throughout his entire career, he has unknowingly tried to profit from all the contemporary trends of success in the genres of horror and fantasy. After the great success that was "Superman," JP made his own hilarious "Supersonic Man," he caught the violent madness of the horror flick with the insane "Pieces" and he really outdid himself with "The Return of ET" . "The Rift" is obviously inspired by the lucrative underwater monster movie series such as "The Abyss" and "Deepstar Six." From beginning to end, you can have fun observing all the stolen ideas and shameless robberies of these (and other) classics.When a completely new and sophisticated submarine disappears near the deep crevice of Dannekin, a second mission with submarine designer Wick Hayes on board is sent to investigate what really happened with the Siren One. In the dark depths of the ocean, the rescue mission uncovers an underwater cave where the government secretly experiments with mutant sea creatures.The monsters are quite aggressive but there is also the danger of an enemy of government among the members of the crew ... "The Rift" is a forgettable movie, but even so it has some ingenuity - though very dishonest - models of monsters. of blood and blood they will not complain, neither, since the bestial attacks are very cruel and ruthless. The acting is a lot of wood, although many of the cast names can definitely be better. It is advisable that you simply enjoy the clich√©s and bloody effects in "The Rift" because, if you start thinking about the script, you will see that this does not make any sense.
