Let me start by saying that there is really no reason to watch this movie. I only went through this because I was trying to kill some time before going to work. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's your typical "sophomoric" comedy aimed at the adolescent audience. There is nothing extraordinary about it beyond the complete ridicule of history, not to mention that there are bore holes large enough to cross a Carnival cruise. Obviously, this should not be a realistic film, it should be funny. Unfortunately, this also fails in this count. I must admit I laughed a few times, but mostly in a "holy shit, I can not believe how stupid this is." <br /> <br /> If you've never seen this movie you're not missing a thing.
