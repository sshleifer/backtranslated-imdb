Did anyone find the plot somewhere in the movie? Maybe it's the missing thing in this pretentious film exercise about cinema. It is surprising that Gordon says that "A movie without plot is nothing" ... It is possible that the characters have more to say than Wim Wenders himself. Was this phrase in the original plot or did the actor decide to send a tip to the director?
