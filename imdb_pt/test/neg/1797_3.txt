Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness, is a dark, deep, enduring novel that portrays the futility and irony that occur in Africa. If you are looking for a great book to read over the weekend this is not the book for you. Conrad retains nothing when he describes nineteenth-century imperialism, but romance has no meaning without giving it the thought and consideration it deserves. If I read this novel in search of a great adventure story, I would say I wasted my time, but looking at the prospect of explaining the futility of 19th century civilization, I would say this is one of the most significant novels I have ever read. . Because I read this novel in my English class and looked at every page, I think I appreciated the book more than someone who was reading for entertainment. I will not lie, this book was difficult and challenges the reader to dig deep into this novel to find the true meaning. The film, on the other hand, found it tiring and boring. The film "Heart of Darkness" does not come close to giving the book justice. The film left out many key parts that I consider important to get the true message of the story. If you are having difficulty understanding and viewing the novel then the movie may be a good feature but I would not recommend seeing the movie as an alternative to the novel or even a different perspective.
