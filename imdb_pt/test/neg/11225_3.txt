I found this movie to be preacher and unrealistic. It tries to be a movie showing children struggling with the system, but it does not even present a positive solution. I do not think I really felt the children. I can totally understand what their complaints were and I know how poor the state of the schools is but I found their solution and the way the outside hand dealt with it to be a large group of people. If this happens on TV, do not waste your time. Watch the Short Circuit again for the 235th time.
