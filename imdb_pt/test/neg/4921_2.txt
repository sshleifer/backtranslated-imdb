There is not enough room to explain the many ways this movie is a disappointing mess. Silly special effects and an incomprehensible plot are the least of the problems in this movie. The film seems to have been conceived in the mid-eighties and just cooked until finally it could be done in the early nineties. The mullet-headed "hero" (complete with Miami Vice's fashionable three-day shadow beard), fists of fists on Ronald Reagan, would be funny if he did not take himself so seriously. So the movie is just pathetic. I'm really sorry for the poor actresses who squandered their beautiful nudity scenes in this horrible movie.
