For the first fifteen minutes the FAME NADA story is interesting: two male porn stars from the late 1930s, in a seemingly healthy relationship, decide to leave the porn industry and try the world to sing and act. The two very sleek and preening men are Colton Ford and Blake Harper. With the help of Kevin Aviance and Marc Berkely, Colton makes a dance floor that is marketed in New York with the hope that Colton Ford will become an instant star - a single disco singer, spreading his experience as Porn Star PR. The rest of the film is muttering and fighting and making comments from porn producer ChiChi LaRue and the film slowly turns into repetition and lull. It is not a bad idea for a movie if there was a little more depth revealed in the movement of each character to move away from a successful career (although one greatly influenced by the youth that both characters lost) in an alternative. It's just that a song on a note wears off quickly. Grady Harp, November 5
