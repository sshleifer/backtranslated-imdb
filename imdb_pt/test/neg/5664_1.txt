I watched the Halloween episode ... oh my god I wanted to die. The acting was just awful. The lines were uttered with absolute conviction. It's a bad idea for a show too, I mean, who watches a web show like that in real life? Miranda Cosgrove was great in a supporting role in Drake and Josh, but does not have the character's strength to anchor her own show. I'm even more annoyed that his departure is one of the main reasons Drake and Josh finished. She was approached with her own show ... she jumped on Drake and Josh. They then decided that maybe they would do something with Drake and Josh moving to college, explaining the loss of Meagan as a character, but Drake had already thought of moving to bigger and better things and he wondered if Miranda did it. The best part of the show was the theme song ... a catchy and good tune in a mire of mediocrity. Of course Drake Bell was dubbing Miranda's voice for the whole thing and wrote the melody ...
