Seriously, Sci-Fi needs to stop making movies. They are all horrible. And this one had John Rhys-Davies, and he could not help the movie. Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito) captures the legendary Mexican goat eater, the chupacabra, and takes him aboard a cruise ship headed by Captain Rudolf (John Rhys-Davies). The creature then escapes and begins to kill crew and passengers. Captain Rudolf and the crew go after the creature, with the arms ablazin '. But they can not stop it. So they call the navy. They can not stop either. Then it kills all 5 (or how many of them there are). Then the captain and his daughter, along with another guy, find out how to kill him. Stay away from this movie. The chupacabra looks incredibly extravagant, the navy men shoot at the slightest motion, throw grenades on the ship and the action is horrible. 3/10
