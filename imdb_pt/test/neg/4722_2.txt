Argentina's acclaimed horror director Emilio Vierya directs a screenplay by Jack Curtis and Antonio Ross. Cheesy and ridiculous are in the mix for the method for madness. The son of a doctor is approaching his premature death, until his desperate father transplaces a monkey's heart in his chest. As expected, things will get weird; when this young man turns into a mask using monster and travels the beaches looking for pretty girls to make their slaves. When heroin is injected, its beauties become zombies. The monster summons its minions stunned with strange organ music. So bad ... well ... it's bad. In the cast: Jos√© E. Moreno, Alberto Caneau, Mauricio De Ferraris, Gloria Prat and Gina Moret.
