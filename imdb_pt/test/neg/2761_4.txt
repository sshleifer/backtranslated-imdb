I read a lot of books in my short life, but this is by far the worst! I just finished reading this useless piece of garbage and when I finished, I threw it in the living room! I hated and let me state the reasons! 1.The soldier dies. Why would the author make the soldier die? Why could not she have kept him alive as a good love story would do? I applaud Patty deeply for trying to pry the FBI agent out. <br /> <br /> 2.The truth is dismissed. Ruth (the black housekeeper) is fired and for no apparent reason either! She tried to comfort Patty and then Patty's father, SOB, fired her for good reason! Ruth, Anton and Patty were the only bright spots in the book. Oh and grandmas too! 3. The perm. Yes. Now can you think why the permanent would bore you? Well, here's why. Patty's mother asks the girl if she wants her hair. Patty says no, but the mother calls Mrs. Reeves (the horrible hairdresser) and tells her to give Patty a perm. Why in the green earth of God would she do it? Why would a mother ask her daughter if she wants a perm just to have her get a perm anyway! Mom always pretends Patty has a say when she has nothing to say !!! She is to receive the "worst mother of the year" award for the material she gives to Patty. Thank God, Ruth cut off her perm! 4. Discrimination, Racisem and Prejudious. I hate discrimination in this book. They use the word * beep a lot. Yes. I know that in those days the blacks were free, but basically they had no rights, but yes! Why teach today's children that word! This only teaches them how to discriminate against people. Not only the blacks were discriminated against, but also the Chinese. In the book, people refer to Mr. Lee (a Chinese) as "The * bip * This is really despicable and last but not least ... Jews and Nazis. I hate the city for spitting on a girl. who was wrong for her taste Anton. She is a 12 year old girl !!! It was just a fall.As a 12 year old can really love a 22 year old.Come this is not "Lolita." And "Lolita" is a good book and not a piece of dirt! <br /> <br /> 5. I'm surprised that this movie is not considered "dirty" as "Lolita" is. <br /> <br /> 5. Patty going to a reformatory. for thieves and murders, not innocent of 12 years! "The teacher or whatever she was called Patty an ungrateful, spoiled brat. about her Patty should have community service or something She did not do anything wrong She just helped a friend. 6. Children's Favor. Patty, her eldest daughter is clearly the least favored, while Sharon, the five-year-old brat, is her favorite daughter. Her father says she wanted to take Sharon to Hollywood, but clearly forgets the other daughter. <br /> <br /> 7. The father. I hate him! He was so mean that Patty could have Hitler himself as her father. Her father beats her for no apparent reason and the way he talks to her in the end will make him so angry that you'll be caught thinking "Patty would get better treatment in a concentration camp." <br /> <br /> Well there you have it personal. 7 Reasons I Hate This Book. Instead of reading this book, read "The Anne Frank Diaries" or whatever, because I warn you, it's very depressing and it will really drive you crazy! The only reason you get 4 stars is because of Anton, Patty, Ruth and the grandparents!
