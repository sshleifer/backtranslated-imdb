The movie is not so bad until ... <br /> <br /> The main problem is with the ending, so it's a big spoiler ... <br /> <br /> As long as it was done, It's a beautiful movie, and it works great. <br /> <br /> However ... <br /> <br /> In the book, Sam gets and lives his dream, while in the movie, he gives up and returns to the city, completely destroying the theme "you can do what you put in your mind "from the book. <br /> <br /> This movie is a desecration, and instead of remaking classics that do not need to be redone, Hollywood guys who do not have better ideas should do it this time around.
