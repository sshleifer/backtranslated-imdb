I appeared as an extra and was on the spot as a journalist covering "The Dain Curse". My involvement was during the segments of this film filmed in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania (Jim Thorpe was also one of the locations of the 1969 film "The Molly Maguires"). I reported the 'action' in the Emmaus Free Press newspaper, where I was editor 1978-80 (the newspaper was no longer published in the 1990s). I remember the excellent attention to the details of the period clothes, of the automobiles, etc. Jim Thorpe's modern paved streets were covered in gravel to mimic a southern country town of the 1920s. At the time, I interviewed the producer and talked briefly with the director during a change of schedule; I could not interview James Coburn, which was always a big disappointment to me. As an aside, I briefly appear in one of the street scenes wearing a button-down hat and a tweed jacket. The producer asked me to "jump" and it was a real thrill. I still have a collection of black-and-white photos that I took from the newspaper's production work. Someday, they may be of interest to film / television historians .-- Lou Varricchio
