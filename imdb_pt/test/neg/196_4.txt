I liked the Milos Forman movies since I saw "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Amadeus" (two great masterpieces), but when I saw "Hair", I wondered if it was the same Milos Forman. This movie is boring and uninteresting to say the least. OK, the music is very good, but on the screen it just looks like a bunch of drugged people dancing (wait a minute ... that's what it really is!). In fact, the only interesting part, and the only part in which Milos's talent appears, is the last 15 minutes or so (SPOILER !!) since Berger took over Claude's place as a soldier in the Vietnam War. Those 15 minutes are exciting and well directed, but it's a shame we have to endure such horrible material before then. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe this is one of those movies that you need to be "on the subject" to enjoy (the subject being marijuana, acid and other drugs that the movie glorifies). I'm not so ...
