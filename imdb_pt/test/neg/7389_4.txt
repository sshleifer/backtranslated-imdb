A bad movie, but with a roll that is worth savoring. For most of the movie, the jokes are bad, the songs are bad, even the W.C. Campos is bad. Then there's a sequel to Bob Hope and his ex-movie; the dialogue is witty and the music (a version of "Thanks for the Memories") is light, cynical and pleasurable. Who left for this one bit? However, it does the whole thing worth the original admission of 25 cents.
