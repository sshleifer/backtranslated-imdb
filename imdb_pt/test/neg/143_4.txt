I saw this movie on the VHS some time ago (January 27, 2003), just because of Paul Rudd's name on the cover. I really enjoyed his performance on 'The Object of My Affection' and I really expected a good job. However, I found this movie a complete mess. The story has a very confusing script and the characters are not well developed. Also, low budget special effects do not help much. I do not know the previous generation of Gen-Y Cops, but this next generation is not good. I do not remember exactly why I gave this note (and I do not intend to see this movie again), but my vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Gen-Y Cops The Next Generation '(` Gen-Y Cops the Next Generation')
