Oh boy .. This movie is so mediocre that I do not know exactly what to write about it. <br /> <br /> I find it easier to write what it is not: <br /> <br /> It's not much fun. It's not original. And there is not one character in the entire movie that I care about. <br /> <br /> It kind of reminds me of a certain reality show on MTV, but no interesting people. It just creeps away and I can not wait for it to end. The only thing that kept me from turning it off was Jennifer Lyons (c: <br /> <br /> I thought long time about this movie to find a good thing to say about it. What I liked was the reminder not to judge a person for the first impression you receive (as Holly did when she accused Nicole), who earns a score of 2 out of 10 instead of 1.
