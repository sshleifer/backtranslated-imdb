I like Noel Coward, wit. I like Noel Coward, the written piece. I like Noel Coward, the songwriter and singer, but I hate actor Noel Coward. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a man who should have stood behind the scenes, writing his pieces and composing his music and making his observations profound and hilarious. He should never have been allowed in front of a camera. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, he is one of the top talent of the 20th century, but the man simply could not act, and his voice. .com rolls and is overly round tonal quality ... well, it could very easily grate on cheese in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is one of my least favorite offers from Coward, as he unconvincingly portrays a psychiatrist embarking on a case with a much younger woman, made worse by the fact that the much younger woman is an old friend of his much younger wife's school. <br /> <br /> Celia Johnson is such a joy to see herself as ever as cowardly offended wife. It's your performance that saves this movie from hassle. I suppose her own adventure at Coward's Brief Encounter four years ago qualified her for this role, for she must have raised a few eyebrows playing such a promiscuous woman and this gave her the chance to win back some fans and gain some lost sympathy. <br /> <br /> She was such a wonderful actress and you can see why Noel Coward used her so much in many of his productions. <br /> <br /> However, the rest of the film is monotonous, poorly represented. , predictable and generally annoying at the almost tightening level. <br /> <br /> If your Noel Coward you want, then take the time to watch what we serve, Blythe Spirit or This Happy Breed instead. Three treasures of Noel Coward. With lovely movies like these, I suppose we can forgive him for this turkey. <br /> <br /> I gave these four stars purely for the addition of Miss. Johnson, but overall I would avoid this like the plague. .
