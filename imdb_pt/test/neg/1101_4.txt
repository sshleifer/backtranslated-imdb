After spending all his money caring for his terminally ill wife, the recently widowed widow Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) moves with her two daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) to the family of her late husband in the countryside. Pennsylvania, where local legends speak of zombies roaming the woods at night. Just seeing the names of the writer and director of the film in the opening credits was enough to send shivers down my spine: Boaz Davidson is the 'genius' responsible for writing the scripts for STV titles like Octopus 1 & 2, Spiders and Crocodile while JS Cardone gave us the Slawer's 'nasty video' and the bleak vampire movie The Forsaken. With dubiously responsible talent, I did not expect much from Wicked Little's things. <br /> <br /> And having finished the movie, I'm happy to have kept my expectations low. <br /> <br /> Although the film looks good at times, with the lovely use of the strange local forest, and the cast gives reasonable performances, given the stealthy clich√© with which they are working, the plot is so laborious, poorly written and derived that it is impossible to get enthusiastic. about. And most importantly, perhaps, the murderers in the film, undead children who wake up every night from the mine where they died, are not at all frightening, a spot of makeup, black contacts and a few jagged shop scars doing too much little to add. to the sense of threat. Scout Taylor-Compton and company do their best to appear afraid of the tiny terrors, shouting convincingly at each showdown, but their admirable attempts to instill a sense of fear in the audience is of little use: small fighters do not have What it takes to cool the blood. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes of dull zombie food in a futile attempt to conquer injured dogs, and the final kill, which shows the victim's blood soaking both Compton and Heuring, is appropriately tasteless, but Overall, Wicked Little Things (AKA Zombies in the UK) is instantly forgettable junk - just another clunker in Cardone's and Davidson's filmographies.
