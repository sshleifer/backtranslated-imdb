This sequence of "In the Heat of the Night" will suffer in unavoidable comparisons with its infinitely better predecessor. Instead of looking like a television theatrical movie, "Mister Tibbs" looks suspiciously like a TV movie released for theatrical release, with grainy photos, tacky opening titles, and scenarios that look like made out of plywood. The sequence of the murder has a blatant error of continuity: the camera shows both hands choking the girl, then a shot of a hand reaching a figurine, then a photo of the girl being choked with both hands again and finally the figurine descending to the fatal blow Solving the case should be easy: find the only face with three hands! But the shoddy production values ​​can not completely obscure the considerable merits of this film: Sidney Poitier's performance as the legal detective determined to follow the evidence wherever it takes, even if it involves a friend. Martin Landau is also convincing as the preacher-activist suspected of brutally murdering his prostitute girlfriend. In addition to being haunted by the case, Tibbs is in conflict over his home life, but Tibbs's race issues and poorly disguised sense of social insult are absent here. So it's the murder mystery complex that made "In the Heat of the Night" so appealing.
