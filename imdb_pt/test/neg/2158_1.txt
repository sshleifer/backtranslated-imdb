I can not see how anyone can say that this was a good entertainment movie. With some well-known actors, I find it hard to believe that this was only done in 2005. It sucks! The acting is tantamount to amateur dramas, poor amateur dramas. Unless you want to laugh out loud at incredible 100 minutes of pure corn, do not worry about downloading it or renting it, the worst I've seen in years. It's from days gone by, where cowboys are shooting 8 bullets from the six shooters. The more known the actor, the worse they were, Drury was just sad. I was extremely disappointed with Lee Majors, did he really lean to this kind of crap? It was bad enough when he played the six-million-dollar man.
