The basic genre is a thriller interspersed with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois. Fellowes tried to get far more out of it by using the title lies to bring all sorts of little twists, invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience. <br /> <br /> It's really quite confusing though. Fellowes does not seem interested in presenting the suspense elements in a way that will keep us with the tip of the seat. Instead, your focus is on your own moral issues. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is inconsistent, phased here, vernacular and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional clich√©-miner. While there is no buzz about locations so that the actors can continue to exist in their space, the terrible score can not create a new dimension and often works against the emotional impulse of certain sets. There is also a very prosaic, I daresay the English feel the filming. I did not want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught up in an extraordinary situation, I wanted to see some sort of artistic story of the story. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is, in fact, the story that leaves the rest down. Just as the elements of suspense are fairly flat, history is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes, woven as a vehicle for the examination of character. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performances and John Warnaby's effervescent colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a good sign for much of the discussion. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed; not that bad, but that could have been a lot better. 3/10
