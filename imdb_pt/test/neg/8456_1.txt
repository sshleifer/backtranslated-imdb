So you have several models on an island and, one by one, they are chosen in the style of Agatha Christie. We have someone lost in the sea, pushed off a cliff, poisoned by a solvent, taken off a cliff, exploded, etc. Nothing terribly explicit. <br /> <br /> Before anyone starts, a woman inexplicably has a Dream with a killer in a strange human face mask. The magazine owner is a scandal that had an affair, and someone took pictures of her before she was old. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's all about business, or something, <br /> <br /> There is an 80's style montage of a photo shoot, most of the swimsuits being made of a piece, surprisingly. A couple is quite translucent. There are clicks on the camera during assembly where the camera frame appears as a white square or rectangle within the image. The photographer is very bad at framing!
