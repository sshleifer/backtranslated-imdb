A study in the ADB. Bad direction, bad acting, poor writing and f / x that teach you that it is best to upgrade your computer before shooting. It's the kind of movie you used to make drunk in your basement with Daddy's camera when he was young at heart. But you certainly would not show that in public when you're sober again, right? YOU would not even see it. Avoid at all costs.
