I had never heard of budget auteur Neil Johnson before seeing "Battlespace" on DVD in Hollywood Video. A few minutes after the movie I realize that this is not a bad thing. Like many science fiction films, this is a film dominated largely by bad special effects and a constant parade of science fiction concepts that fail to create a story. <br /> <br /> Viewers are tortured with a religiously sounding text introduction, then a spoken introduction followed by a narration by the daughter of the main character. To me, this looked like a smokescreen to mask a movie with militantly ugly visuals and zero emphasis on characters. Some people here seem very willing to take this movie seriously and swallow the seemingly new messages from the hook and sink line. These rave reviews must come from the same kind of person who can delude themselves by thinking things like "Battlefield Earth" was a brilliant movie, or that Shasta is as good as Coca-Cola. <br /> <br /> Those who have been attracted to the art of the tacky cover can expect poor performance (in small doses, spaced out with long blocks of people who do not speak), routine computer-animated effects (in extra-large doses), and computers. What you will not get is excitement, emotional stimulation, memorable dialogue or a good story. <br /> <br /> "Battlespace" is an impenetrable bull and the annoying constant of narration proves that. True science fiction, hell, true cinema, is about characters and their dialogue, not special effects and dull predictions. This is right there with similar direct to the sci-fi video as "Cl.One" and "Recon 2022". If the boredom of "Strange Horizons" and "Alien Visitor" is something you seek, by all means, look at the crap of it. If you like good stories and hate fake lens flares, you're better off with a real movie.
