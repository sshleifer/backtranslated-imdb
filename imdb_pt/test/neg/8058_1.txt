This movie was unbelievably bad ... It's bloody, but violence is too much to the point where it seems extremely false and predictable. Since everything is shown to you, there is nothing else for the imagination. And the plot ... the plot? There really is none! The pace is incredibly slow (despite random acts of violence) and the script must have been written by a disturbed 12-year-old kid who kills kittens for fun. So this movie was banned in 31 countries? I could see why ... not because of the blood (boring and banal), but because it was a terrible movie. He should have been banished from existence. Avoid this like the plague. 1 out of 10
