"You know, I've been to some cities where girls were not so pretty, I've actually been to some cities where they're completely ugly, but it's the first time I've been in a city where there are no girls at all." I'm sure fans of great classics remember this phrase that belongs to Vin ... one of the REALLY magnificent seven (from the first film) ... <br /> <br /> Now I want to rewrite it here. You know - I've seen some movies where the plot is not so good. In fact, I've seen some movies where the plot is terrible, but it's the first time in my life that I see the movie where there is no plot. <br /> <br /> OK. Maybe my statement above is a little overdone, but honestly ... how can you call the plot of crap that's happening in that movie. The bad guy (oh, do not ask me to give him his name because I do not remember and he's not even somehow close to Calvera, whose name and character is unforgettable ...) is trying to build the church in the name of their dead sons, who were killed in some battle, and this villain is kidnapping poor villagers to force them to build the church ... First of all, how big should the church have to force hundreds of villagers to build it ... is it some Egyptian pyramid or something? but OK, let's stop here about the plot and absolutely forgettable character of a bad guy and let's say a few words about the seven themselves ... <br /> <br /> Yul Brynner is good old Chris, always calm, always in silence, speaking less, but speaking wise is gone (unfortunately). Oh no ... he's as calm as he was ... but now, he's calm is so fake that you just do not buy it. (imagine, he meets a good old friend Chico, whom he must rescue after so many years and there are only a few "hi, hello" and not even handshake (as far as I remember)) ... honestly, it seems more like meeting two strangers in some internet chat instead of Chris and Chico's meeting. That makes the "new Chris" look more like a robocop or terminator than our beloved quick gun ... <br /> <br /> I will not stop here talking about other characters. There simply is not ANYTHING ... (imagine if a strong actor like Yul Brynner is so forgetful, then how are the other characters) ... <br /> <br /> There are still some attempts to give us a background story for each one of them ... for example one is the women's favorite guy, according to a man with a dark past that the woman was raped and killed by Indians and he has since been killing everyone and everything that is moving ... but none of these characters are making any sense or none of them can take their heart. <br /> <br /> I remember I was a kid and when O'Reilly (Charles Bronson's character) died in the first movie I was crying. Here, I just did not care about each one of them ... even if they all with the whole crew of the movie died, it seems I would not mind ... <br /> <br /> So, please go and SEE THIS MOVIE ... I recommend it because you will not get the other chance to see something worse than that.
