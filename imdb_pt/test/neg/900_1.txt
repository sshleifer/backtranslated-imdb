I do not know what the producers of this movie were trying to accomplish or say, but they failed at anything. Unless, of course, the object would totally confuse the viewer. I watched this movie simply because Drew Barrymore was in it, and it turned out that she had a smaller than small stake in it. The whole idea of ​​having this kid on a wild car trip to win a big cash prize from a gas station game and meet all kinds of freaks is totally ridiculous.
