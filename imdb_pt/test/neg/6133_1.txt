Ok, first I must say I suppose this was done only by a group of friends on a budget. With that in mind, it really should not be compared to very successful features and my ranking would be higher. But still ... <br /> <br /> After giving him a chance, he still violated some basic rules of filmmaking in such a way that both the viewer and the amateur director in me have shrunk. VERY. <br /> <br /> Think: Blair Witch in a car, but REALLY annoying. <br /> <br /> Think: You left your camcorder on the dashboard and recorded yourself getting lost in the park at night for an hour, then make your friends watch it. <br /> <br /> The scariest part (possible SPOILER alert ... IF SPOILING HERE IS POSSIBLE) was at one point the image rewinds and you may think you will have to watch it all over again. SCARY. <br /> <br /> Nonsense aside, this is a good idea for a low-budget movie that will let-go-make-a-movie-tonight. But the concept walks a fine line between being very good and very bad, and let's just say it was not very good. There were only so many parts where nothing happened. At first I thought it was the director's plan - you should be packed into a sense of security and then really scary things would start to happen. But not. <br /> <br /> I kept trying to find good things to say about it (and I had plenty of time to think), and I'm going to say that the music was cool. And I have to give the female credit of being around by herself looking scared for a really, really long time. But that's it. Actors who played "infected" people seemed to be mocking zombie movies. Or they had their Bug motivation by wearing their Edgar "MIB" suit. Chances are that if for some strange reason you watch this movie, it's on DVD or Tivo, so you can move forward quickly whenever you expect something to happen to be very difficult. <br /> <br /> I hate being so critical of anything, but at the same time I've watched many similar movies and nothing has ever been so painful. If they would just cut half an hour and add something scary, it might be decent. Maybe it's the director's cut ...
