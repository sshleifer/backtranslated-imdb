I loved the original P.H. and was somewhat pleased with Bloodwings (II) and Ashes to Ashes (III), so I saw part IV. Oh boy ..... As a Pumpkinghead enthusiast, I did my best to give Part 4 as much credit as I could, but it's too bad. The wedding reception fight early in the movie is a horrible mess for one thing. The plot of Hatfield and McCoy is incomprehensibly stupid and cliche. How did the producers manage to use this tired story of family fiefdom? Wow, unbelievable. Henrickson's performance is below average. The plot and screenplay are mind-numbing. The current edition and cinematography are medium as well as the direction. I mean, the movie is not a total loss. As always: I really enjoy seeing Pumpkinhead, I love watching Haggis the Witch and I like to see Harley's ghost in action. But all three characters had a lot of time on the screen. I thought Haggis and Harley would end up going out to a dinner club for an evening meal and drinks, the way her friend was being so kind in her cabin. The bottom line is .... Is that I wanted all the characters in this puke fest of a plot were dead in 20 minutes from the beginning of the picture. Where does Sci-Fi get the so-called "movie production professionals" anyway? I could do a better job writing a cold script stone. I'm sure there was a limited budget and everything, but come on! See if you're a fan of the other three, but only once. And then come back and get the original two. Shame on you Sci-Fi !!!!
