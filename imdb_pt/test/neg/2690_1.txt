For a long time I have tried to understand why people like Shakespeare so much, and every few years I give him another chance. I was hoping that this piece / movie (my 6th piece other than Shakespeare's) could unlock the lucky coffin and marry the riches of this literary demigod. Bah, I clearly chose the wrong key. <br /> <br /> Once the phrase "pound of flesh" was uttered 10 minutes into the film, the main parts of the plot were transparent, which grinds along with languid writing and lifeless acting. With each step, the plot is placed naked two scenes in advance. The concept that a dying aristocrat would persuade his daughter to choose her future husband by means of a lottery is unbelieving. No wonder who wins the matrimonial jackpot because Bassanio is a main protagonist of the play ... and he is the third man to try ... and there are three coffins to choose ... and your friend rises his life to pay the dowry. The only genuine surprise I've had watching this movie is that it did not end immediately after the resolution of the case. However, as soon as the betrayal of the ring began, it became immediately apparent what would happen. <br /> <br /> OK, so I know that millions of people love Shakespeare not by surprise in the well-known stories, but by the depth and passion of the characters. But I did not feel anything for the characters. Instead of getting caught up in suspense and admiration during the court scene, I sat there impatiently, hoping it would end, soon, please. <br /> <br /> One day, I can find a piece of Shakespeare that does something other than me.
