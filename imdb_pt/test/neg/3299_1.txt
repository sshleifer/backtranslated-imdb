I watched the first episode of "The War at Home" because I thought it was worth replacing "Arrested Development", boy, I was disappointed. It should be clear to everyone that this show was blatantly stolen from "Grounded for Life", "Titus" and "Married ... with Children", since all are similar in plot and general mood. The so-called "punch lines" are all repetitive and stereotyped, and even more so, these "catchphrases" are not even funny, to me, they are coarser and coarser. The main character Dave Gold acts like a white trash bandit who thinks he's being funny and cool, which he is not. (Even Hillary (daughter of Dave) said this in the episode "Gaza Strip"). In the episode "Dream Crusher," Hillary wanted to be a singer (but actually it was pretty bad), Dave and Vicky, then happily decided to crush their dreams by saying that she sucked. After that, she then wanted to be a child psychologist and planned to go to Harvard, after telling Dave and Vicky and leaving the room, the two started mocking her without thinking. Also, in the first episode, Dave said about Hillary's boyfriend "Does she really think we're going to let her out with this guy? I'd rather drink my own urine," this line has the stupidest line in history of television. And Dave is constantly making fun of Larry (his son) when he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks he's gay and is a nerd. Also, let's not forget that he also made fun of Larry's (fat) girlfriend. Dave is the father that he must defend his son, no matter what. "The War at Home" is arguably the worst TV show for the family. This clearly explains why the show should be canceled as it spreads a racist and homophobic agenda. It's as if the show wants to be funny for always putting that stupid laugh every time someone says something, but the lines are a little forced, idiots and pathetically juvenile. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the show is horrible is the acting, Mike Rappaport and Kyle Sullivan are terrible and terrible actors. Rappaport has to always move his hands when he is in front of the camera, he not only does this in this program, but he also did it during his time with "Boston Public". Sullivan talks and acts like a kind of robot every time he acts (he also did this in "Malcolm in the Middle"). <br /> <br /> So to wrap all this up, you all have your reasons wrong with this show 1. It's unoriginal 2. The acting sucks 3.No it's even funny 4.All the jokes are the same 5 .Has bad script 6.The characters are unfortunate and unpleasant 7.The father is a rip-off from Archie Bunker FOX needs to take this garbage out of the air because anything is better than that.
