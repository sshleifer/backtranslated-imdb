Exceptionally bad! I do not expect much from Garcia, since he is one of the most overrated actors of today, but Keaton really should know that this movie would suck and leave while he could (not that I'm especially fan of him, but hey, he did batman ) In one scene, Keaton is transported to a chained hospital and wearing a Hannibal Lecter facial mask when two attack dogs bark at him (dogs can feel the evil you know) and Keaton growls back at them, causing them to retreat and moan with the tail between his legs. Did the movie become comedy right there? Garcia makes a fool of himself in an interrogation scene with dialogues that only a complete retardant could find plausible and the boy is very annoying to feel sorry for ... <br /> <br /> If you're going to make a movie with the worst a plot like this you need some charm, humor, some solid action. Take Die Hard, for example, which is great, though its a little low quality plot. <br /> <br /> Even though the Keatons character was a joke I routed him all the way. I wanted to see Garcia cry for her dead son and Keaton sipping martinis on some paradise island! This movie makes a good laugh .. Watch with a witty friend and you can have some fun as this movie begs for jokes in almost every scene. <br /> <br /> All this is an insult to intelligence and a huge waste of money. Greed made this movie and thankfully bit her own butt.
