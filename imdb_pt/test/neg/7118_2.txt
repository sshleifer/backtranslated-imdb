Spoilers ahead JEEEEEEEESUSSSSSSSSSS .... I have a saying: "Insecticides kill insects and Moronicides kill idiots ..." The "ghost" in this movie kills idiots. Many of the people who were killed in this movie are actually begging to be killed, running into abandoned houses, going after ghosts, etc ... <br /> <br /> In a strictly cinematic aspect, this movie is a bad drug The three lines of history are parallel, and suddenly we learn that they are separated by at least a few days. It's a cheap shot ... <br /> <br /> Moreover, "emotions" are so cheap that they are laughable. Even "Nightmare on Elm Street" did not sink so far as to show someone being attacked by their own sweater ... it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Save your money, stay home, and you will not have a grudge against the filmmakers ..
