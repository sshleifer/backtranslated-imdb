Solomon and Sheba descended on Hollywood folklore not because of the quality of the film, but because of the fact that Tyrone Power died while doing so. I was in 5th grade and I remember well the great news of the days when the tragedy happened. I did not know who Tyrone Power was at the time, but I learned and learned to appreciate the body of his work. <br /> <br /> I often wonder if Ty had a good sense about this movie and what failure he had proved. He was the unnamed producer of that, too. Maybe he just did not want to face the critics. Thankfully Power actually went out with Witness to the Prosecutor's Office, although you can see it in long plans if you look closely. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a biblical stew that would probably confuse the great Solomon himself. Several incidents described in the Bible that the Bible treats separately are intertwined in a plot with some additions launched by Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The real story about the Queen of Sheba is that she went on a trade mission to the Kingdom of Israel, talked to Solomon a bit, came back with a lot of commercial goods and that was it. The story of a romance between her and Solomon is legendary. The ancient kingdom of Sheba is where Yemen is now and its people are supposedly moved to the African continent, which is how Ethiopia was founded. <br /> <br /> The queen never witnessed the famous case of Solomon involving the two women with separate claims for a baby, nor was she involved with the construction of the First Temple. Nor was she near to the destruction of it. For this reason, even Solomon was not. <br /> <br /> And she was not involved in the dispute over succession when Adonijah, Solomon's brother, filed a counterclaim. This is the heart of this movie. Adonijah hearing the news that King David is dying declares himself king. Of course David meets temporarily and says that God came to him and said that Solomon should succeed him. When David hears about what Adonijah did, he says that this is how God became out of shape, Adonijah being greedy. After Adonijah begins to conspire. <br /> <br /> Things seem to have a full circle in which Ty Power collapsed on the set while playing with George Sanders as Adonijah. Sanders and Power were rivals in many films, most notably Lloyds of London, which was Power's groundbreaking role. If Sanders is not the sophisticated sufferer he was in Samson and Delilah, he is still Sanders, the biblical bastard. <br /> <br /> When the Power died, Yul Brynner was brought in to play Solomon and receive a wig so that existing images of Power in the long shot could be retrieved. Brynner invests the dialogue with dignity, but I think he probably regretted having beaten it. <br /> <br /> Gina Lollobrigida is the queen of Sheba and is seductive as a biblical seductress in the tradition of Cecil B. DeMille. . She seems to have no real conviction and my guess is that she was shocked by Power's sudden death and having to do it all over again. Marisa Pavan as Abishag can give the best performance in the film. <br /> <br /> The real story with Adonias is not as elaborate as this movie. He contested with Solomon the succession and gathered around a group of some members of King David's court as partisans. Solomon once forgave them and then Adonijah asked Abisague to marry him. Abishag in the Bible and here was an adopted daughter of King David in his old age. When Solomon hears this, he decides that Adonijah is greedy again and killed him. The Bible mentions someone named Berniah who went around basically making contracts with the followers of Adonijah. <br /> <br /> What we have in the movie is a spectacular climax involving a miracle that I sought and could not find. It came from the fertile imagination of director King Vidor who ended a long and distinguished career on a sour note. It was a matter of Vidor trying to make Cecil B. DeMille in the Bible show. <br /> <br /> He could not.
