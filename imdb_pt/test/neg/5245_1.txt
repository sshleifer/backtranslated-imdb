GOOD: Technomusic accompanying medieval fencing. In addition, the movie looks more elegant than most b-movies, but let's face it: Quake or Doom has more atmosphere. <br /> <br /> BAD: Non-intelligent plot, without acting and totally unbelievable universe. I'm usually able to see the potential of very bad movies; Wow, I love a good B movie like "Split Second" and the likes. But this has nothing but boredom and clich√© to offer ... Totally predictable from start to finish. Oh, and I forgot the lousy special effects, they look more like an old Playstation game than anything out of the myth! The use of a classic poem to sell this sucker offends me! <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: Quite simply boring. If you want to see Lara Croft, buy the game, it's sexier!
