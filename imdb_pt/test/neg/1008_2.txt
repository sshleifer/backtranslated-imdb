This movie might well have been a propaganda film for the American Falangist party - or some similar group ... The strong man (Kersey) stands above the law (but not outlaw) and frees honest citizens by killing trash useless The only thing that made me think it was not made by the KKK was the fact that a Jew starred as a good guy ... Try watching it again while you think of it as a propaganda film for a far right group - and you'll see what I mean ... <br /> <br /> It's a tragedy that Jimmy Page really made music for this movie ... :(
