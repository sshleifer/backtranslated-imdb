I rented this movie for about $ 1.50 - the most complete waste of money (and time) I have ever spent. It's LAME! I could not believe how they could come up with something like that. <br /> <br /> The plot ... there is no plot. Everything you would expect to happen would only get worse. The acting was horrible. My dog ​​could have done better. Special effects have no effect - except to induce total disbelief. And the cheese lines ... I mean, why bother? <br /> <br /> The only credit I can give to this article is the opening scene. They were really beautiful. And one of the reasons I decided to rent it. The graphics shown there are probably the best and most realistic CG of the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Total Reality wins 1 in 10 because it can not score it lower.
