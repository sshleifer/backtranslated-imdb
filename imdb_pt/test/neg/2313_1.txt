I do not recommend watching this movie. It is a film in which a film is being filmed, without attraction between actress and actor being touched. The sex scene at the end of the film, which is to explain the actress's reluctance (to be played in the film) in cooperating with the actor (being played in the film) is a rough repetition of the same scene in Breillat. Film Fat Girl. Everything there was played more delicately, if you can attribute delicacy to such a sexual act. A typical French expression for what happens in sex is comedy is Oh la la! In the film Breillat Brief Crossing there is also sensitivity. In Sex is comedy I do not see real sensitivity and also a clear plot for the film is not being developed so there is a rather loose story with the disillusionment of the end.
