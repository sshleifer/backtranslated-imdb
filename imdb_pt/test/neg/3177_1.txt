The action was episodic and there was no narrative thread to unite the episodes and carry the story forward. The plot goes on. With few exceptions (for example, Graham Greene), the performance was not inspired and, at best, for pedestrians. The actors seemed to have something in mind, beyond the scene they were in. It's annoying to watch a man drive a car through the semi-desert country of the movie's scenery, whether he drives bad or well. These scenes are typical of the level of tension in the video. So there was nothing about this video to engage or attract the observer, to make him care about the characters and the outcome comes. I am doubly disappointed because I rented this film based on the reputation of the executive producer (Redford) and the writer of the novel he relied on (Hillerman). I note that the jewelry box reports that the funding is provided by PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, as well as by Carlton International. I hope this video is as disappointing for them as it is for me and my wife, to the point of not funding more disasters from the same source.
