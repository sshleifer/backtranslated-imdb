This movie defines the word "confusing". All actors remain faithful to the script. More is worth it because the acting is good, but the script is a confused pastiche of random pseudo-psychoanalytic ideas. The pace is slow and the cinematography of lenses of soft focus gives the nerves quickly. I give 4 out of 10.
