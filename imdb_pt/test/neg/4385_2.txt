I love movies in this genre. Beautiful girls, bathroom humor, free nudity. So why did not I like this movie? No movie like this should add the least clutter to the plot. Who's who, where's the money, is not SE7EN, just make me laugh. Maybe it's me, but I've never felt so frustrated watching American Pie movies or any of the more modern National Lampoon movies. This movie has no flow that makes me smile, waiting for what comes next. Instead, I find myself pausing to think, "Why did they keep this scene?" I do not recommend this movie. If you're waiting for Van Wilder, think again. The only fun I had watching this movie was guessing at what movies the actors were when they were kids. 2/10 generously.
