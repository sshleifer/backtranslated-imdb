Watching QUINTET is no different than watching a group of people play a Portuguese word game, or some other language you do not understand. You have the idea that they are playing a game, and if you watch closely enough, you can just begin to understand the rules. But why bother, since it is clear that you can not participate and would not like to have had the chance? <br /> <br /> Director Robert Altman is not to ask the audience to like his films. , much less understand them. Sometimes he lets you into the scene to be a part of the crowd, as in M ​​* A * S * H, NASHVILLE and A WEDDING, movies so full of hubbub and orchestrated chaos, one or two more bodies in the scene. t make a lot of difference. And at other times, he seems to resent the fact that someone may even be watching his movie; as in IMAGES or THREE WOMEN, where the stories are almost personal monologues made for an audience of one, Altman. With QUINTET, Altman seems to purposefully challenge someone to engage with the narrative. <br /> <br /> You can not rely on Altman to make logic or what is expected, which is sometimes what makes his films remarkably iconoclastic. But sometimes doing the unexpected is not daring, just stupid. For example, in QUINTET, we are introduced to a young woman who is apparently the last person on earth capable of becoming pregnant and, indeed, a child. This last ray of hope in a decadent society is almost immediately extinguished; Altman does not even wait until the end to play his last depressing letter in this elaborate nihilistic and pessimistic tale. It lets us know how empty and meaningless life is right up front. Angry? Perhaps. Stupid? Definitely. Devoid of purpose, he tries to build a story on an iceberg that melts quickly, all the while reminding us how effortless it is. <br /> <br /> For the record, QUINTET, at least can claim to be prophetic. The story is centered on a treacherous game played by the various bored characters. It's a form of TAG (the murder game): a handful of people crave for elimination, each as a would-be assassin and each as a potential victim. Two or more can form alliances to kill a third. As they die, new targets are assigned. Who lives, wins. All this happens in some exotic and inhospitable wasteland. It is, to a large extent, an extreme science fiction version of "Survivor" - minus commercial outlets and false "reality." <br /> <br /> It's not a bad concept for a science fiction. epic. A post-apocalyptic scenario, a microcosm of the world (the cast is clearly multinational), a game that you can not trust or at least not for long, and where no one really wins. Literally a cold war. A steel-eyed director with a taste for black humor and violent invention could have a picnic. The mystery in QUINTET is not in the game nor in how it is played, but in why there is all this. If the game "Quintet" is a metaphor for life, then Altman, seems to see nothing in the material, but a chance to show life as an empty and meaningless game - a conclusion as obvious as false. Given the lively, though cynical, nature of the rest of his many films, I do not believe that Altman also believes in QUINTET. And if Altman has no faith in his material, why should we?
