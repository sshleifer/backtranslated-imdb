This movie is honestly one of the biggest movies of all time ... if you suffer from insomnia. It is a surefire way to ensure hours of sleep at a time. As the film progresses slowly, the audience goes into a state of unconsciousness and gradually loses sight of any kind of plot the movie may contain. This effect is certainly created due to lack of action sweet / sweet babies. <br /> <br /> In addition, Mr. Eisenstein was obviously unable to master the art of assembly. A good example of this is the scene on the steps of Odessa. For no apparent reason, an event that in real life would take a matter of seconds is transformed into a seven-minute nightmare for any sound viewer. This flaw in editing smears any kind of realism throughout the film. Honestly, I've seen a more realistic edition watching cartoons. Some individuals who commented on this title hailed Battleship Potemkin as "One of the Greatest Films of All Time" and "Truly a Masterpiece." Well, I'm writing this comment to convince readers to avoid watching this movie at all costs. My best guess is that my Potemkin colleagues simply wrote the wrong words in their summaries. Certainly what they meant was: "One of the greatest siesta festivals of all time" and "Truly an epic failure." <br /> <br /> In conclusion, do not waste your time. If you are interested in watching a top-quality movie, go to www.youtube.com and watch a Halo 3 set-up. If I played the movie "Battleship Potemkin" in a guard killer game, I would shoot him in the face. with my sniper rifle and then with the tea bag. PEACE!
