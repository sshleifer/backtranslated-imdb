I bought the DVD of this movie because I'm a fan of William Devane and I was very disappointed with "A Christmas Visitor". The story of the movie is so boring and slow in development that you just want to turn off your TV or DVD after about half of it. The dialogues are very bad and belong to a daily soap opera, but not to a TV movie. William Devane was well on his side and he was acting very well, but he did much better on other films and projects. Meredith Baxter was horrible and could not really take the warm mother to the onlookers. Instead, she was playing really cool and was no better than a middle-class actress. I absolutely can not recommend this movie. Save your time and your money for this.
