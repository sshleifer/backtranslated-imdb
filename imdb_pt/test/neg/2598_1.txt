I have not seen many episodes of "Family Guy" and it's a pretty safe bet that I will not be seeing many in the future. Some people say that comparing this show to "The Simpsons" is unfair. I absolutely think that this show would not exist if "The Simpsons" had not come first and I absolutely think he really wants to be "The Simpsons". I do not understand what's so funny about this show. In the episodes I watched, I understood where they wanted me to laugh, I understand someone thinks a joke has just been told, but the joke is not funny. I find the whole program lazy: the title, the "jokes", there is a complete lack of inspiration. <br /> <br /> The best programs on television (cartoon or not) are created like this: script is written, it goes through several rewrites, things that do not work are taken out, inspiration is triggered, good things are added, there is more rewritten and then filmed. <br /> <br /> I imagine a "Family Guy" episode to be created like this: a script is written and is filmed.
