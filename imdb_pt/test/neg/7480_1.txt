Before the last call with Carson Daly, my local NBC affiliate broadcast a much more fruitful schedule after Late Night with Conan, such as the city's second TV, 3rd Rock and Carline in the City reruns, and some stand-up comedies. Nowadays there is nothing worth watching, because all I can see is Carson Daly and his horrible show. He is not a comedian, he is not an actor, he does not deserve to be famous because he is not a good speaker or comedian. <br /> <br /> In his show on June 21, he tried to use an internet. meme called the "Rickroll" on his show. He failed harshly. This event confirms that Carson Daly is horrible.
