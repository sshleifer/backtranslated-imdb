Movies just do not get worse than that. Horrible plot, horribly timed, characters and pathetic effects and yes, this is using the "B" standards. <br /> <br /> And for the boys: nothing, this movie is a terrible disappointment, couple scenes that could have been great but you get nothing but build without delivery. <br /> <br /> This movie does not appeal to anyone, horrible movie, which was bad; plot, acting, "B" flavor, special effects and everything. Also, there is no nudity or eroticism for boys or girls.
