This German horror movie has to be one of the strangest I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism, but this is based on a true character. <br /> <br /> Our hero is deaf and dumb as a result of repeated beatings in his father's hands. he also has a doll fetish, but I can not figure out where that came from. Your co-workers uncover and tease you terribly. <br /> <br /> During the day a moderate accountant, and at night he invades cemeteries and undertakers and drinks the blood of dead girls. They are all attractive, of course, otherwise we do not care about the fact that he usually rips his clothes up to his waist. He ends up killing himself, and that's what gets him stuck. <br /> <br /> As I said, a very strange film that is bleak and very slow, since Werner Pochath never talks and only spends his time drinking blood.
