This movie is horrible. At first, I thought it would be appealing to children, due to the affectionate Ewoks, the fury of the Star Wars people. After watching this monstrosity of a movie, I'm sure even a 4-year-old would not find this movie interesting. The special effects are by far the best in this movie and compare well to other 80's TV movies. The script is bad, the actors, especially Aubree Miller and incredibly bad, and the film is so predictable that I still can not believe that I could not touch the button on the front of my VCR. However, I came close to changing this mess more than once.
