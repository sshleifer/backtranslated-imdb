As the previous commentator in this movie, I also saw myself in tears sometimes during this movie. Sometimes, one wonders how such an inspiring horror film comes into existence. From the moment our protagonist wakes up in his apartment in New York from a dream of subway trains interspersed with horses at a gallop (which the Irish emigrant did not have), it is clear that we are in trouble. And it does not get much better. <br /> <br /> We came back to Ireland from the fifties, entering a world where everyone speaks without intonation and exclusively on the topic of the Irish Civil War. Students attend school to learn about the Civil War. Drinkers in the pub divide according to their loyalties in the Civil War. Memories are held for those who died in the Civil War. The city is divided between those who believe we should remember and those who want to forget ... the Civil War. All looks and conversations are full of meaning dating back to the Civil War. <br /> <br /> The synopsis in Broken Harvest's videocover suggests that the film is a parable of the problems in modern Ireland. The only parallel that strikes me is that today, conversations in Dublin are in fact dominated by a single topic: house prices. If she intends to offer some sort of insight into Ireland's obsession with her past, she fails miserably. It's amazing how few Irish films dealt with the Irish civil war and its legacies. However, it will take a film with far more subtlety and intelligence than this to tell us something about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the nation's psyche. <br /> <br /> For those American viewers who have suggested the film evokes the 1950s Ireland atmosphere: it does not. 1950s Ireland was a horrible pit of sexual repression and misery, poverty-stricken, from which young people fled in droves. However, there was more than one conversation topic.
