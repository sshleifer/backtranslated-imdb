I really liked this movie. Of course, the performance was flat, there was no plot, and the villain was the crudest I ever saw. Michael Bernardo as Dante is worth laughing for himself, with an incredibly funny slogan and an evil laugh. But it's worth seeing, just for the worst explosion you'll ever see outside of the TV series Power Rangers. You'll know when you see it. Honestly, this movie should have the budget for a low-quality porn. I almost stopped watching after an hour, but I recommend watching the whole thing; at least there are many eye drops for everyone. Recommended for viewers with high tolerance for bad movies.
