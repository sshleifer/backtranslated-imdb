The plot has something about white hunters captured by a tribe of white women in the African jungle / plains. It's a turkey and some. What it really is is a wildly unreleased recording of films of primitive sound and silence, mixed with recent images (for the release) of men on a safari. There are scenes of a man in a gorilla costume, southern seas native to the sea (used to represent people in the middle of Africa), women in bikinis, horrible narration and a guy in a cloth with makeup all over the body (racially insensitive I I think so). This is a movie to sit on and make fun of, but only with lots of alcoholic drinks and witty friends. At any other time, this will be a difficult task. It's a bad bad bad movie. Besides I'm speechless.
