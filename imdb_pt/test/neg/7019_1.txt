To begin with, I really love Lucy. Your TV show still makes me laugh. She was one of the greatest comedians ever to live up there with Chaplin and Keaton. But, his performance in this movie is disappointing. She was too old, and the gauze filters on the lens make her look like a fog refugee in London. She could not sing, and her voice was so frowny that she mumbled into every song. Your dancing days have been long in the past. Just because you are a fan of Lucy, do not face this wrong and wrong performance and sing your praise. I prefer to remember Lucy on her wonderful TV series (I Love Lucy) and do the charity curtain on the terrible mess of a movie called "Mame."
