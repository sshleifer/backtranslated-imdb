The movie was really bad. It's not so much a script problem. It's just that the movie is really boring in terms of rhythm. The film seems to creep at a slow, agonizing pace. The story in San Franpsycho is that there is a serial killer on the loose who is killing morally corrupt people (maybe I've read a lot about it, but hey, it's my nature apparently) after the San Franpsycho kills a couple of people under the Golden Gate. Bridge we are introduced to one of the main characters in the film: Joe Estevez (brother of Martin Sheen) as a grouchy cop named Bill Culp. Bill is currently trying to hunt down the killer (seriously he does not have a name, he's just the killer), and he's trying to coerce a local reporter named Rita to help him with his investigation, Bill is the hard-end stereotype. police officer and he threatens Rita to throw her in jail for obstruction of justice. Anyway, some scenes go by and suddenly Rita finds a card left by the psychopath (he's a cold-blooded psychopath!) And she changes her mind and tells Bill and her partner Joe about it and helps them in the investigation. The movie tries to be a powerful murder thriller, but it kind of fails. It's very much like the movie The Black Dahlia, which tries to get tense, but it's unbelievable in terms of that. The film tries to be serious everywhere, but there are scenes like where The Killer masturbates (obviously a fan of pornography gore that with lines like "ooh blood on her" or something in that sense) and Joe Estevez banging on the table: "He is a cold-blooded murderer! I admit that I have laughed more than once in the film, although I am sure that the film should be serious. <br /> <br /> One of the only good points of the film is the fact that I I did not pay money to see it (huzzah netflix) And it's sad because I could see something good in his films after watching The Damned. It's not a great script, but it could have been interesting. Instead, what you get is a murder thriller that does not excite or have vaguely pleasant deaths. that the movie has "a great turnaround ending that's shocking, "apparently I was watching a different movie because for about an hour of branding I sort of figured out what was going to happen. The ending did not shock me at all. I would insult this movie, but I do not think I will. Long story short this movie is a boring uninspired thriller (I use that term loosely) that fails to have the "Hitchcockian thrills" that another reviewer claims to have a predictable ending, bland deaths, acting with all the excitement of a wooden plank and a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I'm sure others will try to defend this with the usual: it was a low-budget movie, they did the best they could with such a low budget, and all this other absurdity. But when you got there, there was very little that they could actually spend that budget, there was very little special effects work, the soundtrack looks like it could have been recycled from Hood of the Living Dead or The Damned and it's the same damn team of these two films. This movie really reminds me a lot of another low-budget movie that was not good, and was called Mr. Jingles, the two are of the same quality, they fail to deliver anything close to the pleasure and should disappear quickly into obscurity.
