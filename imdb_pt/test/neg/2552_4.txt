First of all "Mexican werewolf in Texas" is not a werewolf movie. This title is bullcrap. The story is actually about a Chupacabra that kills all the locals in the small town of Furlough, Texas. I suppose the distributors renamed the original title for him to make some extra money or something. And I think it really works because that's the reason I bought this piece of crap, it sounded so stupid. Anyway, the movie is not good. Actually, it's horrible. But I did not expect anything else when I bought it. It's a low budget horror movie with a Chupacabra monster. If you like low budget horror with bad dialogue, actors and some gore then you should check into this movie. But I must warn you, this movie is really baaaaaaad. <br /> <br /> This movie has some of the worst performances I've ever seen. The actors try hard and are completely ridiculous. They almost never say a line in a normal way. They always have that tone completely wrong about everything they say. It's so stupid that it almost looks like a crazy parody. It's as if they shot each scene just once and were happy about it. Worst of all is the blonde girl, who is supposed to be a fool. She's the worst of them all. I've never seen an actor as bad as her (and I've seen Pteradactyl). Even when her boyfriend dies, she can not help being silly about it. I hate her. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes in this movie were very good. Those who were filmed during the day are all pretty decent for a low budget project. But most of the film is filmed at night when the Chupacabra strikes and the lighting is very dark. The bloody scenes are few and short, but really grizzly and violent. The effects are really hilarious, but that's how I like it. The Chupacabra looks pretty confusing, and it's easy to see that it's a guy in a suit. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget movies and it is very important not to watch this alone because you will probably get bored to death. I recommend watching this movie with your friends and a little beer.
