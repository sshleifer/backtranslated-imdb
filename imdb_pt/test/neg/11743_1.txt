A horrendous, ill-conceived and raw movie. The performance of Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan is so inferior to that of Perkins and Leigh in the original version that they must be seen to believe. There was no reason to make that image, which only highlights how talented and brilliant Hitchcock was, and how inimitable. Also, there is an insidious insensitivity in the movie that is not there in the first movie. Hitchcock's psychotic was frightening and shocking, but one could genuinely feel it by all concerned, even by the pitiful Norman Bates. There have been moments of pathos, irony and fairy humor that the remake does not have. One of the best things about Hitchcock's film was its incredible and intuitive depth and nuance sense, when to cut and when to show something, about using a close-up or a long shot, about making a nice actor and when to do it scary, and so on. The remake does not have any of these qualities and does not even try for them. It's a stupid exercise that surprises me that I've been released.
