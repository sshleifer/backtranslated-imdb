The Zombie Planet looks like an example of good ideas and praiseworthy ambition that goes beyond the budget. I thought the explanation for the zombies was real and original and loved the dog chewing the exposure scene. The rest of the gore was effective on a budget budget but very spaced throughout the film. The problem was that it was too long and anti-climatic. Of course, they had an intriguing plot, if derived, and a similarly familiar but cool scenario, but a low budget zombie movie really needs to be goret√°stico to make a good impression and there are not enough red moments for me. I think there were too many fight scenes looking cheap and bloodless, especially given the generally minimal average. Also, for a two-hour movie, there is very little closing at the end, and though it kind of makes me want to track down Zombie Planet 2, I felt a little cheated. So it's probably worth looking for both.
