OK, imagine that every state in the US, or rather each country has exactly the same trees that grow and foliage ground. Imagine, too, that a monkey hunter's camp so out of the way that you had to do in the first half of the river approach has a perfectly straight, tarmac road that leads to it. Imagine a world where you have to wear a full biological hazard suit to collect a floppy disk, so you simply put it in a plastic bag and transfer it into your pocket without any precautions when you return to the office. A world where two nine-year-old girls are happy to give a lot of blood without complaining. This is the world in which this movie takes place. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is one of the most clich√©d droppings that has been my misfortune to witness for many years. <br /> I liked it. :)
