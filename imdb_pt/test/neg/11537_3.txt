Warrior Princess is a science fiction action movie with a very fine plot, essentially about the death of its queen mother-sisters, an evil and a good fight for control of the throne. The good sister is being beaten, so she escapes to Earth, where she appears naked in a strip club in the middle of a wet T-shirt competition. The rest of the film is basically a long chase scene, while the evil sister tries to find and kill her younger sister. But the younger sister is helped by Bob, a good-hearted DJ, and everything is complicated by the police's involvement and sister's ignorance of the customs and culture of Earth. The older sister reaches out to her younger brother several times, but the latter manages to escape and run again. Throughout all this action, there is a cult of women on the home planet making a kind of space session to bring the good sister back. Unfortunately, a good chunk of this movie seems to be boring scenes of car chase as they drive through Los Angeles (and what was that sound effect when the police car crashed?) The movie culminates in another physical fight between the sisters with a predictable Look . <br /> <br /> It seems to lend elements of Star Wars (the light sabers and the girls' home planet look at the opening and subsequent scenes), Dr. Who (the phone booth as a means of transportation). ) and some of the costumes (from the cult on the home planet) could have been taken from the Star Trek episodes. Ms. Dana Fredsti (the bad sister in the movie) in another reviewer's comment mentioned "the endless (and monotonous) wet T-shirt contest." It's seriously the biggest wet t-shirt contest in movie history. And the only one where competitors were wearing industrial-strength polyester shirts that defied every effort to make them wet and translucent. "I could not say better. The thing I would add is that the music in this scene is simply annoying. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting is overly exaggerated, but that seems to fit the style of the film. The actors who play Vinnie and Vito were too much for me - I found them annoying. Fredsti (Curette) seemed to be amused and not taking the whole thing too seriously, in contrast to Sharon Lee Jones, who acted decently, but seemed to take everything more seriously. All the cops were portrayed as clumsy idiots, presumably to add comic relief, which is a bit unnecessary, since the whole movie was quite comedic. <br /> <br /> From the standpoint of classification, this film had a lot of dirty language; some topless women and others with scarce clothes but no skin enough to satisfy those who are looking for nudity; a sex scene that has been portrayed in a non-graphic and dreamy way; and little violence - while there were threats of violence everywhere, the scenes of fighting with swords and fights were exaggerated, and they also camped to be "offensive," although it seemed that the actors were having a good time with it. <br /> <br /> I have to ask myself who created the names of the characters? Ovule (a small egg), Cureta (a surgical instrument used for scraping and cleaning), Exzema (suspiciously resembling a skin scaling and pruritus), Bulemia (an eating disorder with compulsion and purging), and Rickettsia )? Overall, this is a bad, low-budget, extravagant action movie, but it kept me entertained, though I might need a few drinks before I watch it again.
