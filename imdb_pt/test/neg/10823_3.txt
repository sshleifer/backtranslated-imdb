I rented this movie from Blockbust because of the cover and title! It sounded intriguing !! This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense. The "monsters" needed more time. We needed them to have some kind of special power and definitely more moments "Oh Sh--". The photograph did not bother me, except for the scene in which a new respirator explodes. There were many closes. But in addition, the film seemed to drag on and the heroes did not really work for their freedom. Overall, I would say that everyone devotes a lot of time to the writers. But this movie is definitely a below average rental. <br /> <br /> There are definitely better choices. I would recommend Anacondas 1 or 2 about this choice.
