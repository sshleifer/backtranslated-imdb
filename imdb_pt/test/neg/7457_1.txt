This Canadian "movie" is the worst of them all! Incredibly amateur. When the thieves steal a boat, we see two women with machine guns and one of them says in a very low voice: "We're stealing your ship!" She blinks and is totally shy! Very intimidating. ROTFLOL !!! <br /> <br /> The two karate-cut heroes are 40-and-a-half years old, one-and-a-half-twin twins! They are really bad actors. In fact, everyone involved in this production is a non-actor. <br /> <br /> There are so many errors of continuity in this cheap production that is incredible. In one scene, the guys are wearing a type of swimsuit. In the picture below, they are wearing completely different bathing suits. <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible! A must see for any fan of bad movies. I have it on VHS. It's very rare. I appreciate that.
