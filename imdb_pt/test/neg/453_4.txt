I'm a big fan of when it comes to Doctor Who series and I still am, but I was very disappointed when I started watching this new series. <br /> <br /> Children under the age of 15, or better yet, under the age of 10 will probably enjoy you the best and possibly new fans who have not seen any of the original series, but both as fans of the original series, will find this series losing much of the charm that made the original series so great, led David Tennant to take me to appreciate how much better Christoper Eccellestion was as a doctor in the season 1. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend this series to people who have not seen much of the original series, people under 15, and EXTREMELY DIE HARD that fans, everyone else will just laugh and mutter profanity about Russel T Davies has ruined one of our favorite TV shows.
