But even the cartoons need a plausible plot. I suppose in 1934, part of that audience long ago would enjoy this tepid farce. It does not age well. That makes Nat Pendelton and Zasu Pitts, experienced and experienced players, have a chance to lead the roles. Pendelton, who is featured in the series Thin Man, tries his best, but is overcome by a foolish plot. With the backdrop being a play with gangsters, it's not exactly the original material. Movie's saving grace is always excellent Edward Everett Horton in a wasted performance. But do not waste your time watching Everett in this movie. I would encourage anyone to assist you in your Holiday effort, with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. Same was 1936, but much better script and plot. Better gags and needless to say star power too.
