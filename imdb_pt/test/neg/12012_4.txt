Junior and his father start a new life in a new city. It's the same life because Junior has not changed at all. He's still the same rotten brat as before only he got bigger. This time he has a friend named Trixie and she's just a little worse. Junior does not like his father dating and spoils every opportunity he has. Then the grandfather comes in and the dog comes along. I thought the two would have made a good movie, but they have not even become friends until the end. This is a movie for the most immature people. There are diapers, farts, canines and bathroom humor. Only someone under the age of twelve would find this super hilarious. I hope that when I have a child, he will be exactly like Junior.
