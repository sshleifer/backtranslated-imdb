Right on the Colmyster. I totally agree with all your feelings and I add them. I came to my PC especially to post a comment about this terrible Bgrade movie (less). I was going to say that nowadays I'm lost in understanding how anyone could make such a bad movie - but you beat me to it. Anyone who reads this and Colmyster's comment, trust me ---- DO NOT waste your time and money. It's an absolute shock. The acting is totally pathetic, the script is much worse, and the (so-called) special effects are a joke. Surely nobody really invested money to make this movie? I really can not think of anything else to say about this product called sci-fi horror, but I must fill this comment to make 10 comment lines to be accepted for submission.
