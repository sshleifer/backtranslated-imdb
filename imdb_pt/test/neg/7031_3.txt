Have we all seen the same movie ??? I can not believe the raves that some of the others are giving to this really horrible biography which, believe it or not, was authorized by Shirley Temple herself, based on her book STAR CHILD. It gives me the feeling that some are very easy to please. First of all, ASHLEY ROSE ORR, whatever her modest talents, in any way shape or even resemble Shirley Temple enough to be scaled like her in this kind of simple star child biography most famous in the world. She gives no indication of why or how this child was so revered except for trying her best to make an imitation of Shirley who never clicks on any level. None. <br /> <br /> And that's the biggest drawback of the whole play. But as if that were not bad enough, any drama inherent in Shirley's story about her rise to stardom at night was completely washed down with a bland writing spiced with occasional moments of music and dance that did not even come close to what Shirley did. for example, "The Bacalhau Ball" with Buddy Ebsen, which was probably the highlight of Shirley's dance choreography. <br /> <br /> Simply putting a girl in a polka dot dress does not make her Shirley Temple. None of Shirley's marks of charm, sympathy, and appeal is even remotely suggested. All we see on display is a pale imitation of the original proof, once and for all, that there was only one Shirley Temple. <br /> <br /> It's not worth writing more about this mess. None of the others is more than common in lifeless papers. My advice to Shirley fans is to read her book - or better yet - to watch her movies. <br /> <br /> These are the pits.
