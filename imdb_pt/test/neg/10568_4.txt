I was more entertained to see my wife almost ripping her hair out in frustration for most of the movie. I thought something that would bind everything would be around the corner of the milk barn at any minute. So I cheated, picked up the remote, and was relieved to discover that it was ending in a mere 20 minutes. I should have turned the channel. Cute, had potential, but hey!
