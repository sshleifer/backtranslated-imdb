While this is definitely a well-crafted piece of filmmaking, it's completely worthless entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you are already depressed, this movie will send you to the other side. <br /> <br /> If you are feeling a little depressed, this movie will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter. You will feel that it is only your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that ends up being a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you may be able to go through this unscathed movie (I do not, knowing your life is way better than Jim's. <br /> <br /> Then again, you may think you've been fooling yourself and that, in fact, is in a much worse situation than you had ever realized.You may feel a little annoyed with Jim for bringing this to your attention.You may want to slap him with a wet fish. The sad truth is that as much as I wanted to like this movie ... I hated it. It took a long and miserable road down the path of oblivion, and then suddenly, for no reason, it looked back and then Jim does not have an epiphany, at least not one that is transmitted on the screen. <br /> <br /> Jim has a miserable life and a miserable set of options. <br /> <br /> He does not discover anything to relate to and does not can make any significant progress in his journey of self-discovery. ro that no one alive could write a happy ending to this movie. As others have said, it's not a Hollywood tale, it's hard and it's real. It is well done. Life is a struggle sometimes. If anyone knew "the answer," they would do well to shout from the rooftops. <br /> <br /> Still, I feel cheated because this movie pretends to have something to say. You feel that you will say something, that if you suffer for a little more, you will have something to say. It will make you stop and think. <br /> <br /> No. <br /> <br /> Again, I submit that this is a well worked movie. And therefore, it may be of value to a film student with a penchant for, and. techniques of using color palettes. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, it's totally impossible.
