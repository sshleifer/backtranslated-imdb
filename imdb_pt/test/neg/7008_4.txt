The female cast of this film is fantastic: you have Linda Blair (matured well), Julie Strain (who does not talk too much - that's fine), Rochelle Swanson (equally convincing as an innocent sweet or a girl possessed by evil), Toni Naples , and the most beautiful of all IMO, the simply stunning Kristina Ducati (as the male goofy, Larry Poindexter, deserved to get sexually involved with any of these women remains a mystery). However, aside from the chance to watch these beautiful and, in some cases, talented women, the film has little to offer. The plot is disarticulated and does not function until the last 15 minutes; and when Wynorski finally manages to create some suspense, a ridiculous ending of "twist" comes and ruins everything.
