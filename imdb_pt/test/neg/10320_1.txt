I saw this remastered on DVD. He had a great picture of Sandra and said, "Starring Sandra ..." and made it seem like she had a big part in it. Not so. She's barely at it. She does what she can with the script, but that's not much. <br /> <br /> The sound was horrible. By that I mean that things did not go together. The shots would be fired and the number of shots would not match the sound. People talking in a car while it is moving and the shot is from outside the windshield, but there is no engine noise, road noise or any other sound. Kind of weird. <br /> <br /> The score was horrible. It looked like the same few notes over and over again. Really horrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> Act was horrible, I could not believe any of it. The fight scenes were like a Batman comic strip without the "BIFF" and "BAM". They were really lame. The shooting scenes, I mean with guns, were laughable, literally. I went forward quickly through this movie. Even so, it was very long.
