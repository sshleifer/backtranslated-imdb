Quite simply, it's all syndicated episodes and NOT the original uncut / unedited NBC episodes. It is NOT the first full season, all eps are edited to suit the 21:00 for the organization, which means that the jokes are cut, an additional commercial fade is included, all introductions of Harvey Korman are not here .. very poorly made! What a shame of a series that I was hoping .... booooooooooooooooo! If you are a true fan Mama, do not buy this and go to http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/main/help/whv/customer_service.jsp and send comments on why we are unhappy in this butcher work for a classic comedy !
