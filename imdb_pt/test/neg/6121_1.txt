This movie was a waste of time. Looks good, pretty settings, well acted, looks serious and seems to be taking you somewhere to stay tuned for a meaningful return. This doesn `t happen. <br /> <br /> Surprised me that so much effort could be put into a movie, it was clearly very professionally done, and have a result that looks nothing less than a movie. <br /> <br /> Save your precious time and see a good French movie like Les Visiteurs (funny), Jean de Florette or Manon of the Spring. I can not remember the language in Europe Europe, but this is another great movie - heavy but worth seeing. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to promise a lot, but offers nothing.
