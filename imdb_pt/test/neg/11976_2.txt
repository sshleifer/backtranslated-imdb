Completely overlooking the entire cinematic adaptation of a video game, this is another terrible film by Mr. Boll. As he continues to be hired to make movies is a constant surprise for me and obviously most of the film goes to the community. <br /> <br /> As a whole, I will say that this attempt was a bit better than many of his previous films. attempts. Some of the dialogues were half decent in Far Cry, although he still uses a few sentences and in some cases he does not even use the sentences correctly. <br /> <br /> Now, in addition to the fact that Jack Carver was supposed to be American rather than German, Til was still fun in that role. An exception are the ridiculously ridiculous lines he uses to go to bed with the girl. And should we believe she's ready to have sex with him so casually after such minimal dialogue? Emile? Just there for comic relief I'm right and still lame. Jack's character seems old and tired but is still capable of the extreme stunts needed to avoid one of the altered super soldiers in the lab. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this for the adaptation of Far Cry. But you can lose an hour and a half watching if you have nothing better to do.
