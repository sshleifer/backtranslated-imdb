The final frames of the original "American Graffiti" provide summaries of a line of the fates of the four central male characters of the film. Although a bit sexist in omitting the female characters, the end of the original movie provided all the information about those people that even the most ardent fan of the movie would want. However, someone felt that mega-bucks could be made detailing the shadowy lives of these characters after the original movie ends. Bad move. Making an insurance salesman and his wife, a private nerd in Vietnam, a drag race driver and a hippie grown up in interesting characters in interesting situations was far beyond the talents of those who wrote this almost endless movie. While most of the original cast is back, with only Richard Dreyfuss having the good sense to stay away, "More American Graffiti" is a mess of silly situations involving protests, car races, country singers and the Vietnam War. The use of split screens, once thought to be innovative and bold, is used too much here to distract and add confusion to the already confused events. This is a sequel that demonstrates almost everything that can go wrong with a sequel. Maybe it should be shown in film schools as a lesson. Even the use of period music, which was a delight in the original, is poorly done here. If you want more "American Graffiti", see the original twice.
