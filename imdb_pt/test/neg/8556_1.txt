How can some of you call this advertisement a family movie? This is nothing more than a PC, insensitive insult to churchgoers in small towns. The film portrays a woman as the great white savior of a small Midwestern town, and all the city's inhabitants (mostly men) are just damsels in distress, incapable of honor, who can not defend themselves and depend on the main character for redemption. This film is just a case of love that the producer has with some undisciplined, arrogant and aggressive squirt he hopes the public admires. <br /> <br /> The person who made this movie probably spent his entire life in a movie. was a candidate-sensitive church, and had the freedom to dump garbage on small church members like eccentric lunatics and not most. The same people who donate money to the Salvation Army at Christmas time, collecting donations to help missionaries, the poor and the homeless, singing, accompanying and making friends with one another. What is wrong with this humble group that offends these Pharisaic traitors? Most Christians in this world walk in front of a train and give their lives for anyone in trouble, even if they disagree with them. Most Christians would not mind if the pastor, or some church worker, from a church took off his coat (or outer jacket). They would not condemn her. This movie is ridiculous!
