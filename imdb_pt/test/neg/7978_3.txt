Geesh, never, ever, ever thought I'd write the four words above. But, in fact, she's the highlight of this little movie. <br /> <br /> How the movie was packaged when I rented it is supposed to be a comedy about a girl who is kidnapped, but does not have her medication, which keeps her stable. It felt like a cute concept. For years, all we saw of Spelling was Donna Martin in 90210 and an endless parade of monotonous and lifeless TV movies. It seemed like a chance for her to stretch out a bit, and considering that with her TV success and her rich dad, she could not have any financial reason to make this movie, I realized she was taking the role because this should be a budget gem . <br /> <br /> Wrong. <br /> <br /> Instead, Spelling's part is small, and the part about the mentally unbalanced kidnapping victim is just one of several stories. When it's not on screen, the movie crawls so much that I could swear it was longer than the 85 minutes that were listed on tape. That would have worked much better if Spelling's story had dominated, and this had been turned into a romantic comedy with her and Phil, the less annoying hijacker.
