I recently found this movie on one of my husband's VHS tapes (the blank variety he uses to record things from television). The film seems to have been aired last time in the '80s and I do not remember seeing it ever since. It was not (to my knowledge) released on DVD or VHS, although I look for a copy. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of three young people: two girls, one on the verge of puberty. and the other much younger, and a boy who lives with his mother's brother and his young, dumb Irish wife. His wife also has two brothers who live with them. The children's uncle is an unpleasant control freak that forces his young wife to wear a silver collar as she watches a puppet show put by him and his brothers in his toy store. <br /> <br /> The older girl and one of the Irish (the younger ones) develop a love for each other while living in the same house. The girl helps her aunt in the store while her brother helps her uncle do things in the workshop. <br /> <br /> There are many very disturbing elements in the film. There is the treatment of his wife's uncle as a sort of (literally) stupid possession (illustrated by the collar) while the Irish have fun dancing, drinking and some forbidden love. Curiously though, I have seen much more explicit themes in other Hollywood movies today. <br /> <br /> It makes you wonder if the British film industry and the BBC have some kind of hidden agenda going on. Still, although it is not a children's film, there are many playful and magical moments and the Irishman makes beautiful paintings.
