If you came here, it's because you've seen this movie and been curious about what others had to say about it. <br /> <br /> I feel for you, I * really * do. And I apologize profusely as a Canadian (because that's what we do) that this movie already had to cross your eyes, if only for a moment. I have heard that there is no cure for retinal bleeding in every dozen cases. <br /> <br /> I, like everyone else, rented this movie believing it to be an idiot Blade movie. I thought, "Surely I could use a good laugh in a stupid movie." I will give the creators of this film a positive comment on their 'creation': Thank you for removing the REC XX / XX / XX from the bottom right corner of the screen. I can see how that would have been a distraction from watching this movie. <br /> <br /> And for the record, I * saw * the movie, but did not watch. The dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes happened in my grandmother's trailer, I swear to God. <br /> <br /> You know what? I'm not writing about it anymore. It is very painful.
