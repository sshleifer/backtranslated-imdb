It was funny because the whole thing was so unreal, I mean, how would a pop star appear in a public school and fall in love with the girl who is obsessed with him? Let's go guys! <br /> <br /> Everyone, except the lead girl, was completely awful at acting. The dialogue was tacky, the premise was stupid and camera work was poorly done. I felt like I was watching a poorly made home video. <br /> <br /> I feel like I've wasted almost 2 hours of my life that I will never go back. <br /> <br /> I have nothing else to say except that I'd rather punch my face several times than watch this movie again.
