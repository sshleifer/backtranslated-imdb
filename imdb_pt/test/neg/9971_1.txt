One of the most annoying movies I've ever seen. Three immature young men have sex and talk very little except "love" for each other. They do not seem to be interested in much, but in each other, and only passively. I felt left out. Most of the outer scenes happen at night, so you can not even enjoy the well-lit landscapes of Paris! I gave up after an hour and ten minutes.
