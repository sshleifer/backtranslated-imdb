What a waste of precious time! My 5 year old daughter brought this house from my mother's house and we watched it as a family. None of us liked it. This little miserable movie, filled with glaring inconsistencies, Christian themes and horrible movie quality, is not worth watching even in a challenge. It felt a bit like a bad attempt at a high school drama class. How sad it is to see talented actors (Chris Atkins, Gary Busey and company) stumble across this trivial and insipid story. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the dog is cute. The movie may have gone straight to the pound. Avoid this movie - your time is best spent watching dry ink.
