The director was probably still in his early stages of learning when he tried to use westerns. Take a look at the clothes. Everyone looks very clean, well brushed, well dressed and well treated as if they were ready for church. Even the horses look neat and bright. This is a WESTERN, to shout out loud! It should look dusty, unpleasant and sweaty. And then there is the amateur acting of the females in this bird. The whole lot, a dozen or more, all handsome and well endowed, were newly raped and widowed, but hardly a tear flows. Instead, everyone looks with great interest (if not downright lust) to the seven magnificent newcomers who subsequently feed, bandage, and console with love during their battles with the bad guys. The same criticism is directed at Lee van Cleef, who does a good job of good quality. Our Lee, playing the law, just lost his dear wife. But Lee, hard as organic rock, shows no emotion and finds himself within days of his wife's death in the arms of a succulent widow with whom he, along with his litter, walks into the future. The cad. And then there's something else that always bothers me about this kind of movie: no matter how many dynamite-induced blasts happen in the middle of a pack of 50 horses, no matter how many shots are being fired at on them, only bad guys are dead and cowards always rejoice in one play. (I know ... moi silo ... it's just a movie ...). Not the worst of all time, but get ready for a serious yawn.
