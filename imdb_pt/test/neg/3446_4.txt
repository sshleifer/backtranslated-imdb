I like watching Robert Forster. That was the main reason why I rented this movie. I also wanted to see a story in the middle of nowhere where the characters could work with each other quite well without distractions. <br /> <br /> Unfortunitaly I found the movie boring. I could not be interested in the characters. I could not interest myself in the story that seemed to meander anywhere. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie for an hour, I turned it off. I'll rate the film 4 out of 10. That falls well below the mandatory rating of 7 that makes a movie worth watching.
