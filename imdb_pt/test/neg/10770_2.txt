I do not know why they kept the name. How could they call the series "The Scarlet Pimpernel" after they strayed so far from the novels, I would not have a clue. The names of the characters are the only things they kept, and yet they changed some of them and mixed them up, and changed Percy's relationship with them. Of course, I only watched about two hours at most, but that was enough for me to realize that the series was nothing like Baroness Orzcy had portrayed his characters, and would probably have rolled into his grave when filming and aeration. Poor girl. Hopefully, when the next person wants to make a movie / book series, do not ruin it as completely as this series did.
