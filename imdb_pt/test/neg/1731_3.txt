My summary refers to the fact that this film has 1479 votes - only 21 less than making it eligible to be on the infamous Bottom 100 list of IMDb - the top 100 rated movies on the site. With an insignificant score of only 1.8, that would put the film at about 38-46 on the list - talk about a very dubious achievement !! My score of 3 is not that bad - but it brings the film much closer to the list. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it stars Aaron Carter, who was once cute-another pre-packaged and forgettable pop star of the 1990s. When he first stepped in, he was a handsome kid with some songs that attracted pre-teens and tweeners on Radio Disney. Their music, looks and image were scrupulously prepared and crafted by marketers and did the trick - leading to some great album sales. Unfortunately, in 2005, sales were declining and Carter had reached his strangest phase of life - something that ALL kids his age have to deal with eventually. To be frank, he is no longer handsome in this movie and is in a very difficult stage of life. I suppose he's a gorgeous young man now ... but in "Popstar" he's not the beating heart anymore. Here, it is just too normal ... a death sentence for a child in his position as a "pop sensation." <br /> <br /> Curiously, the film has some appearances from some other former teen heart-pushers. of the last few decades - including roles for David Cassidy and Leif Garrett - two guys who also know how to disappear from the limelight. Cassidy managed to pick up the pieces and make a niche for himself, while Garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life after stardom has been a joke. I expect Carter to take after Cassidy in the future and so far, fortunately, he has managed to avoid the negative publicity and court appearances of many former pop idols. I was far from enthusiastic about the film, but I seriously wish you the best in this department. It is not his fault that it was stamped on all the radio and television throughout the early to mid-1990s. In this film, Carter does not exactly have to struggle - he plays a pop star. However, despite making millions and being adored by girls, he does not "have it all". He is quite dense - mainly because he has little interest in learning. The problem is so bad that his mother decides not to take him home anymore - forcing him to go to public school. The problem, however, is that he's a little phobic in doing tests ... and making the grade in school is difficult. So he has the idea of ​​finding a smart girl to this day - one who would naturally be forced to help him in school. He chooses Jane (Alana Austin), who is cute but naive, and pretends to really like her in a sad attempt to make this scheme work. <br /> <br /> This plot, by the way, is not bad and could work even though it looks a lot like an episode of a show like "The Brady Bunch" or a Nickelodeon show. Of course, it is predictable and you KNOW that the formula will mean that she will eventually learn your plot and get hurt And he will eventually realize that he really cares for her And at the end of the movie, everything will be forgiven and they Be a real couple. But given the good acting and competent direction, this may be worth to your adolescent fans, since predictable is not always bad. And, as it turned out, this is NOT exactly where the plot was ... but it was very close. <br /> <br /> There are some good things that I liked about the movie. Seeing Tom Bosley and Stella Stevens playing Jane's grandparents was very good - their role was very sweet and it was good to see them again. In addition, the 70's made for TV star Andrew Stevens appeared in the movie - it was nice to see him again - although part of me hated him, since he looks so handsome after all these years and I look a bit like mine 45 years ! He did a good job and it was nice to see him in the same movie as his mother (Stella). <br /> <br /> As for Carter, with his many previous experiences on TV, he was, not surprisingly, very good. . Although his relationship with Jane did not seem very convincing, he and Mrs. Austin did their best. The movie was not great, but they tried and I think most of the problems with the movie were in writing - with a better and less stereotyped plot, it could have worked much better. Moreover, the whole angle of "testophobia" seemed quite artificial ... and quite insignificant. Who cares if a million dollar star gets anxious by doing tests at school?! Overall, not a rotten film as the current rating would imply, although there is not much here to attract a wide audience. People who grew up loving Carter will probably like the movie. Older people will probably care less about really young people who have probably never heard of him. For them, there is no nostalgic value in the film. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie ... Leif Garrett giving advice to Aaron. I felt like screaming "do not listen !!" but it did not!
