The summary of a line is actually the final phrase of a very old joke that begins "what is a Jewish porn movie?" <br /> <br /> Although this movie had its interesting moments, it was too slow and did not do enough to explain to those of us in the audience unfamiliar with orthodox Jewish costume, exactly what was happening and why? How many people who knew this movie would know that the bathtub in which the female characters were washing is actually called "Mikveh", which is a ritual bath used to cleanse spiritual impurity? The same question could be asked about why the bride walked around the groom a staggering number of times while her face was covered just before the wedding vows were fulfilled. These two examples are just two of a large number of those moments that have remained completely unexplained to the uninitiated audience. <br /> <br /> This film has its touching moments along with expressions of great love and emotions. The characters are presented very authentically, up to the number of outfits that an ultra-Orthodox Jewish man should wear, as well as the religious rituals to which he must devote himself to waking up in the morning to start his day. Orthodox Judaism's attitudes toward women in general and wives in particular are intriguing and sometimes maddening. This is another reason why more explanations are necessary for this story to be understood in context. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to people who are familiar with Orthodox Jewish tradition and ritual, as well as with those who might be interested. to take a peek at what is the life of people who practice this way of life. <br /> <br /> The story itself about two sisters who, in their own way, rebel against the "system" is of moderate interest. best.
