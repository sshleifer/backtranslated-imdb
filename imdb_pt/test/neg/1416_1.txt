How can you make such a bad movie with these actors? Were they forced into it? The plot has nothing to do with an idea of ​​how things would turn out if a comedian ran for president. They do not even try to give an impression of this. Just when you thought you were watching a comment from famous liberals about DC politics (the first five minutes), the movie gets off the road and enters the drama about 1) a computer voting error, 2) want to cover up the lines the least original in history, and 3) a neurotic programmer, but extremely beautiful, who tries to tell the future president about it. She is soon the victim of the evil bosses of the computer company who, instead of killing her, drug her to make her appear untrustworthy. But when she comes to DC, she does not tell him. In fact, the film shifts from the B-movie drama to the drama-movie-love-B idiot. So far, we are so far from the original starting point of the film that most people turn it off. I almost did. If only it could have been SMART love drama, but no! It is not! It's the kind of "oops I'm so nervous that I'm being stupid all the time, so please love me for it" kind of love drama. Everything with a slow and slow pace, which has nothing to do with the political plot of the film, the plot of the X-files of the film or the comic plot of the film. All plots fail at all levels, than any kind of meaningless dialogue reminds you. The love part has to be the result of deciding during a drunken "Hey, there has to be a love dynamic between the presidential candidate and the extremely beautiful female programmer, yes, that will work! Lewis Black is castrated and put on a role where he does not come with a single Lewis Black line. Lewis Black's anger is replaced by a hope that it will appear at some point in the movie, which never happens. And Christopher Walken is thrown into a hospital with heart problems, to duplicate the dramatic effect of the heart attack on the President's closest aid in Westwing. Watching Christopher Walken being castrated as Lewis Black in roles that constantly strive to sound casual and Westwing-ish, but fail as Titanic every time, is like seeing a great blue whale dying on a beach. Disappoint. <br /> <br /> And then, get to the bottom of the whole film: This raises the ethical question, enormously difficult and disconcerting: Robin Williams should be president, knowing that he was elected because of a computer. failure? The American dream and all the good prevails when he turns the presidency on live TV, as Lassie the dog would. With the usual Patriotic Glamor of the Presidency and the atmosphere of us we are so clever that we are making history, which Westwing has grown in abhorrent abundance for millions of years. <br /> <br /> Director and screenwriter, Barry Levinson, is now on my personal list of screenwriters and directors of which I am staying forever. This film should be seen as a symptom of a defective production process, in which people (including Barry Levinson) spend money on production because of their personal relationships and not their abilities. This is a project designed to satisfy the desire of the unskilled people to succeed in their careers, and the great actors mentioned above have been brought in to participate. That is the only explanation that can be. <br /> <br /> PS: The voting error on computers was due to the double letters in Dobbs, Kellogs and Mills. Of course it was, what else could it be when you write a screenplay and can not tell a computer from a dishwasher.
