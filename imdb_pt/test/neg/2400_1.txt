The filmmakers forgot to connect the dots - that is, the sequence of events and choices that led from Charlie Wilson and the anti-Soviet mujaheddin to Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden and finally to September 11. Of course the filmmakers do not tell us the story behind - why the Soviets in Afghanistan? - but this omission is nothing compared to the failure to disclose this support to Islamic extremists in Afghanistan in the name of radical anti-communism. strengthened the hand of anti-Western forces and was a major contributor to the mess we are in today (September 11, terrorist networks, a protracted land war in Afghanistan, etc.). As these consequences are not made explicit, the film leaves the viewer with sympathy for Mr. Wilson (hey, check out his latest projects on the Internet) rather than seeing him as an individual whose actions were contrary to the best interests of his country and the West as a whole.
