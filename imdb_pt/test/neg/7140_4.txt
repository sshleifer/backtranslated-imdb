In Pasadena, Ms. Davis (Joanna Cassidy) sends her daughter Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) to Tokyo to bring her sister Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who is hospitalized after surviving a fire, USA. After the meeting, Karen dies and Aubrey decides to investigate what happened to her and is cursing in the same situation, being chased by the ghost of the house. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, the three schoolmates Allison (Arielle Kebbel), Vanessa (Teresa Palmer) and Miyuki (Misako Uno) visit the famous haunted house and are also cursed and persecuted by the ghost. In Chicago, Trish (Jennifer Beals) moves into the apartment of her boyfriend Bill (Christopher Cousins), who lives with her children, teenage Lacey (Sarah Roehmer) and boy Jake (Matthew Knight). In the next door, strange things happen to the neighbor. <br /> <br /> "The Grudge 2" has a scary sound and visual effects, with the scary woman and boy, and I got scared a few times while watching the movie. However, the complex script with three subplots is totally confusing, making the intertwined story a complete mess. There are many characters and situations, and at one point I was completely lost with the disconnected and fragmented narrative. In the end, I was completely disappointed with this confusing but also scary movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Grito 2" ("O Grito 2")
