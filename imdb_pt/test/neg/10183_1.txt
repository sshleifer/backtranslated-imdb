I went through this movie while surfing the canal and it seemed to be another badly made Christian movie about The End Times (which I find quite amusing because they take themselves so seriously). To be fair, I only saw the last 30 minutes, so I missed the part about UFOs and the stuff of science fiction. But it was long enough for me to categorize it as an embarrassing and terrifying representation of the Christian faith, as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sense. Like a movie, the script was terrible, the acting was mediocre and the pace was bad. The cinematography and the direction were insignificant: no interesting visual, no layered plot, no creativity. Do not just blame the budget - movies can still be interesting without special effects. That was not it. Christian movies can not excuse their mediocrity and lack of originality in the artistic sphere just because of their message. And the message here was hardly "Christian." <br /> <br /> Disclaimer: The rest of this comment is directed at Christians. <br /> <br /> First, it is unethical in any business to bait-and-switch their clients. I do not like being told that I can win a free iPod just to realize that I have to spend $ 300 on participating stores first. Non-Christians do not like being told they're watching a sci-fi movie, and then they're bombarded with Christian propaganda that has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. The hidden agendas do not win him any friends, much less converted. <br /> <br /> Second, you should not use explicit threats to convince people that your beliefs are true. The actors who represented the Christians emerged as presumptuous bullies when they dealt with the skeptical "skeptic" - they even staged the rapture to frighten him into believing him. Representational Dialogue: "Turn to Jesus - OR GO TO HELL!" "Alright, do not believe me, but you'll regret it!" "On the day you die, I can assure you that you will wish that you have paid more attention to these things of Jesus - WHEN YOU ENTER THE BELL OF HELL!" Okay, I may be exaggerating, but it certainly came out the same way. If you think this is a "clear message to Christ," you are wrong. I do not remember Jesus using threats and coercion. And I do not think people can make an authentic decision to believe in him out of fear. So Christians, please do not use this as a "witnessing tool" for your "unsaved" friends. It is heavy, offensive, and inaccurate in portraying a true Christian message. <br /> <br /> Third, theology was bad. In addition to characterizing Jesus as a safe haven from hell, it gave no room for debate or discussion and did not attempt to involve the question of whether UFOs or alien life could exist. Instead, he offered a single answer: "UFOs are the scheme of the devil to deceive people when the rapture happens," which is neither biblical nor widely accepted by most Christians. Because the Bible does not mention UFOs or aliens, you can not use it as a source to draw conclusions one way or the other. The Rapture is not necessarily a widely accepted and solid biblical concept, although today most evangelical Christians seem to believe because of a popular series of books. If you do your research (as many of the supporting reviewers are suggesting), the idea of ​​two coming of Christ (the first as the Rapture) is a relatively new phenomenon in the Church tradition, popularized by some traveling evangelists around the turn of the church. 20th century. Most Orthodox Christians will probably find the message in this film a long stretch that is based on many unsupported assumptions. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is not as good as a piece of worthwhile entertainment. an accurate representation of Christianity and its beliefs. I would not recommend this.
