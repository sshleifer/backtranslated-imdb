It sounded so promising at the Rental Store, the premise sounded great and I couldnt expect to get home and watch it. It was Apalling the Diologue is terrible, the action is extremely poorly scripted and the plot takes a head fall from the beginning. Gutenberg puts on a pathetic performance, Sean Bean tries his best, but with such a bad script, there was not much he could do. <br /> <br /> This is not even worth watching, even if you can get it for free (borrowed from a friend, for example) No, as you will regret and waste 90 Minuites of your life. <br /> <br /> 0/10
