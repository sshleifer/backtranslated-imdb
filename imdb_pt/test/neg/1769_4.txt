Normally any movie with Steve Railsback in the lead is a good movie. However, this movie does not conform to this view. Lifeforce is a below average movie that is extremely confusing at first (reminds me of Star Trek: TMP) but is able to pick things up a little bit by the end, when London becomes Zombie City. A mess of horror / science fiction that is very difficult to sit in, though the bare spacegirl / vampire is very easy to see. This movie deserves a rating of 4 out of 10.
