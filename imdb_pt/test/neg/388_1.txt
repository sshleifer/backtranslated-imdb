Closet Land is an unpleasant job with superb actors. Nothing more (or less) happens in the film beyond the endless abuse of an attractive woman arrested by a sadistic police officer. The setting is minimalist. This can be considered S & M softcore pornography because the drama is devoid of all landmarks such as time, place and political context. As what happens is cut adrift in a futuristic fantasy environment, abuse becomes purely personal. The pornographic aspects are justified as a warning about the evils of totalitarian rule, but since there is no real context for the torture of this young woman, we are disturbed, but we learn nothing. <br /> <br /> What's the point? What torture exists in the world? Is abusing prisoners bad? What dictatorships abuse innocent people? We already know that. Closet Land has echoes of works such as Darkness At Noon and Ionesco's Rhino, but both works were done by competent artists whose work had historical context and depth of meaning. This work is amateurish and dialogue is exaggerated. Definitely thumbs down.
