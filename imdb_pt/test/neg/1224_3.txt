Lonesome Dove is my second Western favorite only for The Searchers with John Wayne. I watch Lonesome Dove every 6 months and I never get tired of it. I read all of LD's books, although I can not remember much about Comanche Moon. I also craved this mini-series and decided to record on our DVR so we could move forward quickly on commercials. Unfortunately, I made a mistake and did not record the first part, but I decided to watch the other parts and try to catch them. <br /> <br /> There is no one who can compete with Robert Duvall or Tommy Lee Jones, and I was hoping to be disappointed and I was. <br /> <br /> Although there were so many things that did not seem true, the most apparent to me was when Nellie died the day before and Gus was away at Noon, moved to Clara, writing her a letter from Nebraska, saying I was sorry to hear about her death. How in the world could she know the next day in Nebraska? Also, it should be 7 years after their departure and their children seemed to be about 6 to 7 years old, maybe a little younger, but more time passed before they actually moved to Lonesome Dove, and in Lonesome Dove they had been there about 10 years or more before leaving for Montana. When they stopped at Clara in Nebraska, which probably took another 6 months on the trail, the girls seemed to be about 10-13 years old, since they were playing in the backyard as little children. The bills do not add up. <br /> <br /> I agree that the man who played Gus had many of his mannerisms and looked a bit like Gus might look like when he was young. <br /> <br /> I'm also a bit confused about one thing. The white girl they brought back - was she the one they captured when they invaded Austin? They said she had been caught 25 years ago, but if she was captured in Austin, it was only 7 years later when that happened in the movie. Was she caught earlier? I remember seeing a girl in captivity after they invaded the city and do not know if this is the same. If anyone can explain it since I missed Part 1. If she was 25, she would probably be over 40 when she found her since she seemed to be lying flat on the floor. Also, the way they were assaulting her when they caught her, it's hard to believe she would have lived to get married and have indigenous children. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that nothing is worse. than John Voight playing Call in the sequel to Lonesome Dove or Lorraine's unbelievable marriage to Pea Eye following McMurty to Lonesome Dove, which was also never explained. Besides, the way he killed Newt was that I heard a grudge against them making the sequence with John Voight without his approval. <br /> <br /> If anyone can clarify these discrepancies, I would appreciate it.
