KK should keep singing - this whole movie was a big hassle. I can not understand the cruelty of the boys and the romance between Miles and KK - the sex scenes were also not inspired. The end was horrible - unresolved - there must be reason to kill. And all the voyeurism of the boy was strange ... the mother always quarreled with the boy - do not you think he would be a bit Freudian with her? And why did not someone teach KK how to speak inflected rather than monotonous? <br /> <br /> I'm happy to only pay $ 1.00 to rent this. <br /> <br />
