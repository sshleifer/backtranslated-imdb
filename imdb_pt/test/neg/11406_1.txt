Demon Wind is as fun as breaking your legs. It's definitely a horrible example of a movie. So terrible that I do not even consider a movie. I describe more as one thing ... a monstrous thing. One thing that must be stopped at all costs. My friends and I discovered this thing ... buried under a large box of video tapes at my friend's house. It was late at night and we had nothing better to do, so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies (unfortunately we took this one) Well, during the 90 minutes this thing played we ended up laughing so hard we almost vomited. . The thing is literally useless in every sense of the word. It's just an inexpensive, badly done rip-off of Evil Dead. The whole "story" seems to be nothing more than a guy wanting to knock down his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting the demons tear them to shreds. I have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed. I've seen bad horror movies before (Manos, Troll 2, HOBGOBLINS !!!) (shiver) I would have to say that Demon Wind could fight any of these movies in terms of sheer stupidity. Watch only if you like to laugh at stupid movies. <br /> <br /> Curiosity: This movie is like a steroid cockroach! Much like the ouija board, every time we try to get rid of it, it always seems to reappear mysteriously. Kind of scary, huh?
