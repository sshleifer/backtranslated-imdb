Okay, I just turned the channels on and got the DW3. I watched it knowing it would be rubbish .. But as a person who has seen tons of movies, this one is like one of the most purely bad movies I've ever seen ... I'm not joking. It's so bad you have to watch it like a bad accident from which you can not get away. Sometimes these types of movies work, that is, films from Troma ... but watch Martin Balsam and Charles Bronson as if that were painful ... What's even funnier is that I stopped the IMDb to see what other People said it and really scores a 4.1 / 10 ??? I can not believe it's past 1.5! Equally funny is that this is not even the pinnacle of this series ... somehow this garbage guaranteed part 4 and 5? And to complete, the comments of a guy here referenced it as the best of the series and his favorite movie of all time ??? Such statements frighten me with this world!
