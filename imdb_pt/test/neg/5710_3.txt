The only reason I bought the DVD was to satisfy my curiosity about the scene when Liz (Kim Basinger) clings to the music of Joe Cocker: You can leave your hat! That was the best part of the whole movie. Not because the scene was good; just the music. I'm not saying it was a terribly bad movie not so good. Disappointingly! <br /> <br /> Especially when the exploration of male and female sexuality could have been expanded. Instead of expanding the dangerous side of lust, obsession and passion, and where it can lead, it creeps obscurely from one idea to another. For example, when John (played by Rourke) is able to leave her at the top of the Giant Wheel, Liz (Kim Basinger) is not convinced of the bizarre experience, courtesy of John's sense of humor, but less irritated by her sexual exploits involving the always willing Liz; and as one reader mentioned, that for a woman to enjoy sex, she has to experience the dangerous side, it is not convincing. This "dangerous" side is not explored enough in the film and the person has a sense of anti-climax from the point of view that everything could go wrong. The captivity theme makes an appearance many times but it just takes one to the edge of danger and then everything goes well. The film is sending the message that this kind of "foreplay" is FINE! If the film was making an issue about the pitfalls of slavery and, by extension, the ugly ramifications of sadism-masochism, it might have made a good moral argument. Instead, the film awkwardly jumps from one scene of Rourke feeding Basinger and selling it to another. In a movie that could have been good, it falls flat, because it does not expand and broadens the themes that the film is trying to relate; so for me, there is not a plot or a theme just a mixture of ideas.
