I hoped this movie was originally screened before the election. The last chance of CBS to beat Bush. This movie was awful, but I'm still watching. ** Minor Spoiler ** I think CBS received the same people who "provided" the memo to do the semi-cut in half sequence. What's wrong with the plot of the bad boyfriend? Can acting be more artificial or dialogue more like a movie by Ed Wood? Anyone who has come with this script, please do us a favor to stop writing. If you want to see decent B-series disaster movies, see Earthquake, Flood, etc. Avoid this mess of a movie. I suggest that CBS refrain from showing us this crap. Give us CSI reruns. Better acting and more credible.
