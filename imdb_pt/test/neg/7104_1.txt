This movie does not know what it wants to be: is it making fun of action movies in general? Is it satirical? Is it supposed to be a black comedy? This is actually one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Lori Petty is annoying. There, I said what everyone is thinking. It's bad enough that she's such a terrible actress (Route 666, Bates Motel), but she does not even qualify as a mediocre b movie actress. His strident voice, strange mannerisms and a comic bad mood punctuate this movie from beginning to end, until you just want to put your head on a vise and end the pain. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid it. movie at all costs. You'll be glad you did it.
