This movie includes two well-known actors that I've enjoyed watching. There are great actions and every action is felt in the heart. But it makes me think that these two were thrown into a theater / speech class at college for the first time and told someone to act dominating and constricting each other in a room without letting her leave and the woman to be truly innocent and deal with it enough to humiliate the mind to bring the audience to tears for their deliverance. <br /> <br /> The only good part is the acting skills, the plot has the same trick that Hitler's influence and I started to hate the protagonist for it. But all of this could have been done in 15 minutes, in my opinion, so dragging it for over an hour was just pure punishment for everyone who watched it. <br /> <br />
