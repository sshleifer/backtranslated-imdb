Somewhere in the USA, the young Clair manipulates his friends Mic, Billy and John, showing a letter that would be sent by Bob to her and the cowardly group beats Bob and Mic kills him with a piece of wood in the forest. Mic feels sad and decides to tell his mother what he did, but John and Billy threaten him with tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> I believe "The Wind" is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The horrible script is ridiculous, and it is almost impossible to write a resume, since there is no story or plot, only sequences of disconnected scenes. The direction and the amateur performance are incredibly poor and terrible. It's unbelievable how producers invest money in such junk, distributors release that crap around the world and viewers how I buy that DVD. I waited until the last scene because I was curious to see how bad this movie could be and I was impressed, since it is worse than I could imagine in my lower expectations. In the end, I question why the IMDb does not offer zero in the voting system, since garbage really deserves that vote. My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Invisible Force"
