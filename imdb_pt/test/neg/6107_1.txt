The film is a gross misrepresentation of lifestyle and orthodox practice. It will NEVER be a Jewish court that imposes a divorce between couples without children. Although the concept exists in Jewish law, the conditions are too numerous for it to actually happen. Childless couples find it difficult to deal with the lack of children in a community where children are a very important part of life, but nowhere are they "rejected" by their community as depicted in the film. They are treated with extreme sensitivity. In fact, many great rabbis lived their entire lives without children and never considered divorce. <br /> <br /> The depiction of Yosef, a horrible human being, is intended - perhaps unconsciously - to show the behavior of a typical Orthodox. male. In fact, it is as typical as a violent drunken rapist is typical of secular society. Both exist in their own worlds and both are despicable. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that so many people form their opinions about a society based on a FILM (by someone who is personally biased against a community). I have always found that only the orthodox, because of their narrow mentality and island lifestyle, judge all secular people based on the violence and immoral conduct they read in the newspapers or see in the movies.
