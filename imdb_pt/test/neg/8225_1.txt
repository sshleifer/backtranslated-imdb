Garden State should rank among the most planned and pretentious films of all time. The plot is simple, involving a young man coming home after his mother's death and discovering love. But really, the plot is not important. What is important to Zach Braff - writer, director and astro? is that he is able to hang on the plot all the necessary paraphernalia of an "indie" or "artistic" movie. We, therefore, are introduced to endless characters and quirky and quirky scenes that do not exist for plot or character development reasons, but simply to give some artistic credibility to the film (Wes Anderson - or at least Braff expects). Sadly and somewhat surprisingly, Braff not only deceived many in the IMDb, but also some critics who really should have known better. <br /> <br /> Of course, Braff's free use of the quirky does not make Garden State a bad movie. What really makes Garden State stinky is Braff's script. He simply does not have the ability to write to take this film, and the dialogue and characterization are terrible. Braff often has to resort to compelling concepts and symbolism to achieve what he can not achieve through writing. For example, the numbness of Braff's character is shown to us by his indifference to an impending plane crash (this can not be worked out in the plot, and so it has to happen in a dream!), Then he is shown fighting back against his circumstances, screaming in an endless chasm (life = a bottomless abyss, very clever Mr. Braff). These two scenes must be among the most ridiculous and artificial ever seen on a movie screen. On the plus side, acting is acceptable despite the lack of material for the cast to work (with which I mean a screenplay), and I admire Natalie Portman for her efforts as love interest - a character so poorly written and implausible that she is little more than an irrational doll that Braff molds into her fanciful woman. <br /> <br /> Apparently Braff took 3 years to write the screenplay for Garden State (3 years to write such a bad script - he's really inept!). I hope it will take some time before he makes another movie.
