The Women (2008) by Diane English is, unfortunately, a waste of talent. With Annette Benning, Candice Bergen, Bette Midler, Cloris Leachman whom I like and like in everything I've seen, and Meg Ryan, Jada Pinkett Smith, Debra Messing and Eva Mendes, who may not be my favorite actors but who are cool See, how could the movie be boring, predictable, embarrassing, sloppy and just plain bad? It was made by Diane English, who is known as the writer of the hit television series Murphy Brown, and is her first film for which she wrote a screenplay. The film has been a labor of love for the Englishman who has tried for many years to make it happen and I respect that. I even found the scenes with supporting players, Bergen, Leechaman, Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in short but memorable appearances, funny, clever and enjoyable, but overall the movie is a second hand "Sex and the City", which was released a few months earlier. I did not find Sex and the City very good when I saw it, but next to The Women, it was simply brilliant. At least Sex and the City spared us the long, tasteless scene in the hospital delivery room where one of the characters was having a baby and her friends were there supporting her. Poor Debra Messing, what did she do to deserve this nightmare that she was placed and us, the spectators together with her? Movies like "The Women" give all genre, girl movies, a bad name. There is nothing wrong with the genre, but why is it so hard to make a really good comedy about friendships and hardships, how to deal with marriage, motherhood, and prove yourself professionally? All these matters are very important and important to any modern woman. Why make films with the lines, the dialogues and the situations so clich√©s, predictable, not funny and insulting that they will be forgotten once the movie is over? <br /> <br /> After I saw the new movie, I checked out of my local library the original The Women and I really enjoyed it. The story was told much better 70 years ago and kept my interest. The old movie had a real star power.
