I'm just throwing this review to show that I'm not crazy - I really like Wynorski's work - Deathstalker 2, Chopping Mall, Against the Law are fast and very enjoyable - just to prove that I'm not blind, I have to mention this , along with some Shannon Tweed "Body Chemistry 3 or 4 or something," are the crap - I have nothing against prolonged sex sequences, but Julie Strain's breasts are so unnatural looking you can not help but look at them - which may be the desired effect, but I do not like to look at them - and several members of this cast seem depressed or disinterested - The "erotic thriller" was the worst thing to happen to low budget films ever, and thanks to God their day has more-or-less done.
