This movie was so horrible, so boring, so bad - it took a lot of work to do what should have been a sure thing in such a farce. I love Lucille Ball, but she absolutely stinks in that movie. Too old, could not sing, sounded like a truck pouring gravel even when he did not sing - and the biggest sin of all - SHE WAS NOT FUNNY. EVEN A LITTLE. The studio shot in the foot with this, and by ruining what should have been a fabulous version of a fabulous stage musical, some other parts of the body deserve to have been hurt too - or maybe they no longer had those parts. That might explain it. But for Lucy to think she was right in a part that demanded CANTO - well, that's the saddest thing of all. It's a very good thing to know your limitations. Even a legend can not get out of a stink like that and still smell like a rose.
