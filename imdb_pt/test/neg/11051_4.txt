Why Jove, what an unholy mess! Revenge, incestuous love, mechanical struggle, incessant and utterly unnecessary violence, some primitive "music" hammering confused victims, big "surprises" (which actually tend to be as "revealing" as The National Enquirer headlines). Add some shoddy camera moves, pretending to be sleek and creative and you've already impressed the crowds. The utterly undeserved popularity of this film powerfully indicates that the very low-level pop subculture managed not only to achieve in the last few decades but also to impose the dominant taste on a powerless audience. (For deeper insights into human suffering under mental illness, without the vulgar excesses of "Oldboy," I recommend an older Dutch / French film, "The Vanishing.") Well, do not believe There is nothing good to say about this movie. In fact, it exists. The famous (in) scene in which the hero (actually a "hero", an abject father who sleeps with his daughter and tries to obtain oblivion instead of redemption?) Eats a live octopus that benefits greatly from the vivid presence of the best actor in the whole cast: the octopus itself. It is a pity that the poor beast, having been devoured, has not been able to survive his only act in order to obtain another worthless diploma for the "best actor" at the Cannes festival. <br /> <br /> What festival, by the way, between the absurdity of Moore's propaganda and this epitome of useless and somewhat exotic weirdness has become a festival of insipid and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Gloria Mundi!
