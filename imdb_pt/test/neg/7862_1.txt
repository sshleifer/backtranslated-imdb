Curse of the Wolf begins as reluctant Werewolf Dakota (Renee Porada) manages to escape from her 'pack' and to the town where 6 months later she is working at a veterinarian. The rest of Dakota's pack is unhappy and wants her back, her leader Michael (Todd Humes) says she will return to them, but fat Werewolf Franklin (Brian Heffron) picks up her scent and the pack decides to force the issue, (Dennis Carver). "I do not know what to do." Can Dakota save Danny and finally get rid of her Werewolf persecutors? I doubt you care ... <br /> <br /> Executive produced, written and directed by Len Kabasinski, who also had a fairly large role in the movie as Stick, I was afraid to watch Curse of the Wolf since that Kabasinski was the man behind Swamp Zombies (2005), which is certainly one of the worst movies ever made, ever. Unfortunately, my worst fears have been confirmed and we have to say that Curse of the Wolf is a really horrible movie in every way, both conceptually and technically. Curse of the Wolf is the kind of film in which the low budget determines what happens and the script, rather than the script dictate the budget. You get the impression that everything was written and designed to take advantage of the few sets and actors they had, you can almost imagine the creators saying we have some actors, some basic equipment and some local so let's make a movie horror around them . The story is horrible (Michael discovers the location of Dakota looking at a large dog that two women are out walking), the characters are horrible (a big fat guy who vomits a lot), the dialogue is horrible (almost every line in the thing) and there is never any motivation for anything that happens (why is the pack so desperate to get Dakota back?), people do seemingly random things and since the background of director Kabasinski's in martial arts he insists on inserting random batches of gear martial struggling sequences in the plot. No offense, but this is to be a horror movie and not a martial arts movie, is not it? In fact, in addition to the presence of some werewolves, it would be difficult to describe Curse of the Wolf as something approaching a horror movie. With almost two hours of duration it seems it will last forever and is so slow and monotonous that it is not funny. Director Kabasinski was obviously working on a low budget, but making such bad films should be a crime. There is no continuity between the scenes, the fight scenes look horrible and are so poorly staged that it is false and sometimes it is impossible to keep track of what is happening because of the unstable editing and bad camera angles or the fact that sometimes it is so dark I can not see anything. Seriously, there are moments during Curse of the Wolf where the screen is totally black and you can not see anything, I'd hate to have to watch it on a low resolution VHS. The sound is awful too, you can hear the wind and the breeze against the microphone! There are also many other unpleasant and unwanted ambient sounds during almost every scene. Did the production actually have any lighting equipment while doing this? Does not appear. Special effects consist mainly of werewolf masks that look like the kind of thing stores sell on Halloween for kids, basically they look awful. <br /> <br /> Technically, the Wolf Curse is as bad as they come, I'm sorry, because I know this had a low budget but it's really awful to sit back and try to gather some entertainment from. This is the quality of the high school film student, I'm sorry if this sounds impolite, but it's a fact. The acting is, well, you can probably guess, so I'm going to stop here before saying something negative, I mean I've done enough of that and I really do not have any pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> Wolf Curse is terrible, both conceptually and technically, is a real chore to sit on. The Curse of the Wolf is the kind of movie in which, while you watch, time seems to be stopped, it's the kind of movie that lasts almost two hours and looks like two years. One of the worst movies that you or I will probably see, definitely one to avoid.
