Telly Savalas did an acceptable performance (but not better than that) as Pancho Villa, the notorious Mexican villain / revolutionary in this account of Villa's attack on the city of Columbus, New Mexico in 1916. Villa is not really a historical figure that I am very familiar with this, so I will not talk much about the historical details of the film. Like a movie, that's not great, although it has a handful of action and humor here and there. Chuck Connors's performance as Colonel Wilcox, commander of the US Army base near Columbus, seemed a little overdone, and Clint Walker, as Gringo's helper in Villa Scotty, did not do much for me. The film is obviously a low-budget effort of limited technical quality. For a film lasting just over an hour and a half, I must say that this movie was dragged in some places, especially in the last 20 minutes. The invasion of Villa in the United States was an interesting one (although, in the general scheme of things, it is not especially important) the historical sidebar, and probably deserved a better treatment than that. 4/10
