Helen of Troy follows the story of Helen and the outbreak of the Trojan War. This is yet another love story between Helen and Paris, who sinks and falls in love with Helen unaware that she is queen. The film portrays the couple as passionate and wanting nothing more than being together. (Other films and books have different portraits of the characters, but in this one, they are simply losing love.) The movie is very slow in some places, but the battles and the details of the scene are done very well. There are also some good performances. I thought the slave did a particularly good job, and she was one of the most beloved characters. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good adaptation if you can look beyond the slow history in places and look beyond some of the tacky romance and dialogue. In my opinion, a perfect film version of Iliad has not yet been created, but this one is fun and has a few good bits.
