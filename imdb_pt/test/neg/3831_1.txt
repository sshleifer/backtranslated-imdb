I attended the prime minister last night. The film started with a bang (maybe due to pre-premier excitement). The audience laughed for about 15 minutes, so most of us spent the rest of the time battling sleep. This movie can not be compared to _Spinal Tap_ or any other Guest work, unless you mean _Sons of Provo_ is a big mistake. Just fell, died, was painful. The story was nothing, the jokes were bland, even if you were a Mormon and got all the inside jokes, it seemed like a waste of time. There were two redemptive qualities: Kirby's acting was in place! And the songs were very clever (only for a LDS audience). So, my recommendations ... Avoid the movie. And if you're a Mormon, buy the music CD.
