This film promised many, many beautiful and successful actors, but with a plot that had practically nothing to say. So many potentially promising conflicts between family members that could have been developed and elaborated, but everything was discarded and not resolved. There was no story to tell, just a show of acting, technique, beautiful scenes - they were all EMPTY. But again, the acting was excellent, so many of the individual scenes were fun, but as you became increasingly aware of the lack of underlying ideas, even the acting lost its meaning. So, from the promising start, you've become increasingly disappointed with non-history.
