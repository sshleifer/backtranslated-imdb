The acting made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play. The story is full of holes and gaps, and you have no idea what happened. Half the scenes make no sense. There is no notion of character development. The track / soundtrack consists of about three songs, one in particular is played in about 70% of the scenes. I'm glad I only rented the movie and still feel cheated. Avoid this movie at all costs, unless you want to see some decent actors giving horrible performances. It seems that most of the budget was spent on putting some branded actors in this movie less than bad. This movie is tantamount to visiting a strip club, it tries to make you excited and interested, but just as you think something will happen, you are thrown into some unrelated scene and left trying to figure out how you got there.
