If you are a sucker for cheesy movies and are looking to see something you do not need to pay close attention to, this may be worth watching. the story itself is very unrealistic. the dialogue is also not very credible. it is doubtful whether you are related to any of these characters, because none of them are very agreeable. the acting could have been much worse. victoria pratt is visibly out of place with the rest of the cast, as she seems to have a lot of potential and talent as an actress. while not saying much, this is one of the best acting performances I've seen in the spelling of the logs. she seems to be getting better with age. Overall, this extremely melodramatic movie is mediocre at best.
