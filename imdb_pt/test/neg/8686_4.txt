But something seems to be protecting the whereabouts of the ship, as people who knew something about it are being killed. <br /> <br /> I have to agree with those who were under the impression that this would be a horror. feature. Instead, what we ended up with was an 80-year low-income finale in the 1977 deep-motion adventure film 'The Deep', but with a bewildering supernatural background and an injection of mystery. The story is a mild confusion (so many inconsistent angles do not make sense and stimulate an uncomfortable rhythm) and the technical side is clumsy.
