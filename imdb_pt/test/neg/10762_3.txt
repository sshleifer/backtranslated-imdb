Although it is better than most movies made for TV, "Buried Alive" is nothing more than a tale of ordinary revenge. There are so many holes in this story, it makes you wonder why the writers did not go through a series of rewrites. The ending has a good twist, but it's hardly believable. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Jason Leigh's acting is great as always, but Tim Matheson fills the game with a Jack Nicholson story in "The Enlightened One." Do not bother with that.
