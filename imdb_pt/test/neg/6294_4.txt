as I'm sure other people have said that this guy is not a very interesting subject. Of course, our society has a morbid fascination with death, and it's funny to hear him talk about how much he smokes and how much coffee he drinks, but he's giving himself an unworthy mystique. Anyway, the bottom line is that he is a racist idiot using weak methods to try to refute the mountain of evidence of the holocaust, and as such he must be forgotten by time. but Morris is in love with any kind of curiosity, which normally I would not blame him for.
