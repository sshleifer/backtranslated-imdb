1) Men above 25 years who refer to themselves, without irony, as having "game" or being "player" or "baller". Gentlemen, from here, it's a quick descent to star in their own real-life version of "A Night at the Roxbury." <br /> <br /> 2) Saying "The V.I.P." The term "V.I.P." itself is not bad, but when preceded by "The", it instantly becomes part of the Douchebag Dictionary. That's twice as good for whites. <br /> <br /> 3) People who do TV shows based on things they do not know are not cool and then go to the IMDb posing as "fans" (... right ...) of which it is the "United States" (Hey, me too!) to bitterly insult members of their potential audience by inevitably thinking that their program is a drug. At least 1 additional demerit point if they employ any variation on the oh-snap-nice-one-bro's rationale that "If you do not like the program, you obviously can not get laid." <br /> <br /> 4) Mass-sensation of Hip-Hop / R & B Canadian ... a random addition to the list at first glance, but at the end of the day Massari gets the gas face for the simple reason that its particular brand of low-rent American-aping uncool and general douchebaggery Aqua Velva fits with the general sensitivity of "Keys to the VIP" <br /> <br /> 5) Last but not least, "Keys to the VIP " ... for all the above reasons and much more.
