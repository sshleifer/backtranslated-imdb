I tried. God knows I tried to like this Swiss cheese from a movie, but the story was very full of holes, some large enough to drive a horse drawn carriage. The overall performance was uniform and the characters captivated enough that you would regret having died as recently sprayed cockroaches, spreading to die in their own horrifying deaths. Overall, however, was not really too scary. After all, we saw scary figures moving quickly in the background since "The Brood", why when / and was scary, then only briefly. This movie just never solved the basic points of the plot and this is the work of the writer. Of course, you would expect the director to realize that the story did not make sense. Like who was the secret room behind the wardrobe, why the ghost hungry for blood did not die when she received the nails as prescribed by the book they read earlier? Why did the computer say "game over" to Frankie's character, even though he lived? The list goes on and on. I really do not feel comfortable recommending this movie as it makes you feel like you wasted your time and there was not enough reward at truly scary times.
