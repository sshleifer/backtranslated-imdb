I know my resume looks very rough, but this movie has a very limited appeal. The average Joe out there would have a hard time keeping this movie. The entire movie consists of lively loggers doing their jobs and dancing on floating logs. All this is done with very witty and artistic colors, and the film can be great for showing customers in an art museum. However, unless you really like this type of art or a Canadian who loves movies about his homeland, this will probably be almost impossible to end. I have a fairly high tolerance for this kind of thing and even I had to force myself to watch after a few minutes. I can respect the work that has been done, but it is not convincing.
