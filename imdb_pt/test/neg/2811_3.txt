I have not seen any other Antonioni movie and the people who saw this with me agreed that he shares themes and pictures with the rest of his works. Maybe if I had seen other things of him, I would have liked that, knowing what to expect. <br /> <br /> I have seen this as an almost complete failure for many reasons. First of all, the film introduces interesting and profound questions about social relations, feelings, the nature of reality versus fiction, but this is often done in the most awkward way that makes the characters speak as if they were making speeches, rambling on and on, juxtaposing statements rather than dialogues. The writers seem so concerned that we will not understand what they prefer to say, rather than to show. <br /> <br /> Second, the movie has no rhythm, especially in the first half. Not only is it slow. Some slow movies were made with an excellent sense of rhythm and rhythm (El Erice of Innocence's Sur of Victor Erice or Scorsese are examples I like), but for it to be successful it is necessary for us to find the characters so engaging or history so moving we can adapt to it. This does not happen in Beyond the Clouds, where the first episode seems to drag on and on, and the relationship between John Malkovich's "reality" and the "fiction" of love stories is sometimes fluid, abrupt, confusing.
