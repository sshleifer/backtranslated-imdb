What's with this movie? Does Lyne and her writers think that a sadomasochistic film between two Yuppies can bring a feature film? Maybe if it had some comic elements (which it is not, at least intentionally), or there were some extra dramatic elements (which do not exist), or maybe it was hardcore. No, it's just the story of the case; a chronology of a lot of dating with risk classification. Ho-hum, who cares? "Nine weeks" deserves all the indications for the Razzie. You're a loser. <br /> <br /> And by the way, what's with Roger Ebert and his review? Where was your head in 1986?
