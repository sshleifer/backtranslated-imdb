Recap: A group of five young Americans, all that remained of a platoon hit hard during Ardenne's offensive during World War II, managed the mission as an outpost and to look for enemy activities. They are in very bad condition, both physically and mentally, and think they have hit gold when their outpost is in an abandoned mansion but stuffed full of food. But after a while there is some enemy activity, and this is very strange. It is not hostile, but strange. It looks like there's a German squad out there, in equally bad conditions, that wants nothing more than to surrender. <br /> <br /> Comments: Based on a novel and my guess that the novel is much better, but the story does not seem to translate very well for the big screen. In fact, it's a different war movie, much more about mental pressure during wartime than fights and battles. But I can almost feel that scenes that must have been full of suspense, full of uncertainties and unknown elements, end up falling in the film. It is not suspenseful, just different, and in many ways absurd. Often people simply act insanely, and the reasons are not clear or, at best, insinuated. <br /> <br /> So when that mental pressure fails, the main building piece of the whole story, I think the story has dropped. through. It was not good, it was not interesting, it did not keep me in the limit and did not send a message. In fact, he did nothing. <br /> <br /> The cast is interesting, many young actors who have turned into stars early in their careers. The acting is good but not stellar, and some characters also fell in the absurd zone. A lot of this also I feel is due to this story, these characters need the time, space and pace given in a novel, that they can not be given here. And going halfway definitely is not good enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
