STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Missing the Mark *** That Little Among ** Late behind * The Wells <br /> <br /> Based on another of Stephen King's long novels, it happens in the quiet town of Castle Rock, New England (also the name of the film's production company!), where a new antique shop, the owner Needful Things, has opened. The owner and owner, Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) hides, you might say, a diabolical secret. There is an item in your store that everyone in the small town wants - a small initial cash advance is needed, before a much more sinister price is asked. As suspicions, hatred and madness destroy the city, it is up to Police Chief Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) to restore order and save the city from a terrible end ... <br /> <br /> I read the novel of Needful As things earlier this year, and I was eager to watch the movie's adaptation again to compare them (as if it were any contest!) But it was deleted on video and DVD and I could not find anywhere to rent it. So I was happy when I finally found it at a flea market while on a shopping trip ... <br /> <br /> It is one of the cruelest ironies that King's novels are usually the best to read, but when they are adapted to screen nine times out of ten they are complete rubbish, as is the case here. The stuff that makes your books great just does not translate into a movie script very well for some reason. And I suppose there's always the question: why bother watching this when I might be reading the book again? <br /> <br /> I appreciate that some are simply too long (ie, The Stand) to be made into a full screen job with all the situations and characters included, but there is no reason why it can not be included in the book. As a result, many key characters in the book (ie Ace Merrill) are not included and we have a terrible development of characters, which means we do not care about the characters involved, since they are devoid of depth and motivation - by For example, we have a character from the book, Danforth Keaton, who kills his wife to the end, but they did not give us the opportunity to suggest for some reason that he did not get along with her or hated her. no impact when this happens, unlike the book where there was much depth invested and really involved you to find out what happened to the characters involved. All the material in the script to fill in the cracks, if you want, is really stupid and tacky and the typically goofy thing that is included in King's adaptations like that. <br /> <br /> Most of the problems in the film are that it goes as far from the book, but there is also a terrible performance of a cast that obviously can not feel the crazy stuff that is being asked to do. In the 1990s, much of King's work began to skip the cinema and eventually turned into TV / video territory. Rubbish like this should certainly suggest why. **
