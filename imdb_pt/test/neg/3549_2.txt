Ask him not to watch this movie ... It starts with a promise and as he goes on, he longs for the movie to end ... Predictable, no entertainment, lost movie ... Save time and watch the best suspense movies . ... The synopsis sounds good and that's why I watched the movie ... But it was very predictable with nothing to get you started ... No big suspense ... no great direction ... nothing phenomenal with the acting ... avoid this ... low rating ... Nothing to write about this movie so I am filling in the remaining lines of text so you can imagine how much time a waste this movie is ... really angry at how well premise it was and how bad a script was written ...
