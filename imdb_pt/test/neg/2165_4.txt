With Matthias Hues on the cover and only $ 3.00, I had to buy it. I enjoyed a few moments, such as Hawks annoyance with the pleasure droids, but I just watched a lot to see the scenes of Matthias Hues. I particularly enjoyed the showdown at the end. It was a cross between Clint Eastwood's "Good, Bad and Ugly," and "For a few bucks more" (a three-man showdown with a musical pocket watch used as a countdown timer). Besides, there is nothing else I can add. The actors gave good performances (all but the "Assassin Droid", whose performance was nothing out of the comedy), but the film really lacked depth and purpose; is simply not enough to fill an hour and a half of standard film time, so we're stuck with characters wandering aimlessly from one hour to another until the ball starts to roll. For example, the main character returns to the same strip club about 4 times, occupying two-fifths of the film. <br /> <br /> The scenery really lacked depth and creativity, probably due to the budget of the films. I do not think we ever get to see this "perfect city" of New Angeles that was always talked about, actually, when the main characters finally arrived in New Angeles, their set in a factory or warehouse full of pipes and walkways; hardly the kind of "kingdom" in which the owner / creator of an entire city would live. New Angeles's "super-high security" was also always talked about, but only a total of 15, maybe 20 security guards were counted, even when the alarm went off; nor close to Matthias's approach of "at least a hundred men out there." <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of any of the actors in this movie then you may want to watch it simply to "add it to the list". However, if you value 1 and a half hours of your time, or $ 3.00 of your money, you might want to give this a miss.
