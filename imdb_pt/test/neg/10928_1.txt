It seems that the people involved with this movie are filling the urn to increase their audience. The good news that apparently only 18 people saw. I suppose that makes me 19. I have no involvement with the film and I do not know anyone who has done it and I am a longtime IMDb user (check my record of votes and reviews in the last seven years) I promise I am giving an honest and unbiased opinion. It's coming to you from a 30 year old horror fan who also appeared in some low budget movies. <br /> <br /> In addition to some interesting video effects, "Frankensteins Bloody Nightmare" is incoherent, boring and technically flawed beyond any reason. Apparently it was filmed in silent stock and the audio was then dubbed; most of it looks like it was engraved with a can and a piece of rope, anyway. More than three quarters of the dialogue is inaudible. <br /> <br /> I watched this from beginning to end and I have no idea what the story was, or even if there was one. It seems that the director is impressing himself with long panoramic lines from the corners of the table and dead black spaces that do nothing but fill the film. That would be a problem if we were really developing a plot and making a movie that had some sense of rhythm. In this case, however, the rule does not apply. It does not matter how the scenes are filmed, because they do not add up to a story. <br /> <br /> Watching this video is an exercise in futility on all levels. Whatever the people who worked on it are writing and yet are trying to influence the ratings here on IMDb, this is just a bad and tedious thing. <br /> <br /> This is the honest truth. If you are planning on spending your money or time on this, think again. It's easy to find something better because you will not find it much worse. <br /> <br /> And that is the truth impartial and without embellishments.
