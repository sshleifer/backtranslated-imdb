The opening scene prevents me from sorting at absolute zero. I wanted the whole movie to be as brave and real as the introduction. <br /> <br /> In order to enjoy some movies, a lot can be forgiven, (handguns with 60 shots, hero with superhuman powers, all women are beautiful and half naked), but Puuuuleeese this "Assault On My Intelligence 13 "is so unlikely that I'm surprised that the cast appeared for a second day of filming. <br /> <br /> First, how about these guys being cops? Based on stupidity, I think. How do the top female characters justify being half naked in the middle of winter in Detroit or wherever they are? In fact, no character reacts to the elements in this movie. No window, no electricity (which miraculously returns unexplained) during the storm of the century and they are all comfortable like bugs on a rug. What technology exists that disables all cell phones, radios and brain functions. This should be the same power that causes Maria Bella to walk from her poor car with her knee in the snow without jacket and almost no dress.
