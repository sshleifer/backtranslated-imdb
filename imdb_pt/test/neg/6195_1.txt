Ok, I felt that a movie of Mormons, about Mormons, for Mormons would be a disaster waiting to happen, but hardly knew how painful it would be. One little-known fact is that Mormons have always made exceptionally good advertising films. The Church's official film campaign produced rare and enduring gemstones that transcend the Mormon community, including the wonderful short film "Cipher in the Snow," which eventually made the rounds as an educational film in the late 1970s. Neil LaBute's disturbing listener ... However, the success of these films depended largely on the fact that they did not focus on Mormons or any specific Mormon theology. Instead, they choose to focus on a universal theme and deal with it on a basic human level. The "Army of God" abandons any pretext of universality and runs headlong into the empathic and myopic world of the Orthodox. While that may be enough to ward off anyone other than the most devoted Mormon, the incompetence of director Richard Ductcher as a filmmaker and his youthful approach to storytelling are grounds enough to judge the "Army of God" unattainable by almost any standard. <br /> <br /> Dutcher's own awesomely wooden performance sets the tone for your less interesting army of Mormons you'll probably find. Of course, the cast's bad performances are not helped by Dutcher's pathetic script. He should be credited for not avoiding some of the more controversial aspects of the Church, but, as might be expected, he conveniently frames these controversies in a sympathetic light. Nor should it come as a surprise that most of the answers to the darker side of the Church are addressed with little other than faith. At one point, an African-American missionary is reprimanded by a black couple for joining a church that was segregated until 1978 (about ten to twenty years after nearly every congregation in the most degenerate parts of the South had done so). Instead of addressing the racist history of the Church, perhaps the most painful point in Mormon theology that even Church leaders do not espouse, Dutcher's troubled character ponders the murder of Joseph Smith-an obvious and perhaps outrageous allusion to lynching. Cover this milky-milk syrup with jokes about third-grade lepers, passing on as a comic relief and you have a strong defense of the renaissance of silent films. <br /> <br /> If you knew little of the Mormons before watching this movie, avoid them at all costs. If you are Mormon, this movie offers absolutely nothing to be proud of.
