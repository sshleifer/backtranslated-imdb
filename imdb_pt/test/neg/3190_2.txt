I give this piece of Hollywood trash 1 in 10! Seriously! I mean, I like both comedy and the next. I can also just have a stupid comedy and really sit back and laugh about it. But this movie had nothing to laugh with either. <br /> <br /> I like almost every actor in this movie. So I thought about ignoring what many people told me about it (my fault for not listening). I was just mortified at how stupid that script was! Just ridiculous and not even funny. The only funny scenes were the ones everyone saw in the movies when watching other movies or on TV. I was really disappointed and I really wondered why these relatively good actors would read this script and still sign up for it! Bad decision on its parts ... <br /> <br /> ********************* PRINCIPAL SPOILER ********** * ********************** Ok - here's my biggest question about this movie ....... If the characters are looking back on this story from Jewel (Liv Tyler) after the fact ... so how can Paul Reiser have gone to a therapist remembering the past!?!?!?!? He dies in the last scene being crushed by the bin !!!! Can anyone answer me this?!?!?!?!? Major goof on the part of the filmmakers ..... No one noticed that?!?!?!?!?!!
