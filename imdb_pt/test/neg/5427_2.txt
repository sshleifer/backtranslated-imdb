Ughh this movie sucks. The script is stupid and, of course, the chase does not tell Zoey that he does not love her !!! Like all episodes ... I barely ever understood zoey 101 (the show) Also, why the hell does Logan's father act so withdrawn. And it's just about zoey and chasing what happens to the other characters. It's always the same in every episode that Quinn does and invents something gives terribly wrong with the invention and brother zoey always gets involved in it. If you have not yet seen, do not waste an hour seeing this because you will be wasting your time! "This may be interesting for an eight-year-old well, but I imagine anyone older watching this movie. But what can you expect from the nick ???
