* Spoilers ahead, but that does not matter, since I hope you will not see this anyway * If you have planned to see this I have to strongly advise you not to. Because this was one of the most wasted 1Â½ hours I've experienced. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a complete theft of the great movie "Battle Royale". It's as stupid as watching any American TV show like "Cops" or "Candid Camera". <br /> <br /> The plot is totally predictable. One is a pregnant challenger and another is a nurse, anyone who does some logical reasoning understands in the beginning what should happen between them. <br /> <br /> The concept is ripped as mentioned earlier and the film lacks the necessary violence to make this movie enjoyable. I mean, the preggo shoots a guy in the back and has no blood or any trace of the blow on the back. <br /> <br /> I could go on forever without finding anything good about it, so get your money. and get a copy of Battle Royale instead of watching that crap. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10, pity that I could not rate it lower. It almost makes the Scream 3 a masterpiece.
