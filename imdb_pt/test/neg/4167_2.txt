I found the code 46 very disappointing. I thought the concept was good and therefore had great potential as a film, but I discovered that it was not delivered. Code 46 lacked thought and structure and the plot did not flow well. I thought Tim Robbins' character was not well developed, for example. I thought there should have been more information and thought placed on his family life and not having completely ignored it as I felt it was. When they first violated a 46 code, it was suggested that they should not know that they may have been genetically linked, but all the technology was available to them, he took his fingerprint and therefore genetic details when he was investigating the fraud. I always saw myself hoping something happened and the story unfolded, but it never happened. I felt that the film had great potential to be intellectually stimulating, but it turned out to be the opposite. Code 46 tried to be very smart and in the end ended up lacking imagination.I would not recommend this movie to anyone, the only good thing about the movie was that it was relatively short.
