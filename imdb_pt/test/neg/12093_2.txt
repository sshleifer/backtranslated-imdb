I really like Ryan Reynolds and Hope Davis and I really had high hopes of watching this last night on DVD. Mainly as I try to avoid comments until I even notice something and form my own opinion. Big mistake! My 2/10 is for the first segment which actually is actually quite decent and if they had made the movie about the characters in section 1 it may only have gone up above the 5/10 mark. Once they moved to the TV 'reality show' territory stinked the sky high. Ryan Reynolds captured the essence of an actor on the edge wonderfully, but as a gay TV writer and famous game maker / dedicated family man, he was definitely less effective. From the synopsis in the box I expected a flashback thriller along the lines of 'Memento' - unfortunately that's not even close to that movie standard.
