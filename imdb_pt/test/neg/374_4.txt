Although the story is good and portrays what I expected from Sam Elliot, my copy on DVD contained almost unbearable synchronization problems. The dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the lips movement throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I would therefore be very careful to buy any DVD from the movie without checking the problem. <br /> <br /> I would also follow the classifications of the recommended censors, particularly regarding the use of language and drugs. <br /> <br /> This film can become a silent classic thriller and with the above notes I can recommend it to potential viewers.
