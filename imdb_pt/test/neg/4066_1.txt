You have to see it. I could not stop laughing about the stupid things I've seen in this movie, even after the event. There are perhaps a million individual mistakes and stupidity in this movie. The acting is bad. The story is so predictable and flat. The effects are about 50 years old. The supposed thriller is nothing. You will not like the movie, but you will laugh at it and have fun laughing a lot after that. We had so much fun after the movie. Truly. Me and my friend spent a whole 40-minute bus ride talking about this movie, as we saw in the upcoming Oscar winner. Unfortunately we were talking about all those bad things we just saw.
