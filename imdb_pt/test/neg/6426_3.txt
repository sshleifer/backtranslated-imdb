The movie starts well enough. It is a truly terrifying scene as some fugitives fleeing from the law destroy an innocent family living in an isolated cottage killing their mother and father. The young daughter can only escape with the help of a mysterious specter, who kills the two attackers while she covers in a cabinet below. So we reached her 15 years later as a drug-addicted student researching the supernatural, living with her promiscuous aunt and being looked after by a mysterious redhead. She has no real friends, was nearly raped at a party and still has bizarre visions that no one else can see. So, yes, life is great. Things get a lot nicer when she fights with her mother's sister, who is later found dead in a bathtub under suspicious circumstances with 11 recorded on her forehead. Hmm, I wonder who will be the main suspect of the police? This is quickly followed by more deaths, all linked by their relationship with our heroine having been in bad terms with them before her death. Could it be the culprit, or perhaps the explanation could be something more ethereal in nature? Tip: If you think the first, you got the wrong movie from Blockbuster. Go back and get the correct, myopic gimp. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was ready to move on to the good parts, safe in the knowledge that I was missing nothing but a mediocre thriller potboiler. But the first ten minutes grabbed me and I decided to give it a try. I was quite pleasantly surprised: it certainly was not a masterpiece, but the performance was good enough and the script continued to cast intriguing situations from which I hoped to find the solution. Unfortunately, 45 minutes later, I realized that my attention began to wander during a long sequence in which the main character was walking around a library, doing nothing. Then we got a cheap scare, followed by fifteen minutes of talk about the paranormal between her and her new boyfriend. Things only got worse from there when the promising start is thrown out the window, like a little convincing turnaround after another, followed by an anti-climactic end that is like being promised the moon and ending with a tiny meteorite. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> If it were bad all the time, it would have been a lot easier to swallow. The fact that it starts at a gallop and barely ends with a groan is not only disappointing, it is touching. How did something that started so promisingly get so stereotyped? I do not know and I do not particularly care. I'll just give the writer and director a bit of advice for next time: do not spend 5 weeks writing the first part of your screenplay, then 5 minutes finishing the rest. You tend to notice these things in the final product when you treat your project as sloply as you ... 3/10
