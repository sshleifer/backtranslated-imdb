I do not understand what the big hype was about this movie. All the horror sites said that this movie had all the essentials of an "old American slasher" movie that would meet their needs. "Even if this was similar to an old American horror movie, my needs were still not met. <br /> <br /> My big problem with this movie is that we are now in the 2000s, not the 1980s. The horror of 1980 is the past and must remain in the past. Horror movies have changed so much that the older movies now seem extravagant and unrealistic. Even if they are fun to watch, they do not offer the same blood-thirsty blood that recent movies offer. <br /> <br /> Hatchet is corny, unrealistic and horrible. If we wanted to watch an old American horror movie, I could go back to Friday, the 13th series, the Street Night on Elm series, or the Halloween series. I must admit that the movie is better than some of the horror movies being released, but it's among the worst. The jokes are not funny and the actors are horrible. <br /> <br /> I personally stay away from this movie and never look back.
