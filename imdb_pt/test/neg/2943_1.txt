at first I thought it was bad because I had high expectations for this movie, but after thinking a little, this is bad. I was almost on promoting the hk of bad stars in bad movies. The new generation of hk actors and actresses, not to mention malicious writers, is tearing the industry apart. At the moment I'm still trying to figure out how high it is. usually you can not miss in a movie with donnie yen and ekin (forget jackie, he has already passed the peak). but then I should find out when the twins were on the cover. it's cheesy, extravagant, very tacky, I try to laugh at some of the jokes, but not only is the effect minimal, but the jokes are very recycled and not funny. Sorry, I bought the movie. The only reason some people think it is so good is because they are brainwashed into advertising that the twins are cute, and everyone likes them, and that everything they do is good and funny. and that if you like twins then you're up to date ... sigh ... I miss the good days of hk movies when chilli li and stephen's movies dominated the box office ... <Movies from mainland China are much better than this, and they are made for lower budgets.
