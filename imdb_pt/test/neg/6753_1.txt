This movie called is horrible! The actors can not act. There is no plot. I believe they need to start from scratch and shoot again. I hope they can correct the acting flaws in this movie. I'd like to see the trailer after filming again. Maybe there is hope for that. I'm not out to hurt feelings, but I believe high school kids can do a better job. The wardrobe could have been so much better. Sorry, but that just did not do it for me. I usually like the trailers on this site, but ... this one can not find entertainment. I hope they take criticism well because I believe they will receive much more from others in relation to this film.
