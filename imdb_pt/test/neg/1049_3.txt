The Kite Hunt started out as one of those "major" movies that most people flatter because they say they should, if they want to be among the elite, and quickly descend into a stupid movie of absurdly strange proportions. <br /> I've never read the book, and never felt the need because I honestly do not care. Of course I'm called uninformed for saying this, but I really have no interest in just another novel "pull the strings from your heart, copy from every other story line to get readers' excitement," even if it's in Afghanistan. That said, I watched the movie. I heard good things about her beauty, and how touching it was and decided why not? As it turns out, there was a good reason why not. Not only was he called the main character completely unfriendly (I understand, he was young and this is a movie about redemption, but honestly he was horrible. I hated him and not that good "Anti-hero" he was just a boring character , idiotic, selfish I did not feel anything to see), but the rest of the story was so completely absurd that I could not believe how everyone was flattering how cute it was, and how they cried and it moved them. I'm sorry, but I just feel moved by something that looks realistic, Sci-Fi is known to move me, fantasy too ... but this? Please. This has outpaced many other films out of sheer nonsense! My biggest annoyance, Hassan was Amir's brother ... really? Are you sure you did not just pull it off a thousand other stories? Plus that particular detail was not only added to try to draw more tears from your audience (do you know the kind of people looking for reasons to cry during a movie)? I was rolling my eyes when this "turnaround" was revealed, knowing I could only get out of there (not to mention the Star Wars "Amir, Hassan is your brother" "NOOOOO, that's not true, that's IMPOSSIBLE!") Ah , and it certainly happened. Filled to the brim with clich√© and just planning to count stupidly. As "good guy miraculously escapes bad guy against all odds with the help of brave child who despite being cruelly sodomized and having no idea who you are is willing to help with a conveniently placed weapon that holds a special meaning for you" . Ooh and do not forget the oh so dumb "finally get revenge on the kid who joked with you when you were small that, surprise surprised, turned into a psycho adult" (trust me personally, I understand you like to live indirectly through of movies but that's never gonna happen. You know that kid that teased you at school ... he's not a terrorist, he's probably an accountant.) Ah, and I should mention the CGI-tastic kites ! I think they were on the same level as the movies "Matrix" and "Transformers" brave guys! ANGRY! <br /> <br /> It seems like this movie was made just for the western audience that needs a reason to care about the Middle East (Hey a story of overly emotional friendship will work!) This is one of the shallowest movies I had the misfortune to see, it seems so deep ... but when you get to it, it's nothing special. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the core of America's audience will do what they're told and follow the "It's about controversial stuff so it should be good!" way of thinking.
