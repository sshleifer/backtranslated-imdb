I have absolutely no idea why I saw Ali G Indahouse, except that Salon seemed to think it was a crime not to nominate Sacha Baron Cohen for an Emmy for his work on Da Ali G Show. It's a safe bet that I will never watch that show, since there was absolutely nothing funny about the movie. Comedy? Torture was more like that. It was the dumbest thing I ever saw. I admit that I was captivated by Rhona Mitra. I had not seen her in anything. She was not in The Practice for as long as I was watching, so I guess I'll have to check Boston Legal one of those evenings to see how she does something that might be worth watching.
