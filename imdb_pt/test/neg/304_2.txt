I've lost enough time actually watching this task from a movie, I do not want to miss it by writing a major review. Not once did I smile. All the jokes were boring, forced, and lacking any kind of humor. I kept saying "where's the joke?" Almost all the characters were an unpleasant stereotype and all situations were clich√©s and in half the time there was no solution whatsoever. Things happened to get to the next scene. For the life of me I can not understand how this has as many good reviews as it did. If you like clumsy acting and poorly composed movie making Fat Girls is the movie for you.
