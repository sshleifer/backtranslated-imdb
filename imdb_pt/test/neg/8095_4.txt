I mostly rented this movie to see Shannon Elizabeth. She played well in this movie, but the plot sucked. The film was about practically nothing to be single after making a pact when one of Jerry O'Connell's friends gets married. The other friends put the money together and the last one to get married is the money ($ 10,000) of all their friends. Anyway the film just tries to keep doing it ever since and trying to make it funnier than it has since. Good thing I paid only 50 for this movie. It really was not good. I rated **** of 10 stars!
