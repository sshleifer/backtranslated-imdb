Following his role in the fine book SEVEN THIEVES (1960) - which I watched several years ago - Edward G. Robinson seemed to be stuck in the game of types of criminal mentors (in addition to the strange juicy role as The Cincinnati Kid [1965]). I had already seen the good effort of the "Euro-Cult" GRAND SLAM (1967) and, moreover, I have two more similar titles from Italy to test - one of them was directed by the future goremeister Lucio Fulci! Anyway, this is the kind of international production - with American and Italian actors and a British director - that prevailed during the 1960s; is harmless and easy in itself, but hardly memorable and definitely too long - especially since to get funding for the heavy equipment needed for the assault (such as an army tank and an airplane!), the gang involved has to pull a variety The gang, of course, is an incompetent group led by an American (Robert Wagner) and his silly girlfriend (Raquel Welch) - the others are a black 'pacifist', a perennial Italian and hungry and a tiny Englishman. They try to induce a former gangster (Vittorio De Sica) to surrender their fortune to them, except that he is deprived ... but under the auspices of "Professor" Robinson, he proposes a nickname of 5 million dollars in platinum! Needless to say, gang members do not trust each other (Wagner instructs Welch to seduce De Sica to get the name of his fence in Morocco - where they must withdraw after the assault), or otherwise ruin the job (commissioned to hold a restaurant, the Italian can not resist sitting at the table and ordering a multi course meal for himself!). Curiously, in the face of similar failures, De Sica tries to show them how they used to do it in the old days - however, ostensibly holding a gas station, it turns out that the owner is a nephew of him and he simply asked to get it borrowed some money! The central sequence of the assault is typically elaborate: while the gang, including Welch, "catches" the train carrying platinum, Wagner kidnaps pilot Victor Spinetti and his plane. When the work is finished, he intends to cross with De Sica - but neither his partners nor Welch himself are willing to accept it, so he is forced to yield. Coming from the moment the crime failed to pay, the gang tries to lose all of its stock in the air when the doors to the bombing compartment of the plane are accidentally opened ...
