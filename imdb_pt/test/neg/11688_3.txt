What the hell was that? My family and I just lost 2 hours of our lives for this piece of garbage !!! There was no plot, no tension, just bored !!! My kids could make better movies with our camcorder. <br /> <br /> But maybe we did not understand the movie ... oh wait, my mom did. She was the only one who liked the following reason: "At least one movie without cars screaming ..." If you are looking for a war movie without a fight, it is still interesting and exciting and has a strong anti-war message, so you should watch "The Trench". <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 out of 10 because it's good enough for a nap and because I'm really cool ...
