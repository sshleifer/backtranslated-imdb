About the spoiler warning? It is not "can contain", it contains spoilers. Readers, be careful. <br /> <br /> Ok, first I need to know that I'm not attacking the actors. They are just working with what they get. The problem was the script. It was horrendous. There was nothing credible about it. Of course, when you have a movie based on a killer ride, there's going to be a big mistake here and there that puts you in a terrible, film-worthy situation. But these girls just made a stupid decision after a stupid decision. The only girl smart enough to try to call the police was the girl added at the end because he had already killed one and struck another with a car. Talking about hitting her with a car ... why the hell did she try to get away from a truck instead of running to the side like a normal person? Also, the one who wrote the script honestly to believe that the cops are not going to investigate a door covered in blood? Frankly, it was not suspense either. The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration with how retarded the girls were. Well, that speech was a lot longer than I intended for such a bad movie, so I will not bother to play at the end, other than being unrealistic and boring.
