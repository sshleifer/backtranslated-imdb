What about "Dead End Road" ... Let's just say that Edgar Allen Poe would have been so embarrassed. The acting, writing, effects and everything in this movie was horrible. That does not even do it justice! This movie was the biggest piece of crap I ever had to sit on. That's also why I stopped about 20 minutes before the end, because personally I did not care what happened to the characters. I've seen it bad, but this was definitely the worst. I was excited about it because I'm a Poe fan and that was bad. Just bad. <br /> <br /> What bothers me the most is that you can not rate movies with negative numbers.
