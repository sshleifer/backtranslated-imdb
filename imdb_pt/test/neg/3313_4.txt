Stains of white and various shapes, a beautiful naked, random images. This is how this little experimental movie is. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to think how in the early days of the film these images could be transferred to the cinema, but despite my love for many surreal images and movies, and a fascination with the bizarre, this movie did not do that by me. <br /> <br /> I do not regret watching it, but if there is any underlying meaning in it, I do not do not understand. Visually, it is not so remarkable, in my humble opinion. As an example of Dadaism, I suppose it would fit nicely, since it seems to reject any resemblance of logic or reason, though I preferred it to do so in a visually more interesting way. <br /> <br /> But for each one of them.
