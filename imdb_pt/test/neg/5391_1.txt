I, like so many others here, bought this movie at my local WM at "Two for $ 11.00". I love horror movies and science fiction, and this definitely fits into that category. Pretty much what everyone here said is dead. Yes, it was bad, but that was to be expected. The "main" problem I had with this movie is that it was basically basically boring. I mean serious yawn-o-rama. The acting was poor, the costumes (K Mart Skeletor outfit around 1982) were worse, and the assembly was very bad. There is no continuity. Mr. Skeletor finally dies in a kind of explosion ... although he has encountered several explosions during this movement. I think the last one just hurt him. Apparently, earlier encounters with this "military" group ("cough") charged its price ... it would change from red to black throughout this crap fest. Even for a B movie, do yourself a favor and skip it. The only good that now serves me to add to my DVD collection. I hope no one will recognize you when you look in my movie collection. Thumbs down, big time.
