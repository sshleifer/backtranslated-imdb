Low-budget rescue of bloodthirsty cultists in Greece led by Peter Cushing. It is up to Father Donald Pleasance to stop them. Crown International released this crap in 1978, and was "dog of the week" in one of the episodes of Sneak Previews with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. I forgot which of the two "dogged", but I see the point. The low quality movie has the worst performances of Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance I've ever seen. There's a monster in the video box. None of these beasts exist in the movie. Instead, you get a statue, but at least it is atonomically correct. (Woo hoo!) <br /> <br /> Cultists look like the Klu Klux Klowns ... if a group could exist. Skip this.
