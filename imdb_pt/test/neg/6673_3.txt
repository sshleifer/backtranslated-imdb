Czech cinematography is traveling through the dark times ... this film is tangible evidence. Slama obviously wanted to make a mediocre documentary about fictional people, characteristic of his stupidity. A young and healthy boy who does not want to work and prefers to live in a decayed hut with an irresponsible alcoholic aunt. Because of Tonik's idiocy, who is able to announce "Daddy, I'm not going to work in the factory" (I really would like to know WHY); I understand the condition of your "home", but I really can not digest the terrible mess out there. It squeezed sentimentality everywhere. Why did Monika not accompany the boy to work abroad? Young Czech couples do this very often. And take somebody else's children to live in a devastated barn ... that's too much. <br /> <br /> Irresponsible mother (misunderstood by Geislerov√°), naive and stupid boy (Tonik), silly and confused girl (Monika) ... Yes, somebody already said that - misdirected and acted in soap opera. Actors like Martin Huba, Bolek Polivka, Tatiana Wilhelmova and Simona Stasova gave their best, but unfortunately they could not save the whole piece.
