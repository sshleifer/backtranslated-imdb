Well, at least we have to recognize that the great Hollywood horror producers are finally getting smarter and more insightful. Instead of waiting patiently to buy the rights to Asian horror hits and subsequently remake them in the United States, they now found that they could simply hire the Asian directors and designate them to make their new ghost story directly in the states. This is like killing two birds with a stone; way to go guys! "The Messengers" is practically identical to any other supernatural chiller that has left the eastern countries since "Ringu". Approximately translated, this means that it is a boring, overlong and entirely blood-free film, but it presents copious amounts of fake and embarrassingly weak scares "have we scared you already?" moments. The Pang brothers (Danny & Oxide) have previously done the overrated "The Eye" and it is a tradition for them to build a story with clues and tips to a point where it becomes almost impossible to meet the expectations of their inquisitive. audiences, but they do not seem eager to change their formula anytime soon. And they are also unscrupulous enough to recycle the same old phantoms and repetitive topics over and over again. Restless spirits of former inhabitants trapped on the walls of a remote rural farm? The protagonist family torn by unprocessed traumas of the past, so they must first restore faith and trust in one another? Give me some time! Put a videotape and a seven-day curse, why do not you? Even attempts to make you jump on your seat are very déjà-vu and do not scare anyone over the age of 7 years. Beating doors, dirty and gradually bigger growing patches on the walls, ghostly appearances, noises coming from the cellar .. Excessive use of cheap tricks like this is almost becoming insulting to horror fans. "The Messengers" revolves around a family on the road to a new life in the country as the sunflower growers. The family situation is somewhat dysfunctional, as a personal tragedy (which is only revealed at the end of the film) caused the youngest child to stop talking and parents mistrust their revolting teenage daughter. Soon after, the children experience strange presences on the remote farm, but they can not convince their parents to leave. This is basically concludes the entire movie. Little Ben sees things, but he can not speak and Jessica is repeatedly attacked by supernatural forces, but no one listens. The basic premise of "The Messagers" is very derived from Stanley Kubrick's immortal classic "The Shining", just missing the constantly sinister atmosphere and disturbing tone. The script takes itself very seriously, although it is fairly easy to predict the final outcome and the total absence of violence and bloodshed is unforgivable. At least "The Eye" delivered some genuine shocks at the end, while the happy happy happy final joy of "The Messengers" is just pathetic. The only positive things I can think of are the beautiful rural shooting venues, the right editing job and the promising young acting talents (and beauty) Kristen Stewart. And there is a mysterious, but sadly underdeveloped, supporting role for William B. Davis.
