Do not waste your time. The plot drags on, the characters are wooden and uninteresting, the motives of their actions are completely indecipherable. He kept waiting for the "romantic" or "comedy" to take place, and nothing happened. Even worse, the love letter is not romantic, but it looks like it was written by someone desperate to meet a deadline. I mentioned that the "plot twist" that we've seen coming 15 minutes into the movie was "Hollywood Smart", meaning you want to shock but given the Hollywood mentality - it does nothing of the sort, and on the contrary it's vaguely offensive. <br /> <br /> Nor is it worth the $ 2 to rent. Do not bother to see this.
