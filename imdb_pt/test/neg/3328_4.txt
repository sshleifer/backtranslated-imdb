I mean I liked this movie, I really like it, but when it all comes down to it, it was really annoying. It starts to look promising, and even as they enter the mines, the scary atmosphere and the weather are great. The problem is the monster, or the lack of it. As people have said, it's a stop motion monster, but that's not the problem (stop-motion can look great if done correctly). The problem is we do not see enough and we can not see any death. This is to be a horror movie, so the lack of monsters and the lack of deaths equals boredom. There were some scenes I liked, like when a girl is using her camera in the dark and the monster is coming toward her. There are also some other scary scenes, but they are too few to catch your interest and definitely not worth watching. It's a shame, because I can see that if it had been treated correctly, it would have been an effectively scary horror film. The saddest thing is that movies like this will never be made again, because filmmakers are superlaunch their movies nowadays and have bad CGI effects.
