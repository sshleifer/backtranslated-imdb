With such a title, you will be forgiven for thinking that this movie is about the great painter, Goya. Then, after half an hour, you decide it's more about the Roman Catholic Inquisition. With even more latitude, maybe it's just a snapshot of the period. With a dismal characterization, many axes to grind and a lack of consideration for the fact, Milos Forman prepares a colorful, but chaotic, miscellaneous that fails in all three stories. Milos Forman (who lost his Jewish father to the Nazi concentration camps) is the great director who painted the Mozart artist as a clown and went unpunished. Won awards for that, actually. His life in Czechoslovakia gave him a taste of various repulsive regimes, especially communism. He also did the same over-the-top, but quite impressive, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. So, at age 74, how does he come to offer us this mess? In Goya's Ghosts, Goya is one step away from a buffoon. The main character is Brother Lorenzo, with passion for Javier Bardem. Natalie Portman is equally as vibrant as Goya's model Ines (and later in the movie, her own daughter). The tenuous connection with Goya is that he paints them both. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo tortured (and later rapes) Ines, who he suspects is Jewish. Her father tortured Lorenzo. Napoleon runs to free Spain (briefly). Ines leaves the dungeon that the Church has left her and looks for her son. Goya is still painting, but he is deaf. Her main concern seems to be helping Ines. And so on. Historically, Goya was also a historian. As Forman unfortunately abandoned the idea of ​​a biopic of Goya, the painter, could this fact have been used to unite the entire film? a large slice of history, as seen by Goya. But the painter is too tangential to receive any weight. In the same way, a document of the terrors of the Inquisition should be made? in comparison with other despotic orders over time, the Holy See was forgiven with only one confession. Although one might ask if Forman is competent enough to be reliable with a factual account of anything. <br /> <br /> "I thought this could be the heart of a wonderful story," he says in the production notes. "There were many parallels between the communist society in which we live and the Spanish Inquisition." But the story is too faint to hold our attention. Against our expectations and with a backdrop of something greater (the life of a great painter, the horrors of the Inquisition and even the French Revolution), we are invited to feel involved in an invented (or not) passion of Goya. The result is that we feel cheated. <br /> <br /> The background detail is terribly treated. Goya was deaf in 1792 (when the film begins), not 15 years later. Napoleon is as believable as a clipping of a package of cereals. We see the Church handing out a death sentence (when the normal procedure was for the Church to insist that the secular arm did that dirty work). The battles seem overly choreographed and on stage. A splash of bare breasts for free hardly makes up for it. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, production figures are largely good. The colors are vivid, the rhythm excellent (at least until we give up finding an interesting storyline.) Bardem is excellent, and Portman is a joy until she goes crazy like a crazy woman. Although he does not say much about Goya, what he says is good, even superficial and quite irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I once had a drunken conversation late one night when my friends and I were asking each other: if you could choose a director to describe your life, who would it be? On your record, Forman would unfortunately have to be at the bottom of my list.
