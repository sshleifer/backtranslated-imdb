Predator Island begins with six friends Eric (Tom Dahl), Chris (Dan Gordon) along with Heather (Iris McQuillan-Grace), Kim (Iana Baker) and Denise (Melissa Roby) are invited to spend time at Kevin's (Michael Wrann ) father's boat partying in the open sea. What could go wrong with such a sounding idea? Well, for starters, a large green meteorite could collide with the sea near your boat and an alien life force could emerge from it and try to kill all of you, so again, this is just a ridiculously stupid idea, is not it? > Co-edited, written and directed by Steven Castle I thought Predator Island was crap and it's straightforward and straightforward like this really. The script is the worst kind, you know the kind of abomination that is full of highly annoying teen characters who do and say the most stupid things, it's full of cliches and it's totally predictable, it does almost nothing, things just suddenly happen without any accumulation or explanation, is annoying even in just 70 odd minutes and has virtually no entertainment value, not even an unintentional amount of laughter. The film does not really have much of what I would call a plot, there is no explanation as to why or how this alien creature can dominate people's minds or because it can be selective in the sense that at one point the person will be 'normal' to next, when the story calls for it and with no apparent cause, they suddenly turn bright green eyes and a sudden will to become cannibal. There is not enough horror in it, the so-called action scenes are regrettable and I really do not want to waste another second thinking about Predator Island let alone wasting my precious energy by typing those words ... The director Castle does nothing to make this thing watchable and the "special effects" are absolutely terrible, this alien guy would not even get into a 50s science fiction film. The filmmakers even play some blooper recordings on the final credits, but that should be the least funny collection of mistakes of all time, I mean, they can not even understand it right if you understand what I mean! Forget any decent gore, as there is none, there is a bit of cannibalism and some intestines placed in the unfortunate stomach actor so that another unhappy actor can pick them up and pretend to eat them. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 150,000 I have to admit that the filmmakers were working on a seriously low budget, which is still no excuse to make such a poor movie. The whole thing seems very cheap and the acting is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Predator Island sucks, I'm sorry, but that's just how it is and I just can not see what anyone would get out of it. In my humble opinion, this is probably one to avoid.
