Well, the previews seemed funny and I do not usually go to the movies on opening night, especially with my kids, because ... well, you never know. Here's a movie that does not appeal to kids as much as adults, as the jokes are very perverse to kids and become completely empty for adult entertainment purposes. I was really embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year olds and having to explain to my 6 year old what S H * T spells. Essentially, what happens here is a total distortion of Dr. Seuss's classic. It adds a wicked, lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for their money. If that was a subplot, then maybe that would have been fine, but it ends up being the main plot throughout the movie and "the cat" plays a more secondary role in exposing the neighbor to the mother for who he really is. Take my advice and read the book and pass the movie.
