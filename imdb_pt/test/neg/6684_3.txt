First: The recent campaign of this film is a great farce. Judging from the cover, you think this was some kind of scandal movie about Kylie playing a character having sex, taking drugs and whatever. This is just a cheap market scheme. She is evil and does none of the things. The marketing here is unbelievable, and I'm surprised the filmmakers have not objected. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was a big disappointment to me. It looked like an episode of Sunset Beach run sloppily by teenage Quentin Tarantino. And that's not a compliment, remember. <br /> <br /> I think the weakness of the movie is the story. It seems to be about nothing. Just about legal teens stumbling around living 'on the edge'. The characters themselves have some personality, but the film does not use its potential. As I said, there is no history of any substance here. It seems to work out a lot in legal dialogue and ends up looking like a colorful MTV ad. You definitely have this feeling. <br /> <br /> Still, I think some people might like it, but I'd say there are much better movies like that.
