I got half of it, but I was not masochist enough to see it all. The first half of the movie had almost no dialogue! Almost everything was about reviews to take the story. The screenwriter forgot that sometimes less is more and tried to explain several millennia of detailed history in the narration. At the same time, he forgot to do any character development. Most science fiction fans do not require large amounts of character development, but it would be good to know why the two main characters who survived the destruction of the space fleet ended up fighting each other. <br /> <br /> There are some good things going on in the movie. The soundtrack was well made. Some of the computer generated graphics are very good, but others were just mediocre.
