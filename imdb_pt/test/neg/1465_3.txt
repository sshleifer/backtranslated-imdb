I found this on the shelf and fainted with joy !! I danced to the counter, hit my money and ran home! You know what?! I fell asleep less than halfway! I tried again the next day ... YAWN !! What the devil!? !! I could not watch it! I love all the other things he did (I have not seen the monster with the monster yet). What gives? It's me? Or him? So sad. Boo hoo. Q. I liked the work of the camera.
