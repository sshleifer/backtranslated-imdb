I just can not imagine any possible reason why Madsen and Hopper wanted to be in this movie after reading the script. They were blackmailed, perhaps? Or are they really bad? The main problem with the movie is that it's annoying. The conversations between Madsen's character and Hopper are useless, as is the bored talking between two friends while drinking beer on a Saturday night. You never feel for any of the characters (although Madsen's psychotic killer is very nice compared to the other characters). Hopper has always been a good actor, and Madsen does a good job as the serial killer, otherwise the acting is almost laughable. There are about three scenes throughout the movie where something is really going on, each lasting about three minutes. Although the "talk and think about the murder and the nature of the murderers" scenes would have been interesting, if they were scenes in a book. The whole concept would have been interesting to a novel, but a film simply can not have a story with so much inner thought and so little action.
