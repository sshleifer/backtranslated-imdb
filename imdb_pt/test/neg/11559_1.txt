After watching this movie, I could not help but notice the parallels between it and another movie called America 3000. Both were very bad in the mid-1980's after post-apocalyptic celluloid disasters. Obviously fake ensembles, wood actors and stupid monsters are found in both films. About the only difference between the two is that the main villain here (played by Angelika Jager) has a very thick accent. Avoid this, unless you are watching the MST3K version. Joel and the bots can barely save that turkey.
