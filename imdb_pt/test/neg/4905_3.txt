This low budget movie about a writer who is going to work in a London casino has a horrible script, wooden performances and not much to recommend it. Of course it will appeal to intellectuals for whom "mainstream" is a curse word, and it automatically adds 20 IQ points when they hear a British accent (apologies to Jeff Foxworthy). <br /> <br /> The script is full of holes (did he write a book yet, or not?), clichés (relationship problems: she works days, he works at night), and provides so little insight into basic concepts as character motivation that requires a narration of narration just to move. In an attempt to prevent the audience from cochleiling, it includes a street fight scene that is almost as realistic as a Julius Caesar production in high school. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​flickering dialogue is "I'm going to see your ten and get you twenty," then run to see this movie. Otherwise, save your money. <br /> <br />
