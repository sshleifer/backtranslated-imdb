There is so much evil to say about this movie and so little that is good! <br /> <br /> The plot has enough holes to sink the Titanic, the characters are completely unbelievable, the monsters are so unrealistic, and I'm tired of watching movies involving an ex-husband and ex-wife being thrown together in some bizarre emergency - happens very often in movies and has become another bad cliche. <br /> <br /> I find it hard to believe that someone would have invested $ 1 in making this junk, no matter the $ 100 or something, it must have cost. <br /> <br /> You could make a better movie with more compelling special effects on your home computer! I did not think movies could get that bad! Avoid at all costs - do something that is more fun and enjoyable, like having a torn tooth or an enema!
