I saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper. Sometimes I can get into romantic intellectual movies. This movie just did not move me. I felt that it was about an hour older. Camille is portrayed as a very nice sculptor, who loses almost everything. I thought the whole movie was sad and downcast. If you like tragedies, you might like this. I just thought it was too long, which meant it had lots of unnecessary scenes, which led to about an hour of boredom. I would not recommend this movie. If you want to see a good romantic tragedy, go watch the Titanic.
