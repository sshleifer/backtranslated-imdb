A group of young adults opens up a trail of escape for the spirit of Elizabeth Bathory when they recite their poem from a video game supposedly representing a session. The only one who dies in the game is Miller (Adam Goldberg), who is also found dead just as he perished in the video game. While the characters of others did not die in the video game, the recitation of the poem unleashed the game into reality, with CGI characters walking chasing and killing each one, one by one. They must follow certain methods using a mirror and nails to defeat Bathory and save their skin. <br /> <br /> If this premise seems stupid, it is because it is. The characters are rejected from WB bad television programs, this time allowed to desecrate profanities. This film follows the rules of the slasher, but does not show much violence or violence. It remains PG-13 safe with most of the death occurring off-screen. There is a scene where the real hero and heroine are fleeing from video game characters who chase after them. Yeah, it's so bad. Nothing to recommend. A good-looking cast including Sophia Bush as the appropriately named October.
