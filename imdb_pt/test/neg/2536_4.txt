Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon begin in Switzerland as the world's greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone), outnumbers the Nazis and smuggles a brilliant scientist named Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.) out of the country and into the relative safety. from London. But is London as safe as Holmes thinks? Dr. Tobel has designed a new revolutionary bomb that will change the aerial bombardment forever and he has agreed to hand it over to the British government, but the Nazis also want it and Holmes shelves the enemy. Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) plans to steal the bomb. secret from the sight of the bomb and sell it to the Nazis. Add the fumbling Inspector Lestrade (Denis Hoey) of Scotland Yard, the love interest of Dr. Tobel, Charlotte Eberli (Kaaren Verne), assassins, mysterious scientists and an intriguing coded message, and Holmes has his work cut off to keep Dr. Tobel alive so he can deliver his bomb sight ... Directed by Roy William Neill Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon was the fourth in a series of fourteen Holmes films made between 1939 and 1946 to present Rathbone & Bruce as Holmes & Watson. The screenplay by Edward T. Lowe Jr, Scott Darling and Edmund L. Hartmann is based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short 'The Dancing Men', and it is not the tradition of the mystery of Holmes' murder, as it is more a story of adventure in time of war. Neglecting what Holmes is all about, solving complex crimes and mysteries is a big mistake as far as I'm concerned and the involvement of the Nazis and the war as background for the story seems out of place, strange and just didn sit Very well with me. The dialogue is not great, Professor Moriarty feels almost like a belated reflection, as if they could not reach a villain for this and as a whole, is much less engrossing than the others in the series. However, at least it is short. <br /> <br /> Director Neill does his work as efficiently as ever, but you have to cut back a bit and keep in mind that it was made more than 60 years ago. It has no real style or imagination and has no atmosphere and intrigue as well. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is good if it is not spectacular, black and white cinematography is good, although I understand that a color version per computer is also available. The acting is good, Bruce & Hoey do their usual comic twists, and Rathbone's hairstyle looks ridiculous and I'm glad he's changed for later. <br /> <br /> Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon was a disappointment when compared to some of the other excellent entries in the series, there is very little I can recommend it for and everything that made the other one so good seems to be missing here. Leave this to the last and see some of the best first, only for the most difficult fans.
