there is only way to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> So bad, it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that I laughed so hard. The male protagonist in this movie trying to use a gun is so ridiculous that you would think he was trying to copy a toy action figure, I know this sounds ridiculous, but when you see it for yourself, you can not help but agree. <BR> The monster looks like a cgi guy trying to recreate the clay monsters you get in the old Sinbad movies. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is good for just one thing. the movies can stay. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a bad screenplay of bad acting and special effects that went wrong <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU
