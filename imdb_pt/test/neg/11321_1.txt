I like some good new music. No, I accept that. I love good new music. I absolutely despise GGROBAR on the other hand, and I have since the first note I heard. When I discovered that someone made a drawing based on it, my head almost exploded. Now that I've seen it because my kids begged me, I wanted my head to explode. It would have saved me from the excruciating misery that this cr @ pfest was. First of all, doing a one-hour show based on a three-minute novelty song is a ridiculous idea. To stretch a song like this, which had to be crazy only for so long, in an entire hour, is even more ridiculous. That was poorly written, cheap, poorly represented ... the list goes on. Dear God, is this always bad?
