I was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. The thugs seemed very real and menacing to me, and I could see why people would be afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing this as an adult, it seemed almost comical due to the over-narration and dissonant details like the 1930s gangsters driving cars that looked like the 1950s. There is a certain glamorous, glamorous reality in the way criminals are portrayed , but the overall effect is more like a bad novel. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny part that stays with me is the scene in which Ma Barker and his sons are shooting at the FBI and the children are killed. The narrator says something like "Maybe at that moment, for the only time in her life, Ma Barker became a real mother." This is a moment of great tragedy and pathetic, for Ma finally realizes how she has destroyed her family by her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. A very strange movie that is rarely shown anywhere today. Fans of gangster movies may like this, but more like a curiosity than a real movie.
