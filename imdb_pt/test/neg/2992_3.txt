There seem to be a lot of fans of this movie here, but I found it boring, slow, twisty and nonsensical. And I watch and enjoy many independent art films and movies, so I was not expecting an action movie. I did not sympathize with any of the characters. The country guy was a bad guest and did not seem to be struggling to find a job, and his relative in Istanbul was unapologetic and emotionally closed. In an interview on the DVD, the director says that the film is about a common situation in Turkey - the person who leaves the field because he has no job and comes to Istanbul and stays with relatives while trying to find job. This in itself is interesting, but the movie was not.
