I liked some of the characters, but our leadership relied too much on a charming smile. I did not mind with two whits about it. He makes bad choices and I did not really care, since he did not look either. He looked rather unintelligent. There were a couple of moments that gave a chance to some human insight (the scene with the whale was interesting), but these are lost in the general malaise of the movie. Love interest was acceptable and the other various characters were slightly interesting, but the plot twisted too much and left me at many points in the film. In the end, I wondered why I stayed so long. <br /> <br /> There are a few tepid moments of humor, but in the end I did not care. I can not understand the rating of the highest movie. - 3 out of 10
