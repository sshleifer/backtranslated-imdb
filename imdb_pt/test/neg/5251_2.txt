What. Uh ... <br /> <br /> This movie is so dissociative and messy that I literally lost some of my sanity after it's over. I will never be the same person again. I'm trying to put my finger on that, exactly, it's so completely insane about it ... It's not just the hilarious techno music, or the medieval "out of time" / Blade Runner / Wild West / Highlander setting, or the weird monster CGI "Grendel" looks like a man made of lively sausages, or even the monster "Grendel's mother", who looks like an Alabama table dancer who grew claws and tentacles when he stayed in the tanning bed for a long time. All of these things are strange, but what is really the strangest thing in this movie is acting. I just can not explain. This script is obviously hellishly silly, but the actors convey deadly seriousness through it all. Lambert is always weird, and usually a bit boring, but for this he entered Dolph Lundgrin's territory: I can not help but start laughing every time he talks. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this movie some credit for being completely scattered and crazy as opposed to conservative and boring. I'll always have a bizarre disaster from a movie about a totally mediocre one. <br /> <br /> Warning: If you are planning to watch Christopher Lambert as Beowulf, be prepared to spend several hours later wandering the streets in some kind of hyperactive-catatonic nightmare. It is true. When I finished my spiritual journey of Beowulf, I woke up in the middle of the Siberian tundra in a pool of blood and milk. There was a dead wolf lying next to me, and later I discovered that I had a handful of human teeth in the pocket of my shirt. My VHS copy of Beowulf was on a stone altar built hastily nearby, festooned with candles and withered flowers. The tape told me to walk. I got up and walked.
