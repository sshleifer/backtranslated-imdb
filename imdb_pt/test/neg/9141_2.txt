This is such a complete failure that it makes me angry. <br /> <br /> All the subtlety and structure of Reggio's early films are gone, leaving nothing more than a hash of digitally stained images whose only purpose seems to be Whinning About Bad things that humans do. Just like Star Trek-like wormhole graphics, colorful and colorful marines, mutiplicities of obviously fake computer icons and athletic competition scenes, which, in fact, show that no one has ever been able to overcome (or even combine) Leni Riefenstahl by filming bodies in motion, edited along with a video coloring overlap that a 1980's "Dr. Who" producer would have dismissed as "too tacky" added up to a polemic against "civilized violence"? There is no intellectual, emotional or visceral connection between these images, assembled and transformed by Reggio and many digital effects artists, and the cautionary tale I presume he wants to produce. With all the "dramaturgical consultants" involved, no one seems to have pulled their head out of their own feeling of saying something important and considered that everyone could be failing to say something new. <br /> <br /> Only people who watch too much television can make such a movie and believe it is significant; this is the kindergarten Stan Brakhage, and finally coward in its ruthless truism. The only irony and tension evident here (unlike "Koyaanisqatsi," where the implacable beauty and strangeness of the time-altered common images forced you to consider its meaning) was when the DVD I was watching was stuck and jumped. This is MTV for the crowd of Noam Chomsky, based on reflection and not on reflection and meaning nothing. Two stars for the song, which is in the best pomo-Cesar Franck style of Glass and features a passionate cello by Yo-Yo Ma. (I hope, for the sake of it, he does not have to record his parts for a playback of the film; there are some things you should not have to do even for a salary.)
