I'm sorry guys, everyone who thought this movie could be something great, I'm afraid you'd be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The standard the movie wanted to set is completely ruined by some very simple plot. So simple, that the film is not evolving until the end. I wondered if the plot was not about the action, but about the main character (played by Mickey Rourke), but I discovered that the character was inconsistent - or he's a professional killer or some guilty brother haunted. But the two do not go together because the kid he tries to guide him puts in dangerous situations where no professional killer would put himself. Now, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a good actor, but he interpreted his character a little unnatural. I did not believe in his acting, it seemed that the director tried to take away some personality that he could not provide. And he did not have to, because his less crazy behavior was frightening enough. The only one whose performance was great was Diane Lane. If not, I would give this movie a star. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I expected to see some well-played movie and some interesting storyline. And I blew it all with my high expectations.
