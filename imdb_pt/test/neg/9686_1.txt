Who wrote the script for this movie, the team at Disney Studios? This is the most inaccurate adaptation of any story! I wanted to laugh at some scenes and cry with others, and that was only because of how unfortunate it was. I'll have to give him credit, he had some funny scenes, but I could have had a better time with my night. Very rarely do I open a movie after only a quarter of the way.
