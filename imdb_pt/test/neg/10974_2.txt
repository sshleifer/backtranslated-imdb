One wonders how FLYNN could have failed as badly as a 1997 movie release, with Guy Pearce appropriately in the lead role. It is not often that the cast of someone so famous is exactly correct. FLYNN was a box office failure and did not end up on the screens in Australia ... even after LA CONFIDENTIAL ...! From a dazzling scene of nudity in the first few minutes (presumably by Guy Pearce), FLYNN begins a fairly robust and interesting start. Unfortunately, FLYNN runs out of power after the first 35 minutes and with hammy entry Steven Berkoff on a detour to New Guinea, (looking and acting like he wanted the role of Klaus Kinski in FITZCARRALDO) the movie begins to resemble a film instead of a great cinematic biography. Believe it or not, for about 70 minutes, it's annoying and you're happy to see that. But such a promise! Pearce IS Flynn! But the film caused a riot at the box office and, unlike The Bounty, sank without a trace.
