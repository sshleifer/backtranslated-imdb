A stupid show in the vein of the rest of them with terrible music and a laughing track that must be from I Love Lucy. I got rid of TV because of programs like this, but I caught the first season in large batches for $ 3.00. If you bought the Van Damme movie instead. If I were a conspiracy theorist who believed that a small group of people were working against real families and kept inventing this propaganda to undermine the family I would like to point to this show, Married With Children , Family Guy etc, but I am not so I will not. <br /> <br /> BTW I'm not a Christian, I love the Simpsons and Peep show. I watched two episodes and thought if shows like this are popular, with whom are they popular? Then I remembered all those pictures of the Walmart people that were circulating on the web and thought ah ha!. No wonder our culture is a joke around the world when it's prime time.
