This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen, it was horribly made, it did not flow, it was very hectic, because of that many people did not understand the movie. I had to watch this movie several times before I had an idea about what was happening, OK, it's like a kid stealing someone's car and, while running away from the police, he disappears, for some reason the police release him and he has to face his parents who sent him to live with his uncle in the desert, there he meets a girl who loves to climb and enters the sport and have to beg her uncle to let him enter a climbing contest, and that's how I said horrible movie.
