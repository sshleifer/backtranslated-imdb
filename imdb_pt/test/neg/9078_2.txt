The evil that men do (1984) was one of the few non-cannon films that Charlie Bronson did during the 1980s. Unlike most of the Cannon films Charlie starred in, this was neither fun nor entertaining. Charlie basically tortured and brutalized people for over an hour and a half. If you thought he was Mr. Emotion before, wait until you see it! <br /> <br /> In this, Charlie goes to an unnamed Central American country and shows the population that whoever is picking on Chuck or his staff has to pay the price. This is no fun. It is not flamboyant or extravagant, just brutal, sadistic and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> I did not like that. I have no love for this movie. No recommendation because it is not worth watching. Maybe if they did not cut the hell out of it. Observe with caution. <br /> <br /> Do not worry.
