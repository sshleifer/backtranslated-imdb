I did not want to write this movie about the comments and criticisms in the western world, I mean how they are wrong about the Asian cinema that now has become a basic diet of the Hollywood remake monster? Also Jet L is pretty cool, and he made some interesting movies in Asia. So, with an open mind, I was surprised by the average of this movie. <br /> <br /> There are good points. The story is very clever, using M-Theory as a basis for presenting the plot that there are multiple universes, each with their own versions of worlds, and most likely you. Each time one of you is destroyed, the rest shares the energy and power between them. The idea that someone can try and purposefully become the only version of himself in all the Universes to find out if they become a God. <br /> <br /> There is also Jet Li, and he is not a bad actor and very agile as a martial artist, in addition to Jason Statham, who is a good actor throughout. As for the special effects, some of them are really cool, a mixture of bullet time and slow motion with normal speed, very cool to see in places. <br /> <br /> The negative points? Well Statham's accent is shocking, and some of the effects are not as comparable as the others, so it's clear that the money was spent on some of the major outlets and not on others that were probably considered too short on the screen or just over. running out of budget. <br /> <br /> A big painful spot for me is the close-up camera action that Hollywood has long favored, something that Jackie Chan has always talked about. Shooting close combat scenes serves two purposes. It gives greater emphasis to a single punch or movement, making it look harder and more real than it actually is, and also hides what's going on around the camera lens. For example, people holding a false arm or the face of a stuntman, etc. <br /> <br /> What Chan always said was that he tried to open the camera and show the audience what was going on, let them see people struggling properly instead of a close-up of a face and a fist, cutting to someone falling on the board. Showing the whole image is more effective, and is more impressive. So the closer photos were more annoying than anything, you could not see the strength of Li's fighting skills, and you found it hard to see some of the actions. Slowly cut and move the camera Hollywood directors! The biggest problem was the story, despite having such a strong base to build, they seemed to lose track of the plot and focus on the action scenes. There are some serious moments of construction of plots and explanations that are totally ignored and covered in the space of few sentences, but that could have formed a development of excellent and complex character. <br /> <br /> All together too weakly, and not enough has been made of the story. All in all, not a great movie and its potential was very spoiled.
