The director of this waste of celluloid specializes in terrible films of exploitation, where the pretension is everything; The year before, he did "Dangerously Close," whose good idea (about gangs taking power at school and the publisher of the school newspaper against them) was submerged in a sea of ​​sloppiness, and he would make "Cyborg", Jean Claude . The worst movie of Van Damme of all time (nothing evil). This pretentious comedy about a girl - Kathy Ireland in her movie debut - who is a total schlump whose inner baby is only awakened after it falls in the center of the Earth and has a set of badly filmed, impossible-to-follow adventures (involving mainly one set of dwarves who want her because she has big bones - will understand!), before returning home changed for the better is not funny, exciting or fun to say the least. And anyone who is watching this to salivate with Miss. Ireland will be delayed too - not because of her voice, but because she spends most of the film buried under tons of loose clothing, with huge glasses to boot. No wonder Cannon, the producers, are out of business. Surprisingly, Kathy Ireland has made better films ever since ... or maybe this is not so incredible. Also, "Barb Wire" is "Aliens".
