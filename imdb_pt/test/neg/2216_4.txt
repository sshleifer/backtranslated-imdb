Of all the E.R.Burroughs screen adaptations that Doug McClure starred in the '70s, this is the most impressive of all. It's so stagy, you can savor the dust from the sets and feel the health of the bulbs above. The thing seems to be a very, very large piece of schooling, or, in fact, a very low budget action movie, which it really is. It has been said on many occasions that this was the last of the entries of the genre, and I hope it has been. The genre did not die in peace, but in horrible agony, amidst a lot of smoke, fake blood, and awful sound effects. Peter Cushing must have felt a boy again, like a mad professor whose shirt turns white as snow after the gentlemen crawl through the dirty holes of the Underworld. What sport he was, to take a role in this mess and carry him with such bravery. <br /> <br /> Filmed entirely on a sound stage and accompanied by a synthesizer soundtrack at the time, now unbearable, the main attraction in this movie are the cardboard monsters. Yes, there are always monsters like this in an adaptation of Burroughs, but they rarely manage to be so completely ridiculous, defenseless or without any credibility. On some occasions, during high combat scenes the action in which McClure attacks heroically creatures, you can almost hear the hollow, hollow sound when his head hits against the side of a tri-compact. Fortunately, the animals explode and catch fire the minute they stumble and fall. In fact, there is a lot of unmotivated outburst when the movie (and the genre) comes to an end. And the lovely Miss Munroe loses her underworld accent. <br /> <br /> The triple bill, currently on the market, features this movie and two others - The Land That Time Forgot and the Lords of the Atlantis War. The first two are very strong entries, especially the first, with lots of money invested and occasionally even fascinating screenplays. Do not expect any of these qualities from this movie. Get drunk with friends and laugh blatantly with what you see. After all, the manufacturers also felt no shame at all.
