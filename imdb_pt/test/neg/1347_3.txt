This movie could have been a decent decent, and God knows it tried (or Mrs. English tried). Assembling talented actors along with a successful and experienced writer / director should be a formula for a decent movie. But Mrs. English's experience - according to her IMDb biography - is exclusively limited to work on television, and it's clearly obvious throughout this film. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that none of the reviews I have read have mentioned what I found the most unlikely about this movie, and what prevented it from achieving even a part of its potential: it looked and seemed to have been made for television. To give Mrs. English some credit, many of the jokes that just did not work on a movie screen would have been great on TV (and maybe a laughing clue helped). Much of the use of the camera and lighting would have worked well on TV, but they seemed awkward or strange on a large screen. If the whole movie had been cut into a miniseries or a comedy, I think it might have worked. But this is cinema and, unfortunately, English's talent has not been translated. I shrank from so many different points of my embarrassment to the actors and writers that I felt as if I had left the theater half wrinkled! Meg Ryan is her normal, handsome self (except for the terrible plastic surgery she had on her face), but where did she get a chance to use her talent? She made films in which she did not recreate her stereotyped role and did them well ... but not here. Annette Bening seemed to simply go through the motions - such a talent and such a poor performance! I liked the other female characters, but they were more caricatures than they were substantial, and it was sad to see. What worked in this movie in the 1930s does not translate to the 2000s, and no one helped Mrs. English to get the changes, updates or subtleties. If she (as writer, director, and producer) had sought some help, I think it might have been good. But it was not. <br /> <br /> It's so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and leave feeling like it was a waste of everyone's time and money! This New Yorker cartoon I saw yesterday is appropriate: some moviegoers are having a meeting and the caption says, "Let's redo a classic with everything worse!"
