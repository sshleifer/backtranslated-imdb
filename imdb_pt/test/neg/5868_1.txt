This abomination and the sequel ONE MORE TIME and Jerry Lewis's heinous disasters like Do not RAISE THE BRIDGE LOWER THE WATER led to movie owners closing their doors instead of being forced to to shoot those movies. Truth: In the 1960s movie booking was still imposed on suburban and rural movie theaters ... that means that in order to get a good movie, movies were forced to use timewasters like these: I remember well in 1974 FIDDLER ON THE ROOF or something, I was stuck in the United Artists ordering office by a sloppy salesman who waved a sheet of flops in front of me and squinted, shouting, "Now, before we get to that, let me see those first" . which basically means: "reserve these failures and we will give you a tired blow." That's the way it is and why so many cinemas are closed down, forced to filter out and annoy their declining audience with those assembly line failures with lame comedians and bored talent. The movie owners, exhausted from arguing simply shut, sold to a gas station and watched the movie theater demolished. Nowadays the same kind of movies (for example: I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK AND LARRY) are banned for the cinema of 20 places in 99 in a mega google plex. Not much has changed. FREDDY GOT FINGERED ... anyone?
