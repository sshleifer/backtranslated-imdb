Plankton or Creatures from the Abyss as I am positive is most commonly known as & filmed in as the title Abyss Creatures appears on a moving image and in the same type of font as the rest of the credits, starts with five 20 something kids, Mike (Clay Rogers) his girlfriend Margaret (Sharon Twomey), sisters Julie (Ann Wolf) and Dorothy (Loren DePalm) and a boring idiot named Bobby (Michael Bon) who decides to fit in a small rubber boat and leave for the do not ask why, as I do not know. Oh & the complete idiot Bobby left the gasoline behind and never thought to tell anyone, so it's no surprise they end up stranded in the sea without gas for the engine and to make it worse they get stuck in a thunder storm uncover a dead body floating in the water. Soon after their luck seems to change when they come across a yacht and potential safety, in a flash all board the yacht and start exploring. First of all they find a scientific laboratory with several fish specimens and computer equipment, and just below they find fully furnished and luxurious cabins. They find a chemist (Deran Sarafian) who looks crazy and can not speak. They eat fish from the refrigerator, which causes Dorothy to vomit vomit, beetles and green slugs. They learn that these fish live from thousands of years of fossils and have been contaminated by toxic waste dumped into the sea and they fly, mutate, bite and are usually unpleasant. I really can not be bothered to continue with this sketch of the plot, so I will not, here is what I think ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was produced and directed by Massimiliano Cerchi under the pseudonym Al Passeri (I hid under a different name if I made such a bad movie) and I think Plankton is simply one of the worst movies of all time, there are so many things wrong with this movie that it's hard to know where to start. First, Richard Baumann's script sucks, it does not make any sense, and it's so slow and tedious that it was torture for me to sit around. Why would five people simply go to the middle of the ocean in a rubber boat almost big enough to fit them all? What were they planning to do exactly? Why do we often take pictures of the views of these fish creatures, but they seem to be totally invisible to the characters, since they are never shown on the screen, even though they are right next to a character, and how these fish circulate around the place ? boat as there is no water for them to swim in? People's actions and reactions to things are all wrong, they constantly divide, they make bizarre decisions that just do not make sense in the situation they are in and some of the dialogues are as horrible as anything I've ever heard. I could continue all day on all the holes in the plot and ridiculous things, but I will run out of space if I do. The fish themselves look horrible, a mix of rubbish rubbish puppets and some really bad stop motion animations in the end, the scenes in which they interact with the human cast also look terrible with some poor overprint. I've heard lots of comments saying that Plankton is bloody, do not make me laugh! Forget, there's virtually no blood or blood on Plankton, there are some slippery scenes when Bobby turns into a fish monster while having sex with Julie, but it's very brief and he does not kill her, he just cries a slime in her, grows a couple tentacles and a fish head comes out of his mouth. Later, Julie's vagina begins to drip into some dark mud, but that's it, we can never see what happens to her or what the mud is. Dorothy has a fish creature coming off her back, off the screen and controlling her, but we can never again see what happens to her while Margaret commits suicide, a very brief shot of a plastic harpoon stuck to her forehead. Easily the coarser scene is when Dorothy vomits that green thing with what looks like beetles and slugs in it. Only one person actually dies on the screen and, most of the time, Plankton is very tame and exciting as seeing paint dry and I almost fell asleep, it's very annoying. I can not see how anyone can like this total crap, I just can not. The acting is horrible, the dubbing is horrible, the characters are horrible and I hated them all. Technically, Plankton is also predictable, with a budget estimated at only $ 250,000. All I can say is where did the money go? The scenarios are monotonous and monotonous, with a laboratory and some booths, the special effects are the bottom of the barrel, including the most fake-looking exploding boat of all time, cinematography is bland, music is an atmosphere or zero tension and as a whole Plankton, as it's name, is as low in the food chain as it could be. I hate Plankton, it's horrible in every aspect of the long run of 86 minutes. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs, unless you are a masochist or an insomniac.
