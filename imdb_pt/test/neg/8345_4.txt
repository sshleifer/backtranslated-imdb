Volcano is situated in Los Angeles, where a small earthquake has just hit, O.E.M. Mike Roark (Tommy Lee Jones) decides to cut his vacation and go in, once there, he sees that everything is fine, but then he leaves for the epicenter of the earthquake, where seven underground workers were killed by a fire or intense heat of some kind. Mike is not sure what to think, so he brings the geologist Dr. Amy Barnes (Anne Heche) to try to explain things, unfortunately a huge underground river of molten lava was released after the earthquake and erupts in the La Brea Tar Pits sending the lava spilling on the streets of the city swallowing anything and everything that touches in flames. Mike, his men and the emergency services have their work cut off trying to stop the lava flow and save as many lives as possible ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Mick Jackson this was the second big budget disaster film revolving around the idea of ​​a volcano erupting during 1997 with Dante's Peak (1997) being released just two months before the Volcano was and while Dante's peak is hardly some kind of masterpiece, at least it's a little better and more plausible than the Volcano. The script here is total nonsense and is not based on reality, underground lava rivers that seem to appear and then disappear so quickly, several inches of standing character of a lava river not yet being affected by the heat (when that face is in the train, the metal seats around it begin to melt, but it remains perfectly fine, as far as I know, human skin is not as heat-resistant as metal, is it?) and happens constantly, flying helicopters are clouds of gray reality would be impossible), a simple block at the end of a street will stop the lava flowing (what about the other streets and other directions?), being able to blow up a perfect trench in a street and then blow up a huge building up to make a massive dam and when Kelly sees the lava going towards her car, she leaves like anybody, but for some reason stands still and sees two firefighters being burned to death and expects their p haha at this stage, her leg caught fire, even though all those concrete blocks were put together to make a barrier in less than twenty minutes, the guy does such a good job, not a little molten lava can infiltrate and much more than that huge building falling on Tommy Lee and his daughter still then both are well after. The characters are horrible as well, though not as cliché as usual, with no flourishing romance between Tommy Lee and Anne Heche and the minimum of city officials trying to close down Tommy Lee and Anne Heche before the event labeled the alarmists. There are some recorded and sometimes embarrassing moral moments when Los Angeles gets together, the black guy and that semi-racist cop who warms each other up and in the end are wishing each other well and that little boy at the end when he says' everyone seems the same 'is shrillly worthy and is certainly an attempt to ham fist and trying to say whatever color we are we are still human beings and we can all get along in the time of a crisis as it unites people. That said, I think the Volcano is so bad they are good movies, entertaining and moving at a decent pace, but expect nothing grounded in reality or any human drama. I suppose a film like Volcano could be seen as an update on a 1970s disaster film such as The Poseidon Adventure (1972) or Earthquake (1974), but with a huge budget with works by modern effects. Speaking of the effects, they are good, but none stand out that much and the set-pieces are also surprisingly forgettable, there are certainly some impressive explosions and a flow of lava flowing through the effects of Los Angeles, but little else. Generally the Volcano is not very exciting and occasionally unintentionally funny and completely ridiculous, it does not work the way the manufacturers intended. With a supposed budget of about $ 90,000,000, it opened for a little less $ 15,000,000 at the box office, looks good and there is a lot of fire, but nothing stands out and Volcano is a movie quite forgettable in general. Filmed in Los Angeles, I think most of the places featured here were filmed in their real-life locations. The cast goes through the motions with some terrible dialogues and ridiculous moves to face, Tommy Lee Jones deserves more than that. <br /> <br /> The volcano is a disaster in both directions, it is a disaster. theatrical film that turned out to be a disaster in itself. It's worth it for some unintentional laughter and the ridiculous of everything, but it's no big deal and I doubt I would want to see it again.
