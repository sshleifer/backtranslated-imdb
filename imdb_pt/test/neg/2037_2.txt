I had nothing to do before going out one night so I did not want to see anything too heavy, I chose the perfect movie. That must have been a gift to Barrymore from someone she slept with, director Raja Gosnell has done nothing but nonsense and writing about it is simply appalling. In which high school can you enroll without a father present and without proof of age or former schooling? They let the kids all come to the ball without shirts, tight tights, shorts, and a girl dressed like Eve wearing only fig leaves? She announces that she is 25 years old and her brother is 23 years old, but there are no reprisals from school, parents or legal proceedings against the newspaper for fraud or spying? The head of the newspaper wants to get the teacher into a sexual scandal involving minors, but does not realize that the teacher is reaching 25 years of age, so any case would be a trap? Do they allow a camera and record private conversations of people with underage children? I wonder if I hired my younger sister to go back to the HS with a camera in it and filmed in old girls for my personal use would not I get into some kind of problem ??? NAHHHH No problem. Did not she have to do gymnastics or go to the bathroom at some point? The secondary characters of this were like cardboard cutouts than were thought that high school students and everyone else was a stereotype. Jessica Alba is just embarrassingly bad at this assault on the camera at every chance. In what world do parents not get suspicious when their super-nerd daughter is miraculously invited by the school stallion to the prom? And they do not ask the guy inside to find him like any other father in history. If some guy from my school or any other school like that had cheated on my sister and laid eggs for her in her prom dress, he would be in a cast for the rest of his life. This film is so artificial and predictable that it is nauseating, and why in the end is everyone (the Alpo girls included) cheering for this girl when two days before they hated her ???? <br /> <br /> DUMB, MUTE AND IDIOT.
