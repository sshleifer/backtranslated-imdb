There are many mysteries in life. For example: Why did some people other than Carrot Top agree to appear in this movie? Why did someone distribute this movie? Why did someone pay to see? I do not think any of these questions will be answered, but one thing I know for sure, this movie is one of the worst ever made with such a big budget. It would be bad, but the addition of the "humor" of the Carrot Top makes it even worse. The only entertainment you can get from this movie is to burn it, smash it or destroy it in a fun way. If you were to rate it against all the movies already made, it would be right between "Problem Child" and "Biodome". Nuff said.
