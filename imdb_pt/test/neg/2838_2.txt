Now, let me see if I have this correct, a serial killer lunatic is walking around killing real estate agents ... ok ... what's wrong with this scenario, I can live with that. <br /> <br /> Then a slasher with tax inspectors massacred? Traffic guards sliced ​​to death? Should we feel any sympathy for empty, shallow property people, obsessed with money? Er ... no. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, playing sideways is not only a very well done film, with poor acting and raw effects, the climatic scene is particularly silly. You can almost see the director screaming, 'action' for the stuntman as he falls into the window glass. <br /> <br /> As another reviewer rightly said, after starring in 'The Fog,' this was the nadir of Adrienne Barbeau's career. So I was happy to see that she had rekindled, becoming the voice of Catwoman in the animated series of Batman, while watching the extras in the movie Catwoman live. NB: It's not exactly the horrible movie that is made by the way. <br /> <br /> However, this is a bad movie, I think it's a bad episode of 'Kojak' or 'Streets of San Francisco', and you'll get an idea of ​​what's on offer here.
