I wanted to like this - the situation was rich and the scenery was unusual and interesting. But the story is replete with children's elements of feminine gothic romance that are hard to swallow. The director has an unfair prejudice against the 'goy' characters - content to let them be grotesque cartoons of cardboard - and inexplicably indulgent with heroin's controlling behavior. The potentially interesting power struggle between the inventor and the housekeeper is not really dealt with. <br /> <br /> Feminist filmmakers will have more credibility when they stop manipulating situations to play all heroin sympathy and start dealing honestly. with problems. This movie more closely resembles 'The 7 Pieces of Gold', another serious failure, more than 'The Piano' - a true tale of passion.
