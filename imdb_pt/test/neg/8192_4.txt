It's schmaltzy, but what else did you expect? The heroine is Cinderella's younger sister complete with perverse mother, sister and brother-in-law; the hero (if you can call it that) is an ineffectual putz; and the rival interests of love are filled with melodramatic villainy. The cast, the settings and the wardrobe were very attractive, and I thought the actors did a great job considering how weak the material was. The film was filmed and featured a soundtrack that was carefully crafted to show the viewer what emotions he should be experiencing throughout. Megon McDonough sang sweetly and gave the film some of its best moments. <br /> <br /> If you love Danielle Steel, you'll love this movie. If you love archetypal romance, you'll love this movie. I do not. I was able to sit, but it was close.
