Retro Puppet Master begins in Kolewige in 1944 where puppet master Andre Toulon (Guy Rolfe) and his live puppets plan to flee from Germany, staying in a puppet master of Toulon reminiscences about his youth and the point at which he learned the secret of giving life to dead objects in 1902, in Paris, when his younger self (Greg Sestero) commanded Theate Magique. He describes the fateful night he met a 3000-year-old Egyptian sorcerer named Afzel (Jack Donner) and his eventual love for the handsome young Ilsa (Brigitta Dau). He tells the story of how Afzel passed on the gift of life to himself and gave life to his own wooden dolls that were part of the show Theater Magique. However, the gift of life was also a curse, since the ancient God Sutek, from whom the secret was stolen, firstly by Afzel, wants it back and all who have learned it have died ... <br /> < I've been in a bit like a big fan of the first three I decided to watch the rest of the franchise and as such I saw Puppet Master 4 (1993), Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter (1994), Curse of the Master Puppet (1998) and now Retro Puppet Master in the space of a couple of weeks and boy was hard to go through all of them, especially this as the worst of the series so far. The Retro Puppet Master looks like a cross between Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge (1991) with its breeding period and Puppet Master 4 and Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter with Sutek trying to kill everyone associated with his stolen life giving away secrets. There is also not much continuity here, again there are none of the green sÃ©rum presented in the previous films and although Andre Toulon committed suicide in 1939 at the beginning of the original Puppetmaster (1989) he is seen alive and well in 1944. Most of the story is counted as a flashback and focuses on Andre Toulon's own rather than the puppets, the film focuses on his relationship with Ilsa and he learns the secret of life and it's all too boring and tedious to be honest. Even with just 80 odd minutes, the Retro Puppet Master looks long and padded, with no real rhythm, and the concept is not central, since the plot never stabilizes and usually jumps a lot. So of course there's the bewildering decision to totally redesign the puppets that I found incredible, I mean, why would the makers take the one basic thing that made the Puppet Master movies so memorable and completely eliminated? The dolls are seen briefly at the beginning and at the end, but otherwise we get these wooden caricatures that are not nearly as cool as their modern reforms. It has never even been explained why these puppets were used, instead of all Puppet Master fans falling in love, although it is suspected that Full Moon hoped to make another sequel that dealt with exactly that issue. <br /> <br /> If a bad story and a complete lack of our favorite dolls was not bad enough. Full Moon decided to use a PG-13 rating to make the Retro Puppet Master the only untitled 'R' Puppet Master movie in the U.S. (obviously other countries have their own movie rating systems) and therefore there is no single drop of blood throughout the film, the puppets do not kill anyone, there are no swearing and no nudity. This is more than educated things for children. In addition to the dolls themselves being garbage, the special effect is the wost of the series too, there is no stop motion animation in this, no CGI computer effect (certainly in 1999 the CGI was cheap enough?) And all effects are of stiff effects of the stick-puppet type. That is, whenever you see a puppet puppet, the camera is always positioned above the standby, so the legs do not need to be shown and obviously there is some production assistant pushing the thing, this is as complex and modern as special effects are . <br /> <br /> The only positive thing that the Retro Puppet Master has for this is that it looks pretty cute, the period production design, costumes and props are really impressive and it's a pretty cute movie to watch at times . Apparently filmed in Bucharest, Romania, which folds nicely for the turn of the last century in Paris. The acting here is horrible and maybe the worst of the show. Retro Puppet Master is more or less the final Puppet Master film as the next Puppet Master: The Legacy (2004) basically edits scenes from all seven previous films and is a very bad way to shoot the series that began so well with three excellent and distinctive little murderer puppet movies. Do not worry about it, just watch one of the first three again and just remember the good times ... The murderous puppets would return in the terrible spin-off movie, Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys (2004).
