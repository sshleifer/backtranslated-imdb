I'm not afraid of bad movies. I like bad movies. I like to mock them in the company of my friends. We're all very good at it, actually. That being said, let me tell you how much I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> For starters, it was incomprehensible. Rob Lowe attacks some people, they capture him, but he escapes this great shootout. There's a singer we think he's dead, only she did not die, except maybe there's a lot of them who act and look the same. Cue Burt Reynolds to enter and question the singer. He looks like he just walked into this Walker, Texas Ranger movie and he's confused. So Rob Lowe dies, only he does not ... And the worst is that there is enough dialogue or action that does not involve killing people or even trying to make fun of that movie !! And do not even tell me about the random chihuahua. Then there was the fact that it should be about the old power structure in Eastern Europe collapsing. We did not know where we were, all the accents were apparently "Eastern European" and what were Burt Reynolds and Rob Lowe doing there in the first place? <br /> <br /> I desperately wanted to tell Blockbuster people what I thought about this movie, and to get my money back, but since I started out as a special (just $ .99), I've decided against he. What I want to know, however, is how the director got the green light to make that damn movie, and what the "stars" were thinking when they logged in ???
