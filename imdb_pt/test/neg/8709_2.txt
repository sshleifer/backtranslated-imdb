I had high hopes for this movie that I even gave up one night watching Stargate for this movie. I thought I had a hasty sense about it and many of the main biblical moments and facts were missing. I could be a bit tired and spoiled by the 1956 version, as I've watched it every year for the last 20 years. I doubt that this will reach the realm of the annual classic, as the other has. If you have not yet seen the 19546 version, you may like this, but I seriously doubt and ask you to skip this and go rent or buy the classic. This has some nice special effects, but that's not what I look for when telling a movie like the Ten Commandments. I was sort of looking to see how they told the story, and the writers did not do a good job with this.
