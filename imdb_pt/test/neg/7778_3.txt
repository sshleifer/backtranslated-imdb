As usual, another masterpiece from the Vice Academy series (HaHaHa). I do not know why they bothered to make this crap. Just another series of cops acting like sluts. A defining part was when the character of Ginger Lynn Allen (Holly Wells) and the character of Elizabeth Kaitan (Candy) tried to seduce the scientist by wearing nothing but bra and panties under their raincoats. Just a wonderful scene (Ha). One character I did not like was the Commissar. He was very boring and ignorant. They should have caught him. Mrs. Devonshire was also very annoying. They should have stopped this series after this movie.
