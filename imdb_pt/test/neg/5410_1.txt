My wife and I like bad science fiction movies. Some movies are so bad they are good. Mansquito was one of those. That was bad, but it had some redeeming qualities. This makes you think like a respectful actor approaching phrases like "Hey! Mansquito!" <br /> <br /> This is so bad that it has now taken its place as our standard for evil. It's not just a bad movie, it really stinks. There was the attacking force, the "Indian" who wore a black cloak and wielded a sword to shout aloud. He shot down a helicopter with an arrow !! <br /> <br /> We tried to laugh at this movie, but there were no points where it did not get over pitiful. We could not have redeeming resources except one. Those were the words "The End". <br /> <br /> There seemed to be no plot, no character development, and no point for the movie. Someone in Hollywood needs to get fired.
