For a good look at the Roman Empire, watch the excellent miniseries produced by the BBC "I, Claudius". This is just shit. The acting was pathetic and you could almost see the actors staring at the camera. Hans Matheson was irritating. The cheese factor was so high that it promotes constipation with repeated visualizations. Even Caligula was meek. I think this movie was silently supported by "religious" groups that will remain nameless;). The obvious tones of Christian favoritism and persecution were evident if this gave any clue. Stay away from whatever you do - the race time is so great that I was able to read the first Harry Potter book faster than the time it took to see that gut. <br /> <br /> Italy did better - do not let Hans cute guy fool you. He's not a great actor ... he's a big annoyance.
