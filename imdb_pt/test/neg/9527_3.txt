The story, as I understand it, is "based on real events." This can be good or bad depending on what kind of license is taken with these actual events and how they are processed. <br /> <br /> In this case, the results are enough to annoy a larva. I was not expecting much - anticipating a story of rich high school kids cruising in the ocean under an aft commander. That is, what I imagined was a maturing movie along the lines of something about military training or basic training, the kind the sergeant says, "My duty is to get you out of your lovely civilian ways." Well, that's it, in a way. Children start out as children and end up as an organic group. But this is a lot harder than any boot camp movie I've ever seen, out of a deliberate comedy. Who wrote this thing? The air is full of slogans that belong, not in high school, but in the third year. Dialogue offends the ear. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges usually does a better job than average, but in this case his performance is mediocre. He brings nothing extra to the role, though, given his lines, it's hard to know how much he could do with them. The rest of the cast is indistinct and some of the children are painfully inadequate. There is much tearing and considerable crying. The best scene involves a dolphin. <br /> <br /> The immature clich√©s continue to the end. The Coast Guard is escalated into the role of the hard-hearted court in the hearing following the disaster. The interrogator does nothing but hit Bridges in the head with his misinterpretations and misinterpretation of events. "You let the crew drink alcohol, do not you?" (A couple of harmless drinks.) "And you did not punish them, even though I punished them for killing a fish." (The dolphin business.) The technical details surrounding the wreck are obscure. What is a "white storm"? And if it's as dangerous as Bridges says, why were not all the crew alerted and wearing lifejackets? But why continue? If "The Albatross" was a Dreadnaught, it would still be torpedoed and sunk by the ridiculous script of the comic book.
