The basic premise of this movie is that everyone in the world can know that a person is gay except for that person. And that a man who likes to show melodies, has good taste, and is pure in appearance should be a homosexual. Yes the movie is funny in some parts but the basic premise is to be homophobic and insult the fact that the whole movie collapses into something that is very painful to sit on. The performances, particularly Joan Cusak and Kevin Kline, are very good.
