This is by far the dumbest thing I've ever seen on celluloid. I mean, we started watching it assuming it was a skinemax T & A movie, but beyond a few breasts, that was it. I mean, I have the goal of making stupid movies to show some sex scenes, because they are the only reason for such a movie to be made. This film, however, does not have sex scenes and really does not make any sense. There is no linear time, the scenes travel like a fart in the wind, people appear for no reason, then they leave, and this is never explained, the plot is never advanced and nothing happens. I've never been so amazed at how bad a movie was until I saw it. Has the director ever been to a film school? Has he ever seen a movie? I do not know, but by the looks of it, he seems to have left some idiot proud with this crap, since he's still working. I literally walked away from this dumbest movie, but I still recommend watching it, as it should be shown in every film school in the country as an example of what not to do when making a movie. Move over to PLan 9 of the Outer Space, you have a new competitor for the worst movie ever made.
