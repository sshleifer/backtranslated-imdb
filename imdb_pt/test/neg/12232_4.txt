When I first saw the trailer for The Comebacks, it looked absolutely horrible and I had no interest in seeing it, but when it came out on DVD today, I realized that there was nothing else that interested me, I would rent it and give it a shot . I watched it and it really was not that bad. I think it was immature and stupid at times, but there were some funny moments that made me laugh. I really do not watch a lot of sports movies, so I wonder if maybe I saw more, maybe this movie made more sense to me, but it's okay, I still did not care much about watching The Comebacks. I admit, these "stupid" movies are silly, but what's the catch on a stupid joke every once in a while? Comebacks are not that bad if you give them a fair shot. <br /> <br /> Coach Fields is failing in life, family and career but when offered the chance to bring his career back to life if he can bring a weaker football team to the championship . But the staff is really very terrible, as beyond terrible. But with a little work and team effort, they try to give their all, even if it can turn into something more sad. <br /> <br /> Comebacks are not the worst movie I've ever seen, I think it's good for a couple to laugh and laugh. I know this was stupid but I could not help laughing when the coach came in the middle of a fight in the locker room and he's banging the nerd's head against the closet, only he and the nerd in general were so funny together. If you have an open mind and do not take this movie very seriously, I think you'll have fun watching it, if you watch it waiting for it to be an Oscar material, this is not the movie for you. /> <br /> 4/10
