On paper, this film has some characteristics: a street kid who overcomes past traumas, rebuilding his life and succeeding when the world would have written it. Big deal, everyone loves a happy ending. <br /> <br /> In theater, though, there were some omissions that left the film dead inside. The dialogue was hollow and uninteresting, the characters were almost caricatured in their lack of size and complexity, and why did everyone need to be gay? I have nothing against homosexual themes or characters in a movie, but when used in that way, it is not only offensive to homosexuals, but it also trivializes the lifestyle and makes the movie cheap. If history works without this cheap trick, it should have been cut. <br /> <br /> Each character seemed to come out the same way as a cookie cutter: each had a big flaw and a small flaw, each character is good-hearted. were successful or not, and they all had or are in an abusive relationship with someone. <br /> <br /> The most annoying fact of the movie is that they never let you get past the name "pip". comes from high expectations. They give it to you once and that should be enough. The story shares a lot with Dickens' classic to make this fact obvious. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the film is the grandfather's story and the tape he leaves for Pip and as Pip, the main character, learns to grow from the lessons learned from the tape. In the end, with the lessons learned, Pip confronts his dark past and films with his life.
