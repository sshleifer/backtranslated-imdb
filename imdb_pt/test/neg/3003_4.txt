"What a symbolism!" exclaimed a woman as we left the theater after seeing the Polish brother's anthem for Ingmar Bergman. Some symbolism is all right. But not much. "Northfork" adds to some good acting weakened by the somber cinematography that fails to make any coherent statement and a confusing story that annoys rather than captivates. <br /> <br /> Northfork is a city that faces extinction after a new hydroelectric dam is in operation. It is the early 1950s and a squad of state agents in identical clothing, all looking like they have just responded to a call of "The Untouchables," have the job of relocating recalcitrant residents who do not appreciate their immediate danger as much as the reward offered for moving. An exciting anti-development film is always a possibility, but let's face it: rural electrification is one of the greatest advances in bringing decent living conditions and a boosted economy in American history. Can dams be built without forced relocation? Not in this country. <br /> <br /> But this movie is less about the situation of homeowners than it is a fantastic creation of the escapist imagination of a dying boy. Nick Nolte is the priest who takes care of the boy and much of what he says may have been interesting if the sound was clear enough to be heard. <br /> <br /> Alternating between the black evacuation agents (working for "lakeside" "land when the dam creates that valuable area" and a ghostly collection of weirdos, the film does not develop a coherent theme or even interesting. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is poor.A faded, subdued, depressing color permeates the whole film for a less dramatic purpose.There is no reason for this vast terrain to be portrayed so desolately.In fact, a contrast between the virtually untouched natural beauty and the massive and sombre solidity of the evolving dams and power plants would have been very effective. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
