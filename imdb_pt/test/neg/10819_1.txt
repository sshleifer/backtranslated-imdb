Dire! Discouragement! Horrible! Laughable! Disappointing! <br /> <br /> Sure, you're trapped in "The Cave" with several "hard" men and a woman or two, your being systematically killed by "Something" and you STILL can not hear ANY naughty Growing words !! ! A 15 Cert 'here in England, and you could tell! <br /> <br /> The Egos of the "Macho Men" were too much, pass the bucket, I'm going to get sick. <br /> This film should never be exposed to daylight and ironically be kept in the darkest and deepest hole of the floor and be forgotten forever. I have the feeling that this description is not the first time he pops his head out of a hole in the ground. Like the movie The Cube, it seemed like a good concept, but it was just leave it in the last post by, well its self. <br /> <br /> This comment contains Spoilers well, it's called The Cave. Thank you Bruce.
