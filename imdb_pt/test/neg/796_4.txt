Ha ha - oh no - what about this movie? Yes - green eggs and ham makes more sense than this movie. Where does someone begin? Many good things have already been said - so I will not divulge in the same territory. I believe you already have the movie summary - so I will not paraphrase the movie. <br /> <br /> First - let's start with the good. <br /> <br /> 1). If you like psychological thrillers that make you think (like me) the first 29 minutes of this movie will be for you - this is one of those movies that illustrates the question you always talked about long car journeys when they were kids like (and if you had to choose one member of the family live, another to die, or if you had to die by drowning or fire) This movie is a great concept - bottom line. <br /> <br /> 2) wardrobe group did a good job with bringing us back to the 70s. Realistically though, how hard is it to achieve this? ..... Okay, that's all for good. Let's talk about evil. <br /> <br /> 1). This movie looks like a 2 hour "Twilight Zone" episode. This can easily be 90 minutes. This may have made the film bearable. <br /> <br /> 2). Do you remember the movie "From Dusk til Dawn?". The film started interesting, then in the middle of the film, was once demeaning? Yes - the same thing here. I would venture to say that the writers started with a concept, so they had no idea what to do with it. I got a deeper thought about Transformers 2. <br /> <br /> 3). Yes - we have the dilemma in the movie. We understand the philosophical nuances and the utilitarian approach - but the story jumped too much, did not elaborate the arc of current history, and took a totally insulting (forgive) direction. <br /> <br /> 4). The ending did not make sense. Not at all. None. <br /> <br /> This movie would be a great finishing job in college philosophy 101. If you're weird, bed sick or you've enjoyed being hit in the face with a pie, and you can see it online free - by all means, go for it. <br /> <br /> If you need to pay anything to see this movie, do not waste your time - you're better off watching old Howie Mandel standing on You Tube. You will have more philosophical stimulation rearranging your sock drawer.
