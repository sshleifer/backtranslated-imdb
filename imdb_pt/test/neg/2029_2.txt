All right, this movie might have been nice if there was a plan behind it. the title did not fit in after the first ten minutes. the wind did not have much to do with the rest of the film. the acting was unsatisfactory and the writing reminded me of something you would read in a children's book of scary stories. <br /> <br /> When it comes to horror movies, this should not even be rated as one. this was a disgrace to fans of terror and suspense everywhere. I hate being so hard, but I felt like I wanted the time I spent watching this movie back. I hope there is no follow-up to this. this movie must be locked in a safe and never released to the public for viewing.
