A New Generation is Amityville's third entry to base its plot on John G. Jones's premise of an item taken from the Long Island house that causes ghostly misery and death to its new owners. First a lamp, then a clock and now a mirror. However, this is also the first Amityville since 'The Possession' to connect directly to the real-life events that started the entire series. This time, Keyes Terry (Robert Partridge), an artist, gets a macabre looking glass for a homeless man someday. Soon, people around him begin to die, eventually leading to the discovery that the mirror hanging in the Amityville house - in fact, the same night, a man named Franklin Bronner (Sonny Montelli in 'Amityville II') murdered the whole family . Unfortunately for Terry, his discovery of the mirror is not mere coincidence, and he soon discovers the truth about his past a truth that he is kept buried from childhood. <br /> <br /> This 7th installment of the often worn out franchise is a disappointment to me. Things were starting to pick up with the silly and uneven, yet fun 'It's About Time', and given how much this film tries to draw on its roots - not the first episode, but the source material itself - should have been better than that this was. <br /> <br /> However, three trips to the same pit with one more evil artifact from the Amityville house with yet another explanation for the evil paranormal visitors are using on me, to say the least. One of the biggest weaknesses of the Amityville franchise is the firm determination of each group of producers to completely ignore all other episodes in the series. On the one hand, it is perfectly reasonable that they do not want to be connected to the continuity of another person, but, at the very least, perhaps they could recognize stories that have already been made and possibly do not repeat them over and over again. *. There is also something a bit indecisive about how the story unfolds, no doubt because of the inevitability that this fest-repeat brings. Since you already know what will happen, the carefully made buildup is simply slow and tedious. Or maybe it's just tedious anyway. Director John Murlowski probably could have done more to increase the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror, rather than simply make it shine red and emit "evil" voices that have no subtlety at all. There were times when the characters seemed quite unperturbed by their supernatural qualities. If they do not take it too seriously, why should we? <br /> <br /> What a shame, because 'A New Generation' has a cast that is more than capable. I was going to postpone the remark until I saw the name 'Julia Nickson' in the credits. It captivated my attention as it always does, and if anything, I was upset, its part was no longer extensive. Terry O'Quinn was equally charismatic and again underused. Partridge himself in the leading role clearly fits the kind of square-jawed hero with a woodcutter's shirt, and although I'm not sure if he really gave it seriousness, it's not as if someone here was playing Ibsen. The sets are also noteworthy, from the dramatic work of art that fills Suki's room to the claustrophobic corridors featured in flashback / supernatural sequences. Obtaining the appearance of these rights is especially important given that certain sequences are repeated throughout the film for simulated fragmented memories. Clearly, Murlowski is more of a visual director than an actor or horror director. Unfortunately, it's supposed to be a horror movie, after all. <br /> <br /> 'The New Generation' sees the same race being played for the third time in 4 years. Add to that the lack of direction where it was really needed and the whole effort is not as high as it should be. However, it should be recognized for its strong ties to the source material and some good actors in not necessarily its best hours. Honestly, the ideal person for this is someone who has not seen any of the sequences from the past 'The Possession', for whom the story will not be such a massive deja-vu trip.
