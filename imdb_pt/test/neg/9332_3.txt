Mainly non-engulfing biblical mumbo-jumbo that creeps for over two hours. The only thing that saves this movie from the crown of God (and there is only one god, remember) is the unintentionally funny dialogue, and a good battle scene that comes too late in the movie. For most of the two hours up to the action scenes there is a lot of talk; the dialogue is so inept that the movie just begs to be falsified by MST3K. <br /> <br /> George Sanders is absolutely horrible; one of the most lively and overly theatrical performances I've ever seen. Brynner is not much better; his rigid, wooden performance combined with the horrendous word of wisdom from the fortune cookie makes a boring and annoying Solomon. It seems like every time Brynner opens her mouth, something so wise and ridiculously tall and powerful appears. To some extent, it is not Sanders and Brynner's fault, because of the crappy and comical dialogue and typically biblical one-dimensional characterization, but they made little effort otherwise. Brynner's accent even resembles that of Schwarzenegger; this is not a plus. Only Lollobrigida manages to avoid embarrassment, interpreting the paper with more conviction and in an appropriate way, which is suitable for a role in such a silly film. Describing these biblical characters as one-dimensional would also be an undeserved credit; the characterization is semi-dimensional.
