The fifth collaboration between Marlene Dietrich and director Josef von Sternberg, BLONDE VENUS, is a film that looks great while playing but can not engage the viewer. The dismal plot of Dietrich being divided between two men, becoming a gigantic cabaret star, and fighting for the custody of his son is confusing and often looks like pieces of three separate films made together. Dietrich is recklessly cast in a passive and quite reactive role for much of the film and her character remains distant from viewers, while Herbert Marshal is not convincing as her moody husband, and Cary Grant is largely wasted as a mild suitor who enter and leave. out of the photo. The film contains some intriguing pieces (the number "Hot Voodoo" is the high point) that are stunningly surreal for this time in Hollywood, although this did not result in such a flimsy and incoherent film.
