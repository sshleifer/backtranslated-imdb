This is the epitome of bad 80's cinema, unless you're a preteen girl. Addressing a big name as madonna, a plot that physically attacks the intelligence and humor that best fits a day care. If there ever was any doubt, I think this mob of a film clearly shows the absolute lack of acting talent of Madonna and made me feel very embarrassed in its name. The only thing I can not believe is that they let the director get close to another movie again. Madonna spends most of the movie prancing like a child rag doll and talking like a baby. It is painfully obvious that the only reason this movie was made was due to the fact that Madonna was a big name in pop music at the time. DO NOT BE DUPID TO SEE THIS STRONG TEMPTATION OF WINNING IN STARDOM POP. Stay away at all costs!
