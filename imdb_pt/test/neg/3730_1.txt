During a lifetime watching and enjoying thousands of movies, Feeling Minnesota is absolutely the worst (** mainstream movie star) I have ever seen. Bar none. This movie fails completely on all levels. It is badly photographed and edited. There is uninspired acting, the kind in which actors seem bored. Just collecting paychecks, maybe? And worst of all is that sticky writing seems to have been written under the influence of some unpleasant substance found only in the sewers. I can not even begin to understand how the writer / director could have found someone to fund this project, let alone attract any of the stars he made. I really wish I could go back the time I missed by watching this piece of crap. If possible, I would have given this film a score of zero. Better yet, a negative number.
