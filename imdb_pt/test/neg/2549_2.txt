Mexican werewolf in Texas is located in the small border town of Furlough where Anna (Erika Fay) lives, her best friend is Rosie (Martine Hughes) and she has a Mexican boyfriend named Miguel (Gabriel Gutierrez) who is determined to track down a beast that has terrorized the city, killing cattle and several villagers, including some of his friends. Local Mexican legends speak of the Chupacabra, an evil creature of myth and legend. Erm, I'm fighting now, because not much else really happens ... Written and Directed by Scott Maginnis I'm not going to hit here and simply say that the Mexican werewolf in Texas is horrible period. The script only mentions the word Werewolf once and the rest of the time is referred to a Chupacabra, in fact I suspect that this was not really conceived as a Werewolf movie. The creature 'Werewolf' seems mostly hairless and more like a cruel dog, there is no reference to someone changing during the full moon and actually attacks during the day on some occasions, there is no scene transformation and at the end when it is dead , it does not change back to anyone either. To be honest, aside from the title, there is nothing here to indicate a Werewolf movie, and yet the title is only a copy of the highly popular An American Werewolf in London (1981). This is the kind of homemade crap that I personally think is killing the horror genre, how much time has passed since there was a real classic low budget horror like Dawn of the Dead (1978), The Evil Dead (1981), Halloween 1978) or Friday 13 (1980) which were all made in shoe string budgets, perhaps The Blair Witch Project (1999) but that's it in recent years & crap like Mexican Werewolf in Texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered a classic. The character is horrible and things happen around him, the dialogue is crap, the rhythm is terrible, the story sucks and it almost sends me to sleep and as a whole this movie sucks, I'm sorry, but I I do not know anyway, to describe it. <br /> <br /> Director Maginnis does nothing to make this possible; there is the annoying cinematic camera type that could easily cause someone's headache and quickly "blink and you will lose something." which only irritates and irritates in equal measure. It's not scary, there's no nudity, no tension or atmosphere and the special effects are terrible. The monster really does look poor and it's no wonder that Maginnis keeps you in the shadows or cuts your scenes so quickly that you never take a good look at it. There is virtually no color in the picture, or it is almost pitch black or orange saturated with desert sand, which makes it equally sore. The blood consists of some fake guts (blink and you'll miss them!), Some bloody wounds and a severed arm, big deal. With a supposed budget of about $ 300,000, I admit that the budget was but I simply refuse to accept this for making such a bad movie, there are plenty of low budget horror films that make their meager budgets go a long way. The whole thing has the appearance of a home movie, has no style and is completely bland and bland to look at. The acting sucks too, though you probably already know that. <br /> <br /> The Mexican werewolf in Texas will probably involve some people in renting / buying / watching because they may mistakenly think that it is a sequel to John Landis's classic, which is certainly not and is not even a Werewolf movie appropriate. Do not be fooled this is horrible and I'm sick of having to waste time / money at home did amateur crap like this.
