I've seen this in a preview and I have to say that this documentary-style movie is the biggest load of guts I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Completely embarrassing, low budget, boring, garbage script, terrible acting - The whole public (young and old) sat in the movie in a coma without laughing for the most part of it ... there was literally just about two places you'll laugh all over the movie <br /> <br /> Many people came out of the middle - Can not blame them ... I kept thinking the movie would catch on, however, it never happened and I wish I had gone. <br /> <br /> The humor was really dumb and I'm surprised that this has hit the big screen. I'm not someone who is offended by the adult content of this movie - it was not funny. The people who made this movie really do not deserve your money, so please do not pay to see this movie. <br /> <br /> That's not funny enough to be on TV, let alone in the movies. .. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give 0 out of 10, but the system does not allow ...
