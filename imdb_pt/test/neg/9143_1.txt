If any movie ever made the Italians look bad, that's it. <br /> <br /> Duke Mitchell - what is an A-HOLE. Duke Mitchell, I'm in your grave. Seeing as virtually all the people killed in this movie by the coward Mimi is black or some other racial or ethnic minority, it's hard not to be convinced that the guy owes his allegiance to the Ku Klux Klan or skinheads. Awww, but he does not shoot the little boy in the elevator in the opening sequence, so that means he can not be all bad, right? WRONG. Typical sentimental triplet with a hard head. <br /> <br /> Although I understand why some people may be surprised and even to some extent admire the audacious veracity of the film, totally unashamed (certainly not ashamed of their own hatred and sense of self- but this does not change the fact that the main character, Mimi (and by extension, Duke Mitchell), is a totally disgusting human being who does not gain a bit of empathy or interest, especially since Duke Mitchell is a such COMPLETE BORE as a performer. But what do you expect from a guy whose main fame is fame (apart from this one-time dog movie) was to be a second copycat of Dean Martin?
