While this movie has had some scary moments (great use of the music and angles of the movie to create suspense), it is obvious that director Ethan Wiley and screenwriter Ellary Eddy wasted no time in researching the subject; which also makes me question his claim that the scenes of exorcism were overseen by a genuine Catholic bishop. <br /> <br /> Among the many inconsistencies: Jacob, the Roman Catholic priest, when we first meet him outside the church, is wearing an academic robe over his clerics instead of the typical alb, casula or surplice. Academic vests are commonly used by Protestant pastors in liturgical denominations, not by Roman Catholic priests. <br /> <br /> * Jacob, the priest, quotes some obscure and disturbing scriptures on the angels taking up arms. He attributes this to St. Paul. This verse is not from the writings of St. Paul, nor is it in the Bible. I can not even find it in the Gnostic scriptures. Jacob tells his bishop that he does not believe in demonic possession and refuses the request to study exorcism, but does a total of 180 (later that day?) minutes after speaking with Isabelle possessed . Of course, it is possible; but a bit unrealistic. See Father Damien as a priest / psychologist in the original THE EXORCIST for a somewhat more realistic portrait of a skeptic who became a believer. Michael, the former priest who became a farmer, is the first to attempt an exorcism in Isabelle. He quotes the scriptures and she quotes back. He says "I see you know Psalm 65" - she corrects him "this is Psalm 67" - both are wrong. Michael, the ex-priest who has just made an exorcism - making the sign of the cross, invoking the name of Christ, applying holy water, etc. - tells Jacob that he does not believe in the church and he does not believe in God. (Maybe he's just in conflict?) Jacob summons him to put on homemade attire and have another go anyway. <br /> <br /> * Michael, the former Roman Catholic priest, crosses back (or Eastern Orthodox style). As a Roman Catholic Hispanic who used to be a priest, he should have crossed the forehead to the sternum, the left side to the right side of the chest. <br /> <br /> I had to read the side stories to get the notion that Satan was messing with the whole family, not just Isabelle; but even in the end it was hard to say for sure if anyone was really guilty of the images in their heads or if it was all a demonic trick (with the exception of the sheriff - it's pretty clear he was guilty). <br /> <br /> On the plus side: Isabelle was CREEPY - in my opinion she was the best part of the whole movie and I enjoyed the turnaround in the story with Claire. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the movie was meant to be serious or a parody. Listening to the commentary with Cameron Daddo and Ethan Wiley, I'm inclined to believe it was a joke.
