I hated this movie. Put simply, this movie is so bad that I almost want to disregard never watching it and never mention it again. But on the other hand, I can not resist a good attack. And if there is one thing that Evan Almighty does to the public is that it brings the best reviews. <br /> <br /> The film (a sequel to the very funny Bruce Almighty) begins by reintroducing audiences to Evan. Baxter, a mere support in the best character of the original film. That's right. This movie does not show Jim Carrey or Jennifer Anisten. Not even a small apparition. You know your movie is bad when the guy who agreed to do Ace Venture: When Nature Calls does not even have a small role. But somehow they manage to keep Morgan Freeman as God. As I sat in the almost empty theater numbed by the lack of comedy, I could not help but wonder how much money was needed to secure Freeman for this movie. Then it hit me an hour ago. It's just a disposable paper that takes 20 minutes in the 100-minute movie. God simply appears among the scenes to tell Evan to build the ark. Of course I know Morgan Freeman will not look at this movie in a year and thinks it's as good as their roles in The Shawshank Redemption and Million Dollar Baby, but it's easy money. <br /> <br /> Where was I? Ah yes, the plot. Sometimes it's so hard to stay focused on the plot when you realize that you've thought more about the plot than the screenwriter did. Anyway, Evan (Steve Carell) apparently left his job as a newscaster for a job as a congressman. Yes ... no transition between the two. He never turns to his wife and says, "I think I want to be a congressman." It only happens in the first five minutes and you are forced to deal with the great transition. As well as a congressman, he is a partner in a bill proposed by John Goodman's character when, suddenly, God seems to tell Evan to build an ark. No "Hey, how are you? How's the weather?" little. Just "I want you to build an ark". Evidence of poor writing: Evan determines that God is giving clues to build an ark after noting that a fan holds a sign saying Genesis 6:14 when he is passing by his son, who was watching a televised baseball game. <br /> <br /> This is basically the plot of Evan Almighty. There are some random cast support members who do their best in creating comedy, but they do not do very well because they receive almost no time on the screen. It's just your basic working of the mill family building an ark movie. Oh, and there's also that must-see scene where a parent has to cancel their hiking plans with their kids and wife because he gets busy with work. They are disappointed, but they understand, just like every other time in the movie this happened. Only once would I love to see the younger boy turn to his father and kick him in the chin and tell him "You're a real bastard for canceling your plans with us. I'm going to turn emo now." There is also that drama you would expect from the father with his family when they realize (the wife, actually ... the three children have no problem helping their father build an ark) that he has gone mad and he claims that God wants him build a big boat. But do not worry. His family decides to stay with him. Oops, I ended up spoiling the drama. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that there is almost no good comedy going on. I know the decision was made to assess whether this is a PG movie to have a bigger audience reaction, but I do not think I'm a minority when I think family humor is more than just guys being kicked in the nuts and animals . crapping. Maybe I'm wrong and that's why quality family humor has been reduced. And if it is, please bring me more adult comedies, so I do not have to deal with this crap anymore (unintentional pun). <br /> <br /> The ending is extravagant. Suddenly, the movie takes a dramatic CGI spin that makes me shiver at the thought of a terrible waste of CGI. I bet it was expensive too. Finally, after all this waiting, we are told why God wanted Evan to build an ark. And kid, oh boy, I hated the reason. I'll spare the details, but it was like watching or reading a murder mystery and making the killer become the person who walked behind the main character for a second and had no lines. <br /> <br /> Oh and then there's a nice touch in the end. The song "Everybody Dance Now" touches on the credits and we are subject to the "dance" of the cast. I dont understand. They spend 100 minutes unsuccessfully doing a comedy and then they get involved with a thriller. I swear I'm not so scared watching Steve Carell dance since ... well never. There you have staff. Evan Almighty is the scariest movie ever. <br /> <br /> In short, I thought it was a wasted experience. I am puzzled by all the talented actors (Carell, Freeman and Goodman) appearing at this festival along with Lauren Graham, the Gilmore Girls woman who has yet to prove to me that she can get out of a paper bag. But most of all I'm surprised by my willpower to actually sit through the movie without leaving. Rating: * out of ****
