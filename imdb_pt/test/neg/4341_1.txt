This is a pale imitation of the Die Hard franchise that just sucks. The film's low ambitions are clearly on display when terrorists hold the vice president hostage and he has to call the White House to ask them to transfer some money. In most movies of this genre the President is kidnapped or held hostage because after all he (or she) is the most powerful person in the country with a finger on the nuclear button etc etc. If most Americans were really worried if Dick Cheney had been kidnapped? The honest answer is probably not. Because the terrorists would choose a Stanley Cup final to perform their operation and why, despite many explosions around them, the audience inside the hockey stadium is indifferent to the situation, they are unanswered questions. Let's just say that this movie is really corny, it's not hockey. Those who liked the movie and found it exciting should have a life.
