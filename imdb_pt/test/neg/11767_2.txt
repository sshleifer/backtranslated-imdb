If you can tolerate the camp, this movie should make you laugh out loud several times. You did for me, at least. I will mention just one of my favorite elements: the "underwater shots" of the "fish" "swimming". The sound that accompanies these scenes is also great. <br /> <br /> One last note: William Katt is actually a decent actor. I hope he has another day in the sun; seeing him as "The Greatest American Hero" was a fun part of my childhood a few decades ago, and it has not been very visible ever since. He seemed kind of depressed in this movie. Someone give you a fun job at a good show, or something.
