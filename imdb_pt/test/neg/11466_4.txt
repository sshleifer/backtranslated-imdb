Michael Bassett's film, 'Solomon Kane' (based on the character of the same name created by Robert E. Howard) is a disappointing Fantasy Action-Adventure movie, which despite having some genius scenes falls with his clumsy gait, poor characterization and general softness. Solomon Kane (James Purefoy) is a mercenary from the army of Queen Elizabeth fighting in Africa, where he comes face-to-face with the Devil's Reaper? a demon who collects the debts of the devil, that is, souls? refusing to go to hell yet, he evades the Reaper and begins a new life in an English monastery. With this new life, Solomon has left behind his culture of violence and bloodshed and now embraces the values ​​of peace and non-values. But once he is expelled from the monastery due to the fear of the return of the Devil's Reaper, he must travel back to his home in Devon and along the way he befriends a traveling family of Puritans going to the New World. On her journey through the British counties, the family is attacked, and her daughter Meredith (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is abducted by the evil sorcerer Malachi, who is led at the front by the mysterious Masked Rider. Now a man of peace, Solomon must return to his former life as a man of violence and unrepentant destruction to save Meredith. <br /> <br /> Despite having a great source of material to work on, and building to potentially create an exciting and enduring medieval action-adventure film, the film fails in three main areas. The pace of this movie is terrible, which may have a lot to do with its incredibly short time of only an hour and forty minutes (and this is probably a consequence of the fact that they want to turn this movie into a trilogy). . Constantly jumping between drama and self-characterization to that of action and muddy bloodshed, it kills the excitement of action sequences a little. Instead of keeping the audience at the edge of their seats amazed by the anticipation of agile eyes, the film seems incredibly weak and, this follows the next, boring criticism. Despite being considered an 'action-adventure' movie or in some circles an 'action epic', 'Solomon Kane' is almost certainly not. The action is mundane and monotonous and usually ends before you have a chance to admire the beauty of a decapitation. Finally, apart from Solomon himself, there is very little characterization within this film. For example, we know little and therefore we care little about the young woman Soloman sets out on her journey to save. And I again imagine that the filmmaker would refer to this criticism of the fact that there will probably be a second film that will hopefully address those aspects that this film certainly missed. <br /> <br /> It's not an entirely terrible movie though. James Purefoy performs fantastically like Solomon, the mercenary who must decide whether or not to appeal to his conscience or his sword, and how his decisions will impact not only on himself but also on those around him. While respect, admiration and recognition should also be applied to Bassett and his team for creating vivid venues that beautifully reflect the period in which they are filming. Sometimes it's hard not to get carried away by the admiration of the beauty of the locals, the composition of filming and the scene on the scene here. Which certainly shows that a lot of time and effort has been put into this film, unfortunately that does not mean the same for the story and the characters at hand. 'Solomon Kane' certainly had the potential to be something more than simply an 'epic action', yet it seems that once again the actual lack of depth in the story and characters resulted in Michael Bassett creating nothing more than a one- one. dimensional look at swordplay during the medieval period.
