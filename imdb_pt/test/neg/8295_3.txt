Some of the secondary actors actually try very hard. And the camera photos in the desert are beautiful. Otherwise, this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> William Shatner's character, Harvey, is an amateur writer. He is also a psychopath, a man who literally escapes a mental institution. The goal of this movie is that amateur screenwriters are psychopaths? Harvey will do anything to make his script read and turn into a movie, even if it means taking a crew hostage. Amateur writers ... crawl? Maybe they will. <br /> <br /> The movie setting is too long. We did not get to the point of the story until the second half. The first half flings and flits between assorted characters. <br /> <br /> "Shoot Or Be Shot" is presented as a comedy, but I found it totally not funny. Dialogue does not contain subtext. None of the characters are believable as real people. They are all puppets that perform "action" in a way that resembles cartoon characters. In fact, the film is basically a cartoon for adults: silly, dumb, adventurous. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some actors are in that movie. They need the money or exposure. But what are the insiders Shatner and Harry Hamlin doing here? Maybe Shatner wants more comedy roles. Is that the best he can do? Is Hamlin so desperate for money? He used to be a respected actor. What happened? <br /> <br /> Even though the story must be a satire, it presents itself more as a rejection of amateur writers. Maybe that was not the intention. But it is certainly how the film can be interpreted. As such, the script was very, very poorly written.
