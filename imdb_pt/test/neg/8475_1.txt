This "movie," and I use that term loosely, reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote at eighteen months: "P.U. smelly poop!" <br /> <br /> Like this joke, this movie can only appeal to the very young, the very immature, or the very stupid. <br /> <br /> That said, there are some bright spots. <br /> <br /> The effects, to where most of the renowned $ 100 million have been, are kinetic and compelling - I mean, as convincing as those kind of kinetic CGI effects can be. The effects of CGI baby are not great, but I imagine they are very difficult to do well ... although for a hundred million dollars, they could have been better! <br /> <br /> Moose, the dog of "Frasier", phoned in his usual exemplary performance. Steven Wright did well with a small part. Alan Cummings was, well, Alan Cummings-as-villain, whom we saw before, and Bob Hoskins as Odin was unrecognizable, but pleasant. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays Mrs. Avery was cute, as you would expect, and Jamie Kennedy, as you expected. His best role so far was in the Scream trilogy (not to be confused with The Lord of the Rings trilogy), and in Three Kings. He should be, perhaps, with more subtle forms of comedy. Jim Carrey, he's not. <br /> <br /> The writing and direction were, at the very least, worse than Kennedy's performance. I remember a clever (though intelligent seven-year-old) line that I'd like someone to cite accurately the "Memorable Quotes" section. Something about Avery's proposal being Craptown's "boring crap," was a second-grade joke, but kind of funny in context. <br /> <br /> Above all, since there is nothing less than a "one." I give this movie a "one".
