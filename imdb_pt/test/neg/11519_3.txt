Being one of the founding fathers of the film club of my regions (this also includes monkeys / chimpanzees and orangutans), I am reviewing this film from the point of view of a monkey movie. After all, it's a whole summer of monkeys, over 100 days for monkeys to do their best, to do pranks, tricks, hyjinx, solve human problems, and teach us about ourselves. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough. In short, poor boy needs money for things he wants. Fortunately there are some monkeys (chimpanzees) that have a reward in their head that would make the blood of Boba Fett or Dog (Duane Chapman) flow. As the boy tries to catch the monkeys, he learns about himself, his family, his grandfather, the local weirdo, flirts with a girl twice his age and learns that the way to deal with bullies is to have someone aim a shotgun at they. Inside there is the problem. So much focus is placed on the boy that the chimpanzees just do not get the screen time they deserve. Chimpanzees are not as talented as the chimpanzees who play Jack of the M_P trilogy or the legendary orangutans who play Dunstin or Clyde (1 or 2). So do not watch this movie hoping to find the next big thing in the Chimpanzee genre. The chimpanzees hit some sweet turns, which is what the film needed most. There is an epic scene of chimpanzees invading the homes of poor families and destroying all the things they have worked so hard for. Film enthusiasts of serious monkeys will want to rent the movie just for this scene. <br /> <br /> So to wrap up this movie is not for the serious movie enthusiast. I would not recommend this movie to families as it encourages a child's rebellion against their parents. I can only recommend this movie as a rental for hardcore monkeys loving well supervised adults and children.
