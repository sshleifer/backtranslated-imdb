This is a strong recommendation for anyone who reads this review who has never seen the movie Total Reality, do not waste your time and money renting this excuse for a movie. This is, without equal, the only worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I've had nightmares of this movie since I saw him. The acting was terrible, and any amateur filmmaker could make a more decent movie. The film won much higher science fiction films, such as TimeCop or Total Recall (from which the title appears to have derived). I'm sorry, but I just think there's more entertainment value in watching next to a cardboard box for two hours. If you've ever seen this movie, I'm sorry you missed what I did.
