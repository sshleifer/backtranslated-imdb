Okay, I watched this movie. Someone needs to kick me. Why do the Olsen twins insist on subjecting the world to this putrid torture? This was another movie to see the Olsen twins travel to an exotic location, meet some cute guys, look gorgeous and have everyone drooling over them. The direction, the development of the plot, the acting. I do not know about the US but in my country it is considered extremely stupid to get on the bike from a guy I met like 10 minutes ago. although I am convinced that these girls will never learn to act, I really hope someday we can watch a movie with an original plot, even if slightly plausible.
