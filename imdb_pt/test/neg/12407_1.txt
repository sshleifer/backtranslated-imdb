Disclaimer: During my adventures in foreign cinema, I have enjoyed a wide variety of films covering different genres that include horror, action, drama, comedy and romance, to name a few. So, I appreciated the serious and thoughtful tone of the dramas, as well as the meaningless popcorn fun of action movies. With a wide variety of Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I am confident in my ability to recognize bright spots in movies to appreciate and complement. Unfortunately, Ashes of Time has nothing to recognize. It's one of the worst Chinese movies I've ever seen. To begin with, this exaggerated sword epic shows the infamous "slideshow" action sequence, which is nothing more than an ultra-cheap and pathetic. form of action choreography. Just show a series of close-up photos of faces, swords, legs and / or arms, and then a dead body. Bravissimo! You now have a sequence of actions for Ashes of Time. The problem is not only in its poor quality, but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and disjointed that the viewer has no idea what is happening. <br /> <br /> The dramatic element of this film is: nonexistent because it relies on the characters telling the viewer that they love someone or hate someone rather than actually developing and displaying such elements on the screen, which makes all the characters generic and colorless, leaving the viewer completely indifferent to their actions. In fact, the plot itself is an absolute disaster, introducing many characters very quickly with many plot devices. Plotting complexities in movies can be used very advantageously (ie, A Tale of Two Sisters), but Time Ashes become exploitative junk when it does nothing more than entangle a very simple plot with no apparent good reason. <br /> <br /> In fact, this whole movie works like a series of smoke curtains to cover up its shortcomings. Horrible action choreography is masked by slideshow tricks and chaotic camera moves. Non-existent character development is obscured by the characters who openly say how they feel. And an unthinking plot is hidden by confusing the viewer with the convolution. <br /> <br /> As if that were not enough, this movie was extremely annoying, looking like over 150 minutes instead of the current 95. <br /> <br /> Rating = rarely gets 0/5 stars.
