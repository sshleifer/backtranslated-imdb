Unlike other spaghetti westerns, this one has characters that almost make sense and can be identified to some extent. Still has the silly shooting of other spaghettis westerns. A spaghetti, by the way, is another word for a sinless western, with no characters you might be interested in, and silly shootings that do not make sense at the time, and good music to make the audience feel something. This is more carefree, like the ones Bud Spencer and Terence Hill did together. They were also superior to the garbage made by Eastwood and others, that the sadomasochists make their friends watch, if they have a chance. It seems everyone had a lot of fun making the movie too. It was nice to see a giant actor like Gilbert Roland, who was not even mentioned in the movie store, but who was clearly the biggest name. His character was very nice. There is a three-way stalemate at the end, which is far superior to what he does (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), simply because the characters are at least a bit pleasant and somewhat identifiable. Not a good movie, but it has a bit of fun.
