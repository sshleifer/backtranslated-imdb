Chupacabra: Dark Waters has to qualify as one of the most foolish movies I've ever done. I expected at least some acceptable entertainment because John Rhys Davies was involved, and after seeing this movie, I can honestly say that I substantially diminished my opinion of Davies. <br /> <br /> Why? The acting is incredibly poor. An excellent actor like Davies should have demanded more from the cast and director. It was painfully obvious that Mr. Davies was just watching the clock and hoping the check would not jump. To say that he had just appeared would be a euphemism. But at least he showed up. The rest of the cast looks like they sent their respective jobs to the various Los Angeles restaurants where they work as waiters. Talk about a cast of unknowns! This is the kind of cast that never appears in the movies again. They act as if they have been heard while waiting at the unemployment office. <br /> <br /> What about special effects? Keep buying fireworks, Styrofoam, inexpensive rubber clothing, and CGI effects that seem to have come from my 1980 Atari Game. I saw some horrible special effects used in Sci-Fi Channel movies, but those things seemed to crop up and necklace made in kindergarten by someone's child. I hoped that Mr. Crabs and SpongeBob would appear at the end to fight the Chupacabra. Not to mention that all reports of the creature describe him as a small gremlin bug. It would have been a good movie for a Leprechaun character. Instead, we have a gigantic gigantic creature that is shown walking with accelerating stop effects that are laughable. The chupacabra is in one place and then it shuffles at super speed down the hall and it's worth giving some laughs just to see this.
