The title takes viewers to believe that this is a fun movie to watch and probably much better when watched under the influence, but it is not good at all. A 15-minute sequence with Jack Black beautifully playing one of his songs and stumbling on acid while venturing through the woods does not save this movie. Every actor in this movie went on to do better things, except for the lead girls that I could not think of in a movie I'd seen them in before. I hate hitting movies, but also hate not being able to find something decent in movies. The film is sad, not very funny and had that potential with its incredible cast. If it were redone and written, it could be incredible. If you want a good movie to be stoned, check out Grandma's Boy, or Half Baked or Dazed and Confused, but this is not a movie to be seen.
