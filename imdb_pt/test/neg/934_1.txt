I do not know what some of these filmmakers are thinking, making the same kind of clich√© movie over and over again, where bad guys (bad girls in this case) win. Weak performance and very predictable. Nothing original about that. This same movie was made repeatedly - not unlike GOODBYE LOVER (1989), SLOW BURN (2005), or at least ten other films with the same plot and ending. There are many holes in the film too. It's as if they run out of money and stop filming. Or maybe they ran out of ideas. But do not waste your time on this one. It will only leave you upset that you have wasted your time watching.
