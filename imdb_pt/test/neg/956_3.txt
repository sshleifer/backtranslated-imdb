"D.O.A." is an unthreatening thriller from directors Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel. The acting is fine and the script is very bad. This movie also has a few moments that will make you laugh at how stupid the scenes of violence are. For example, someone is shot near a window. We then see from the outside <br /> <br /> the building that looks like the person jumped. I laughed out of my head when it happened. This movie tries hard, but ends up failing. Just watch this movie when you have no other choice. <br /> <br /> My Critique: ** <br /> <br /> Classification: [R] <br /> Reasons for evaluation: Violence and language. * There was no rating reason available because of his age.
