Ah, yes, it's more of a recounting of the classic, "sociopathic killer doctor creates female Frankenstein and falls in love". From the same director who brought you timeless classics like "10,000 Maniacs" (no, not the group) and "Blood Feast", this "unfinished" movie practically calls for MST3K treatment. The physician's assistant still has Torgo connotations from the classic "Hands: The Hands Of Fate". I do not know if the graph, whether the fake-looking violence or the frequent snippets of speechless dialogue could have scared the crew. <br /> <br /> The main reasons to bother watching this movie are: to the hysterical scene of "hypnosis," the ridiculously serious ending, and bottom-up production figures. In fact, I watched all the credits after that movie, for the same reasons why you're inclined to slow down your car when you're in a serious traffic accident. This is the pure genius of the final theme that sounds like a "My Favorite Things" played on a toy piano. Goblin this is not.
