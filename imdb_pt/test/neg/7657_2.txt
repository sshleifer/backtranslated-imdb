This movie is more goofy than any other movie I've seen in my life. The special effects are terribly bad. For example, near the end, when the Concorde is falling after the door is torn, it looks like a toy. The special effects of Airport (1970) are way better than this crap. In addition, the strength of a Concorde opening at altitude and speed would basically turn the thing from the inside out. (That is, if it even opens) But the movie has its positives. Especially when it ends. This is cheesy, too. For example. The Thing landed on a weakly compacted snowbank, if it did, would fragment into a million pieces. Overall, 2 out of 10. Instant flop. Great laugh movie.
