Many people are standing in front of the house n some women are crying ... Men standing in groups close and talking in muffled tone ... a couple of guys come in and they are discussing how sexy the daughter may seem today .. in soon you will know that someone in the house has died ... The wife of the dead person is worried about preparing food for so many people, the friend sitting next to her gives an idea of ​​facilitating things by preparing simple roti sabji ... of the person's son the deceased is talking to someone on the cell phone, Daughter is busy with the makeup ... her mother suggests that she use kameej, but the daughter is more interested in looking beautiful when so many people will be visiting their house and so she prefers jeans and shirt on salwar kameez ... another son asks his mother to finish all the kriyas and also indicates to her that he should not come early from the office ... Then the camera slowly focuses on the dead person ... the white cloth covering the face is shifted slightly due to the wind, revealing the face ... Your Anupam Kher ... suddenly the alarm rings and he gets up from the bed ... Is it your dream or a flashback? U will not get an answer by the end of the movie ... Well this is wat's comedy is for director Dibakar Banerjee !!!!! Later, you discover that this scene has nothing to do with the film and therefore makes it obvious that what we described earlier was a dream. Is this a movie comedy? Well, it's supposed to belong to that category ... But actually it does not !!! There is nothing that can be remotely associated with the comedy in the movie !!! More about the director gives the message that no one is going to get justice from the police !!! then everyone should cheat the cheats !!!! or forget justice !!!! Music by Bapi-Tutul and Dhruv Dhalla is OK ... Nothing much to say about other sectors ... Bad script destroys everything ... not even the performance of Anupam Kher manages to make at least one vasool vasool ...
