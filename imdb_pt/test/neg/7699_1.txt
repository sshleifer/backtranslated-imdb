This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen, it did not leave out a single clich√© that could be imagined about a Hollywood called Thriller. The protagonist is a loving father and a private investigator who is engaged in a special task: figuring out if a movie suspected of "snuff" is real. <br /> <br /> Certainly, he gets more and more deeply involved, directed by Mexicans) & sex theaters are his field of investigation as he is looking for the woman killers in the movie "snuff". Assisted by an employee of the "smart" sex shop (he read a book), he is approaching a killer bondage movie producer and his personal perverts who are responsible for the movie ... ... and what you expect ? They are portrayed as simple evil, with no need for explanations, origins, history: they are the bad ones, and he is the purifier. Bang. Assassin of the assassins. End of the movie. This is bad? Yes, I'm afraid so. Ironically, "machine" (the mega-pervert that killed) is even pointing to its ridiculous character: In the last scene, our hero forces "machine" to postpone the leather mask (yes of course that he is using one) and recognizes that the "machine" looks like the normal guy from 8/8 of the street. So "machine" says: "blablabla I'm not a monster, my parents never abused me, I had a nice childhood, I just love doing what I do!" <br /> <br /> I just love killing people. Yes, of course, "everyone loves killing people" (Bender). It's not just the total lack of character that made this movie so annoying, but it's also ugly "I have to kill these people" - an attitude that makes you sick. In one scene, our hero tied one of the killers and tried to shoot him ... but he can not. So, what does he do? He calls the mother of the dead woman, says that her son is dead and asks if she loved her son so much that she wants to see the dead killers. The mother cries yes, she loves her son, he returns to the killer bound and kills him. To get to the point: this movie is breathing the dirty air of linchamb supporters (certainly the police play no part in this), morally ridicules against pornography, does not take its characters seriously and Wasting your time with a stupid plot. Probably the only good thing about this movie is that it does not try to pseudo-psycho-analyze ... even that would be too much plot. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this. <Br /> <br />
