My wife rented this movie and then conveniently never got to see it. If I want to torture her, I'll make her watch this movie. I watched a lot of movies with my 4 year old son and I can get almost everything. Barney is refreshing after a photo of Quigley. Plot, dialogue, cinematography and acting were one step above (or equal to) a cheap porn movie. I feel stolen for $ 3.69 we paid to rent it and then 90 minutes of my life I will never go back. I'll say that my 4 year old son liked it, thankfully it was a rental we had to return immediately. <br /> <br /> I just hope the careers of the younger actor are not ruined by being in this movie.
