This would have to be considered one of the worst movies of all time. The film screened at the Italian Film Festival in Melbourne, Australia. After screening, not only did I want my money to be repaid, I also wanted the 1.5 hours wasted in my life. I have a very broad tolerance level when it comes to the indulgences of some European films, but this is one of those films that are selected for festivals based solely on the filmmaker's reputation. This film is proof that while such selections can satisfy the egos of the filmmaker and the screening panel, there is absolutely no joy to the audience. There is no development of any character, the plot is a distorted mess, the style is meaningless, the selection of footage is terrible, and the editing is worse. At the end of the first roll, you wonder if you went into the wrong movie and at the end of the third roll, you're begging to get kicked out of your misery. This movie is an abomination.
