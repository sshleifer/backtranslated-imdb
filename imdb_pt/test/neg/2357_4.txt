Human Trafficking is purely an experience 'is there, done that'? Only this time it's pretty soft. <br /> <br /> Key topics explored are paranoia, male impotence and jealousy ?? but only slightly and badly. <br /> <br /> Much of the film seems to want to imitate Trainspotting (drug culture / clubbing)? but does not include the down times / landslides Trainspotting deals with (eg, problems with death / dependency, etc.). Does he still try to come up with a monologue similar to Ewan McGreggor's classic "Choose Life" speech? but `the milky bars are in me! Yes!' ??? What's the fudge that's all about?! The characters try to analyze their lifestyle, but when their lifestyle is so superficial? their analysis becomes boring and repetitive. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack (for a movie that is trying to be cool) is pathetic. Includes the likes of Fat Boy Slim and CJ Bolland ?? come on guys ?? good dance music It's better than that! <br /> <br /> The characters become annoying and irritating (especially in the middle of the movie) and the lack of care for the characters soon begins. <br /> Are there any funny scenes? But they are few and far between. The mother taking the child in the room was very amusing. <br /> <br /> But PLEASE ?? I'm sick of the death of the Star Wars analogy scenes. I thought it was much sharper in some Kevin Smith films (ie: Clerks and Chasing Amy). According to the characters? Yoda is a drug addict and that's why he's short and bald ?? huh? <br /> <br /> My score? 4 out of 10 ?? do yourself a favor and see Trainspotting or Go!
