Give H.G. Lewis points: He managed to incorporate exotic and burly dancers, gallons of his notorious fake blood, and Henny Youngman into a single movie. "The Gore Gore Girls" was the swan song from Lewis's horror film, and ends with a head being crushed by a car. Oh ... Henny plays a nightclub owner whose girls are victims of Lewis's butcher shop.
