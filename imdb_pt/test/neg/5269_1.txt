"Ordinary Decent Criminal" is based on the exploits of Martin Cahill, which was once the subject of John Boorman's 1998 film The General. Cahill had a difficult upbringing in a slum area and graduated from small crimes to hand-armed assault with honors. He justified his criminal career by pointing out his poor past at every opportunity. This is a common excuse for criminals who conveniently ignore the thousands of slum dwellers who do not seek to steal post offices and sell guns to survive. Cahill made fools of the police and local authorities, not to mention the IRA, which earned him a kind of "Folk Hero", in addition to making him many enemies. However, he was basically an amoral and selfish thief. <br /> <br /> My main problem with "ODC" is that the protagonist is considered a lovely Irish rascal. Kevin Spacey does a good job portraying Michael Lynch with a mixture of oily charm and silent threat, but the character is too amoral and selfish to be seen as any kind of hero, even an anti-hero. <br /> <br /> The film is well filmed and well represented by a good cast, but what it leaves down is the script. The writer Gerard Stembridge can not decide; is he writing an Irish "Lock Stock" or a tougher treatment of Martin Cahill's thieving career? This is the problem when a writer bases his central character on a real person. <br /> <br /> It is also unfortunate that "ODC" followed the movie release of John Boorman's "The General," which was a more accurate portrayal of Martin Cahill's story. Cahill was a cunning thief who knew the value of good publicity, so it is not surprising that his exploits had the treatment of the film. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is that a studio was prepared to take Cahill's story and give it a Happy Hollywood ending. Kevin Spacey's charismatic-lynx-thief-thief, Michael Lynch, becomes anonymous on his motorcycle at "ODC". In the real world, Martin Cahill was executed by the IRA, only to prove that no one is a fool of an obsolete, sectarian and corrupt para-military organization and shuns it. The real Cahill would never have turned away from his notoriety because he reinforced his self-image of "People's Man." Having Michael Lynch give up everything to avoid death in "ODC" is a final escape for a weak and superficial film.
