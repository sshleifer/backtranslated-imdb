Living in Edinburgh, and I have a great thirst for history, I was very impressed with the liberty taken. Wrong dog race for a start !! The owner of Bobbys, Old Jock, was an old, single man who came to Edinburgh and died like a homeless, not like in the movie. For anyone coming to Edinburgh and hoping to see the locations of the film, you will not find the cemetery in Princes St Gardens !! There were times when fabrics would have been great. The actors were fantastic in extending a rather fragile script. I do not feel that poor little Bobby really has enough time on the screen, possibly due to being "lost" at one point. All that said, the movie was fine and any 8 year old will like it.
