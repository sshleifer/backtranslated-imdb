An airplane carrying employees of a large biotech company - including the CEO's daughter - descends into dense forests in the Pacific Northwest. When the search and rescue mission is canceled, CEO Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen) gathers a small, disorganized group to perform his own search and rescue mission. But what is Knowles looking for and trying to rescue, and only what follows them and observes them in the forest? <br /> <br /> Oy, what a mess that movie was! It was a shame because, on the one hand, it stars Lance Henriksen, who is one of my favorite actors of the modern genre, and two, could easily have been a decent movie. It suffers from two major flaws, and it's probably the writer / director's fault Jonas Quastel - this movie (which I'll call by your aka from Sasquatch) has the worst issue I've ever seen alongside Alone. in the Dark (2005), and Quastel's constant advice to the cast seems to have been, "Okay, let's try again, but this time I want everyone to talk to each other, improvise no strings and generally try to be so annoying as possible ". <br /> <br /> The potential was there. Despite the fraudulent aspects (any material related to the plane crash was obviously attempting The Blair Witch Project (1999) and any material related to the titular monster was Predator (1987)), Ed Wood's exposition and ridiculous dialogue, the plot had potential and promise for more subtle subtexts and much less saccharine. The monster costume, once we actually got to see it, was more than enough for my liking. The mix of character types walking through the forest might have been great if Quastel and fellow writer Chris Lanning had turned down the stereotypical slot from 11 to at least 5 and spent more time exploring their relationships. The monster's "lair" had a beautiful production design, specifically the corpse decorations winged by a more primitive Jeepers Creepers (2001). Had it been well edited, there were some decent dialogue scenes that could have been easily effective. <br /> <br /> But the most scary thing about Sasquatch is the number of mistakes made: For some reason, Quastel thinks it's a good idea to split dialog scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time , so that we can see some lines from scene A, some lines from scene B, then back to A, back to B and so on. <br /> <br /> For some reason, he thinks it's a good idea to use black screens often between snippets of dialogue if we need the idea of ​​an unspecified period of time between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after another on time anyway. <br /> <br /> For some reason, he does not care if the scenes were filmed in the morning, afternoon, middle of the night, etc. It just cuts to them randomly. Incidentally, the scenes shown appear to be randomly selected. Important events never or hardly appear, and we are stuck in many senseless scenes. <br /> <br /> For some reason, he left a scene about rock art in the film when it needs more exposure to justify getting there, or needs to be cut, because it is not so important (monster intelligence and "humanity" could easily have been shown otherwise). <br /> <br /> For some reason, there is a whole character - Mary Mancini - left the script even though it is superfluous. <br /> <br /> For some reason, all of a sudden, we go to an extremely gentle porn scene, even if the motive is never repeated again. For some reason, the characters continue to call Harlan Knowles "Mr. H," as if they were Asian domestic stereotypes. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Quastel insists on using "Blurry". Cam "and" Distorto-Cam "to the monster's attacking scenes, even if the costume does not look so bad, and it would have been much more effective to put a fog, a subtle filter or anything other than a bad cinematography. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but you got the idea. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie better than me? I'm a Henriksen fan, I'm intrigued by it, I loved it. scenery, I love to hike and this is basically a walking movie on one level - but I just could not.Every time I thought "it was going to be better from that point to the end," Quastel made another horrible move.In the end, my score was 3 out of 10.
