This is a pale imitation of "officer and a gentleman." There is no chemistry between Kutcher and the unknown that plays his love interest. The dialogue is made of wood, the commonplace situations. It is very long and the climax is anti-climatic (!). I love the USCG, your men and women are fearless and tough. The action scenes are incredible, but this movie does not do much to recruit, I fear. The script is stereotyped but confusing. Is Kutcher's character trying to redeem himself for an accident that was not his fault? Costner is furious at the death of light, but why? His "conflict" with his wife is as deep as a puddle of mud. I saw this preview for free and certainly felt that I got the value of my money.
