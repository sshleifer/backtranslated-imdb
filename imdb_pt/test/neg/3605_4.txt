That may sound weird, but I just got to see the first movie (The Emperor's New Groove, yaddayadda) a week ago and just because of an episode of the TV show. I just love Kuzco's character, but Kronk is not that bad. Anyway, I decided to watch the second movie, just to see. I hoped it was as good as the first, but ... I'm sorry to say that, but the more American humor I became, the more I yawned. I agreed with Kuzco when he started to cry seeing all the extravagant images. <br /> <br /> Still, younger kids and probably veterans will also love this movie in pieces (if they like the old school that is moralizing at Disney), but I just had expectations that were a little more than they should have been Kronk is a lovely character, being good-hearted and stupid at the same time, but it was Pacha and Kuzco who woke me up at the end of the movie. (I'll ignore Rudy ... as far as I can) <br /> <br /> Anyway, great movie, it's not my style and, as they say, you always have to be true to your rhythm.
