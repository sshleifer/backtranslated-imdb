This year's Eurovision was a great disappointment to me. I've watched the Eurovision Song Contest every year since 1986 (well, at least that's the oldest I can remember, and I was only 2 at the time). As in any other year, it contained good, bad and horrible songs - nothing new there. However, this year's show was the worst I can remember. Just very few good songs (decent probably more like that) and a lot of absolutely terrible songs. <br /> <br /> Turkey's winning song "Every Way That I Can" sounded to me like a steal from Turkish singer Tarkan's. press "Simarik", sounding much worse. I did not deserve to win from my point of view. The Belgian song "Sanomi", secondly, was music without language. Imagine what comes next? Animals singing? However, the music for the song was quite captivating, giving the music a kind of dreamy feeling, for which the "lyrics" seemed appropriate. One of the best songs, but that's not saying much. <br /> <br /> After one of the closest races in Eurovision history, the Russian duo t.A.T.u. finished third only three points behind Turkey and behind Belgium with "Ne Ver, Ne Boisia" ("Do not trust, do not be afraid"). For me t.A.T.u. was one of the few highlights of the show, surprising almost everyone to be some of the most covered girls of all women's competitions. They let their music speak and if we ignore the fact that they failed to play a few times in the first chorus they let the music speak very well. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise when looking at the music. score was Austria. Bookmakers here in Denmark had the greatest odds on that song - a song that was in fact horrible - but ended up in 8th place. Could it be that bum of his being shaken to the rhythm of music? This performance was what made me and my family laugh more, not because it looked good but because it looked so stupid that it was really fun. <br /> <br /> Sweden did what it did best; ABBA. In 1999, they won with "Take Me To Your Heaven," sounding like ABBA. In 2001, they made the top 10 with "Listen To Your Heartbeat," sounding again as ABBA, and once again this year they made the ABBA style, once again finishing in the top 10. <br /> <br /> England went finally punished for making those absolutely horrible songs that did not pick up, which have been in recent years. <br /> <br /> Ireland kicked off the 2000 winner, "Fly On The Wings Of Love." And I could keep talking about how bad the songs were. <br /> <br /> I feel a little sorry for the Australians, who this year finally had the chance to see the Eurovision Song Contest. They deserved more than that. <br /> <br /> I was not surprised by the show. The Eurovision 2000 for me stands out as one of the best in recent years. 2001 was very good but not so good. 2002 was good, but certainly not more. This year was simply disappointing. <br /> <br /> Let's hope it gets better next year. If it were not for us, at least for the Australians. <br /> <br /> 4/10. One for t.A.T.u., one for the fierce contest, one for the trepidation and one for all the others.
