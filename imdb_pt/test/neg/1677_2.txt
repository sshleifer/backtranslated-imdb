This movie just does it in cgi I mean science fiction really they did the original '' BATS '' it is better not to use CGI as the sequel. in this movie is the simple people running from mutant killer bats. and really bats in Afghanistan?! the plot involves US soldiers finding a terrorist and being attacked by bats and dying <_ <but the reason I gave this movie 3 stars is because the camera brings the soldiers closer together. the acting is bad and this does not even look like a horror movie. Throughout this film is a pretty good TV movie for the science fiction channel. but if you like science fiction movies, you'll like this movie because you like channel 43 oh and if you fall asleep during the movie do not be surprised. Oh sorry, I think I give 2 stars instead.
