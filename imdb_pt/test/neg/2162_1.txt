I received this film from my uncle who released him with a DVD magazine. It's easy to understand why he was so willing to get rid of it. Now I understand that this is a B movie and that it does not have the same budget size as larger movies but surely they could have spent their money in a better way than doing this crap. There are some pretty good performances, like Jack, Beth and Hawks, but others are ridiculously bad (droid killer for example). This movie also contains the worst fighting scene I have ever seen. The amount of nudity in the film made it look more like a porn movie than a science fiction movie at times. <br /> <br /> In conclusion - Horrible movie
