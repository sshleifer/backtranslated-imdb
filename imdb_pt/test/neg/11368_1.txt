This was the worst TV movie I've ever seen. The look was so agitated that it made me dizzy. I hated the constant zoom in and zoom out, and the frequent Black and White to Color. I also thought the story made no sense, and it was another action movie clich√©, with a hero a bad guy and some hostages. Could I make a better movie with my own camera, why? I can hold on tight, something the director could not do. Above all truly the worst I've ever seen, did you think Disney was bad? I did not even bother watching the whole thing, because I'm sure I could guess the result, and the look was the worst I've ever seen.
