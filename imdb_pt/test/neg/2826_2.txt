I wrote an essay in 1981, the year I graduated from high school, called "the last American virgin." I also had a friend named Nancy who was the prostitute in this movie. Apparently, her daughter took my essay one night when she slept in my house. a year later I wake up one morning and see the ad for this movie. I was 18 years old and based the essay on experiences of my life. the film is a bit different from my essay, but definitely taken from it. I had no proof of this, except my English teacher, Mr. Versace, who gave me an A in my essay. I let it go and never did anything about it. I realized what's going on there. I still would not accept anything. action against anyone involved in this film. I just needed to get it off my chest, as I never really told anyone about it except my best friend and they agreed to keep it a secret. The same year I saw Nancy in a market, she really had the guts to ask me if I had good stories or scripts for her to look at. I think it's all about Hollywood, getting stories from wherever you can. But it was interesting to see parts of my life on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Ghostwriter!
