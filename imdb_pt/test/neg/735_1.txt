Horrible, terrible, terrible. The actors are bad, the music is ridiculous and the footage pathetic. I rented the DVD and had to force myself to watch it to the end. <br /> <br /> My advice: read the book, it's much better and you will not have to endure all those silly images and ridiculous dreams that Catherine has. <br /> <br /> I do not think I've ever seen such a bad movie.
