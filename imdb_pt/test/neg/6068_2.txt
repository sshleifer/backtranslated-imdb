For a movie that I was really looking forward to, I was very disappointed. I had no expectation that this was another Amadeus, but I had expected a more significant portrait of Beethovens in the last few years. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris's performance was superb, but the plot was so weak that the film simply shifted from one dark scene to another without continuity. <br /> <br /> The only nice part of the movie for me was the presentation on the 9th, and from that point on I might as well have left without finishing. <br /> <br /> I left very dissatisfied and still feel that something important was forgotten.
