As a young girl, the beautiful Joan Woodbury (as Rita Adams) was orphaned after her father's "pigeon" was shot to death. As a young man, Woodbury finds himself struggling to keep a job, as the ex-convicted status of his murdered father makes Woodbury a bad business deal. Woodbury Chambers with the understanding of singer Linda Ware (as Donna Andrews), who advises Woodbury to contact the old friends of the orphanage John Archer (as Bob Elliott) and Jack La Rue (as Mickey Roman). But none of her friends can help when Woodbury is the victim of a fraud, which puts her in jail. After the release, Woodbury decides to give male mobsters a run for their money? <br /> <br /> Re-titled "Gangs, Inc.," this is a maverick melodrama, obviously weak and cheap. Still, it's really fun to see Woodbury do wonders with inferior material. She plays the innocent "Rita", more and more sophisticated, convincingly; and, she plays a bit like a blonde prostitute. Woodbury should be added to the list of unfortunately underutilized Hollywood actresses of the past. "Paper Bullets" also features one of the first Alan Ladd (as Jimmy Kelly, also known as Bill Dugan). Ware, who sang the hit "An Apple for the Teacher" with Bing Crosby, sings well in the '40s. But mostly, it's the Woodbury show. (1941) Phil Rosen ~ Joan Woodbury, Linda Ware, Alan Ladd
