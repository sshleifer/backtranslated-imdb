OK, first, there may be a SPOILER here, since I do not know what it means to give a lot of information. My subject line says it all, but sure enough people will wonder WHY this is so stupid. <br /> <br /> First, this movie follows a group of Yuppies who go to a sports game in Chicago, but end up having wrong output and liquidation in the ghetto. Scary, eh? Well, first of all, Emilio is leading everyone in the most exaggerated RV / Winnebago in the world, cheated with satellite dishes and crap like these on him. So these guys are going to a sports game (I forgot which ones, though probably the Bulls or the White Sox, since they're close to the ghetto so scary), but they can not even get off the freeway without having a center onboard display command that would embarrass ESPN. However, they are smart enough to make money that would pay for the material, but they are sports fans who do not even know which way out to go on the road to the game they both love. <br /> <br /> I gave up the movie within half an hour after that, but the reasons were plentiful. They end up in the ghetto, but their main danger to their existence is DENIS LEARY. A white guy. I'm not racist, but come on. In anything that HIGHLIGHTS reality - and this movie was trying to be an urban nightmare - Denis Leary would not be trying to kill Emilio Estevez, he would be hitchhiking to get Dodge's own penis !!! <br /> <br /> This is easily one of the dumbest movies ever created, though I'm not familiar with much of the rest of the world cinema. If MST3K was still on, they certainly would have dedicated an episode to it.
