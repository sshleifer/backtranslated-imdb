Well I like to watch bad horror movies because I think it's interesting to see the stupidity and inability of creators to shoot seriously bad movies. (I always compare these movies with - for example - a few Spielberg works and again and again I do not understand the huge difference in what I see.) I like Ed Wood movies because it is so inept that it's very funny. But the people !!! "The Chilling" is not funny or even "interesting." It's EXTREMELY NICE horror movie without ANYTHING that makes even bad watchable movies. There is no acting, no script, no direction, no emotions and not even blood. It's an extremely inept amateur movie. It's definitely the worst movie I've ever seen (and I've seen many "worst movies" - believe me). I warned you !!! 1/10
