As CURSE OF THE KOMODO was for the creature feature genre, Jim Wynorski's CHEERLEADER MASSACRE is a parody of slasher films, such as SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE. A psychopath who escaped from his padded cell (he was sent to the hospice thanks to the murder of eleven people) is working across the Bobcat County mountain range, attacking anyone within reach. A van of cheerleaders, your teacher, two equipment hands and the driver are on their way to a competition when your vehicle runs out of fuel while you're catching a supposed shortcut to avoid having to backtrack. Fortunately, the group finds a cabin ahead, but is the victim of a killer who attacks each victim, one by one. The loose psychopath in the county could not have killed a girl because she was in the dressing room of the cheerleaders while he was somewhere else, which means someone among his own is to blame. Meanwhile, the county sheriff and his deputy pursue their psychopath's whereabouts, while trying to find the location of the squad of missing cheerleaders. <br /> <br /> Filmed cheap on video, Wynorski does what he can with the limited budget having to find clever ways of murdering off-screen characters without the luxury of adequately effective special effects. In other words, many melons were stabbed, the sound effect used to inform us that certain victims were carried into darkness by a gloomy and dying hand. Wynorski incorporates a scene from SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE about the character of Brinke Stevens, Linda, being chased by a killer with a drill (... that killer and Linda, both dead, but I think Wynorski wanted to connect his movie to that, although quite bad ) .. it was still good to see her, even if it was a glorified cameo. Tamie Sheffield, like Hendricks, the troubled schoolteacher, has a long scene of bathing in the shower soaping her naked body and fake breasts. The girls who make up the cheerleaders are a bit unconvincing because they are obviously in their twenties. Soft-core porn star Samantha Philips (as a cop who is attacked by the psychopath she's looking for) and Nikki Fritz (a climber who is victimized while running on a dangerous bridge) does not surprisingly need to undress. . Wynorski veterinarians Bill Langlois Monroe (.. as Sheriff Murdock) and Melissa Brasselle (.. as a detective who assists Murdock in his case) contribute to the sub-plot of the search for serial killer McPherson by John Colton. Interesting enough, McPherson's story serves as a McGuffan as, in fact, the movie's meat is dedicated to the cheerleading group and its dangerous situation. I'm not sure if slasher fans are going to embrace this movie because it takes a lot of time for the killings to die down and when they eventually come on the scene, the violence is not potent or shocking enough to satisfy.
