Let's face it, this is a very bad movie.However, if you get ready to make fun of that you can survive the experience.Okay, you will scream a lot in agony. African jungle in a dopey way. Tom Conway (who spends most of the film wearing a rather strange hat) is using the local wizard and mad science to create a "perfect" being. It looks like a program that has already passed six weeks. Drunk and dressed in a bag. The ugly is being kind. But he will not kill for it, because he is using a good girl as a theme. He needs a bad girl. <br /> <br /> Marla English and Lance Fuller are two little thugs in search of African gold. Lessons from English to English should be at the top of the search list. She is a bad girl and lets everyone know her in a performance worthy of a high school play. "Connors is the English white guide & Fuller con in leading the expedition. English and Conway finally meet and it's a game made in hell. She's the perfect subject to b ecome her voodoo creature because she will do anything (stress anything) to get what she wants.You will do anything to stop the agony of this movie right now. <br /> <br /> What made this movie interesting to me was Conway wearing that funky hat tribal / tiara / floral piece! Still trying to figure out what kind of dead animal he was. I think he thought if he pulled him down enough on his eyes no one would recognize him. <br /> <br /> Truly bad cinema.
