This movie is simply horrible, the movie lasted only an hour and for about 25mins of the movie were just random useless random snowboards that did not even connect to the movie. The plot is completely "retarted", my 5 year old cousin could probably write a better script. I do not understand how anyone could fund the production of such a movie ... horrible. This is definitely the most horrible movie I have ever seen in my entire existence. I think the casting director just got some random kids off the street to play in this movie. Directing, acting, producing and writing for this movie are really bad. I feel bad for people who have spent money to finance this garbage. You could not pay me to watch that crap again.
