Too bad this movie is not. While "Nemesis Game" is mildly entertaining, I found it difficult to suspend my disbelief throughout the film, especially the situations in which Sara was getting into. We should believe this: <br /> <br /> 1) is this hot girl going to collapse unarmed around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels in the middle of the night just to solve some puzzles? <br /> <br /> 2) The protagonists are supposedly such experts that they play puzzling games for fun, but do not put the whole puzzle "I Never Sin" together until the end ... and then ... and then. .. Take this ... does she have to do the whole thing from the mirror to finally put the pieces together? I know it was the filmmaker's device to show the audience what was going on, but did they really think we were so stupid? <br /> <br /> 3) When Vern and Sara go to Chez M to question the blonde, there is not a topless girl in the whole building. Anything. Come on. I know it's Canada, but I would expect more from a country that gave us Shannon Tweed. <br /> <br /> And anyone else noticed that when Vern was surfing the internet and discovered that riddlezone site, that when he passed the cursor was an arrow, and it did not turn into a little hand (LIKE ALL THE CURSORS DO WHEN CLICK ON HYPERLINK)?!? I mean, if you want the internet to play such a prominent part in your movie, at least hit the small stuff. Wow.
