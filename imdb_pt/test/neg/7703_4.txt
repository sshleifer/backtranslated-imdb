Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of Abbie Hoffman and read Steal this Book and Steal this Urine Test. I'm also an even bigger fan of Jerry Rubin. But his film was a pile of crap that made a very generic version of Abbie Hoffman. The director had no chance to make Abbie Hoffman interesting in this movie. They disdained Stew Albert as a cheeky cartoon geezer devoid of intelligence, the man was a teacher at Berkley for the believers. Ok, they did a horrible job for Anita Hoffman, they did a horrible job for the character Jerry Rubin. I just think the movie does not fit into the news flashes I saw of Abbie or the books he wrote. The movie just did not fit and bothered me. Oh yeah and theat is the worst voice I've ever heard of Richard Nixon. This is one of the few movies I've ever rented that I could not sit through because I have a crush on Abbie Hoffman and her Yippie band and this movie was just plain bad. And it pained me to know that now, when people watch a movie about yippies, they will see a terrible fit and will not have a true sense of reality. Instead, they get a hollywoodized palanthra of crap. <br /> <br />
