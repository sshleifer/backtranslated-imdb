Why was this movie made? Are producers so easily fooled by the sadists that they will give them money to create torture methods like this so-called "movie"? I love a bad movie as much as the next masochist, but "Cave Dwellers" is pushing it. It is seriously painful to physically watch. The plot is something about a face name Actor - a numbnuts buffed up I'll refer to as Private Snowball for the rest of this review - you have to fight invisible warriors and rescue a princess in order to beat the bad guy you need Find a better hairdresser. I could have misunderstood the plot since it's been a while since I've seen this excrement, but really, do you care that much? Oh yeah, Private Snowball also has a dumb Asian partner (who does not?). Who's not funny? <br /> <br /> Anyway, Private Snowball fights invisible people, visits some caves, all in the name of a good king, without personality, he makes Al Gore look like Jim Carrey. So Private Snowball builds a hang glider (yes, I'm serious) and picks up the girl. Yippie-kee-yay It's cheap, unintentionally silly and boringly boring. Why am I not surprised that the director ended up making porn? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: AVOID. Actor will steal a part of your life and you will not have funny "so-bad-they-good" effect phrases to take with you from the experience. Bad Actor! BAD! Aak! gags
