Fortunately brief mystery about a telephone operator who is discovered the kidnapped daughter of a railroad tycoon. The discovery brings an attempt in his life that is frustrated by Charlie Ruggles as a "crime deflector." Things take a turn for the dangerous when everyone ends up at the title site and another attempt is made on the girls' lives. Your enjoyment in this film will depend on your tolerance for the Rugggles and its absurdity. I usually like Ruggles, but there was something about that role that got in the wrong way. In fact, I think it did not help the fact that the mystery was not very good, so there was nothing but the characters to keep him watching. yes the end on the train was exciting but it did not make up for everything it was before. Not worth looking for, but if you stumble, try it.
