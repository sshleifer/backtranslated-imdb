This is a classic B movie that you would rather not waste your time and see. It all started well and I thought it would grow like a good thriller, but I was confusing. All the long movie you have the feeling that soon something interesting will happen and suddenly it will turn into a tense thriller, but that does not happen. Run slowly and peacefully to the end, without anything interesting. Only the ending was unexpected and original, but that's it. Vote: 2.5 out of 10. Oh, one more thing. Why is this movie rated R?
