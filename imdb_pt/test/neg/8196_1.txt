One night, on an independent channel famous for viewing off-the-wall movies, it aired this monstrosity. Though tempted to turn it off, we watched the bitter end, hoping to see some semblance of redemptive value. Unfortunately, there were none. Absolutely nothing. The quality of the film was cheap; the soundtrack was muddy; the issue was ridiculous. Then again, there was precious little to save. After a few minutes of the medical character of Cameron Mitchell narrating about some of his patients, the viewer is tortured by no plot, pathetic writing, terribly terrible acting and a total lack of cohesion and continuity. The rotten cherry on top of this fetid confusion was the most horrific of "special effects" and "make-up" to disgrace the screen, even for television. The main character stumbles on his paper in a rubber mask and a pair of dishwasher gloves that appear to have been dipped in glue and rolled into beads. Perhaps the poor lighting and good quality of the film were trying to cover up how bad makeup was for the tenth. We can only hope that at least one deliberate decision has been made in the course of this hopelessly amateur video. Seriously, a handful of three-year-olds could have produced a better project. In the end, poor Mr. Mitchell returns (as he must have been desperate for money!) And eliminates some nonsense that is supposed to connect that pile of shit with the AIDS epidemic. Please spare yourself and your loved ones the inhuman cruelty of sitting down with it. It was so bad that even the Mystery Science Theater 3000 could not save it.
