This is a bad excuse for a movie. A noir movie made by Busbee Berkeley? Please! First, let's forget the plot, a truly simple version of a cynical and tough guy turned into a saint by the love of a beautiful blonde. Yechh So, what drives you to despise you for loving you? Along with a bunch of other guys, it helps prevent a kid from drowning while they all swim in a water tower and try to survive while the water is sucked, stranding them. It is not exactly heroism, but it is suddenly wounded. It's really painful to see Claude Rains trying to portray a tough, tough-talking cop and noir. A crooked grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting tool, along with a growling voice. Most of his energy seems to try to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles. As he was convinced to accept this work, I will never understand. Enjoy, if you can, for some period details, old cars and gas pumps, but do not expect a decent cinematic experience. Wasted 1-1 / 12 hours of my life.
