After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, "The Eastside Kids": Leo Gorcey (as Muggs), Bobby Jordan (as Danny Connors), Huntz Hall (as Glimpy), David Gorcey (as Peewee) , Ernest Morrison (as Scruno) and Bobby Stone (as Skinny) want to serve their country. But both the Army and the US Navy reject them as too young. Still wanting to "overthrow about a million Japanese," the "boys" attack an Asian official, who turns out to be Chinese. The unfortunate incident, however, led the gang to help discover really nasty Japanese and German people. If "too young" is defined as "under the age of 21," only Mr. Jordan and Mr. Stone would be rejected for military service. But it is possible that the recruiters have been cut off by the ways of office displayed by Mr. Gorcey and Mr. Hall. "Let's get tough!" was made during what the script accurately describes as "open season in Japanese" - for this and other reasons, it did not age well. It's a wasted effort, but regulars play deftly, with Tom Brown moving the plot, like Jordan's spy brother. <br /> <br /> Let's get tough! (5/29/42) Wallace Fox ~ Leo Gorcey, Bobby Jordan, Tom Brown
