Right now I'm watching this movie on TV here in Tokyo. Beautiful landscapes, beautiful sets of biblical proportions, beautiful costumes, beautiful colors, beautiful Gina. Great climactic scene when God destroys the Sheban idol and more with Millean's rays as Yul and Gina are about to consummate their love. Yul does a decent job of delivering his lines, although it sounds a lot like Yul delivering his lines like Ramses or Taras Bulba. George Sanders looks like George Sanders playing George Sanders. Given the limited range of acting she is called upon to show in this role, Gina does a good job, although by the time the film ends, she is completely converted into a modest demure girl and it looks like she may be playing a biography of the mother . Teresa. I think lightning will do that to you, but it's almost breathtaking how quickly she discards her own beliefs for her new religion. Supporting players are mostly terrible, with no credible emotion and time. The usual big battle scenes, which went through lascivious dances in 1959, and an orchestra casting many trumpets behind a huge chorus singing many "Ah's," but none of that top-quality Hollywood. The final swords fight between Brynner and Sanders is at the low skill level of a high school play. The film is a large piece of eye drops, but not much more.
