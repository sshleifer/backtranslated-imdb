OMG, another bad movie by Larry Buchanan. That guy did not learn to stop, did he? First, he offers us science fiction films with zero budget and lies about famous dead people, and now he is exploiting the Loch Ness Monster as being cruel. <br /> <br /> The "plot" is basically about some Southerners in the country. USA pretending to be Scottish camping in Loch Ness. Oh, in the fishing hole, opa, I mean Lake Loch Ness, there's an inflatable monster named Nessie, doing everything to kill people for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the MST3K team has never heard of this movie. Yeah, it's so bad.
