This is the first and as far as I can tell, the only complete production of "Heart of Darkness" ever released. Before beginning with "Citizen Kane," Orson Welles shot some test footage of a version of "Heart of Darkness" that would be filmed entirely in what would now be called "POV", where we would see everything from the point of view of the main character Charlie Marlow; he would be seen only fleetingly in mirrors, windows, water, etc. The movie was never made. The "POV" technique was used, not very successfully, in 1947 in "The Lady on the Lake" with Robert Montgomery starring as Philip Marlowe. Presumably, the coincidence of the two characters "Marlow (e)" is just that. Of course Francis Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" was based on "Heart of Darkness". <br /> <br /> The little romance "Heart of Darkness," by the Polish writer Joseph Conrad, first published in a British literary publication. magazine in 1899, features one of his favorite alter egos, the captain of the ship Charlie Marlow, who also tells the tale "Youth" and indirectly tells the story of "Lord Jim." Marlow, temporarily unemployed, decides to take on captainship of a river boat for a Belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of the resources of the personal fief of King Leopold II, the cruel State of the Free Congo. Marlow travels from London to Brussels, connects with the company, and is informed that his mission is to embark on the Congo River to a station in the hinterland, led by one of the company's most productive agents in the colony, a German named Kurtz. . Shipments of ivory, latex (for rubber production) and other products of Kurtz's station ceased, and no word came from Kurtz for a while. Rumor has it he was "native." Marlow must investigate, take the necessary steps and report on his return. It traverses the West African coast to the mouth of the Congo, postpones for weeks as it is forced to mend its boat at the company station on the coast and finally leaves upstream to find Kurtz station. The river, the heat, the vegetation, the wildlife, the insects, the people, everything affects your stamina, your imagination and your mental resources. He finds Kurtz sick, half crazy and close to death. The final encounter and death of Kurtz are almost anticlimax, especially since Conrad is so obscure about what actually happens that we are left to resolve by ourselves. This is a novel in which you close the book vaguely dissatisfied with the ending, but still value the story for its incredible atmospheres. <br /> <br /> This "Heart of Darkness" was filmed with Guyana in Central America in West Africa. . It is best when romance is at its greatest disadvantage: in fact, showing us First World urban as it would be a boat trip on a tropical river. But the rest of the movie was forgettable. Tim Roth does his best as Marlow, but much about the plot, characterizations and character relationships has changed beyond recognition as you wonder why they bothered. If the goal was to get Conrad's story to the screen, why did not they leave her alone? It's unreasonable to expect that no compromise will be made when a book is turned into a film, but so many changes have been made that for me had no cinematic justification for you to wonder if we are simply dealing with incompetent film writers and filmmakers. The most disappointing of all was John Malkovich as Kurtz. He has been completely misfiled and simply puts an end to the role. Everything about him is wrong: his appearance, his acting style, his voice, his accent, everything. A much better choice would have been someone like Bruno Ganz (unlike Malkovich, a real German, like the character). <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing production and I would recommend it only after reading the article. book if you want to depend on more than your imagination to get a visual image of a boat trip down the Congo River around 1900.
