OK, I'd give it a 1, but I'll give it a couple because I laughed while watching this movie ... First of all, I can make a much better movie than this ... in a week .. Special effects made this movie seem like a joke. You should not make movies with horrible special effects because people will not take it seriously. The acting and direction was awful, too. The script had lots of plot holes and the whole movie was not believable at all. This has to be the worst Indian movie ever. The songs were also bad. The acting was poor and artificial. I need to say more. Do not watch this movie unless you're curious to see how bad it is. That's why I watched it. I'm going to the movies and wanted to see how bad a bad movie can get. Trust me, I watched one of the worst movies in history, if not the worst movie.
