My best guess is that this work will be out on DVD before Christmas. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible. The timeline jumps all over the place. That would not be so bad if it left some suspense to the end. It was totally predictable. Girls bitches choose outcasts, outcasts wonder why they hate her so much, slutty girls die a terrible death, outcast girl goes home and looks crazy. The proscribed girl has brought evil spirits with her, makes her neighbors go crazy and kill each other. Scary boy understands what's going on. Oh, and the younger sister was not good enough for Mom, sick mother sending a younger daughter to bring the golden child home. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there were some great moments here and there. First of all, the character of Sarah Michelle Geller dies in the first few minutes. More definitive. I did not see that coming. I also did not expect the wife to put bacon fat on her husband's head. If the movie had kept this kind of emotion, I would have loved it. The beginning showed much promise. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because I liked the first one. That made me jump, I did not expect most of what happened, and although I questioned some of the movies, it was still a fun watch. I did not watch any preview for this sequence because I wanted to be surprised. I was, but in the wrong direction.
