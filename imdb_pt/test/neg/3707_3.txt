"The Capture of Bigfoot" by Bill Rebane, is one of the most terrible horror films ever made. The owner of the sawmill Harvey Olsen (Richard Kennedy) decides that Bigfoot is captured at any cost. However, local ranger Dave Garrett (Stafford Morgan) learns that Bigfoot used to live in peace disturbed by a geological expedition and set out to protect the creature. There's nothing even remotely interesting about this crap. The film is extremely boring and full of horrible songs and cheap special effects. gore, no suspense, just gigantic boredom. Avoid this horrible garbage like the plague.
