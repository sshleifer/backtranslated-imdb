As a fan of Michael Dudikoff, I sat down to watch one of his good old-fashioned actors - I'm still waiting. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on a group of American commandos trying to get away. of a bunch of Syrian terrorists who have taken over a nuclear reactor. Maddie Reese (Felicity Waterman) was an English member of the command unit and, of course, she became romantically involved with Tom Dickson (Dudikoff). I should ask since when the British had female members of the SAS - as far as I know if they are always needed, they are obtained from other sources. Even if they could, I can guarantee they would not be as wet as Maddie Reese. I also think Tom Dickson would be a little more responsible in his position - or did I miss the plot? I know there's always the romantic angle in these films, since this helps to provide the welfare factor, but it has to be all the time, especially when there are more important things to take into consideration - like nuclear war! <br /> <br /> The signing of the treaty on the US aircraft carrier intrigued me. The "sacred pen" as carried by one of TV's alleged news teams - there are no security checks to find out who or what is aboard one of these ships, especially the caliber of the people in it. Remember that if there were, I suppose there would be no history. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but when it came to the "pump bomb in the inner body" in order to safely remove a bullet I gave up on an action movie and a little drama for the comedy he really was. By the way, would a reporter really say Downtown Damascus?
