Beans, Kevin & Perry, UK TV creations that made successful transitions on the BIG screen. Now it's Ali G's turn and I'm afraid to say this is not one of them! Ali was always obscene, but funny about it. This movie was extremely sick and not funny. Scenes involving bestiality, gay sex and pedophilia should not be portrayed because of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Ali G In Da House is crap and deserves to earn very little money. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
