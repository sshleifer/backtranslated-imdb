this western / musical / comedy is not one of the best of the genre I've seen. I found it very slow.It just dragged itself to the inevitable end.I also found disjuntos.I could not wait for it to be Over.Randolph Scott is the headliner here, and Lloyd Bridges also stars.but for my money money Edgar Buchanan is the best of the group.Buchanan appeared in many westerns in his day, often providing comic relief, as he does in this photo I also liked Ann Dvorak as Rita . However, I can not think too much to recommend this movie. The film is based on a novel by Ernest Haycock, who also wrote the novel Stagecoach, which was crazy in a film of the same name in 1939, and redone in 1966 and again in 1986. The 1939 version of Stagecoach is in my opinion, one of the best movies of all time.When the city of Abilene, my vote is a 3/10
