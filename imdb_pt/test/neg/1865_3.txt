This is a very bad movie, but okay, this movie is not as bad as the third Ghoulies movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a bad movie in terms of writing, directing, acting and basically everything in between. It has a story so weak, simple and ridiculous, that besides having little to do with the previous entries of the movie Ghoulies. He tries to connect the movie with the first 1985 Ghoulies movie, but then, on the other hand, if they really wanted to connect that movie with their predecessors, then the Ghoulies were in that movie? Instead, we are now having some small people, played by Tony Cox and Arturo Gil, dressed like demons. Not that the Ghoulies of the previous films were classic characters, but they were the heart and soul of the film and also provided the movies with some fun. It's like having a Gremlins movie without the Gremlins. <br /> <br /> The movie is not really interesting to watch because it does not have tension, good humor, intriguing characters and basically everything else you can think of people who obviously are not the most talented in their business. As well as director Jim Wynorski's resume, with films such as "The Witches of Breastwick" and its sequel, "Alabama Jones and the Busty Crusade," "House on Hooter Hill," "Hot Water Bath Party," "The Bare Wench Project "and the sequels" The Bare Wench Project 2: Scared Topless "and" The Bare Wench Project 3: Nymphs of Mystery Mountain "and" The Da Vinci Coed "on it. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is pretty silly and extravagant, but that is not enough to propel this movie and gives it some more entertainment value. You know, it's the kind of cheap movie with some special effects, costumes, makeup and actors that no one has heard since. <br /> <br /> It's still not the worst movie in the series. because of the reason that "Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go to College" is by far a worse movie since it has had some horrible attempts at humor. This movie, at least, still makes a few attempts to be serious and professional, even if the end result is far from perfect. <br /> <br /> Bad movie and maybe just watchable for those who have seen the previous Ghoulies tickets. <br /> <br /> 3/10
