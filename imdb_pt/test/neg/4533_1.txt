Directly misdirected "movie" (high definition shot or betacam appears). He shouts student film / video all the way. The premise is limited in scope and the short one actually looks much longer than it runs. Some interesting acting moments and some decent production value, but not enough to get that movie out of the "hole" in which it fell.
