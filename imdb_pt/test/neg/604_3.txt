In short, this movie was disappointing and could have been shortened in twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> The acting was unsatisfactory, being the only decent actors of the Trisha group, the killer and Molly. . The music was a bit unsatisfactory but appropriate and the special effects were very overused. The story / script was poor, the unnecessary torture / romantic scenes being dragged on for too long and a disappointing ending. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the film was quite slow, the appearance of fake not much of interest. Trisha arrived at the house, and there was some premise for a good story. <br /> <br /> Trisha began to receive threatening phone calls, which increased suspense. This momentary suspense, the best feature of the film began to be built, but later the friends invaded the place, destroying all the potential suspense / horror in the film. <br /> <br /> The plot then becomes obtuse from now on. The chemistry shines between the two couples, and then the killer chooses Frank and the other girl. This scene was dragged and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The murderer then goes to Trisha and ties her. There is an exaggerated torture that lasts at least ten more minutes. Because blood is poorly done, this is not fun, and it bores more than shocks. <br /> <br /> In short, the first thirty minutes of this movie look promising, but then a poorly written dialogue and a general lack of plot. spoil this movie. 3/10.
