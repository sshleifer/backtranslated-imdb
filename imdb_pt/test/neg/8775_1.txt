Whatever the producer wanted, he made a mistake. The Lone Ranger is not camp, but "the" good icon of the whole world. And it is a total violation of the character's spirit that the only true Lone Ranger, Mr. Clayton Moore, has been banned from wearing his mask in public appearances when this movie was released. Whelp, long storyline In short, the only saving grace of this gross (and poorly done) distortion was that I had the honor of meeting Mr. Clayton Moore in Columbus, Ohio, as part of a tour resulting from the bad press about Moore's treatment. . Needless to say, Mr. Moore's character, integrity, and presence far outweighed the film. <br /> <br /> Some things can not be improved. There is only one Lone Ranger.
