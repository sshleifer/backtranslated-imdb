It is sad that Schwarzenegger was the best of this production, especially considering the fact that he had not yet settled, and was still as hard as cardboard in his dialogue. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is not as bad as some critics say, but it's also not good. It's fun and plays like a poor cousin of the Conan line, making it a conflicted, uneven and poor job. And speaking of poor, the quality is terrible, due to the time when it was filmed, but that is not the only reason. The story here is inferior, even to the Conan line, but in addition, is lost in the maneuver "Red Sonja must be dominated by the great and strong Schwarzenegger", and forgets entirely its purpose, if is that you already had one. It's fun, but low budget, guilty - Pleasure "B" kind of way. <br /> <br /> The price is 4.2 / 10 of ... <br /> The Demon :.
