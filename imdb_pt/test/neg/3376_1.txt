The ill-conceived sequel (.. the absurd idea of ​​having the snowman killer in the bustle on an island where there is no snow or cold) brings back the spirit of the psychopath, returning thanks to a scientific experiment that provides foreign elements that reintroduce life for its molecules (..is the best I could do to explain this absurd concept). <br /> <br /> I could delve into how it ends up on the island in order to kill many tourists but I just do not find reason to worry because everything would be so exhausting. Anyway, the filmmakers think it wise to kill the pretty girls, not ten minutes after their arrival (... I mean seriously, why bother to introduce them to ourselves if we can not appreciate it anymore!) < The murder scene of the "snow anvil" takes the cake. Ice pendants protrude from the sand of the beach so that the victim can fall on them. Oh, and another girl is stabbed with a pair of weenie tweezers. <br /> <br /> Look, I understood what's coming to me when I sit down to watch a killer snowman movie ... a ridiculous supernatural slasher will please your funnybone ("Oh, it's a wonderfully extravagant horror movie! ") or are you wondering why the hell are you wasting time with this nonsense? Jack Frost has the power to freeze the water (.. so how were they able to melt him in the first movie?) And makes the island resort to snow. A sequence has Jack freezing the pool water, wrapping a swimming model under the sheet, resulting in his drowning with no place to escape. Oh, there's also a re-creation of the piece of "Tongue Tied to the Cold Pole" of The Christmas Story ("Cowatonga Face." I have to hand it to the cast, though ... they're real soldiers for trying to make this miserable stuff be Christopher Allport (... perhaps recklessly) returns as Sam, to face his former enemy, as well as Eileen Seeley, as his wife. Attempts of ironic humor (.. to me at least) failed, but the soldiers of the cast trying to get the most out of a very difficult situation with witty performances, they do their best to overcome the unfortunate premise. <br /> <br /> And an unfortunate dialogue. <br /> <br /> An event occurs that increases the danger over those still are out there to face Jack, his genetically modified water molecules, thanks to the external elements introduced, allow him to support coolant / anti-freeze, and worse, he can now reproduce ... atra After indigestion, Jack cuts what appear to be snowballs that hatch to reveal little snowballs with black eyes, mouth and sharp teeth! The killer snowman costume and the snowball puppets introduced later in the movie can produce laughter if you're in the mood for these pranks, but I personally found this crappy little garbage (... that's the purpose behind it I suppose, of those who are willing to embrace this) and unbearable. The snowball offspring is an obvious homage to Gremlins, where we have a bar scene where the little bastards are celebrating in number more than terrorizing the victims at the resort. The weapon against them ... bananas! It is explained that when Jack went to kill Sam in the first film, they both fell into a truck bed filled with antifreeze (a pendant coming out of Jack's belly pierced Sam's chest as he pushed them out of the window of the truck, and I I think, being "hooked" to the ice-pendant, Jack has inherited Sam's banana allergy, that is to say, that's what we're led to believe!) and, in doing so, "merged" in a sense. /> Ufa, a movie like that challenges a simple explanation. It's a film with effects and plot so terrible that one can find the presentation pleasant because of many flaws.
