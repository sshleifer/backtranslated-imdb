I already suffered with Parts, The Clonus Horror. <br /> <br /> Having the word horror in the title of this movie is an insult to true horror. <br /> <br /> The story was about a central cloning owned by "The Man" They grow clones to harvest organs from the clones later to the original humans in need of transplants. A clone escapes, The government gets angry and kills everyone involved, but the story somehow leaks anyway. <br /> <br /> It's really shameful how a movie with potential is destroyed by amateurs like Fiveson. The only thing he really managed to do was to weave the concept of human rights and the philosophical aspect itself, which makes it a human being, and would it be right to cultivate clones for organic harvesting? Unfortunately, mediocre actors were chosen and the plot left the city, until the end where a pathetic attempt is made to summarize. <br /> <br /> But !! What disturbed me most was the introduction of new characters with no real relevance to the plot. Nevertheless, Fiveson feels the need to kill them in a bad blast, of which only Sir Coleman Francis would be proud. <br /> <br /> The scenery was interesting. Like Fiveson thought pulling plastic sheets and running water over them would make a river believable beyond me, but I think if you compare the setting with Coleman Francis's gray pasty oats, that movie would win. Maybe Coleman has changed what bad movies are to me. 3/10
