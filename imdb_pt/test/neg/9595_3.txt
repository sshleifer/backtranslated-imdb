I saw this movie yesterday on a public service channel. They had advertised it as a horrible movie, and then I was drawn to see it, and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> A group of 18-19 year olds goes to an excavation site in an old viking. castle in Denmark, to try to discover the myth of the Berserker Vikings. Strange things happen: something is in the forest, and people begin to disappear. <br /> <br /> The main thing about this movie that really bothers me is that the story should happen in Denmark where I live. There were so many places in the movie that the Hollywood style overcame the Danish reality. This really made acting and drama seem ridiculous to my eyes. <br /> <br /> You never see the characters interacting with the surroundings. It looks like a mini-Hollywood in Denmark and takes the credibility of the film. When at one point you hear someone speak "Old Danish", it sounds exactly like the Swedish modern day. Really a bad search, considering the director is from Denmark. <br /> <br /> The characters in the movie used GPS and maps, and that's very funny, since Denmark is the size of your yard. Nomatter where you are, never more than 50 km to the sea and 500 meters to civilization. And if you're in a castle, there will be tourists everywhere. We see many overviews of the forests in the film, and sometimes we see what looks like North American vegetation. (?) History did not appeal to me exactly, perhaps because the acting was so bad. When the characters see the creatures of the swamp for the first time, they are not even afraid. I think his acting skills were insufficient to display realistic emotions. In the end, there is an unexpected turnaround, but it did not impress me, since I did not really care. Swamp creatures are cheap, but they had the potential to be scary. Unfortunately, they fail, as we see them standing in the woods when the characters arrive at the castle. Also, there are no really scary scenes, as the Bogs' Creatures are mostly just standing up. <br /> <br /> Anyway, conclusion: Disregarding the facts, the movie is the typical B-horror movie. I think people from other countries can have more fun. As long as you are not aware of reality, it does not matter. Just as I think of the US as a great action movie scene, everyone can think of Denmark as a forest with a castle ... and some people killed in a swamp ..
