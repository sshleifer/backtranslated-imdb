I got into this movie really wanting to like it - it topped a film festival earlier this year, and boasted of a cast of stars. But (and you could say there was a "but" coming) is a failure of a movie. Outstanding character acting for Sarandon and Walken is destroyed by editing and supporting casting antics. Turturro's performance is mediocre and most of the comedy is exaggerated. Recurring doll shows are useless, and some scenes are completely out of place. <br /> <br /> That said, there are some wonderful moments scattered throughout the film. A genuinely touching stage moment, several of the seductions and some of the comic colors really work. Unfortunately, they are overshadowed by the diffuse and incoherent script and by some bad performances.
