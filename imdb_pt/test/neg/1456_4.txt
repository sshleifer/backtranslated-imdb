Have you ever tried a type of food that your friend did, and then said to himself, "Wow, that was not a good mix"? Well, that's how I felt after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Many viewers will be very uncomfortable with this strange mixture of crime and comedy very tacky. It's almost like seeing Mr. Rogers playing a ruthless, very strange gangster. Some things just do not mix and this movie clearly proves it. <br /> <br /> There are some very good performances here, like Dean Stockwell, Mercedes Ruhle and Alec Baldwin, all excellent, but this does not do for the lack of balance and symmetry in the film. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Demme did a great job on films like Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia but seems to be out of his element with this.
