Considering the film's reputation as really the worst of the worst, I was eager to watch Wood's Crappus Opus (my word); is not necessarily more inept than the other Woods I have seen - however, being from the film school REEFER MADNESS (1938), GLEN OR GLENDA does not look as "nice" as its genre efforts. In addition, this certainly emerges as the nadir of the horror legend Bela Lugosi (his first of three "collaborations" with the director): one wonders if he really knew what kind of film was (considering the actor's story heavy and pure medication lack of sense of their special participation). In addition, Lugosi's idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps the most embarrassing here ... although Wood's script is the main culprit - given the impossible dialogue (with repeated absurd allusions to "dog-dog" and "fat snails"), he handed the sick. Star! By the way, Wood himself plays the central role (under the pseudonym of Daniel Davis) - and being so useless in this area, proves to have been a versatile dog! Dolores Fuller - his wife and co-star - was similarly untalented (she would also appear in JAIL BAIT [1954]) ... but, at the very least, the image in which the latter finally lets Glen wear her angora sweater gave Tim's mistress Burton Biography OF WOOD ED (1994) his famous poster! Incidentally, the latter film presents a presumably fictionalized encounter between Wood and Orson Welles - well, for all intents and purposes, GLEN OR GLENDA constitutes CITIZEN KANE (1941) by Ed Wood, given his cheerful propensity to enigmatic narrative. techniques: in fact, the most basic segment of the plot is filled with plenty of stock (many of them irrelevant, such as the perplexing instances of S & M) and empty dream sequences (highlighted by the presence of a grumpy demon bearing Martin Scorsese's heartfelt attempt to tolerate and psychologically investigate the affliction / transvestite phenomenon is, however, sabotaged at every step by the amateurism of the approach. Why it's worth it, the issue I watched "Re-issue Version" which included six minutes of "depraved" scenes (directed by W. Merle Connell) censored in the original version! In addition, my copy went out of sync (which forced me to back up a bit to get the audio back on track) - though fortunately this was the fault of the source conversion to DivX as opposed to the movie itself.
