Nuff said. A police officer disguised as the state capital is sent to a small county where the moonlight rush is rampant. He ends up being kicked off the road by some local backwoods who have no idea he is a police officer in disguise (so they just drive away as happily doped as ever). He is soon being looked after by a woman and her three daughters who wear short tops and short shorts (have to love the 70s). He falls in love with one of the girls, but meanwhile he has yet to figure out who is doing all the magic and driving to all the local bars and restaurants. He also has to deal with a fat sheriff and his incompetent deputy who thinks he is the footman because he is new to town. <br /> <br /> Life in the small American city, style of the 70s. YEE HAAAAAAAAAAA.
