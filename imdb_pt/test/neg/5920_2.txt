I thought this movie was horrible. I understand it was filmed on a small budget, but the acting was terrible and the movie itself was just plain stupid. The plot was predictable and the central character was an unfriendly idiot. In fact, all the characters were unfriendly and none were fully developed. Audiences do not relate to anyone in the movie. It was supposed to be a suspense, but if you do not mind the characters, it's hard to "get" in the movie. I felt like an outsider being forced to listen to someone tell me a stupid story. All the twists in the end were a little too much - in fact, I was laughing when I think I should be "shocked." All in all, I thought it was really just a bad movie.
