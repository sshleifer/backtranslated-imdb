Oh, how I laughed during the first scenes. This little silly movie about an 11-year-old boy who carries a gun, steals cars, steals shops, breaks houses, extorts money from other children, burns houses, shoots rats, buys drugs, distributes drugs to his mother and friends, and then kill a guy What a great comedy! But it was not meant to be comedy. It was conceived as a social drama. How can this be? The events of this film are absurd and ridiculous. The characters are all stereotypes of the immature imagination induced by the comic books of a 4-year-old boy. The dialogue is laughable; People talk like idiots. It's a very stupid movie. <br /> <br /> The first scenes are actually very funny, for all the wrong reasons. But the unintentional hilarity of the stupid premise runs out after a short time, and after that the laughter rarely comes; at this point the viewer can not believe what he is seeing and is alternately surprised and bored with what follows (if he has at least half a brain cell). <br /> <br /> A short film, but it seems an eternity. The film, in fact, is a serious attempt to show the world a degenerate young man, while imitating films immensely superior to him, like "Fun". There is only an air of falsehood about everything; children, adults, all lack credibility both in their actions and in dialogue. The boy in the lead makes his way through the film as if he's seen all of Jimmy Cagney's movies at least a hundred times. And normally, the boy is not portrayed as a reservoir of evil, but as a bit of misunderstood artistic talent. But of course. Every young hooligan is misunderstood - society has done it wrong. Poor child. <br /> <br /> The film is embarrassing; a collection of obsolete clich√©s, occasionally hilarious together to make a film that lacks intelligence and meaning. The intellectual level of the film is zero.
