After watching this movie, I did not want my money back. I wanted my time back. I wanted that hour and a half back in my life - it was the most incredible and horrendous torture to know that I had wasted precious minutes of my life on this stretch. I've been scarred all my life and since this "movie" came into my life, I had trouble sleeping. I'm trying to suppress the memories, really am. . . but they make me want to burn things. <br /> <br />
