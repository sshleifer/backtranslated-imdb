Rita Hayworth is simply stunning sometimes and for me the only reason to watch this silly movie. Despite the exaggerated lipstick of the 1940s, Rita was one of Hollywood's glamorous women of all time. In fact, for a couple of years I can not imagine someone who looked better except maybe Elizabeth Taylor in her prime. <br /> <br /> Anyway, show co-star Gene Kelly does not play his normal, at least the kind of guy we all know him in "Singin 'In The Rain." Here, Kelly's "Danny McGuire" makes a lot of noise. Phil Silvers, who I loved on Sgt. Bilko's TV, is as stupid here as "Genius," you're just going to shrink listening to your stupid jokes ... and they're stupid. <br /> <br /> The visuals are good with great Technicolor, which almost looks fantastic. You also see many beautiful women here, not just Hayworth. Unfortunately, the story is not so much. It centers around Hayworth deciding on a career choice. Along the way, we have the normal wedding treatment and we have an incredibly stupid end. All in all, a memorable movie, except as a showcase for Hayworth's beauty.
