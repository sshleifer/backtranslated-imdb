Like I said, sometimes the low budget is good. You get to see a good movie without too much BS that can hide a piece of junk. Well ... that was that piece of crap. If anything, I thought I had humor, unfortunately, the mood was not intentional. The only mixed race came from Bill Smith and his part was cut (that's a joke). There was never a Bill Smith, nor was there anyone who could act. Even Gerald Okamura sucked, and he was cast in nearly 40 films. The fight scenes were comical and made me feel like I could kick all your $% # @ # $. The sound was horrible, as if all the sound were recorded on the set. My 10 year old son could have written a better script ... BTW, my 10 year old son fell asleep ... no joke. I give a B + for editing to cut the movie for only 90 minutes ... 60 minutes would have been an A +.
