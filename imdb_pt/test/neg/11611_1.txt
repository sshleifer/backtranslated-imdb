I'm not being in any way factual when I say that this movie was worse than any other movie ever made. Worse than "Batman & Robin". Worse than "Hands, hands of fate". Seriously, it's so bad. When people tell me that a movie is horrible, I use the "Two Girls" scale to find out. If the movie is comparable to "Two Girls," then I do not watch. If it's twice as good, I might watch it, but just to laugh at the laggards who paid someone to do it, because a movie twice better than this would still be a piece of crap.
