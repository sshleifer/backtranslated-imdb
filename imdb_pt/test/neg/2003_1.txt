It is very rare to see such a useless film that I, with the IMDb, allowed the use of negative scores. In fact, I reflect on this movie and really can not think of a movie that has had so little success. Acting: Your Kidding Right. No. This movie has nothing to do with whether you consider it a serious movie, this is often the case with movies of this genre, but most movies of this nature can be seen as a movie. comedy and you can laugh at how pathetic the characters and situations are and almost worth their time. This film is so empty, it can not even cater for that purpose. I have to give a -1/10, three points lower than any other movie I've ever evaluated. I really feel like the team involved in this movie should pay me for the 83 minutes I spent watching. I really do not have words to describe how bad this is. No one should watch this for any reason again.
