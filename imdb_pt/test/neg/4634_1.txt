I saw this movie and I was bored out of my head! I'm a fan of Peanuts, but I can not understand why Charles Schultz let this disaster happen! Spoilers ahead. <br /> <br /> I can not believe Snoopy would let his friends sleep on the floor in a dangerous situation and go to a bar and drink some cold without standing up! The story was complete nonsense, even for comic book characters. It takes a long time to get to France, and once they arrive in France I had the feeling that the writer (I still can not believe it was Schultz) did not know what to do when they got there. <br /> <br /> Peanuts are best done in 30-minute episodes, not in 80-minute movies. <br /> <br /> Go home Charlie Brown, you're at your best. <br /> <br />
