For any wrestling fan, this is the fight to forget. No logic for the games, some garbage tricks (doink the clown, and the giant Gonzalez) this was a somewhat overlooked PPV rare for the WWE (F). Hogan's logic winning the world title at the end did not make sense, and many people feel that they only help put the nail on the PPV. From the meaningless tricks of Roman soldiers, to simply some real bad wrestling (doink vs. Crush being the worst game) to simply combine evil (Scott "Razor Ramon vs. Bob Backlund, how can you have one of the biggest treadmill fighters making a comeback , and working his first wrestlemania, to face a power wrestler that was undefeated at the time), this is a PPV that until WWE already admitted, was well below the expected one.
