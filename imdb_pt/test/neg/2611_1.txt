This movie may have been the first Puppet Master, but it certainly bore me when I saw this stupid movie, I wanted a refund. This was a bad series for the Puppet Master and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks this was terrible. For some it was great, but for others it was a ticket for the snores - ville and boy, they're right. The puppets neither did anything nor killed people. It should not be seen by people, so I'm warning you not to see it. You'll be disappointed even with fans who love Puppet Master, it was a waste of time and did not generate much money. No one managed to kill, but one or two, very meaningless. <br /> <br /> 1/10
