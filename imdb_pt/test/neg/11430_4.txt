Following Irvine Welsh to Trainspotting reaches the screen as three short tales set in Edinburgh, all with some of the Welsh brands, drug culture, depression, working class and Hibernian football club. Restless to watch in places, is not less than very well written, 2 of the stories with a somber comic touch to them, while the 2nd story a serious (and shockingly realistic) plot to him. It will not appeal to the majority, including me to a point, but will undoubtedly adopt a following cult.
