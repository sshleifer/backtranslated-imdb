The angels of hell left the losers in this movie. Sonny told the director that NOBODY does this to the Angles and goes unpunished. His version was that the two guys should be shot to death, but their suggestion was ignored. They were inclined to appear, much less to be "technical advisors" in a stink of a movie like that. Angles of hell on JAP bikes? Come on! (although in Sonny's autobiography he says, "F # K Harley Davidson!"), and that if they were smart they would ride in Hondas. (ST1100) Read his car ... he hates Harleys. Can you imagine the angels whispering Town on their sewing machine sounding Japanese bikes? Not too intimidating. They would be ridiculed out of town.
