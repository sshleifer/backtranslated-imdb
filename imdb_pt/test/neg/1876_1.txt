This may be for those who have been to summer camps, but it sure is not an entertainment camp. I went to one before, but that did not make me shout for joy. Instead, it made my head ache. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is that Bill Murray actually had some hair in the '70s. Yeah, and he did not mind running some either. But to make him run a lot, you'd have to give him a woman to chase after. <br /> <br /> It's not that some of the acrobatics can not be funny. For example, joke with one of the aldermen who is always waking up somewhere else due to the movement of his bed. Instead, it is that the jokes and acrobatics were misconfigured and executed. He just could not be funny. <br /> <br /> For someone who loves comedy, this is a pain. Others are glued to it for life. I wish it was more like Leonard Part 6, but it does not come close. "F"
