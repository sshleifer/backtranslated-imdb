Well, making divorced American with more money than the brain buys a country house in Tuscany. (Much more money, at the same time that she has to deal with the price, she can cook sumptuous buffets for her workers and wander about Italy indefinitely, with no job or apparent means of support.) Endless boredom and unavoidable inevitable Italian lover; this is a girl movie in the most pejorative sense of the term. Lane acts like a naive, naive teenager - who comes in shock with his serious appearance - along the way, turning into a variety of cardboard stereotypes (mostly Italian), dykes, divas, senile tales and gigolos among them. Brimming with unnecessary scenes, the most ridiculous is a clumsy and meaningless recreation of the fountain scene in "La Dolce Vita." (A similar concept was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in 'Only You', Norman Jewison's immensely superior ode to Italy and the novel). "Tuscan Sun" may be the most lazy film of the last decade, despite its admittedly well-treated panoramas of Italy. Negative bonus point for the strange lover left for the last minute to provide Hollywood needed for the target audience of Oprah housewives. Avoid at all costs, unless, of course, you see Oprah and Dr. Phil as pinnacles of intelligent speech.
