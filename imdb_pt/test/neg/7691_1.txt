This crap is not worth a critique, so I'll write some information for those who do not know the history of this movie. First of all, it is not the first Saudi movie, they used this wrong information for commercial purposes (they lied!). According to they did it for money not for anything else, so they chose the idiot (Hesham) who won Star Academy (as Big Brother) is a popular show and the idiot Hesham is popular, but dunky, tacky and untalented, then , chose the famous Kuwaiti actor Mohammed Al Sairafi (also dumb and untalented), but has a popular (count how many times I'll use the word "popular" then send me an email to get your prize) has show popular and Jordanian actress More Hamdan who appeared in the comic show POPULAR CBM (unfunny) so she is famous * PoPular! So they picked some Saudi actors for ... blah blah blah. The funniest is the director! He is Canadian with Palestinian roots (I believe the identity of the film is the identity of its director) .. wait a minute! The screen game was written by an Egyptian screenwriter (very terrible!) With some help from the Lebanese critic (famous as a critic, but in fact he is a money collector!). This group of multi-races (money slaves) knows nothing about Saudi culture that they do not represent, but when we know who is behind that garbage, all our questions will be left out! Waleed bin Talaal is the Saudi prince and (BUSINESS MAN) who does not care about Saudi culture or the Saudi people he does not even live in Saudi Arabia (even if he lives he will live in his own world, his world is far away ) away from the real world people world) so he knows nothing or cares about anything except increasing his endless fortune. <br /> <br /> * Do not film Saudi (do not film anything). <br /> <br /> Squeeze all of them. <br /> <br /> Beep out of 10!
