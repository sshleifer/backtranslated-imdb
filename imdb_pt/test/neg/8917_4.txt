Today You Die was the fourth Seagal movie in a mini marathon I just completed. Wow, I do not know where to start. He seems to mutter his lines more and more as time passes, and the scenes between Seagal and Treach, where they seem to improvise, are embarrassing. And what did his girlfriend's dreams have to do with anything else in the plot? I can not recommend this to anyone but the toughest Seagal fan, and even then you're better off with your previous job. Of the 4 movies of my marathon (Submerged, In the Sun, Foreigner and Today You Die) Today was the worst. An earlier reviewer mentioned this, but the use of filming was pretty obvious.
