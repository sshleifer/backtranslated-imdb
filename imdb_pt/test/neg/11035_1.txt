I watched this movie with an audience of ... 5 in total! There was a choice between Lakshya and Asambhav ... (I realized then that I should have gone to Lakshya). A typical plot ... India v Pakistan ... but it's not just cricket as you have Kashmir in the middle. An Indian superhero is on a mission to save the Indian president from some Pakistani rebels who are involved in a massive plot of drug smuggling. I left the movie in the middle of the road because it was just boring and the plot was confusing and all over the place. The songs were also horrible, the movie tries to hide the flaws with its special effects, but unfortunately they are outdated too. <br /> <br /> Overall ... avoid it if you can, it has to be the worst movie I've seen this year.
