1983, "Frightmare" is a weird little movie. The director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of the classic 1930s horror films with the shock factor of the then-explosive genre of the 1980s. It is not entirely successful (mainly due to very obvious budget constraints, and the caliber of less than but still has its moments, mainly due to the class performance of the film by the late German actor Ferdinand Mayne, who plays an old horror movie star (Vincent Price) called "Conrad Ratzoff". At the beginning of the movie, we met the usual horror star while he's shooting a commercial for dental prostheses and we quickly learned that old Conrad is a little arrogant, prima donna jerk-off. When you think he could not be more unpleasant, the commercial director chides Conrad for taking a picture for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death. Good right? Conrad then visits a few fans in a college campus horror movie club, unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and ends up returning to his mansion waiting to die. Still quarreling, even at Death's door, he manages to wipe out a scorned business partner, choking him with a pillow before finally kicking the bucket. Conrad is then placed to rest in true Hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the coffin, which will play Conrad's own personal video messages for visitors who come in to pay their respects. <br /> <br /> It is at this point that the Horror Movie Society college kids decide to pay a visit to Conrad's grave, invading the tomb and taking his body back home with them for a party all night. (It's not exactly my idea of ​​fun, but they're characters from an '80s horror movie. Logic has no place here.) College kids spend the evening dining with Conrad's body sitting in a place of honor, posing for photos with and even dancing around the room, before parking Conrad and his coffin in the attic, planning to return it to the crypt in the morning. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ratzoff, disturbed by the theft of her husband's body, called a psychic friend to try to "reach" Conrad through a Spiritist session. You may as well find out the rest from here. Since Conrad was not a really cool guy in life, it's not hard to believe that he will not be friendlier in death. Psychic Lady makes contact with Conrad and he awakens predictably tense, then spends the rest of the movie wandering the halls of the ridiculously huge house of the students, taking the young tomb robbers one by one. This is where the film falls apart. Endless scenes of teenagers wandering through empty corridors saying "Hello? Is anyone there?" (we have a very rough beheading scene, which is the highlight of the movie) before the last two survivors finally find out (later, any semi-intelligent person would have discovered the same thing ... but again , we're in an 80's horror movie!) that the only way to stop the chaos is to take Conrad's body back to its crypt where it belongs. The slow pace is filled with a lot of strange lighting and dry ice fog effects backed up by a soundtrack composed almost entirely of sound effects rather than music (thunder, groaning and howling, etc.) that become severely irritating after a time <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend "Frightmare" to those who did not grow up watching cheap movies like that in the late 80's. Fans of "Modern Horror" will no doubt find "Frightmare" incredibly slow and playful. If you've come of age in this magical decade, however, you may get a burst of nostalgia for "Frightmare". Fans of Jeffrey ("Re-Animator") Combs may also want to take a look, as the future Dr. West appears in one of the first places here as one of the unlucky film students. <br /> <br /> I will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the label EastWestDVD (paired with "Vault of Horror" by Roy Ward and sold in dollar stores) because the print quality is terrible. I heard that the movie had a luxury release through the good Troma staff, which seems appropriate. If you are a Troma type of person, then "Frightmare" will be in your alley.
