*** May contain spoilers *** I had very high expectations for this movie, based on the trailer. I knew a little bit about the real Ed Gein, so I figured this was a Hollywood version of the average real-life events. Dude, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, the writing apparently came from an eight-year student who barely knew anything about Ed's story and drew the script in about 20 minutes. The film conveys completely Ed's most interesting facets and his relationship with his mother (not to mention what the real police found in his house) and decides to focus mainly on the young police officer who seems to have just entered the set. Likewise, all male characters seem to improvise the dialogue throughout the film. I'm not exaggerating. <br /> <br /> Do not make me start with the historical mistakes in this movie. Seriously, who the hell did that? This movie was supposed to happen around 1957, but the cops are carrying modern side cable sticks, some of the things in the hardware store look like they came from Lowes, and when the police officer gets to a pay phone he dial 9-1-1 ( did not exist at that time). Also, Ed was a small, scary guy like Anthony Perkins's character in Psycho (who was supposed to be based on Ed's real life), not that burly guy who ended up looking a lot like the bad guy in Men In Black. Another thing that really bothered me was the appearance that the producers of this movie recorded the whole thing in an abandoned building. Because of the "smart" camera angles, you never see any real city, and the inside of the scenes looked like old, long-abandoned shacks. Put a cash register on a saw and bam! - an instant hardware store. <br /> <br /> I'm usually very capable of forgiving low-budget horror movies, but this is just a ruthless request. All you had to do was to include most of the actual events (even beautify them!), Pay five good actors instead of 15 bad ones, and for God's sake take 5 minutes and think about the period from time to time. My advice: Google Ed Gein, you will be much more entertained.
