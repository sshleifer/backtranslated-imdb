This documentary tries comedy, but it never gets there for me. Camp? Ehn, maybe. The most appropriate word with which everyone agrees - and has difficulty avoiding in any revision - is the kitsch. He dribbled kitsch. It was as if the filmmakers were worried that viewers would take the film very seriously, and then leaned back to insert the kitsch and proclaim, "We're kidding around here! See?" <br /> <br /> In short, I felt I was trying too hard. For example, the stocking puppets that introduced each scene were (to me) annoying when I'm sure they should be fun - or at least (ahem) kitsch-ey. <br /> <br /> No, however, avoid this movie based on my complaints. Just be ready to have fun in kitsch rather than have it shoved for you unprepared. If you are interested in carefree meals, you can go far, far worse. At the very least, the facts surrounding the rise and fall of the Bakers make this interesting and deserve a vision. At best, bunch of kitsch lovers with the same mentality will scream about the bits chosen throughout the film.
