Well, I notice that IMDB did not offer any plot information ... that's because you can not do that without sounding vile and disgusting ... because that's what this movie is ... VILE AND DISGUSTING !! I watched because I'm a huge fan of Chris Noth, whom I met personally and he's a nice guy ... but if I meet him again, I will not scruple to ask him whatever he has participated in. something so horrible. He plays an ex-son prodigy who is now a brilliant doctor, who spends his free time running over small children with his car, with the intention of mutilating and weakening them ... this is not a "spoiler", because all this is made very clear from the start ... nauseating enough? Oh, it gets better ... he is manipulated into doing so by his incestuous sister who threatens to withhold his sexual favors if his last victim fails to die ... not even Clive Barker could write anything so horrible. Please, if you want to see Chris Noth in something worthy of his talent, rent "Teddy Roosevelt and The Roughriders"
