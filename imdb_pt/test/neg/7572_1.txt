and abysmal, over-the-top acting, you can enjoy this junk movie. Only atomic bombs make life turn into about a day or two (or according to other viewers, wake them up). Or so it seems. And apparently massive atomic explosions on the coast of Spain do not make anyone ask any questions. Thinking about it, the plot does not make sense at all (why do the evil half-puppets attack the headlights?), So the nuclear weapons that go out for no reason do not stand out much. <br /> <br /> OK, overcoming this, and the fact that the "monster" is a glorified thing you do in socks in kindergarten, you may actually be able to take it. But for the first time, the complete lack of blood does not help, leaving the monsters attacking in all their naked "glory" at the bottom of the pit. <br /> <br /> I doubt you can watch it, so you'd better stay away.
