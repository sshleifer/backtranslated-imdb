Watching Enterprise for the first time, as we all undoubtedly do with all the shows, I got into it with an open mind, taking advantage of about half of the past efforts of Star Trek and not liking the other half. <br /> <br /> The company fell short, but this episode "A Night In Sickbay" made me seriously question why it bothered me to advertise the programs on Monday night at Sci Fi. In the episodes of Day In The Life, in which we learn about what makes certain characters operate as humanoids, writers seemed to forget that this should be a stellar ship , not the Ricardo and the Mertzes. <br /> <br /> A planet, especially one whose people had been previously offended by the Enterprise crew (for eating in public), was no place for a dog. As an animal lover, I would never have taken one of my pets to an environment that had tense in the past. <br /> <br /> But what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem with all of these ST shows, constantly portraying things that are sacred and insulting to other cultures as they are offering some insight into religious fanatics Americans. <br /> <br /> The aliens were offended when the dog urinated on a sacred tree. However, the aliens were able to lead the dog to urinate as an insult. Strange how the dog's urine was not considered a form of worship. I wonder how it got with the writers of the show. <br /> <br /> From there, we are subject to a captain who was misguided by his duties. Watching the episode, I found it very easy to forget that Bakula should be the captain of the ship. <br /> <br /> He chose to sleep in the infirmary and from there gave us more inanities of behavior (sigh) that we should not understand and this makes us furrow the eyebrows. <br /> <br /> The doctor stapled long, hairy nails and fed them with animals caged with hunger. Ewwwwww! Then a white bat creature escapes. <br /> <br /> Oh, how could anyone sleep through all this happening! Toenail clipping, for crying out loud! I was waiting for something that feeds on vomit to be introduced. Then it was inexplicably given the idea that the captain was in love with T'pol, and that perhaps he was masking those feelings with his concern. about the dog. <br /> <br /> Infinite amounts of junk. <br /> <br /> "Your dog is sick, so go have sex. You'll feel better." And of course, the captain had to apologize and we humans had to regard his apology as completely ridiculous, because we're all (that's all smirk sarcastically) narrow-minded! Serial descriptions such as this have incessantly spread through TNG. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, the only thing missing from this horrible episode was that the person from Trip offered his smiles and imbalances, because Bakula seemed to be covering all of this. with the silly dog. <br /> <br /> Oh, the dog survived, so now fetch it.
