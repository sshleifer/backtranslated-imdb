Let's see, cardboard characters as Muslim terrorists forced a cardboard scientist to do some exotic drug testing on some cardboard people who were drugged and kidnapped. Do not forget to laugh when those pathetic apologies for humanoids get their mere deserts! It turns out that the experiments with drugs gave them the ability to feel another world ... the world of religious fantasy! - complete with cardboard demons that seem to be made out of paper mache. Everyone is dragged to hell except for a poor man who goes to heaven, where he can presumably spend Eternity with the wood-heads that created this masterpiece of the Absurd. I think I would opt for Hellfire alone. Go see something else unless it's flat and in that case you might really like it! It could not hurt!
