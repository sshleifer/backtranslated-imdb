The sound of this movie is a nightmare. That's the best I can say for this movie. Any chance a good story is lost when this movie begins. The premise of the movie looks good. A playboy who comes to terms with the people around him. The plot is predictable and very boring. The Wet T-shirt contest may be the worst scene I've ever seen and it's almost worth seeing a Mystery Science-type deal. The sound is sometimes hard to hear and the lead actor does not seem to be able to speak clearly. His accent makes it very difficult to understand. The only brilliant sport is the performance of Penelope Ann Miller. Her role is underdeveloped, but she plays well. In short, do not waste your time.
