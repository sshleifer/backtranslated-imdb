IT'S OK. Well, I think it was worth my time going through it * once *, but I will not be watching again. There are several things about this movie that irritated me. <br /> <br /> First, dude ... I really hated the characters. I had the same problem with Sid and Nancy. I have a hard time spending a lot of time following characters that I do not really care about and can not relate to. It is not that actors or writing were technically bad; was that the characters were written in such a way that I only had contempt for them and as the film continued, I almost wanted to see the sky fall on them. And that leads me to the second problem, and one question that I think is at the heart of this film: Was the intention simply to document this generation and those types of bohemians who were (I think) wandering around Europe in the 1960s? Was it the intention to criticize and criticize them? Or was this movie some kind of warning? My final evaluation of the film (ie to determine if there was anything salvable here) depends on this issue. <br /> <br /> Regardless, these characters are really nasty and as a consequence, Hard to really give a damn about the plot or what happens to them. If that was some kind of statement about this generation, then the film becomes a bit more tolerable. Of course, Schroeder is not a kind of nursing home square, so the way he proceeds here carries more weight than, say, the many stupid AIP movies created or related to the counterculture of the 1960s. film has two things - first, the soundtrack (obviously). I like how Cymbaline is used here and others have also mentioned it since it takes the lead in the film. I'm guessing if you're a fan of Pink Floyd and want to see it for that reason, nothing you read here will likely stop you from watching anyway (it would not stop me too). The curiosity of listening to Pink Floyd in one movie may be enough to just get past you. <br /> <br /> Second, there is a legal scenario. Ibiza seems like a good place to visit. Maybe I'm tired of looking at Los Angeles, New York and Chicago in movies, but European films that really show us Europe (pretty or ugly - the most beautiful here) are always welcome. <BR>> <br /> But I do not really see any particular genius here. No revolutionary camera work, not even morality, tone, message, sensitivity or plot that has something new to say. Perhaps what was revolutionary about it was merely the fact that it came from a fellow like Schroeder - a film that criticized a mentality that at least in part made his film marketable. In that sense, it is an honest film; there is no glorification of the abject excesses of the '60s here, which is perhaps something you can expect. In fact, the portrayal of the characters in this film closely mirrors (in fact, distorted, in my opinion) the modern cultural memory of that generation. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, bunch of nudity and sex here; nothing new if you watch these types of movies from that period. I think it was considered new or provocative or something at the time. I do not find this offensive or exciting (I doubt you too); instead, it only prolongs the running time of an already tedious movie. In its own way, this particular use of sexuality in the films of the time (especially the European ones) has become a bit of a clich√©. But I think in hindsight you can not blame them; In that decade, they were able to "get away" and I suppose (I suppose here) that the very presence of this type of graphic sexuality was a political or social statement in itself (being that sexuality was part of life that this generation was not going to be as strange as his parents). <br /> <br /> If you watch? If you're a Pink Floyd fan, of course ... I think it's worth watching. In any case, The Valley is a better movie. I got into this movie expecting a lot of what I got. If you do not normally watch these types of avant-garde art films and do not know what to expect, this can be annoying as hell. This is a normal and healthy reaction :) <br /> <br /> If you are not a Pink Floyd fan, I do not know why you would spend your time here. I noticed that a guy who left a comment really liked the movie, so maybe I'm missing out on something. I do not need guys running in slow motion from fireballs, special effects, explosions or anything like that to enjoy a movie. But I need some kind of control - I need to find something to like a movie, and I usually need to sympathize with some aspect of the characters' situation (except that some novel of filming will work, camera-work and so on). Here, there is nothing to hold except for the magnificence of Pink Floyd. That is * just enough * to make it tolerable. At the very least, if you're a fan of Pink Floyd, for starters, you'll enjoy the part with Cymbaline, I promise.
