Everyone loves watching a really bad movie at some point. You watch, have a good laugh, and forget the next half hour. But that's not one of those. It is the worst thing that will appear in front of your eyes for a while. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see someone else take responsibility for Dante - he's really the stupidest villain you can imagine: an expensive leather pants that speaks with a voice and has a laughing victory like a Dracula from the 50's. How can anyone have this face? And the hero ... "The Dragon" or whatever ... my cereal box has better acting skills than him (maybe than all of them), it's unbelievable. But the worst are the fight scenes where you would think there might be something in it. They are so lame, they are beyond description. No shame, I can not believe how this movie was allowed by any studio. But I'm just thrilled that it was. Watching this is a self-mutilating pleasure. Watch this only if you are on a movie search for pain, and in this case, this is a sure winner.
