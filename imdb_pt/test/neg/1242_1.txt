Maybe I'm alone here, but this is a fucking show. I'm sorry, but I was drawn when I found out about Lil 'Bill O'Reilly (which I had no idea came from this show until months later, and honestly since losing his appeal) but I gave the show a fair shot. Spike tries to transform himself into something that is not, which is to say that he tries to be human. Fox did not even bother to hide the ropes when he took it out of the box in which he entered. His sketches try hard, he himself is not funny, and writers are struggling to write material for an untalented presenter. There's a lot of good TV out there to waste your time with this show, and Fox ... Fox we've had good times, but you need to get your f $% * ing act together and come up with something original instead of trying to be just another "I-too" network.
