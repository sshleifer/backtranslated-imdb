I think I should now comment on a 4th movie in the franchise MAGNIFICENT SEVEN; the sequels still surprise me or surprise me with their appearance and their deliberate absenteeism. They constitute or forge a fourth path - not classical, not revisionist, not European - but an American fissure, resembling the violent watcher of the 1970s films, the absurdity of garbage. This part is also bombastic, inexplicably awkward and even a little strange. <br /> <br /> Now what I find disturbing is that these sequences not only have their opportunistic fans; but that fans simply do not feel any difference between the style of the original and the sequences. <br /> <br /> These sequences are not boring or insipid, but bizarre. They are, of course, very poorly written, confusing scripts, garbage lines. It is a direct madness; in this plot each shooter receives several women? Van Cleef's young wife begs him to release a young prisoner; he finally does. The young man returns to life, shoots Van Cleef, kidnaps his wife, rapes her and kills her, then joins a malefactor. Van Cleef, who previously refused to help defend a village, now mounts a small group and charges the offender's farm; so the offenders charge the village where Van Cleef settled. <br /> <br /> I liked the cast. <br /> <br /> Van Cleef is Chris; Stefanie Powers, quite active in the westerns of the 70's, is the darling of Van Cleef. Callan, very unfriendly, is Noah, writer and partner of Chris. The rest of the aggressive pack is Askew (one of only three survivors), Armendariz, Lucking, Lauter; Rita Rogers is a truly hot and fleshy beauty.
