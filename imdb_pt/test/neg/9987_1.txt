Incomprehensibly terrible mix of probably most notorious of all the Roman emperors who went mad, leaving infamous festive orgies and ruthless murders in their way ... I know there are several versions of this, and this is based on the 102 min 'one I watched - but I can not understand how this can make any difference to getting the rest of the film out of the trash! <br /> <br /> I've long heard about the supposed "shocking" content of sex / nudity (which honestly there is not much here - and boring when it exists) and blood, but watch out - it's technical production amateurishness really shocks here: it all seems simple and simply like a junior film school project! The camera work is hopelessly inept, full of strange zooms, flawed framing and messy pots (from and to what looks like a great theater stage!), Complete with a grainy and cheap photo quality. Lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven - is it day or night? Are they in or out? Did they change the scene? Who is or should be in the shot? Editing is the ultimate sin here, making a confusing mess of everything, with randomly jumped cuts, flaws of continuity and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum, progression of history - and involvement. There is a potentially interesting dialogue and an equally interesting historical history ... but these faults distract so much that it is tragic. <br /> <br /> A story with so many possibilities to be great is just a gigantic, burnt (and Fellini). turkey which is good just for some laughs and Peter O'Toole, which makes a Tiberius more memorable. Ah, yes, which brings us to the big names of the actors. I would like to align all of them one by one and just ask: Who did you have free access to good orgies to be a part of? There, I wasted enough lines in one of the truly worst movies of all time - period! <br /> <br /> 1 in 10 Ozjeppe
