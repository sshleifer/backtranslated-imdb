I was so eager to see this movie that I can not understand how I got the impression that I would like it. I'm afraid it's really a yawning party - every movie patron I watched yawned and fiddled with throughout the movie. That's a shame, because it's a fantastic story - I'm inclined to think that would be a better read. It is not helped by the main character showing only his teeth once - and this was as a result of the angle of the camera. As the story unfolds, it becomes easier to understand the main character's dilemmas. However, the suspense and drama that could have made this really top rated movie were completely spoiled by the dull treatment. Dizzy like a half-cooked documentary!
