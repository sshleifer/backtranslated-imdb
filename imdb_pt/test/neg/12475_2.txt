A film by Almodovar - sends a shiver down my spine all the time. The engraving in capital letters, which opens the latest version of the Spanish author, instantly induces memories of lewd nuns, necrophiles gentle, transsexuals and I did not even go so far as to criticize the first works of the infamous-terrible. And after a beautiful opening montage, with the camera traversing a graveyard swept by the wind buoyed by a treasure of widows rubbing headstones feverishly, I thought Peter had me again under his spell. <br /> <br /> But once my nostalgia had subsided, there was very little to fill her place. For a director who has fun bringing humanity to murderers and rapists, he does a lousy job of finding any emotional depth or captivating quality in his women. Penelope Cruz is Raimunda, a stubborn housewife whose life is complicated by the accidental murder of her abusive husband on the part of her daughter. Luckily, she lives in Spain in Almodovar, where her friends will help dispose of a corpse for the offer of a round of cocktails. Add to the cauldron the ghost of Raimunda's mother and a series of other eccentrically warm matriarchs. "Volver" literally means to return, and Peter seems to be recycling old material. The sub-plot of incest seems to be a mandatory taboo. Instead of commenting or subverting the issue, as in her treatment of pedophilia in Bad Education, she feels forced and unconvincing amidst the film's sentimentality. I suggest Almodovar call his next movie Salir (to follow forward).
