This movie was OK as far as the movies go. It could have been made as a crossroads in secular films. However, it had little to do with the Left Behind books that were supposedly based. The main premises of the story were removed and new main premises were added. <br /> <br /> What most disappointed me was how Nicolae was portrayed. He was shown with supernatural powers that he did not have at the moment in the books. The Antichrist is not Satan, is not omniscient and is not omnipotent. Faith and beliefs were portrayed in strange and surreal ways that seemed to make the film simply silly. <br /> <br /> Non-believers who watch this will have more ammunition to mock Christian beliefs.
