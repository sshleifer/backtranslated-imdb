Not me ... If all went well, I could kick a dog's ass, and that's why this movie does not work for me. If it was me against the Alien, or Jason .. Or ... Hell, I do not know .. ANY OTHER ANTAGONIST OF THE MOVIE OF TERROR, so there would be no contest and I would have my butt delivered to me barring divine intervention. A horror movie works because it puts people in a situation with a creature, person, being, entity, which is more powerful or ingenious or intelligent than they are, and then people think "well, and if that happens to me," and they get scared - and that's why this is a horrible idea for a story. I can not imagine being terrified of a dog, so I'm not scared.
