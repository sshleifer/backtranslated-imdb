I was impressed by the terrible acting and screenplay for this movie. All characters seem immobile because of personal issues - like deer in headlights. They hesitate around whining and moaning over their emotions when decisive actions need to be taken. I saw myself screaming on the TV screen trying to wake them up to their situation and do something! The plot is implausible. Every time there is a key decision to be made by a main character, one of the other characters has to bring all the problems with the obvious decision to make the decision even harder - it's a melodramatic trick and just wants to make you moan. Clearly the importance of the decision is obvious - you do not need to treat the audience like idiots. Overall - there is a lot of emotional melodrama throughout the movie.
