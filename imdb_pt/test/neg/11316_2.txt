Leslie Nielsen is usually someone I really like (even critically like "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" and "Wrongfully Accused"). So the fact that I'm hitting "Mr. Magoo" should show that it's a piece of crap. He casts Nielsen as the myopic title character, something is planted in him, and he makes a mess of it all. It seems that the combination of Nielsen and director Stanley Tong (behind two Jackie Chan films) would make this movie hilarious, but that does not happen; it seems they only have people to do anything, and there is no real humor here. <br /> <br /> So, the original drawing with Jim Backus providing the voice was worth seeing, so avoid this movie. Leslie Nielsen also did a lot better then there is no reason to waste your time on this. Starring Kelly Lynch, Stephen Tobolowsky, Ernie Hudson, Malcolm McDowell and Miguel Ferrer; they probably do not want to emphasize this piece of junk in their careers.
