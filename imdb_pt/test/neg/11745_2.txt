* some possible spoilers * Of course this movie could not be as good as the original, the remakes are rarely. But this remake of one of Hitchcock's greatest films, Psycho, could have been so much better. <br /> <br /> First of all, whoever released the movie must have been psychotic. I mean, Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates! What do they think?! Unlike the "harmless", almost childlike Bates that Anthony Perkins was able to portray, Vaughn looks like he could be a killer. In efforts to make his Bates look innocent, Vaughn ends up being gay. Many of the other actors also did not seem to fit in, including Julianne Moore, who just did not seem to fit the film. <br /> <br /> At the top of the atrocious cast, cinematography is remarkably poor, despite the fact that they have reenacted the scene from the film to the scene. The only thing they added were random shots of objects, like clouds or a naked woman, among the shots of characters being murdered. These photos seemed to be irrelevant to the plot anyway, and in turn made no sense. <br /> <br /> Overall, this remake of Psycho, which could be a decent image, ended up being a complete waste of time. .
