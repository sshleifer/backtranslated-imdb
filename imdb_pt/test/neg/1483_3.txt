One of those movies where you bet on who will die first and who will survive in the end. There was just something about the movie that made me zone out. I think because I keep looking back and thinking "yes still in that tree ... still looking at the water". Bad character development. I felt nothing when they were in danger. I was voting for croc. I found it hard to believe that a crocodile would try to take down a boat first, and then when he jumps on the boat, I think it's really unlikely too. The croc seems very supernatural at times ("everyone knowing everything"). In addition, when the croc attacks, its behavior seems unrealistic. It is a killing machine and would not allow victims to escape two or three times in a row, especially when attacking in the water.
