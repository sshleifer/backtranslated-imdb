LORD PROTECTOR is a child's food, but to whose children? Obviously filmed for television or STV, this amateur replay KRULL has several characters - a magician, a murderer, a warrior, a scientist - in the wake of one thing or another, in order to defeat the Dark Forces about to be unleashed on their planet . Badly written, represented and staged in places available in California, such as municipal parks and a ranch, LORD PROTECTOR has nothing to recommend it, not even as a waste of time. Jay Underwood is the only "name" actor, and most people, especially the target audience of five-year-olds, probably will not remember him as old Disney cooking as NOT HUMAN GOOD. An unnamed actor who plays a wizard with an ill-fitting silver wig at least touches his tongue firmly planted on the cheek, while those around him act as if they are in a KING LEAR production at a dinner theater. I was hoping at least for a decent action or special effects sequence. Unfortunately, the action sequences are pathetically staged and the few special effects are those old-fashioned cartoon jokes that we used to see in the 1950s and '60s fantasy films like Bert Gordon's THE MAGIC SWORD. The filmmakers planned a sequel that, fortunately, never came to be. Often, these cheap Hollywood productions use a combination of legitimate actors and porn. I kept myself busy during the seemingly endless run-time of the movie, trying to figure out which was which one. I was not very lucky.
