This movie is so stupid I want my $ 2.99 back I paid !! First this movie starts with a bunch of geeks from talented wood actors as they were chosen on the street somewhere because the "real" actors either did not show up because of the laughable script or they just could not get anyone desperate enough to do that movie! The music in this movie is enough for you to sleep, the flute music made for the desert fairy dance would not even be good enough for this movie! And the guy dressed in Satan seems to be wearing a special K-Mart Halloween costume! There are no dead scenes except a few thigh scenes. When I saw the terrible killers in those Nosferatu-looking bath robes, I just laughed! That's why the whole city should be running away once a year! This movie is one of the worst demonic movies I've ever seen. Avoid this one!
