What we know of Caravaggio suggests a brawler stuck with a healthy sense of law that lived between prostitutes, thieves and dealers and put them on canvas. The themes of his works were sex, death, redemption, above all, finding the sacred within the profane. He lived in a time when homosexuality carried a death sentence and political intrigue usually involved fatalities in a society defined by the maxim "to strangle the boy for the purity of his cry." <br /> <br /> You can not criticize Derek Jarman for his cinematography, or his recreations of Caravaggio's paintings and certainly can not accuse man of moving away from homosexuality. But frankly, Jarman never deviates beyond the caricature of the 80s. Italian sponsorship becomes the London art scene of the 80s, complete with beautiful waiters and calculators. Sean Bean is a sexy piece of rough North lubricating your bike. Tilda Swinton performs a transformation worthy of a Mills and Boons ("Why, Miss Lena, without that gipsy veil, you're beautiful ..."). Jarman provides Caravaggio with a particularly banal motive for the murder that left him in exile. This could have been a visually dazzling treatment of a man whose life was dangerous, exciting, violent and decadent, but that lives of people common to the status of Renaissance masterpieces, observed by the emperors and kings . Instead, what you get is Pierre et Gilles from Italy. The beautiful bodies of boys are shown to perfection, but never the men who inhabit them. Jarman seems to satirize the art scene of London, showing it shallow and pretentious. To use Caravaggio and the Renaissance in Italy, the goal is to use a silk purse to make a pig's ear. To be fair, this film remains visually stunning, but ultimately as two-dimensional as the paintings it describes.
