Is this an FMV game or a movie? In all honesty, I watched this one of "choice without less". It is a great waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> It seems that HK movies are going in the opposite direction from the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Try putting more effort and money into a production and makes us want to watch, rather than something that you want us to watch. <br /> <br /> The graphics are so horrible that they seemed to be something of the low resolution games from the beginning to the middle of the 90's (compared to today). <br /> <br /> The way they did this movie is almost exactly what they did in the 1990s Wing Commander game, namely the third installment of the series. Stop regressing and make us Asian look so bad about it compared to the big Hollywood guns. <br /> <br /> Of course! They have big budgets and better actors. But we have some of the earliest stories, myths and legends, the best technophiles, and possibly the largest graphics base in the world! So what was so wrong? Have you started using the same old companies that work with you in so many movies? Please stop wasting our time and money. This is the reason why HK movies are going down so quickly. Did not you claim to be the Hollywood of the East? I think not.
