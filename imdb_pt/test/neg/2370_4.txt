This movie is derived from a Long Running ITV sitcom of the same name. Sitcom lasted about half a decade and brought to our screens Rigsby, Phillip, Alan, Mrs Jones and Vienna. <br /> <br /> In 1980 the film version hit theaters. Now when that happened, unfortunately Richard Beckinsale had passed away and was replaced by Only when I laughed at actor Chris Strauli. <br /> <br /> I even felt that it made the film feel different. would prefer it if it were not filmed as Richard was a key character. It's like having porridge without Godber or Mackay! <br /> <br /> The film had a few classic moments, but it seemed a bit De-Ja-Tu! Many parts have been seen before in the TV series. Now, if you saw the movie first, instead of the Series, you would have a different feeling about it, so the series fan! <br /> <br /> Saying that Leonard is definitely in his best shape and does the movie, just like on TV. series. The film recently had a new life on DVD and is usually on land for a quiet weekend. It's a good movie, but for Rigsby fans you may feel that you've seen it the same way before. <br /> <br /> Saying it's worth buying / watching <br /> <br /> 7.8 / 10
