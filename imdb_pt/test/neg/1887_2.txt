I watched this movie when I was a kid and I thought it was terrible. Now that I'm older, I find it so terrible. Universal could have done better than that. They simply decided to make as much money as possible using all their monsters at once. For me, that was a cheap shot. These characters were able to stay in their own films, and the choice of actors was deplorable. Dracula needed to be Bela Lugosi's monster, Frankenstein, he needed to be Karloff. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it was the weird Disney sequel made decades ago, and it was not appreciated. Umiversal began with something great and original, and then thought they could cede to the masses with the shock that is extremely evident in this film.
