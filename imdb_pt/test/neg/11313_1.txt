This morning, I found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed. I found myself thinking, "Oh yeah, there was a Mr. Magoo movie, was not there?" This is most surprising because I remember following the controversy surrounding this film (advocacy group for the visually impaired said this movie was humiliating). I even went to see this movie the day it opened, because I am a fan of Mr. Magoo and Mr. Nielson, and I thought he would be an excellent choice to play Mr. Magoo. I even remember the opening opening credits, because I thought they were a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> After that, everything goes completely blank. I think it's a very sad statement about any movie that is so lame, so bland, and so utterly devoid of merit that you can not remember any of it. I understand that Leslie Nielson is not always known for appearing in first-class comedies, but I saw him in "Spy Hard" in "Scary Movie 4" and "Police Squad 3" and none of them were great movies, but I left by least remembering * something *. Magoo, however, is a complete void. <br /> <br /> I wonder now if all the controversy surrounding the film was not actually generated by the studio that produced it, hoping to generate at least some small amount of interest in a totally useless movie.
