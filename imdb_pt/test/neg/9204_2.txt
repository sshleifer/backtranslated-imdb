A spacecraft in some unspecified future, where humans are equipped for space travel and possess laser weapons, land on a strange planet where dinosaurs coincidentally also evolved and only in this world have not yet been extinct ... yet. Survivors of the crash, about ten mild characters wearing blue, white and yellow suits, fight for survival against alien prehistoric monsters. <br /> <br /> "Planet of the Dinosaurs" is a quirky movie. As I said in my resume above, the animated dinosaurs in the movie are the only colorful actors. The models are coarse, but effectively animated. And they are far more fascinating and intriguing than these characters portrayed by inexperienced actors and lines of speech from a script that must have been written over night without a single review. Obviously, most of the budget has been put on the dinosaurs, and although there is a fair share of them, there is hardly enough to save us from boredom. These human characters are there just to scream, run and murmur these poorly written and verbose speeches about survival. And unfortunately, they are hardly consumed by dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Planet of the Dinosaurs" is not a movie that I plan to see again. Some people simply love to be so cheap and poorly made. Sometimes I like movies like that. But this particular movie is very long, very annoying and very exhausting in the mind.
