Like many movies involving young children, this starts out as "cute" and friendly ... and then, after about half an hour, it becomes the other way around. <br /> <br /> This is certainly the case here in this time-travel story (which I usually love), where an adult meets a boy who really is his at age eight! Great premise and a great lead actor in Bruce Willis, but ..... <br /> <br /> Kid "Rusty" is a smart little brat and Willis Rusty, now grown up, while "Russell" becomes abrasive with his constant screams. Is this entertainment? No thank you. <br /> <br /> Young Breslin became a great child actor, taking part in a number of films, including "The Cat in a Hat," opposite a more famous children's actor: Dakota Fanning. <br /> <br /> Overall, a disappointing movie, especially with all the good impression this movie had when it was released.
