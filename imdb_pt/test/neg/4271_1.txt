total idiot <br /> <br /> I was kind of excited to see this because it's the only movie version I've seen of Mansfield Park. I suffered during the first four episodes, but when the proposal came between Henry and Fanny I hit and had to turn it off. Whoever employs this lady Sylvestra Le Touzel must be blind and deaf because the woman is the worst actress I have ever seen in my life. The whole thing is just bad, bad, bad. I do not know. I just do not know why people writing Jane Austen scripts seem incapable of giving their work the respect it deserves.
