Perhaps, we are very attached to great spectacles when we hear of the antiquity brought to the screen. Maybe, let's hope a lot of these movies. However, if we as spectators are offered very little, what happens then? <br /> <br /> That's what I thought after seeing Paul Marcus's IMPERIUM - NERONE, part of the production series on the Roman Empire. AUGUSTUS, by Roger Young, the first IMPERIUM film, included at least Peter O'Toole, but what does this movie include? <br /> <br /> Hardly anything needs it. The historical errors are so serious that the film changes the facts and constitutes a distorted image of the Roman Empire than the true story. Throughout the film, we see young Nero: young during the alleged long reign of Caligula, young during the reign of Claudius and finally during his own reign (historically with 14 years of duration). And he dies the same way. According to the film, Nero, born during the reign of Tiberius, has lived for over 40 years but seems to be in his early twenties when he dies ... Continuity combined with invented story is the film's biggest problem, which makes it difficult to logically, not to say dependable. Nero loses his father, he is raised by slaves. At that time, his mother, Agripina, is exiled by Caligula. Later, however, she suddenly marries Emperor Claudius, who already has large children newly married to him Messalina. In these moments of the film, we see Acte (Rike Schmid), lover of Nero. Okay, it's historically "accurate"; however, no source proves that it played such a decisive role in the rise of Christianity in Rome. In the film, she is not only a dedicated Christian, but even a witness to the miracle of St. Paul (he brings back a young Marzia to life). Moreover, historically, there was nothing like Nero seen in Caligula's court since Nero was born in the 4-year reign of Caligula (37-41 AD). I understand that movies can change anything, but such an error makes the script absolutely unreliable! And many, many other flaws about content that are hard to list, but after 30 minutes watching this movie, I doubted you were watching a historical movie or a total fantasy. <br /> <br /> As for their artistic characteristics, provide us with entertainment, they are equally lame as the story here is. The performances are artificial, the cast simply has beautiful faces but weak acting abilities. Perhaps, I am very attached to Peter Ustinov or Charles Laughton in the lead, but Hans Matheson does not fit like Nero. He could have some of the good times as an actor, but never like the infamous Roman emperor. Is he an artist who burns Rome for a song? Is he a cynic who disguises love for his relatives? Is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people because of "alleged justice"? None of those. He is just a young man who does not know how to govern and, in the long run, begins to release the fire that burns within himself ... John Simm is out of place in this film as Caligula and absolutely inferior to other portraits of the film. character. Elisa Tovati is just as sexy as Poppaea; however, it could have been so much better. The costumes are inaccurate and the ensembles are not surprising. Low budget results in low effects and, consequently, low entertainment. <br /> <br /> But what made me more angry in this movie and as a result I give him 1/10 are some moments that are absolutely unacceptable: <br /> <br /> - Pop√©ea's death and the conversation of St. Paul with Nero in his corpse, - The mention of Claudius on the current conquest of Britannia at the feast and soon after his death (he conquered Britannia while Messalina was his wife long before his death), - Tigellinus killing Agripina (Laura Morante), mother of Nero, - Nero's arguments in the speech to senators, - finally, the death of Nero - a calm day on the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a moral, Acte said "Let's forgive him" <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is a waste of time and is absolutely unnecessary as one more production on the Roman Empire. It's better to make a good movie in 30 years than ten in 5 years. 1/10 - should not have been done at all.
