This movie is the last straw on a list of movies I've seen this week that have pushed me to the limit and forced me to join IMDb and spread a warning to the public. It was absolutely awful. The film was drawn and painfully annoying. The sound, effects, and even the quality of the picture seemed to have come from Willow (1988) or perhaps even from Conan the Barbarian (1982). The battle of Bannockburn was absolutely absurd. This "major reconstruction of the medieval battle already held in the British Isles" made me laugh. There was not even a coherent lineup, just a few guys with spears and horses running through them. Douglas's scenes, especially in the last battle, were simply horrible, as were most of the acting in the film.
