Hannibal must be the most horrible movie I've seen in a long time. Actually, I want my money back. What a waste of time. Without plot, minimal character development, questionable motives, poor dialogue, substandard acting. What else can I say? If you have not seen it yet, do not bother. I would not even hire the video and if you happen to appear on TV ... change the channel. The only reason anyone might have to see this movie would be to see if the gratuitous violence satisfied all the hype (which frankly is why they added it). If you want to see some gug eating your own brain, then fast forward to that piece. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of this film? It's as if someone had asked 'I wonder what Hannibal is doing these days' and we just went on for the ride. He is free at the beginning and is free at the end. In between is a lot of self-indulgence on the part of Anthony Hopkins and the filmmakers. Julianne Moore boldly tries to inject a little life into her Clarice, but they gave her a sub-standard script and, as far as I'm concerned, she was prepared to fail. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is just a very very bad story in every sense of the word. The only reason they earned so much money was because of the senseless violence they added, which at the end of the day leaves you with more of a sense of contempt than the horror you should feel. <br /> <br /> give a big RASPBERRY!
