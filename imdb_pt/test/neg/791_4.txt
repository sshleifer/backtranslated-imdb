Couple having financial problems gets a box delivered to their door. If they hit the button, they make a million dollars, but someone who does not know will die. Do they push the button? <br /> <br /> This is a strange movie based on a tale of Richard Matheson that has some chills, but most of the time is a confusing subject. The problem is that there is so much going on that it seems that screenwriter Richard Kelly did not know what kind of movie he was making. Is this a horror movie with supernatural nuances? Sometimes it seems like conversations about moral choices, condemnation, and the afterlife. Is it a science fiction movie? Possibly, there are many questions about this Mars project. And what are the strange looks that people seem to have in a big conspiracy? Is it this invasion of body robbers or a demonic movie? I do not know, maybe. And that is the problem, there are many questions, most intriguing, but there are many. Little seems to have been explained and when we get to the end of the movie, things seem to stop more than concluding (even in an open way). I'm all for making a movie rich in themes and points but the writer Kelly fills her script with simply many that director Kelly can not handle, or does it in such a way that each theme or plot plot gets its ten minutes of time and for those minutes, he holds the court before launching the next bit. It drove me crazy. (I'm not going to get into the two leads, Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, who are not very good or more likely not to know what to do with stuff that's always changing) <br /> <br /> It's a heady mix that does not work (ultimately there are many holes). I came to the end and suddenly realized that I had no idea what I just saw. I really did not like it, but it's more than that, because it does not make sense. I'd take a pass or wait for a cable where it would not cost you anything.
