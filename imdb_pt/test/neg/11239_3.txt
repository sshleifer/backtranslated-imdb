If a movie can not hold your interest in the first 25 minutes, it's over. This concept that you have to simply deal with a slow first third of a movie and be rewarded later is nonsense. A good movie has to start and end strong. Everything looks interesting and some decent and promising photos, but ultimately confusing and irrelevant. There are so many other movies from Asia to watch, many of which I'm sure most of you have not seen, that I would really skip this and look elsewhere. Why exactly does IMDb require a minimum of 10 lines for reviews? I said my piece and hope this helps some of you to move on to the next movie.
