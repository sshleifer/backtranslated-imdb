Here is a movie that clearly risks being marketed as exotic to audiences unfamiliar with the subject. <br /> <br /> A hybrid attempt at fiction and document, "Kadosh" falls awkwardly between the chairs. As a documentary, on the one hand, it is neither accurate nor insightful. To realize its sloppy handling of details, one must go beyond the opening scene where it is quite obvious that the ultra-orthodox protagonist does not even know how to properly place his t'filin. More generally, the tedious presentation of rote-style details (in this case of the ultra-orthodox Jewish ritual) is the role of a manual, not a good documentary; the latter must provide an organizing principle (a gestalt, if you will) for the viewer, so that it can arise with a better understanding of what is seen. This clearly does not happen here, as the ultra-orthodox ritual is becoming even more enigmatic. The director seems to have done a decent job explaining everything verbally during the film's launch campaign; kinetically, however, this is a serious case of stuttering. As a feature-fiction, on the other hand, it suffers from flatness of character, simplicity of plot and message frankness. At times I felt like I was watching a cartoon. (for example, the wedding night consummation scene - without going into details on angles, positions and dimensions ... well, technically that could not be a realistic picture of the human sex, however wild it is. > <br /> There are no subtleties in this movie. Intelligent manipulation of cues, stimulating the imagination and the thinking of the viewer to take an active part in the cinematic text, which I believe is a mark of a good trait, is completely absent. On the contrary: watching the movie I felt, at times, as being force-fed over and over again with the same content already chewed and too obvious. It is, in fact, as director Gitai himself put in an interview, an "object displacement in the architectural" space, and then coloring the scenes with the appropriate emotions when requested and advancing the plot in its proper and predictable track; but the spark, that creative, unarticulate, dark, sparking spark that looks like a pixie (let's not forget that "Kadosh" is supposed to be a tragedy), which casts a two-dimensional screen into the spell that transforms it into an extension of the spectator world. missing without a trace. Maybe a visual engineer job, maybe an unsophisticated ideologue; definitely not from a true filmmaker. What I saw was a game of passion for lively issues rather than real people of flesh and blood. The performance, in general, could not transcend this flatness from the direction of a forced (sometimes even tortured) idea to be filmed. One notable, though relatively small, exception was that of the mikve-lady and the mother, both played by the excellent and experienced Lea Koenig. <br /> <br /> It takes more than strict adherence to a winning formula (that is, a portion of exotic, plus a painful but simple melodrama, plus a popular, preferably politically correct agenda) to torment my interests . The bottom line here, all told, is that for a considerable part of the movie I was just bored. Despite the novel, perhaps even from the pioneering discovery of using an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood as a film set, for which Gitai and his team deserve all the praise, I find the "Kadosh" also Nadosh (in Hebrew for "banal").
