Stage star Grace Hayes stars in this little dark movie. After years of being on stage, she will visit a small university town to check out the son being raised by her grandfather. The boy does not know who his mother is and when she sees him in a local malt shop, he is a gross fool. Part of the problem is that he is a college clown, the other part is that he is really spoiled. <br /> <br /> Curiously, the mother is actually very rich and has not only funded her son's life but is a robust contributor to college. So she has the idea of ​​forcing the young man to mature. She talks to the man who is raising Peter and has his permission cut off completely - hoping he will get up for the occasion. It turns out she puts the screws in school because she thinks all these kids need to stop playing and be more responsible. <br /> <br /> Now it's here that it gets really dumb. To show they know the value of hard work, she hires a lot of them to sing and dance in the malt store she just bought. Talk about artificial !! What happens next is like a long and not particularly good talent show or maybe a poor man's version of a musical by Judy Garland / Mickey Rooney! I suggest kids try to do something else to make money ... or maybe sing and dance until people pay to stop! I know I would pay them. Whereas talent is far from talented, Peter is a bad actor and his move from aggressive to adult is almost instant, the whole thing is a bit difficult to take. . Not a very good movie by any sensible standard, this is an obscure movie that should have gone dark! <br /> <br /> By the way, it's interesting that Hayes's son in the movie, Peter, is actually his real-life son. The only problem with that is that Peter Lind Hayes is a really horrible actor. He is not handsome enough to be a leading man and he comes out either as bored and uninteresting or downright nasty. In particular, all the stupid impressions he makes are really bad and he has the charisma of jelly that you take away from spam. Despite this terrible performance, he went on to have a reasonably successful acting career. Who would have believed if you had seen him in ZIS BOOM BAH - because here he is as welcome as bubonic plague !!
