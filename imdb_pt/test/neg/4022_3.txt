What was that, a Zucker brothers movie? I do not mind a bit of humor in my Holmes (I'm a big fan of "The Private Life of SH" by Billy Wilder), but this version of "The Sign of Four" looks like an episode of the Grand Guignol style. "Murder, She Wrote" (from the opening credits, which are of the worst kind possible: a montage of scenes from the film) as directed by Mel Brooks. Ian Richardson is a good actor, and certainly looks like the role (he is one of those who play The Strand!), But his character interpretation is all wrong and overly humorous, by the silly smile he often practices (I thought Holmes drug was in was cocaine, not marijuana) for their expressions of comical stiffness in the carnival sequences. Not to mention that when he disguises himself as an old man, he is so exaggerated that despite the beautiful makeup we recognize him instantly. David Healy is a memorable one, but, given the circumstances, acceptable Watson, and not much of a clown ... at least no more than the rest of the characters. Cherie Lunghi (Excalibur) plays Mary Morstan in a naive and exaggerated way of a vaudeville of the 1930s. Notions of history, there are some useless additions (such as giving vampire teeth to Tonga, an appetite for raw meat and a carnival pit as a place to live, turning it into a reject of the island of Dr. Moreau), and we are even denied the pleasure of discovering the mystery next to Holmes, since we are well informed of everything before Holmes found out. And this is full of tired cliches: not only do we have the infamous slogan "Elementary, my dear Watson" (which, as any Sherlockian will know, Conan Doyle never wrote), but we are exposed to such blatant commons as having Hindi music comes from nothing when Holmes goes to see a white guy in Hindi clothes. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: In the UK in the 1980s, two competing TV companies tried to create a series of long-lasting Sherlock Holmes adaptations. and produced early TV movies as potential pilots. One of them starred Ian Richardson, the other starred Jeremy Brett. Fortunately, the one that got through several episodes was the good! 3/10. Transvestite.
