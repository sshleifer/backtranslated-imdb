Mad scientist Professor Tabani drinks a potion he has prepared in his laboratory, but is turned into a vampire who wants blood. When Dr.Aqil visits, Tabani sees a picture of Aqil's wife, Shabnam, and, after turning Aqil into a vampire, Shabnam will make her his fiancee. Ahil's brother discovers the tomb of the vampire and his brother in the castle of Tabani and kills his brother with a knife to free his soul. Tabani manages to bite Shabnam and once turned she tries to lure her niece. .Qil's brother runs up against time to put an end to the vampire curse. "Zinda Laash" almost put me to sleep. The plot is extremely slow, but more or less follows Bram Stoker's famous novel. The suspense is completely absent as is gore and nudity. The film is only recommended for curious horror fans who want to see the second horror film made in Pakistan (after "Madman" 1964).
