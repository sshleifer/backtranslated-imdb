(spoiler) may be the worst movie you see, you may like how I liked it. It's one of those chance movies. <br /> <br /> There's a man who saw a day in his life. Black rats, some how sorry I am for it (which I think was a good idea). <br /> <br /> The murderous rats become friends man two great man comes making unwanted feel for the man to place the murderer rat on them and ground to put the two bodies covered with large black rats without much blood. <br /> <br /> But think of big black rats all over the body), but start killing them, but the rats get bored until the rats kill friends and girlfriends, <br /> <br /> One scene was sitting in the toilet while the rats went into the pipes that led to the bathroom and the mouse went up by his and out of his mouth (which means the mice must have eaten everything inside the body) I had to laugh for weeks /> <br /> Why I liked this movie, yes, it is different from the rest, me, for example, when the little creature assumes humanity. <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen any of these film slugs, slither, Them, spiders, snakes, tremors, Cujo, crocodile, shark, octopus. <br /> <br /> If you liked and check the Hood rats, <br /> <br /> it's better then Terror toons than all I can say! 4/10
