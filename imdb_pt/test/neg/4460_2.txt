Veteran British television director Alan Gibson, "Dracula A.D. 1972", qualifies as one of the less appetizing entries of the series Hammer Studios on the immortal blood sucker of Bram Stoker. In fact, this represented the first time since Terence Fisher's memorable Horror of Dracula (1958) that Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing fought each other as mortal enemies. They will reprise the same roles a few years later in the late Hammer Dracula: "The Satanic Rites of Dracula." In addition, it was the penultimate Dracula for Hammer, in which Lee presented / displayed like the infamous fangster. For the record, "Dracula A.D. 1972" was the seventh Hammer Dracula. <br /> <br /> The thrilling prologue of 1872 prepares you for something very different than the rest of this disappointing horror film produces. Eternal rivals Count Dracula and his enemy Professor Lawrence Van Helsing is literally in the throat of one another, in an uncontrolled carriage at Hyde Park in London, for a vigorous opening scene that makes everything else seem comparatively anticlimactic. The carriage beats, and Dracula emerges embracing half of a wooden wheel with its broken rays embedded in his chest. Of course Christopher Lee has to grab this broken wheel against his body, but the images are impressive enough to pass the test. The Count expires and his opponent, Van Helsing. However, one of Dracula's disciples snatches the Count's ring and places some of the vampire's ashes into a vial to keep. <br /> <br /> Don Houghton's script takes action for a hundred years in 1972. Meet a sarcastic young man, Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame of "No Blade of Grass"), who loves hell with a bunch of hippies who invades parties and leads the British police with their antics. Alucard happens to be the descendant of one of the servants of Dracula. Now, Alucard has the count's ring and a bottle of dehydrated blood. Alucard chooses the vision of a desecrated church to organize a black mass. He invites his fashionable friends, including Laura (super sexy Carolina Munro from "The Spy Who Loved Me"), Gayner (Marsha Hunt) and Jessica Van Helsing (Stephanie Beacham) to attend this black mass because it offers them something different. Not surprisingly, they resurrected the Earl, and the evil leech fixed his eyes on Jessica. Meanwhile, after Laura's body is discovered drained of blood, Scotland Yard Murray inspector (Michael Coles of "Doctor Who and the Dalkes") seeks help from Van Helsing's modern children, Lorrimar (Peter Cushing). Dracula wants revenge on Van Helsing, taking the granddaughter of the latter as his bride. Lorrimar traces Alucard; they fight in their apartment in Chelsea, and the young vampire drowns in a tub of water. Remember, running water is as deadly to vampires as sunlight and the crucifix. Van Helsing finds Dracula in the deserted church with his daughter waiting for the earl. Van Helsing and Dracula tangle. Van Helsing throws holy water on Dracula's face. The vampire falls into an open grave with a stake waiting for him and he decomposes again. The main problem with "Dracula AD 1972" is that we did not get enough of Lee as the Earl, although we achieved considerably more from Cushing as Van Helsing. In addition, showman Don Houghton keeps Dracula confined to the ruined church and never allows the vampire to venture into the city. Despite his low budget, "Dracula in 1972" could have been much better. The scene in which the contemporary Van Helsing has to write down Alucard and spell it back to get Dracula seems almost laughable. You would think he would know about this spelling trick backwards. Unless you are afraid of horror movies, this will make you yawn. Occasionally, Gibson presents us an excellent close-up of Dracula with his bare tusks and bloody eyes, but this is as scary as the chiller, and that's not saying much.
