I know that if I were a low budget filmmaker I would probably be checking this page to find out what people are saying about it. So I really hope the creators of the movie really read it! I think you should find a way to pay me for the hour and a half of life I ended up losing by seeing this crap. Please stop making movies about something you probably fancy about. Just stop making movies together ... you are one of the reasons why it is so hard for indie filmmakers to become great. Do the world a favor and get a McDonalds job or something so you can do something productive with your life! I feel like calling blockbuster to complain that they actually uploaded this movie in their store.
