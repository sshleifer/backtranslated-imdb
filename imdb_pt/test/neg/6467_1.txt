The only fun thing I found about watching this movie was listening to Star Wars going through the movie wall (yes, I'm going to a really bad movie). This movie is so painfully bad I think I'd rather have my eyes scratched by a cat instead of watching it again. <br /> <br /> Let's compare with the original. One is charming, funny, exciting, well-represented, and one of the best movies ever made, the other is so weird that all you can do is twist your eyes so that you do not have to watch anymore. I'm sorry, Christina Ricci is a good actress but can not compare to Hailley Mills, and did not even start me in Doug E. Doug in a part occupied by the incredible and absolutely charming Dean Jones. The small part of Dean Jones in the new version is the only partially redeeming part of this movie, and is the only reason why I can justify a rating of 1 * (also because imdb does not go into negatives).
