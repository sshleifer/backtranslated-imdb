This is a very strange movie, with an unnamed cast and virtually nothing known about it on the web. He uses a familiar approach to those who have watched the likes of Creepshow in that he introduces a trilogy of shorts called "horror" and combines them into a connecting narrative of the people who are involved in the segments of getting off a bus. There is a narrator who talks about relationships, but his speech adds absolutely nothing to the mix and just adds to the confusion. As for the stories themselves, well ... I swear I did not understand why this film received a certificate of 18 in the UK, which would put you in sync with names like Nightmare On Elm Street and The Exorcist. Nothing here is even remotely scary .. there is no gore, sex, nudity or even a dirty word to cheer things up, this is the kind of thing you could put on children's TV and no one would flick an eyelid. I can only think if he had the rating he really deserved (a PG), no serious horror fan would be seen dead with that, so the dealer probably hounded the BBFC until they gave in. Anyway, here are the 3 short stories: 1. A man becomes dangerously obsessed with his telekinetic car to the point of alienating his bride. 2. A man living in a filthy apartment is understandably frightened when a living organism evolved from his six-month-old tuna casserole. 3. A woman thinks she has found the perfect man through a computer dating service ... that is, until he begins to act strangely. And there it is. Some of them are quite fun due to their extravagant premises (my favorite is number 2) but you get the feeling that they were made to be a scary and b) morality plays, unfortunately they fail miserably in both ways. To summarize, this movie is an obscure curiosity ... for good reason.
