A better film could have been made to portray the tragedy of Bosnia. Some parts are very effective and the film does well to give an idea of ​​the suffering of people especially children, but overall it seems less a movie and more like a documentary. Woody Harrelson is very good, but the rest of the cast performed well without being too common. It should be noted to get a rough idea of ​​what the war did to the children of Bosnia. If anyone expects a great and exciting movie, welcome ...... it will be a disappointment.
