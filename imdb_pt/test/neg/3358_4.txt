Below average blaxpoitation action / melodrama in which the lovely Ms. Grier plays a private detective who comes to the aid of his father (Rudy Challenger) and his partner (Austin Stoker from the original "Assault on Precinct 13") whose loan deal is being I'll be frank - I agree with the few other user comments for this movie. "Sheba, Baby" has an unsatisfactory script, direction that is not particularly distinctive, action scenes that are moderately entertaining at best, and one of Ms. Grier's most common castings (although there is an important supporting role for D 'Urville Martin, also a household name in blaxpoitation). I have the impression that this routine film may have been assembled quickly just to profit from the sheer popularity of it. <br /> <br /> It sure was nice to see Stoker again, though Grier was not that good. a role - or dialogue - as she has had in other films, although she is doing her best, and that is playing a sexy and sexy sister on a revenge mission. <br /> <br /> Soul without stopping / The funk soundtrack is pleasant, at the very least. <br /> <br /> Recommended primarily for those who want to see everything in the movie repertoire Pam Grier. <br /> <br /> 4/10
