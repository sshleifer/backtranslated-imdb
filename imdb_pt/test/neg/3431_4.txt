This (very) low budget movie is fun if you're a fan of John Krasinski, but it's disappointing. At least it was short so I did not feel like I had wasted much of my time. John's scenes are funny enough, but the "deep" scenes with Lacey Chabert are nauseating. It starts out looking like it could be a funny movie, but some of the characters are so extravagant while the others are too serious, which just does not happen. Do not make me begin the end. It was totally implausible and did not even fit the rest of the film. I'll say I was not bored, and that's why I rated above three. Fans of John Krasinski will love to see you wearing a bandana and socks around your head and eating Cheez-Its. Oh, and be sure to check out the deleted scenes of John, they are better than some that were actually included in the movie.
