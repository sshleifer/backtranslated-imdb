This is a Hollywood piece that should never have left a can of film. Dialogue without a plausible thought, plots without point, staging without skill, driving without direction, and acting without the value of some junior high school class piece. The whole cast should have been arrested for overwork. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, fine!
