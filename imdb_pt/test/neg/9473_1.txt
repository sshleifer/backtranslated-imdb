I saw Roger Moore snorting at scenes that required running or exercise. He was a James Bond who would be more comfortable sitting in a bar telling stories with his fellow British Knights. Nothing against the elderly in age-appropriate roles, but how realistic is it for a fragile-looking 58-year-old man struggling on airplane wings, hanging beside a train, swimming in a swamp with crocodiles, and so on. ? In addition to the fact that OCTOPUSSY was incredibly silly, tasteless and idiot, the fact that a frail old man wrapped in many death-defying stunts just made it much easier to laugh at James Bond. In 1983, Roger Moore was clearly looking his age, and was far beyond the time when it seemed he could fight younger men. I saw this movie at the Theater, and the howls of laughter were many and very often. Any credibility that James Bond accumulated disappeared after OCTOPUSSY. <br /> <br /> The only thing lacking in OCTOPUSSY was Benny Hill and his supporting cast. Another low point was that the incredibly lame Louis Jordan was half the Axis of Evil. Jordan helped make the whole concept even more laughable. And the Russian general was a complete idiot. OCTOPUSSY works best as a comedy similar to SPIES LIKE US. <br /> <br /> Even the fight scene on the train was just a bad copy of the same train scenes made in many other movies by better actors. Take NORTHERN EMPEROR (1972) where Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine fought across the top and bottom of the train and made it look exciting and real. Roger Moore had a slim, fragile body in 1983. And yet his stuntman was clearly a younger, taller, more athletic, muscular man. Even the color of hair did not match. This only made his fight scenes more comical. Moore's scenes looked like those old low-budget Chop-Socky Kung-Fu movies, especially with the bad editing. The director seemed to try to improve bad acting and bad stunts, providing several visions of the same stunt. This only accentuated the differences between Moore and his stunt double. The fact that the train scenes with Moore were filmed inside a studio can be noticed by the lighting when Moore was in the shot versus the outside scenes of the stuntman on a real train. Although many of the James Bond movies have been the worst of all when it comes to editing their stunt fights. You can clearly see that Bond is not really struggling. Overall OCTOPUSSY has to rank as one of the worst movies ever made, and easily the worst of the worst James Bond movies.
