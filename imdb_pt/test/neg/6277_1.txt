I wish I had given it a zero. Of course I'll admit that I mistakenly picked it up thinking it was Spielberg's version. An intelligent marketing move that is being launched right now and featured prominently in the store. However, I was willing to give it a try anyway - I wish I had not. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? I read some of the other reviews here and I have to say that I do not agree with anyone who thinks anyone of the acting was good - sorry even C. Thomas Howell stunk. None of the presentations were good. Not one. <br /> <br /> Even if the acting was decent, the dialogue is terrible! "Ginormus" and "dick skinners" simply do not really cut. <br /> <br /> Now, as for the story as well - it has been terribly adapted and must have been edited by a 5 year old. The main character is constantly encountering situations that are very convenient - or at least appear that way because of how the movie was edited together. For example, he is trying to get to a place called New Hope to find his brother. During a brief pause, someone just randomly gives you instructions for New Hope. What the hell is that? When he arrives at New Hope, he finds his dying brother. Then there is the part where he is traveling away from his destination for days and simply finds the car in which his wife and son were traveling. He was going in a different direction, so how did this car end up where he was? was? He has a black backpack that appears randomly and disappears throughout the film. There are parts of the movie where the characters are just waking up in the morning and two seconds later it's night - or worse, at twilight the next day. I also can not forget the main character and the preacher falling on the floor of a house for no reason - we did not find out until later that an alien landed in the house. Which reminds me of the moment when they are walking and suddenly find themselves standing under an alien they did not notice. What the hell, the aliens are like two stories high with huge bodies and multiple legs - how could they miss it? There's a point where an alien kills a random citizen, supposedly spitting some kind of crap for it - but you never see the flying stuff just pops up in the guys' faces. The special effects in general are terrible. The whole movie is like a bad "train wreck." When we finally got to the end, after this guy trying to go to DC to find his family, they just show up. No research without asking questions at all. Oh, there you are, I'm so happy - the end. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if my comment diverted a little, but this movie was so bad that I had a difficult organization of my contempt. Please save time and do not watch this stack of cinematographic stench sneaked up. It's possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I'd rather be getting a root canal - it would have been less painful.
