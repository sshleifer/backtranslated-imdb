Watching this movie today, I have the impression that something was missing between 10 and 15 minutes since the beginning of the story. John Wayne rides at this trading post / lounge in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some thefts. All he sees are the signs of a massacre, some corpses, signs of struggle and no one in sight. That's because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room, the kind you find in the ancient mysteries of English homicide. <br /> <br /> The reason you find these halls hidden in this kind of story is that they were formerly padrases. Catholic families clinging to the ancient faith in 16th century England built these things to hide the royal authorities' escape because of their faith. It's not something you see in westerns, but a good trick. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, because of bad editing or writing, or both, we never know exactly what exactly brought Wayne to this place. But this was a western B and not even a good one at all. <br /> <br /> Gabby Hayes is in it and he's shaved and playing a dumb part of the time. An unusual circumstance for gabby chatter. <br /> <br /> If you want to bother and find out what happens and see a Gabby Hayes without a mustache, then check out this movie.
