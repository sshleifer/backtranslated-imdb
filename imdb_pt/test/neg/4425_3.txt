As many have detailed here with a level of seriousness that I find amusing, this is not *: A MOVIE. (suggestion of dramatic music) <br /> <br /> It's so bad, it's good, totally surreal, Jackie Chan, everyone's stunt. The women fighters are totally kicked and Jackie is definitely put in her place. <br /> <br /> This is the movie you want to see with some good friends on a Sunday afternoon - hungry, ready to giggle, cheer up the good guys, boo the villains and continually shout, "WHAT?" when something totally bizarre happens. Great fun !!
