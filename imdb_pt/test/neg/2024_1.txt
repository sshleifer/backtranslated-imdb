Did I see a worse movie? No, I can not say I have. That was pathetic. If the director is still alive: 1. He should not be. 2. He should be ashamed. 3. God, how I like to take my 2 hours completely wasted on your $$. <br /> <br /> To give you some "movie" tips: 1. (I am a man) and I would rather give myself a papercut in the opening of my urethra before I see this again (seriously). <br /> <br /> 2. He has a few well-known names (Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio). They do not help, and their careers in the movies after this "movie" are officially finished. <br /> <br /> 3. Dialogue is the worst I've ever heard. "I want to ejaculate in your bozonkas." What kind of writer did they have in this movie? Was he still using hooked-on-phonics and had he confused his letters to make those horrible phrases? Or was he trying to get the director killed by the few people who saw it? <br /> <br /> 4. Watch this "movie" backwards. Because I promise you that you do not want to see it ahead. <br /> <br /> 5. This "movie" would make Helen Keller get up and leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 6. The setting of the movie looks like a McDonald's-sized playground for adults. I was just waiting for this so-called "Dracula" to fall into the hole of the ball sometime in the movie. <br /> <br /> 7. Also, I like that in the year 3000 they still have wired headsets that go to the mouth. No bluetooth, no wireless headsets, no chips placed in the brain, but they use headphones borrowed from a telemarketing agency that went out of business in 1983. Good professional. I hope you are currently unemployed and unemployed. reading this.) <br /> <br /> 8. I do not know who was in charge of special effects, but I could have done better in my backyard with my VHS camcorder that has no battery. <br /> <br /> 9. I was a devout Catholic before this "movie". But since I saw him, I know there is no God, because if there was, he would not have let this movie be produced. I am now an atheist. <br /> <br /> 10. I will be honest, I can not talk about the ending. The last time I tried to explain, I fell into a coma. <br /> <br /> Annoying people, however curious (or brave) you are, for more laughter than you think will come out of this movie, please DO NOT SEE THIS. It literally ruined my life. AVOID ALL THE COSTS! <br /> <br /> Comment to the director: I hate you. You ruined my life. After seeing this I feel empty inside. My wife and children left me and they hate me because I could not speak or almost did not move after seeing this. I lost my job, my dignity and, above all, my pride. I will never forgive you in this life or the next (which does not seem good in my new beliefs).
