Tom and Jerry are visiting Africa and disguise themselves as fashionable "Amos-n-Andy". They even act and speak differently, using the degrading standard of extremely poor grammar associated with the stereotypical image of blacks portrayed in many cartoons of the time. In addition to the offensive images, this design is not very good. Why were they going to Africa in the first place? Apparently, just to provide the public with another Amos-n-Andy and the additionally used cannibalistic picture of the native Africans. The only reason this has a 2 rather than a 1 is that there are a decent few seconds involving an octopus. <br /> <br /> Worth a sight, it will still leave you shaking, wondering how ignorance could prevail ... <br /> <br /> (Note: I consider some cartoons containing very stereotypically racially-stereotyped images .It all depends on whether there is good content around the cartoon, or if the only reason for the existence of the cartoon is to make fun of those incorrectly portrayed. In other words, if you get rid of "Mammy", dragged feet, bad grammar , and images of black lips with giant lips is there anything left? In the case of "Plane Dumb" there is not.)
