It's as if the editor and the writer had only 40 minutes of real time. This is supposed to be a remake of a Chinese movie, which is obviously far superior to this crap. Of course, some Hollywood critics have decided that this movie would be head-to-head, man vs. man, instead of just letting the story unfold with the characters' personalities that were built in the first 40 minutes. At this point in the movie, the characters simply do not act like ordinary people and not even as their own personalities. Makes little sense. It is quite clear why this movie failed. It's not credible at all and that's too bad, "he began with a promise. Do not be fooled.
