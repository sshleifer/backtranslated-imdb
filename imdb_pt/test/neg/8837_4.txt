It is sad to say that this is one of the most ridiculous of John Wayne's Western series for Lone Star Productions. Here he is a United States marshal on the trail of a known bandit just, I am not joking like the Shadow. <br /> <br /> No, it's not Lamont Cranston, he's a guy who gives orders for an open wall. sure that his men will not see who he is. But the voice is unmistakable, you will know within 10 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> And another reviewer here is completely wrong, no scream or whine from the audience would have happened because Gabby Hayes was still playing a variety of roles and he is well shaved here. He had not yet found his niche as the kindly veteran aide to several heroes of movie cowboys like the Duke. <br /> <br /> He later leads his men openly into climax, so I'm not sure what the point of the original gimmick with the safe wall was. I do not think those who wrote this also knew. <br /> <br /> Wayne picks up Yakima Canutt as an Indian helper here and the relationship is almost the same as a Lone Ranger and Tonto without a mask. <br /> <br /> It's all very silly if you ask me.
