Firstly, I refuse to consider this work as a video clip ... I consider it a short film that uses excerpts from the song "Thriller" in its soundtrack. For me, a video clip should not exceed the song itself, and the song should play the entire length of the video. To call it a video clip is like calling a poem from The Great Gatsby. Also ... let's face it ... "thriller" is a tedious 14 minutes, including the extremely dated werewolf transformation, Price Price's poem (just because the VP recites that does not mean he's not lame), and the zombies less threatening than I have ever seen. Of course, this was certainly a cultural phenomenon, but do not forget, this also happened at the same time that A-Team was the number one show on TV, so we're not going to give the culture much credit about it ... last point about the impact of this movie on the media in music videos ... what exactly has this increased the equation that "Billie Jean" and "Beat It" no longer added? From what I can tell, it just added the practice of stopping the music for some dialogue, or a superfluous dance scene ... so you could say that all that this video really did was inspire Puffy to make music videos more annoying . Not quite my definition of great
