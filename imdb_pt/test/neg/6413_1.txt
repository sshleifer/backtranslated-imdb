This is the stupidest movie ever made. The story is laughable. His wife and son think he's crazy. So they did not. So it happens that he is and I think they knew all along. There's a dog named Ned that causes some problems and I think it's all his fault ... Jim Carey too. God knows why Virginia Madsen took on that role ... this is a career problem. I think the target audience for this is 11 and 12 years old. And that adds up to 23 or maybe it's for 8- and 10-year-olds who also add up to 23. Or maybe it's for really stupid 23-year-olds. Or maybe really stupid 32 years, because they are 23 in the opposite direction. Or maybe 46-year-olds would have fun because half of that is 23. I guess looking for things on the internet about number 23 would be more fun than this movie unless you wanted to watch a comedy.
