I watched this movie mainly to see Charlie Ruggles and Una Merkel, two of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The plot has many twists and turns - not bad as a direct mystery aboard a train. <Br /> <br /> But why play a circus train accident and an escaped gorilla? I can mention this without being a "spoiler," because the circus train wreck and the gorilla have nothing to do with the complex mystery plot. <br /> <br /> The bad person trying to kill good people has many tricks his sleeve, but the circus train accident was mere coincidence. It allows a unique scene with a menacing gorilla, but then back to the murder mystery!
