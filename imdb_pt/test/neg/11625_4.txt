When I was a little girl, I loved The Swan Princess, I was reliving the same fairy tales from Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, the princess and her prince who saves the day is always a timeless story that will never die, I expect. But I figured I'd take a look at The Swan Princess sequels to see what they were like and unfortunately that's the typical cartoon sequence that just disappoints more than entertains. The only character I found was still very entertaining was the Queen, she was very funny in this movie and had the best part. But with the mute voice, they were noticed and also bothered me a bit, I do not want to be picky, but it was very strange for me. The story was also more or less borrowed from the first Swan Princess, only the villain in this movie is following in the footsteps of Rothbart. Odette and Derek are about to celebrate their one-year anniversary, but Derek was too preoccupied to fight for his kingdom to keep him safe. With his mother's birthday also coming, he forgets about it, since there is a new villain in town, Clavious, who hopes to go beyond where Rothbart's powers went and kidnap the queen on her birthday. But Odette must return to her swan to help Derek fight him and save his mother. <br /> <br /> The Swan Princess 2 is more than right for kids, which I do not care about, it's good fun clean for them. The reason these sequels are disappointing is because it's usually just for kids, it's the audience they want, but it's most enjoyable when jokes and stories can be enjoyed by everyone. Now there are some laughs and giggles here and there, but that was not so clever in my opinion for the first Princess Swan. I would recommend it for the small ones, but if you are looking for a fun cartoon movie, I would recommend staying with the first Swan Princess. <br /> <br /> 4/10
