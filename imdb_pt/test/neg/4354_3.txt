I've tried watching this movie 3 or 4 times, but I just can not get over the fact that everything is horrible. I'm sure it was a bold move by someone to put Jack Palance as the protagonist, but there is not a single fiber of my being that believes he can act, much less act against the guy. <br /> <br /> Yes, I understand that Clifford Odets was a brilliant author, but it is not evident here. This strange and forced mixture of the 1950s hipster dialogue seems to obscure any genuine meaning, which explains why none of the actors, even the good ones (Steiger, Ida Lupino, Shelly Winters, and Everett Sloane) seem to know how to deliver their lines. "It's as if they do not understand the meaning of what they're saying. And meanwhile, Wendell Corey and Palance stage a fantastic contest to see who can be more impassive. <br /> <br /> The direction is amateur and completely exhausted. The physical interaction between the characters is as blistering as the dialogue. <br /> <br /> And can we discuss this hideous set? It is so busy, ugly and artificial that it increases the robotic and disconnected quality of characters, dialogue and portraits. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to suck the energy from within me. It seems that everyone took an overdose of Valium every morning when they arrived on set. It takes a really bad movie to make Rod Steiger and Shelly Winters look bad, but that's a success. <br /> <br /> I can see that it may have been effective as a play on or off Broadway where intellectuals and beats. might have been congratulated for appreciating the power of the plot and the artistic flourishes of the pseudo-hip dialogue.
