Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster movie, as a remake of any of the old 'Giant Attack' - movies of the 50s, 60s and 70s. Or rather it should have been more like a remake of , instead of what it was. So how is a monster movie made in the year 2002? Well, since the typical opening with some chemical making the spiders grow to huge proportions, they mix films like Gremlins, Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers and the flavor with some parody like Scary Movie. Gremlins is probably the best comparison, but Oight Legged Freaks was so full of parodies and stupid jokes that it was sometimes more like the movie Scary. It was too much, at least if you're looking for a monster movie and not just another parody movie full of jokes. <br /> <br /> For a movie like that you do not expect much from acting, and that's how it went. The story, though, was extremely thin, with just a bunch of events connected to show some action mixed with all the jokes, leading to an easily spotted and tacky ending. <br /> I quote Eight Legged Legs a 4/10, and that includes the fact that the special effects were very good and that the noises that the spiders made were hilarious.
