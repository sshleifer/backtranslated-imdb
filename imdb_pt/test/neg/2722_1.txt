I am disgusted and shocked by the positive comments this movie is receiving. It is not only tricky, manipulative and melodramatic. It is also blatantly offensive. The character of Radio `Gooding Jr. 'is displayed as a cute animal, like a puppy that is so cute that you just want to take it home. This mentality is shameless; Radio is never treated as a human being, but as a manipulative device to attract sympathy from its audience. Even more atrocious are the numerous moments of the film, in which the Radio is hit in the head / trip / falls / etc. These slapstick comedy moments made the audience howl with laughter merely because, "It's funny because the radio is retarded." That is shameless. Now I do not feel that the word "retarded" is an appropriate word to describe the mentally retarded, but this seems to be the stance the film is taking: `Radio is retarded, but okay, because he is cute and we like him. 'Gooding's picture seems more suited to a John Water movie than an inspiring family drama. To add insult to injury, the film is incompetent on all levels, Debra Winger is not inspired by the role of "stereotypical housewives" that the very reminder of their monstrous heinous insights laugh at everyone who sees the film. The Score by John Horner is pure sap always covering his tear of some score on the tired cinematography. Ed Harris is decent in a role that he could have slept in, but manages to keep much of the attention of the audience throughout the film. In conclusion, if you consider yourself a decent human being, ignore this farce of a movie, read the book, but otherwise skip this terrible movie about an interesting character in American history.
