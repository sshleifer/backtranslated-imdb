This movie is worse than Cat People, which I saw the same week. It has all the style of the 80s. MTV punk rockers, true ones who are anti social, are not the commercial type of PC of today, boys of fraternity, and a bad guy called Splater. I really like Splater, and the film does that blue-lighting sensation of the '80s, but the rest looks like a low-budget Canadian schlop. I've seen a lot of this while living in this great country, and I realize that this kind of film was made because of tax breaks. Avoid at all costs.
