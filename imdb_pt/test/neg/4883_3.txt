This movie is overrated, to say the least. It's not good as a comedy and it's not a "serious" movie either. The pace is very hard for the first, and there is a lot of clowning for the second. The only laughter comes from Bud Spencer's reaction shots when he gets exasperated by his brother's behavior. The dubbing is great, but the full-screen framing is shocking. (* 1/2)
