Why did they change the beautiful Rugrats television show that we all know and love in a weak attempt to reach teenagers? They do not have to do this. All ages notice the regular Rugrats. When I heard about it, I thought, "Hey, they did a TV series about the movie, except they're really grown up as a teenager! When I saw it, it was as if I was watching Told By Ginger, except they did it. Great job. <br /> <br /> When in the Rugrats series, was Tommy the director? Never. Basically all the episodes in this series are about Tommy's love for driving. I do not like this. I prefer watching episodes that change every episode. It is not the same thing over and over again. Also, when in the old series did each character have their own sides to the story? Never. This series did it. I did not like everyone to separate. I do not want to see the side of Angelica's story. I hate her. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this show if you like As Told By Ginger and the Rugrats.
