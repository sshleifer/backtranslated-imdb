This movie is not worth the time it takes to put it on the VCR or DVD! Michael Dudikoff and Lisa Howard are two bounty hunters in love, but they are totally opposite. She is ambitious and organized while he is relaxed and totally disoriented. <br /> <br /> In this movie, bad guys chase Jersey Bellini (Dudikoff's character). This opens the door to bad godfather impressions, ridiculous fight scenes, and Tony Curtis playing the most effeminate mob boss I've ever seen! The ending has to be the most ... unbelievable scene I've seen in a movie in some time. I would believe that the Terminator, even the Matrix, has a better chance of possibly being true than this ending! This movie just smells at a low price. The script had to have struck someone as being totally ridiculous. However, the green light was given to this piece of manure to be made and released in unsuspecting public. I watched this movie with several other people who agreed that we were cheated. No one in the group could say anything good about the movie except that it ended.
