Despite John Travolta's statements in interviews that this was his favorite role of his career, "Be Cool" proves to be a disappointing sequel to "Get Shorty" from 1995, smart and intelligent. <br /> <br /> Travolta offers a very pleasant performance. in this slightly entertaining film, but ultimately the film falls due to an underdeveloped plot, enviable characters and a surprising lack of chemistry between the actors Travolta and Uma Thurman. Although there is some laughter, this example of a lackluster dialogue (which often appeared in the trailers) says it all: Thurman: Do you dance? Travolta: Hey, I'm from Brooklyn. <br /> <br /> The movie suggests that everyone in the entertainment business is a gangster or aspires to be one, comparing it to organized crime. In "Get Shorty," a gangster's premise "to become legitimate" upon entering the theater was a clever idea about water, but in "Be Cool," it seems the business has been totally crooked ever since. The film is curiously released and the absolute highlight is a "monolgue" delivered by The Rock, whose character is an aspiring actor, as well as a fool, where he reenacts a scene between Gabrielle Union and Kirsten Dunst of " May come." Vince Vaughan's character thinks he is black and he is often seen dressed as a pimp - this was pretty funny in the first scene that presents him and gets tired and embarrassing almost immediately afterwards. Overall, "Be Cool" may be worth a rental for John Travolta's die-hards (of which I am one), but you may want to keep your finger near the fast forward button to get past it without feeling that you have lost much time. Fans of "Get Shorty" may actually want to avoid this, since the sequel is devoid of most of the things that made that a winner. I rate this movie an admittedly tough 4/10.
