Apparently in early 2005, the SciFi Channel threatened to disclose the incriminating photos they had of John Rhys-Davies and said, "We need you to star in another SciFi Original." The scariest thing is that he's really good at this movie. This is actually saying something, since this is a silly resource of the SciFi creature; you have to put some feeling into it to be well-acted. Unfortunately, no one else does. It's his stereotyped movie "moster-run-amok" on a cruise ship. The cryptozoologist wants to keep the creature alive, the Navy SEALs think they have everything under control, but they do not know what they are dealing with and they all end up dead, a girl jumps into the role of "sexpot movie" like Rhys Davies' daughter and the creature kill about 100 shipmates. What this movie has to do is, it's very fast and lively; you never get bored or waiting for another death. In addition, however, it does nothing to distinguish itself, and it is silly that this thing creeps all over the ceiling and can not be hurt by Navy SEAL machine guns, but can be kicked by karate by the daughter of Rhys-Davies. Kind of back and forth giving this bad boy a 5, but by the foolishness above I am giving a 4.
