This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. The acting was so bad. Anthonie Kamerling used to be a good actor, but in this film he seemed to be reading his text on a piece of paper. Especially his voice was extremely wooden. Beau van Erven Dorens was completely exaggerated like Fraser, although this probably had more to do with the low-quality dialogue. "Ik ook van jou" is an adaptation of a book, and it seems that the creators of the film have forgotten that the film dialogue follows different rules of literary dialogue. It all sounded like a way to get rid of books. <br /> <br /> Some of the situations were very poorly visualized. Example: somewhere in the beginning of the movie, there is a scene where a canoe passes quickly. This piece is simply too incredible to be true. You see a piece of river obviously somewhat shallow, with many stones just below the surface (hence the fast). We hear a suspense song to warn us that there is danger ahead. A canoe with the girls passes through that rather superficial speed. Our hero then dives several feet below the surface to rescue one of the girls. Girl faints in his arms and utters the words 'You saved me ...' Vomit! <br /> <br /> Actually, it was so bad, it was funny. This is sad, because it really was not intentional. In the meantime, I heard a guy behind me say, "Oh God, there's another part!" My feelings exactly. What scares me is that the final credits of 'Ik ook van jou' were in English. Does that mean it will be released overseas? Only when the Netherlands began to have a good reputation after films like 'Antonia' and 'Karakter' (Character) ...
