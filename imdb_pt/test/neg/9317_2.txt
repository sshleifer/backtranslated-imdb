Help! Once again, Paul Schrader sabotaged his own intentions with a monotonous and pedantic narrative. I reorganized the holidays so that I could see this "world premiere". What a mistake! Why did Schrader even want to make an Exorcist movie? Good intentions are good, but if I wanted two hours of theological conversation, I would visit my nephew's Sunday school. Father Merrin's struggle with his faith, presented in his youth, is a potentially interesting subject. But an Exorcist movie needs more! The ruthlessly drawn presentation, coupled with ridiculous special effects, makes a strange production. Who is this movie for? I did not bother to see Harlin's version, but at least they apparently tried to deliver some kind of visceral emotion. <br /> <br /> The Exorcist series has been quite strange. The first film was excellent, but all the sequences were not loved and were useless. Why do they keep doing them? I suppose Schrader made a lot of money. But why should we go?
