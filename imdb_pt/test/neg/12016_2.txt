Seriously! You only have to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it. It came out during the time when everyone was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy (little rascals, Mr. Nanny, etc.) still lacked charisma or enthusiasm. Each character in the film is driven by fury, with the exception of Trixie's mother, who only shows aggravation and weariness, possibly in the tired cliche of the film. <br /> <br /> Put simply, the biggest flaw in the movie was not acting, not filming, but mostly writing. The lines we receive are reminiscent of the Disney classics, although this film does not have the whole heart that '' Walt could do. Junior's father (John Ritter) goes crazy doing nothing, simply because he allows Junior to run without supervision, and only gives him a stern warning when he records a 60-pound giant on a chalkboard. <br /> <br /> In addition, Junior's grandfather is particularly excruciating. For those of you who saw the first, I found it nauseating, and so, did not see the second, "Big Ben Healy" as it is referred to in this film, is still a total douche. He basically invades John Ritter's house uninvited, installs himself in Junior's bedroom, even though he says he hates Junior, and basically does nothing to speed up the movie, or to support the movie anyway. Instead, he grimaces at the public for being a free, lazy loader. <br /> <br /> Finally, we are introduced to a wide variety of new characters, such as the presumptuous and obnoxious Trixie, who carries dynamite in his backpack. , which she first lights, then delivery, to Junior, who simply looks wide-eyed. In addition, Gilbert Gottfried returns in this film, this time playing the main detestable in Junior's new elementary school. If Gilbert Gottfried is not enough to explain, I'll put it simply: This movie smells! <br /> <br /> 2/10 stars, because the actor's convictions shine through the film, even if the script sucks. .
