Unlike most reviewers of this particular movie, I really am not much of a fan of Cynthia Rothrock, to say the least. However, when I saw that the film had Fred Williamson and Robert Forster (both great actors), I just had to watch the movie. Williamson is a Dakota Smith, an alcoholic cop who is demoted to scrub toilet with a toothbrush and, worse, to have to join Cynthia at the request of the captain (Robert Forster). Forster is always watchable, it's just a shame that the movie itself is so damn clich√©. He also has one of the less terrifying villains to be compromised with celluloid. Williamson would return to the character Dakota in some more films, being the next one "Down N Dirty".
