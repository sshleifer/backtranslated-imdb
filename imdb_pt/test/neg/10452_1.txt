The science fiction channel thinks this is science fiction; it's a shame. Big Bugs, Snakes, Mythical Beasties, and so on, they persist. <br /> <br /> Someone at Universal had the brain to include BattleStar Galactica (the new and good) and Firefly for a brief moment in its line. above. I know they know the difference between total junk and high-quality science fiction. <br /> <br /> Some years ago they were talking about how they were going high and powerful, making productions that were not just for us. grouper, lame-o Trekkies. Many thanks, Sci-Fi! You know, you make movies so bad, until the Trekkies do not watch them, so you've reached your goal! Fire Snake, Ice Spiders, Manticore, Larva, etc. and an immense and relentless garbage storm later, and they are still developing faster than the latest flu virus! How they do it is beyond my knowledge. Why they do it, I just do not know. How they can ignore these reviews, comments, blogs and emails, also do not know, but of course they do not think much in public or do not care about our opinions! They seem to think this is what science fiction fans want! You would think that one or two good productions, with some sense, would infiltrate whoever lit up this junk is on vacation. At least they are employing the toy mismatch collection; many of the sci-fi films of the week that the actors were at the Science Fiction shows once and now need the money. I love you and I hope you can get a better job!
