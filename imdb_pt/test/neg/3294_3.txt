I grew up watching sitcoms like Seinfeld, Roseanne, Simpsons, etc etc in other words, mainstream television. Over the years, many sitcoms have appeared in the air, and of those, a very small percentage is genuinely intelligent and fun. The War at Home is a prime example of most modern American comedy. <br /> <br /> I give the show a 3 out of 10 because it's what it claims to be, a comedy, but it does not. seems to go out of his way to be a good comedy. A good comedy should make you have fun with your big jokes, you should not be able to see them coming and at TWAH I see almost all the jokes coming. The characters are probably the most simplistic and horrible stereotypes I've ever seen on screen, and the acting is not very good except for the father who portrays a stereotypical beer sport drinking a perfectly fine American idiot. <br /> <br /> Poor unbelievable characters, and jokes that do not take you by surprise diminish this show to the point of being impossible to be seen. If you do not have cable TV and would like to watch a comedy that is worth watching, try the Boston Legal. Worth your time more.
