God, this sucks. You can not end a horror movie with a happy family environment forever. Yeash I was half ambivalent going for the final act. But my god. He did not have to kill the girl, she did not die, the ghost father shows up with a cure (which does not make sense, because his spirit would have been released after the killer boy killed all the bad werewolves). What a piece of crap. This is the worst horror movie I've seen in a long time, and I've watched many horror movies. This is a slap in the face of Landis and everyone else involved in American Werewolf in London. Blegh I hope this has ruined everyone's career at the Julie Delphy bar. And CGI: new and chic medium in 1997, but today it seems monotonous compared to the artistic work of prosthetics / makeup in London. Anyway, I finished, I hope I scared some people. Get the original instead, or not the Howling. Or failing that, the American Idol reruns. Just do not watch this mess.
