Revisiting old movies that you thought were average is not necessarily a good thing. They sometimes get worse. Defended by the Fangoria camp (in Gorezone, they labeled it "the scariest movie since the Texas CHAINSAW", um, no), LUTHER THE GEEK inexplicably developed a following cult as an "intense" horror image. In fact, it is just a stem and a medium cut, bite film that separates briefly from the bunch while showing a killer who cluck like a chicken. Yes, clucks like a chicken. To the filmmaker's credit, at least they did not make the killer sound like a duck to LA THE NEW YORK RIPPER. That would be silly. <br /> <br /> Narrative logic is completely abandoned in LUTHER THE GEEK. I'm not saying that horror movies are plentiful with reason, but at least in HALLOWEEN Michael Myers escaped. Luther is actually on parole after a long scene in which people argue that he is retired, even though he scratches like a chicken and has dentures (which he apparently did in prison). It's the kind of movie where a couple sees a knock on the door and the girl says, "Oh, my mother must have forgotten her keys. She's forgotten a lot of things since my father died." The kind of movie where the hysterical mother runs to a cop looking for Luther and tells him, "The killer is in my house!" So, what does he do? He grabs her and literally drags her back to the house and says, "Just show me where he is and I'll do the rest." Why not call back? <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the film is full of such horrible action and dialogue, because the character Luther is really interesting. Most of the credit goes to Ed Terry, one dead to Tom Noonan in MANHUNTER, who gives Luther a genuine air of threat. In the hands of a certain director, LUTHER THE GEEK could be on the same level as SONNY BOY or SANTA and be a true cinematic oddity. But Albright is not that director and just puts the fascinating character of Luther into dreadful traps of terror.
