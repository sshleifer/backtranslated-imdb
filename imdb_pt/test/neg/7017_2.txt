I'm a big fan of "Aunt Mame" with Rosalind Russell. She really was the perfect actress to play this character. <br /> <br /> I heard that Angela Lansbury was very good on stage in "Mame", but it's hard to imagine someone at the top of Rosalind Russell. <br /> <br /> Lucy was a great comedian that her comics regained her performance in this movie where I think she was wrong. Really, they should have nicknamed their voice - listening to those songs sung at a faster rate and with loud voices really changes the whole. It is made. <br /> <br /> I just saw the rebirth of the stage in Washington DC and I think Christine Baranski was very good as Mame, Harriet Harris - the nasty smoking agent in Frasier - played Vera and she was particularly good. <br /> <br /> Both would be good releases for a TV movie of this show. Maybe, if production hits Broadway, they'll consider filming. <br /> <br /> I also think Tracy Ullman would be good as Agnes.
