I put the blame for The Comebacks on anyone who has enjoyed Date Movie and Epic Movie. You have encouraged the Fox studio to continue producing desperate parody movies, and now we are facing what may be the most lazy and desperate of them. Comebacks hardly qualify as a parody. Heck, barely qualifies as a movie. This is a comedy in theory, but not in execution. No one, not even the people involved with this mess, could have been wrong thinking they were making a funny movie. Director Tom Brady (The Hot Chick) has done something truly miserable here. <br /> <br /> The plot, if you can call it that, centers on a man named Lambeau Fields (David Koechner). When I heard his name in the first few seconds of the movie, I knew it was in a long movie. Funny names are rarely funny, and they become even less funny the more you hear them. Lambeau is one of the worst coaches in the world, but he got another chance from his best friend, Freddie Wiseman (Carl Weathers), to train a football team called The Comebacks. Lambeau should not only lead the team to victory, but also teach them the clich√©d modes of inspiring sports films. He expects his children to have low grades and problems with alcohol and ridicules them when they do not. When it looks like the team has a chance to play in the big WC Bowl game championship (Did the 10-year-old write this script?), Lambeau is shocked to discover that Freddie is the coach of the great rival team that his team is playing against. It turns out that Freddie only encouraged Lambeau to take over as coach because he wanted The Comebacks to lose. <br /> <br /> Comebacks are such a forced and pathetic movie that I almost had trouble believing what I was watching. Parody films have recently become a game of "identifying the film's reference," and this continues the tradition. He tries to include as many references to other sports movies as possible, but does absolutely nothing with them, expecting us to just point to the screen and laugh at the familiarity, or try to be funny and fall on his face. face. Some of the movies cited include Field of Dreams, Bend It Like Beckham, Rocky Balboa, Friday Night Lights, Fure, Radio, Miracle, Remember the Titans, Iron Cross Gang, Invincible, and Dodgeball: A True One Story of Underdog. But wait, was not Dodgeball ever a parody of inspiring sports movies? So in other words, we're watching a parody of a parody of inspiring sports films. If that makes any sense to you, you're just the audience that this movie is looking for. Some of these films are referenced in the plot, and some (like Rocky) are simply released for no reason, because the filmmakers wanted to refer to as many films as possible. There are some that the film feels the need to explain us in their dialogue, just in case we miss the obvious reference. You know a movie is in trouble when you have to spell your own jokes for us. <br /> <br /> Worst of all is that the screenplay of TV veterans and screenwriters for the first time, Ed Yeager and Joey Gutierrez, I do not know the first and most important rule of the parody - you have to play straight. The actors have to pretend they are not kidding. The reason the classic Zucker Brothers movies such as Airplane, Top Secret and The Naked Gun are so lovingly remembered is because they cast serious actors like Leslie Nielsen (yes, he was a serious actor before turning into humor) and Robert Stack, and then played them in ridiculous situations. What made it funny is that they acted as if they were not in a comedy, and kept a face of stone to the strangeness around them. These films would not have worked if they played their roles extensively. Comebacks prove this, as all actors are forced to play their roles so joyfully, it's as if they're screaming to laugh. David Koechner keeps waving his arms around, eyes widening and screaming at the top of his lungs, to the point that he looks like someone who knows he's stuck in a dead-end comedy, and just tries to pretend he's having a good time. . The film also does not understand the art of celebrity appearances (also a major factor when it comes to parody movies). What kind of cameos do we get in The Comebacks? Andy Dick and Dennis Rodman. <br /> <br /> By the time the movie releases an extremely senseless cast musical number for Journey's "Do not Stop Believing" for absolutely no reason, I was almost ready to step out the door of the theater. I was the only person in my exhibit, and the thought of this movie going the pathetic path to a completely empty house appealed to me. I went through the rest of The Comebacks and was not rewarded for my efforts. The sad thing is that Fox has not yet finished killing the parody genre. They have a parody of 300 that comes out next year called Meet the Spartans. I would say it can not be much worse than that, but I saw the trailer, and I would not want to have your hopes up.
