A superficial and materialistic absurdity. How can women (and gays?) Enjoy this garbage is beyond me. No man who respects himself would ever want to be with one of those neurotic gold diggers. What is even more disturbing is that so many reviewers say they relate to women in the program. If this is the future of women, Lord, help us all. Showing your independence and being respected as equal to men should not be a matter of spreading your legs every three seconds with a different man. I think this humiliates women and does not do them justice. But this review is not against women. Fans of this show say it's "hilarious" and "dynamic," but every time I watched that show I just struggled to stay awake. Despite the narrative of the woman reporter, at no point in the series is there anything close to something that can be considered a rational thought. So, it's not fun, and it's not informative, so why bother watching? One in ten stars.
