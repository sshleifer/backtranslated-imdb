Cowardly and cynical, 'The Hospital' represents the low point of Paddy Chayefsky's special celebration of status quo disguised as satire. <br /> <br /> Thanks to hard-hitting director Arthur Hiller, this ridiculous script gets ugly visually. Only a great performance of George C. Scott, in the petty-spirit role he was born to play, makes "The Hospital" not a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Scott's performance does a disservice to viewers. Their magnetism keeps them watching when they can turn off the videocassette more profitably and clean the cabinets, look at the clouds or watch reruns of 'Baywatch'. <br /> <br /> Surely, anyone investing emotionally in the set-up _ seemingly mad modern medicine _ will feel cheated by the somber reward, where Chayefsky reveals that the system works well, so get out of your car. <br /> <br /> While the first half of this movie provides some fun black comedy, everything turns out to be a red herring. Before that is clear, however, Chayefsky gives some good lines to Scott as his white middle-aged, middle-aged, middle-class man. <br /> <br /> Bitter, alcoholic, impotent, Dr. Herbert Bock of Scott. alienated those who know him best, and he has the bile to continue alienating them. In Chayefsky's worldview, all of this, of course, makes Bock a magnet for a hippie girl half his age. <br /> <br /> Touching a collection of adjectives, long-haired, long legs, no bra and almost no bust Diana Rigg struggles on the girl's part. The British Rigg is miscast as a free spirit of the Southwest, but any other actress would fight as well. Like the rest of a good cast, Rigg can not overcome a script that is not interested in any character except Bock, or any philosophy beyond banality. <br /> <br /> For fans of George C. Scott, this is another star turn and worth seeing. For fans of the dark comedy, turn it off after the first 45 minutes. For anyone else, do not bother.
