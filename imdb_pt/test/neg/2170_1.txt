When I was voting I was going to give a 2, but seeing that 1 meant horrible, hit the nail on the head. The portrait of the Native Americans as bloodthirsty wild is deeply disturbing to me. This is the third film I have seen of D. Griffiths where the races of men are stereotyped in ugly ways. The man is not able to tell his side of the story, so I'll try to avoid personally attacking Mr. Griffith. In my opinion, the three films probably influenced thinking of millions of people and their children's children. Films like this probably did for many of the resentments that are still with us .. Some might say that camera work was great, the action is the first time for your time. The positives are very offset by the negatives, it's like someone taking $ 10 from you and giving you a penny back to make up for it.
