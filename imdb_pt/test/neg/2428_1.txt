Horrible, horrible, horrible ... <br /> <br /> I loved the original movie. It was funny, charming and had heart ... this piece of crap has NONE of those things. Reused jokes from the original movie, stupid tunes, bad animation, different voices (with the exception of Kronk and Yzma) sounding NOTHING like the original (especially Pacha ... * shudder *). <br /> <br /> The characters are out of the model, the animation is boring and boring, it's just a bad job. And why is Kuzco an idiot again? I thought he had retired ... but since when these TV spin-offs are loyal to the original * rolls his eyes *. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but there's nothing redeemable about it ... Avoid at all costs.
