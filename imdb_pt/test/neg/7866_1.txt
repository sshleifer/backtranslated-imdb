If this film were rated on a scale of 1 to 10, it would be necessary to create a new rating system because it should not even qualify. The plot of the movie, (if you can call it that) revolves around Charlie (Stephen Baldwin), a former special agent agent who is being targeted by the brother of a man he killed while still working for the government from the USA. If this sounds like an interesting scenario, please do not be fooled, as this movie will not deliver what your action-themed story suggests. <br /> <br /> Comedian Chris Rock once said that when you see an actor making a bad movie that makes someone want to send the actor $ 50, given that the actor must be desperate for money to do a job of bad quality. After watching this movie, you can send $ 100 to Stephen Baldwin. <br /> <br /> It seems that Baldwin put no effort into his role in the film. In the film, Baldwin is forced to run around the city of Los Angeles in order to protect his "honeycomb" (wife) from being murdered by the brother of a man he had already killed. However, throughout the picture, it seems that Baldwin can barely make a light run. Its relaxed performance can subtract from any suspense that the film may have intended to portray. <br /> <br /> If you are the type of person who likes to watch very bad movies and laugh at their shortcomings, this movie is for you. However, if you are looking for a well-made action thriller, it would be better to look elsewhere rather than rent this movie.
