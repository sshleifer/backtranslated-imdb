Lina McLaidlaw is a lonely and brilliant young woman who falls in love unexpectedly with Johnnie Aysgarth, a highly qualified bachelor with a crush on losing money. They get married, but almost at one time Lina is subject to Johnnie's addiction to lying, gambling and getting into debt. Despite her flaws, she is unable to resist her charming manner until she begins to suspect that he may be harboring murderous thoughts toward her ... This is a good movie as well made, with a compelling cast, a good screenplay, and possibly the only worst finale in movie history. Ok, this is going too far, but not too much. Many movies change the end of a book (Great Expectations, The Shining, etc.) but the latter two scenes of this not only manage to be horribly thighs, but also leave the whole previous plot completely meaningless. The story is about a woman whose husband is driven by her greed and moral lack - and what she knows about him - to kill her. It must end (as in the book by Francis Iles / Anthony Berkeley, Before The Fact) with him trying to assassinate her. The reason for this is not that the studio forced Hitch to remake the ending, one of the earliest examples of the audience test preview process. Hitch was clever and did as he was told (this was only his third Hollywood movie), knowing that if he played the game, sooner or later he would gain creative control of his films, evidenced by his masterpieces of fifty years. But that still leaves us with a final turkey. This is a great shame because it really is a very good movie with an intriguing theme - does anyone really know the husband or wife well? The screenplay is excellent with many moments of nonchalance (like when Lina's father dies and Johnnie supposes he's crying about it), a performance judged by Grant (who never played a villain again) and good photography everywhere, culminating in the famous dose of glass of milk. Fontaine won an Oscar for this performance, although personally I prefer her confusion and vulnerability in her former wife role in Rebecca. I'd like to rate this movie higher, but I really can not forgive this ending; this is what happens when movies are made for money, not for love, which, curiously enough, I think is the theme of the movie itself. Look quickly at Hitchcock's cameo as a man posting a letter.
