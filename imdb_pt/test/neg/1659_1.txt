I rate movies on this site all the time, but usually do not write reviews. However, in this case, I felt compelled to warn others! This movie is bad! It's probably one of only a dozen movies that I've marked as '1 (horrible)'. I know people say this all the time, but this was actually one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's easy to get to the top ten. <br /> <br /> When it comes to horror movies, I have very low standards. I'll ignore all kinds of shoddy movies for a good scare. But this movie is embarrassingly bad. It looks like someone bought a video camera at Sears and decided to make a movie with their friends. (The fact that each crew member's name appears on the cast list proves this theory, I think). This film has lower production standards than its average high school game. It really is a bit shocking to see a movie that looks so bad released on DVD. Special effects are a bit effective at times, but they are still amateurs at best. The best thing that can be said about the actors is that at least they remember not looking at the camera most of the time. I can not say for sure if they are struggling to remember their lines or invent them as they happen. Any attempt at humor is lame. This movie is such a colossal waste of time.
