Another on the long list of aspiring Conan who got tired of profiting from the success of the film, this Italian monstrosity is as bad as it came to be. You know it's a bad sign when your heroes fight invisible enemies because the movie was made so cheap that there was no money for proper special effects or to hire real people. I will not even bother getting into the plot because I challenge anyone to follow it and understand the plot. Maybe it's the TV cut I watched, but I can not imagine that any version is much better. Everything seems so random to me. Wicked sorcerers, cavemen, giant snakes, medieval castles, grenades and hang gliders ?? none of this fits. It's as if director Joe D'Amato had an epileptic seizure while creating Cave Dwellers (or any of the other names that the film traverses) and played everything he could think of on the screen, no matter how different it was or how it fits into the plot already intriguing of the film. The acting is bad enough. Miles O'Keeffe has never managed to get out of a wet paper bag and proves that, once again, in this movie. The rest of the cast is equally atrocious. Then there is the. . . Well, you got the idea. It's late, I'm tired and I've wasted enough time writing about this piece of junk. Believe me ?? Avoid cave dwellers (or whatever you want to call it) at all costs.
