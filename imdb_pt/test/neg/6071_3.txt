Terrible! <br /> <br /> Despite the good performance of Ed Harris, Diane Kruger, and the strong budget (the reason for the 3 stars), the film is by far the worst I've seen about a composer, and the worst issue of a masterpiece of music. I agree with some fictional things to update a biography, which otherwise could not be so "charming". This was done in AMADEUS with better results, but this B copy here is a flaw. Beethoven had a strong personality, but he was a wise artist. Here in this movie, however, he looks a lot more like Mike Tyson! I also wonder if, despite his deafness, he heard all the whispers in the last scenes (can it be a cochlear implant?). I'd rather hear the ninth on a CD with some good teacher. Today, most of them perform modern Wagnerian orchestras. By the way: I gave Amadeus 10/10!
