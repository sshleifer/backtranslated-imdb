I am a dance teacher and I was looking forward to some good dance routines in this movie. How sad to have been subjected to such a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I had big problems with Jennifer Beals and her character. I found Alex extremely repellent. Beals's face is so young, sweet and innocent, and this is very incongruous with Alex's very disturbing perversity, especially in that disgusting restaurant scene. She also has the tantrums of a child. It is very difficult to believe that Nick would continue to return to a teenager so grumpy after his frequent comments and delusions, especially after she opens the door of a moving car and throws a stiletto at him, preferring to go home - in the middle of road - with just one shoe !!! And after your idiot behavior after the night in the ballet? In fact, the whole novel was very disturbing - the thirty-something man going after a girl who looks 16 years old. <br /> <br /> As for the dance, I'm afraid that this style of the 80's is totally outdated. What the hell was that TV dance sequence at the club? Who should be dancing? I was not even sure if it was a woman or a man on the street! And even this famous final sequence is quite disappointing, especially given the context of a audition for a ballet company. The camera footage of your heel really spoils the effect because you can not see what you're doing. And what the hell was she doing when she passed each of the panels pointing at them? And as many other comments pointed out, she would NEVER enter a ballet company based on audition - maybe that's why they did not really say in the end whether she was successful or not, the closure is the fact that she overcame her fear in the end. Of the 'Flashdancers', I actually thought that the best sequel belonged to Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). You could see that she was a real dancer, and her acrobatics were very impressive. This is of course if you can go through your fancy and horrible makeup. <br /> <br /> There were two good bits in this movie - the dancers who stretch when Alex first signs up for a audition - they look so charming and elegant, and at least that helps to underline the difference between their dance career and what she aspires to. The other good scene was the dance break on the street. I also liked the ice skater's parents, they were funny. <br /> <br /> Some other random points - who was Hanna and how did Alex know her? What did an 18-year-old live alone in a converted deposit? How could she afford that lovely barrel and all the furniture? Where was his family? Was this scene in the 'nude' club really necessary? The person who wrote in their commentary that was something like a Disney movie needs their head examined. And anyway, what happened to the ice skater? <br /> <br /> Many people said that the film was bad but liked the message - do not lose hope, keep trying and your dreams will come true. Watch "The Little Mermaid" instead.
