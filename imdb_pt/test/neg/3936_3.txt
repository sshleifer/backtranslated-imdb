I happened to see this movie on a flight from Paris to Boston and it reminded me of the food on the plane: generic, tasteless and obscure. French cinema seems to have lost its foot today and this is a good example of how a heterogeneous script can waste brilliant actors. While some may think the script's "joke" is in line with the dictates of Euro-postmodernism, the whole project looks more like a post-mortem on the death of the golden years of Euro-cinema and truly fabulous talents - one of them is vaguely remembered here of Bunuel, but without the charm or wit.
