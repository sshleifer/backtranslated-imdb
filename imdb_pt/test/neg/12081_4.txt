"Hardbodies 2" is harmless, aimless and conspires less. I would add "brainless" to this list, but the trick of the movie within a movie, although it has not been done very well, helps you narrowly escape that label. The setting has shifted from the beaches of California to the Greek islands, and the only cast members who return from the first film are Sorrellas Pickard (the bearded guy) and Roberta Collins (who at one point falls into a mud pit, bringing back memories her classic catfight with Pam Grier in "The Big Doll House"). All other actors are new, but apparently Brad Zutaut must play the same character (Scotty) Grant Cramer did in "Hardbodies". This sequence does not have the energy and appeal of the first movie, nor does it even come close to combining it in the "hot" department. Of course Brenda Bakke and Fabiana Udenio are very beautiful, but Teal Roberts' team - Cindy Silver - Kristi Somers is unbeatable. "Hardbodies 2" is not the worst of its kind, but if you just want to see one of these movies, the original is the one to be obtained. (* 1/2)
