I just watched the first twenty minutes of this movie and personally I think this is the worst movie to do in the last few years. <br /> <br /> The plot was so bad it could have been possible that a 10 year old boy wrote. The acting was also sloppy with a cast virtually unknown and not only that the action sequences especially in the first half of the movie were so terrible that it was unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the producers succeeded. the budget for filming this movie, but the producer must be regretting it now. <br /> <br /> For anyone who might come across this movie in the near future, I advise you to avoid this joke of a movie.
