Usually I applaud a movie that tries to do something different or original in a genre. It is obvious that this movie is a kind of parody of ninja movies. And I really did my best to enjoy the movie. But I just could not. The jokes are not funny enough! (I've seen my share of Japanese movies and most of the time I like it and I understand the humor used in those movies.) The characters that are portrayed in this movie know that this is not a serious movie and show that everything is about fun. See the characters in parodies like "Hot Shots" or "Scary Movie". All they do on screen is done with a serious face and never leaves the character! And because of that, certain scenes become funny and hilarious. In "Red Shadow", the actors never achieve this. The ninja of the shadows should be very skillful and deadly. Unfortunately, the actors do not do their best to convince us of their talents. They do not do things with a serious face. The jokes would have worked better if they did! The bad choreography of the action scenes also undermined the viewing experience for me. I like humor in martial arts movies as long as the action is good. "Red Shadow" only fails in this department. So what's left to be appreciated. Well, the music (techno) was uplifting. It had to be how action is never exciting. And there are some short dramatic scenes that are good, but simple. The use of humor, lack of history and depth makes me think that this movie is for children. But I wonder if the kids really would like this movie. Waste of time!
