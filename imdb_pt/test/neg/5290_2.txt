Twenty years ago, Dr. Chopper (yes, he's driving a helicopter and cutting people) disappeared when police found corpses at his clinic. Since then, people have disappeared around Lake Tanoka (or something like that) and dead bodies / body parts have been found all over the place. Dr. Chopper needs body parts to stay alive and was getting them out of strangers, like a couple of lesbians and 5 girls from the fraternity in their initiation (you get the picture) traveling down Lake Tanoka. When a lot of teenagers decide to go camping, they are bound to collide with the doctor ..... Well, if you want to waste some time, this is the right choice. Acting ranges from very poor to mediocre, with girls stumbling and falling all the time for no apparent reason. Every chance to show the skin is taken, but without actually showing anything. The same goes for special effects that are quite pathetic, with each cut filmed at an angle so you can not see, but there are many blood-soaked body parts (probably to cover up how sad they actually look). The plot is rather defective and the dialogue is rather sad. The only time he laughed was when Dr. Chopper said, "Hello!" when trying to be scary. Do not watch this if you're not a hack'n'slash freak. Even so, I recommend that you observe something better.
