This is boring, inert and selfish. When the only thing that suddenly gives a cinematic life is a hanging, you know that the venture is ruined. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Truman Capote as a narcissistic caricature, full of teeth, self-indulgent, with cartoon voice and insects. Why it is so is never explained and we have little background information. The script focuses on Capote's writings on "Cold Blood" and his connection with the injured brothers who murdered a family of four. Harper Lee's acclaimed "To Kill A Mockingbird" writer accompanies Capote in his initial investigations into crime, and his presence immediately suggests a much more interesting subject for a biopic. Unfortunately, Lee is quickly sidelined in favor of endless scenes of Capote mourning his painful existence. Watching him is like watching Dr. Smith from 'Lost in Space' complain about his 'delicate backs' for anyone who wants to listen for two hours. The difference, however, is that Smith was fun to watch while Capote is not. The precious importance of the film kills him, as does director Bennett Miller's reluctance to add any kind of shading. Like the melancholy piano soundtrack, the film is a marvel of a note, without contrast, without emotional coloring and without intimate drama. If Capote really was so annoying, why make a movie about him and wait for the audience to watch? Although the supporting roles are well performed (Chris Cooper is their usual self), they serve a dramatic purpose because, after all, it's all about Capote (!) Director Bennett and screenwriter Dan Futterman can not emotionally engage the audience intended clearly overwhelmed by the cultural baggage of Capote's "legend". Her product is stillborn bait from the Oscars ... and it's further evidence that a big picture of the genre has more "truth" in it than a dozen or so shitty shit.
