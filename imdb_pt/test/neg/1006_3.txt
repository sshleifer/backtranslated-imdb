I would put Death Wish 3 in the same Cobra box and Stallone's Commando. The box I would sell for $ 2 on a garage sale with all the videos inside. The story is about the main character returning from the success of previous films to ruin everything with this load of junk. Why do manufacturers want to destroy the reputation of the last two movies with this cheap junk? The story is so stupid that it had to be an outrageous sequel. I mentioned Cobra earlier because it has the same humor, that a man can kill 20 or 30 gang members without a scratch. Both this film and Cobra were bent on showing the hero firing his guns at hip level and the enemy falling in large numbers. Cops spend hours at the shooting range, so why were they shot down by gang members firing aimlessly at their hips? This movie was so bad I thought for a minute that it was Death Wish 4.
