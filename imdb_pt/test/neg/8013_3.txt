Good!! the film has Catherine Zeta Jones in it. It's a Hallmark television movie. It's from a Thomas Hardy novel. There's Catherine Zeta Jones in it. She is by far the only one in the movie who acts better than in my high school drama class. Oh, yes, Clive Owen has that. I'm not British, which means almost as much as being a Thomas Hardy novel. Except he was in The Bourne Identity, and I liked that. This involves everything personal. That really was all there was. I'm becoming repetitive, but I like CZJ, so I held on to the end. The computer is telling me that I do not have 10 lines and I keep counting. I've always counted 11, but maybe I do not like my style, but that's my opinion of the movie too.
