Keys to the VIP is just one more horrible T.V shows you can and will see in this season. The show is terrible, with guys claiming to be real players competing against each other (there are two of them competing in each episode) in stupid games, where they try to get girls in a bar to talk to them, get girl numbers and so on against. . The judges are four other guys who also claim to be experts at picking up artists, but they also appear to be just great d-bags as well as competitors. The show is not funny and not interesting, it's annoying to see these guys desperately trying to convince us of what incredible players they are (talking even more about the four judges than about competitors). Nothing funny happened at the shows I watched and the shows are obviously handled. Do you really think they invited all these people to the club, got them to sign postings, and put them on tape while those guys did the same stupid games with them? It's not reality, it's just stupid, probably even recordings at the time of day. Someone else here wrote how they knew someone on the show and it was all fake, yeah, that's obvious, it's a fake show and even with actors, it's still not funny. One of the worst shows I've ever seen.
