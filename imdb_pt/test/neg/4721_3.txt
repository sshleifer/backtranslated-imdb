Crop buyers are unquestionably familiar with the term "video nasties." This was a notorious British list, containing all the films that could bring "damage" to society if viewed by irresponsible audiences (dramatization). For fans, this is an excellent list, as it contains cruelly disturbing and realistic films (Faces of Death, Cannibal Holocaust, Driller Killer) as well as outrageous and ultra-sick horror films (The Burning, Nightmare City, The Toolbox Murders ). With this in mind, it is quite unusual to see "Night of the Bloody Apes" listed among the other "nasties". Surely it is bloody, but the blood and violence are so poorly presented that I can not imagine anyone being offended by it. And the silly plot (about a desperate doctor transplanting a gorilla's heart into the chest of his dying son) is not exactly what you would call disturbingly real, either. All that remains is a rather entertaining horror film with a horrible performance and a worthless nonsense. The makeup effects of ape-man are laughable and there is no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere. Nice only if you're in a good mood, in other words. The few sequences that show detailed matches of lady-wrestling (which one of the leading actresses does for a living) are very cool.
