It's very possible that I simply did not give the film a fair enough shot, because it was so immediately unpleasant to me (something similar happened to the Triplets of Belleville), but I really should have picked it up when I put the film and my companion a student exchange student from Japan, immediately began to laugh at the movie, saying that it sounded like an idiot. Now, I do not agree that it's dumb, the animation is very simple, but clearly very skillful. It's like classic animation with added layers that add another element of realism to them, while remaining strictly in the realm of the surreal at the same time. <br /> <br /> But the subject is totally unpleasant to me. There's an interesting message about pettiness and greed, but it's wrapped in such a nasty package that it's hardly worth learning, especially since you already knew that. The sound effects while the man is devouring cherries and cherry lumps, for example, are indeed repulsive. <br /> <br /> There was a clever scene of animation as we continued plunging endlessly into the hole the man finds in his mouth. head when he pulls the bud from his scalp, but continues for so long that it seems to overshadow everything else. There are so many things in the same sequence that it's almost like the whole movie is about it. <br /> <br /> As I said about the Belleville Triplets, this would be great for a late-night TV. program as an adult swim, or his Japanese counterpart, but an Oscar nominated film? This gives me the impression that there is usually not a long list of animated short films for the Academy to choose.
