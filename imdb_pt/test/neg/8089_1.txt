Here's the spoiler: At the end of the movie, a small piece of you dies. You will spend the rest of your life searching in vain for that missing piece, but it is gone, gone. You'll wander the streets at night peeking out the windows of your neighbors as they sit down to dinner. Friends and family will try to identify when exactly you have become a walking dead. You will answer your questions and concerns with an empty stare and a few grunts about a runaway testicle. When the AMC inevitably makes the Tomcats the "movie of the month," a series of mysterious murders will happen in your town. You'll wake up the next morning curled up on the kitchen floor with a slight taste of brain in your mouth. Then you will crawl into the living room and into the sofa. You will look at the wall, get a little wet and then begin to laugh maniacally. Because once you're dead inside, Jake Busey in a thong is actually very funny.
