This movie is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. A woman "The EX" pretends to be a number of people to gain access to her ex-husband. Kill people for no reason in baths to achieve their goal. The women I think never went to college. She spends the whole film making idiot expressions, and seems like she's trying her best to avoid looking at the camera. Failing on most occasions. She befriends her ex-husband's wife and son, she does it to use them against her husband. In the beginning, when you watch this movie, you think the "Ex" wants to kill the ex-husband, maybe because he treated her badly. But, in fact, women are man-obsessed and want it back. The two used to enjoy raw entertainment (using whips, of course). My advice to the general public is not to buy this movie, do not rent this movie and do not watch like I did (at 1.15 in the morning on FOX)
