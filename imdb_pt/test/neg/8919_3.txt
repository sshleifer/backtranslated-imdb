Today You Die begins as honorable criminal Harlan Banks (producer Steven Seagal) is hired by sinister businessman Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe) to drive a security vehicle with $ 20,000,000 of money in the back of point 'A' a casino from Las Vegas to point 'B' it sounds simple right? Well, what Max forgot to tell Harlan that the money was stolen and that he just became the escape driver of an armed robbery. Vadio. Things get even worse for Harlan when local cops pick him up and put him in jail for a long time, but Harlan managed to hide the money before he got caught and with a good $ 20,000,000 in play, and Harbin does not have the bad guys they want it as government agents. Harlan joins Ice Kool (!) (Anthony 'Teach' Criss) in prison and both manage to escape, by which time Harlan goes looking for some revenge ... <br /> <br /> Photographed and directed by Don And FauntLeRoy, we have to say that the direct action films for the Eastern European video that Steven Seagal specialized in these days are not improving and that Today You Die is a good example. This is a terrible movie, simple as that really. The screenplay by producer Danny Lerner, Kevin Moore and Les Weldon gives Seagal a new type of character to get his acting skills non-existent, that of a criminal rather than an army clich√© / agent / cop / soldier / a man he usually plays. In fact, if you were being charitable, you could say that Today You Die is a hoax of Mel Gibson's excellent thriller Payback (1998), in which he also played a really nasty job with such a nice effect. While Payback was an excellent noir hard action movie, the action thriller Today You Die is not and becomes insignificant in comparison. Unfortunately here Seagal is terrible, he has no presence on the screen nor threat nor the public is never sure if he is a bad guy that we hate or not. For example, initially his character is set up as a modern-day Robin Hood while he steals from the rich drug dealers and drug addicts to give to the poor (as well as keep a profit for himself) which is just ridiculous in itself but then has Seagal turns and kills many people, which contradicts the sympathetic criminal with the moral that the film went so far to mount. The story is full of holes, for example, Agent Knowles is contacted by Harlan and is then scolded by his bent superior for meeting him and it turns out that he found out by ringing on his phone. In that case, why did not your boss use the information he had to get Harlan? The bickering story is the predictable bickering predictable about lots of money with surprise surprise that the government research agent is really a bad guy! Wow, I did not see this coming, I must say ... <br /> <br /> Director FauntLeRoy slows down at a snail pace and Today You Die looks like it will last forever, action scenes and Scenarios are also gravely lacking in entertainment value. The infrequent fight scenes are not great, most are filmed in the shadow, very quickly cut and edited or the camera played behind the Seagal character to try to disguise the fact that most of the stunt work here is twofold. Again Seagal looks fat and out of shape and wears long loose coats to try to hide it, it does not happen. There's a really cool car chase down the streets of Las Vegas at this beginning and I thought Today You Die might be fine, but it seems like the whole sequel was stolen from another action movie called Top of the World (1997) which is about a Las Vegas casino robbery, as well as footage from the movie Today You Die also edits scenes from Charlie Sheen's action film No Code of Conduct (1998), Jean-Claude Van Damme's action movie The Order (2001), and Wesley. Snipes action movie based on the prison Undisputed (2002) so how much of Today You Die is an original footage, no one knows. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is fine considering that it is edited from four separate films, just as filming itself is just competent and consistent enough. All footage from the US locations is obviously taken from the films already mentioned, with all the original filming filmed at low cost in Bulgaria. The rap style music that brood today you die is terrible by the way. The acting is bad and Seagal just grunts his lines as usual. Today You Die is a very bad movie made from other bad action movies, Seagal looks old and fat, the action scenes are average at best and most of the story is quite random and do not gather in the end that well into everything. One to avoid, unless you're a Seagal fan, if such an animal exists ...
