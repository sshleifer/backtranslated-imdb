I made a big mistake watching this movie. This is the lottery going to see movies, I think. After five minutes, you knew it was going to be a problem and I struggled a lot to stay in my place - the old guy "wasting two hours of his life." The fundamental problem is that, without even mentioning the whole line of "historical accuracy" of criticism, the script is painful, painful, bad. <br /> <br /> The first thirty minutes could have been distributed within an hour to give a plausible idea. real, plot development. Instead, it went from one non-dramatic "dramatic" event to the next. Making the girl cry at the beginning of the movie does not make sense because the public has no emotional attachment to anything at the moment. And all that way to the sunset through the tall grass field in the end, what the hell was that? <br /> <br /> Not even the great Ed Harris managed to save this one. You could almost feel his pain on some of the lines he had to utter. The most fabulously awful was, for no apparent reason, he looks at the girl as she copies her work into her apartment, she looks up, everything gets a bit foggy - an illumination (or I'm dreaming), and he says, with authority in your voice, <br /> <br /> "WASH ME". <br /> <br /> And she gets up and washes it with a sponge. "Wash me" WTF? That's hilarious. <br /> <br /> And then there was the song. The long and prolonged session in which Beethoven was only conducting and the 9th Symphony spilling from the surround sound in the cinema and the chorus waiting, waiting there, in silence, what seems an eternity. And then, finally, pitching in huge sound. It was frighteningly astounding and I dare say that, brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> So that's where the movie got two stars. The only part of the film in which Beethoven actually said exactly what he meant. <br /> <br /> And I believed him.
