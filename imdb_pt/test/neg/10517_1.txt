Everyone knows late-night movies are not Oscar nominees. Well. I mean, I'll admit I was a little dizzy and bored and figured I'd get to a skin-a-max. It is very bad when the information in the TV guide channel makes fun of the movie in the description. Even half star. To be fair, I sat and played the whole thing, because man was soooooooooo bad. I could not stop laughing. I mean the words that come out of these people's mouths and how they were trying to be serious. Most of the time I think the people on the screen were trying so hard not to laugh. In fact, I think in one scene they laughed. Anyway, the movie did not make sense. It was like that episode of the Sopranos with the fat fat guy. Only the Sopranos are great shows. But it was terrible, I mean, without nudity, just sex scenes from the '90s. You know the type who uses shadows and silhouettes instead of flesh. I gave him two things because this movie makes a good movie to drink. I mean, with all the cheese, it helps to get the wine out. If it's late at night, and everything on TV is this and that Tony Little guy and his exercise bike, then I suggest Tony Little.
