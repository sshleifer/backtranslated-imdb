I can not explain what a load of trash this movie is. How really I can not. It's just that bad. <br /> <br /> Plot = crap acting = budget crap = so low your laughable <br /> <br /> Jesus, it's like the only good thing in this movie is the fact that the main character was pretty hot. <br /> <br /> The only people I feel, who think this movie is good are those who participated in the film. I'm sure they are not the ones who financed because there was no money put into it. (HAHAHAHA for the bit where heads shave) <br /> <br /> This movie has already wasted so much of my life, so I will not waste any more time writing my review of it.
