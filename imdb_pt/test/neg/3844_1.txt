Obviously, the comments above the fawn on the film were made by someone who is in the team. I do not remember seeing a movie that is more insulting to the talented actors or the audience watching. In my 30 years watching movies, this is the only one I've ever left. Bad mood, bad jokes, bad jokes, bad editing, bad plot, etc. <br /> <br /> Note to the producer: It is never funny to hunt humans based on race. It's great that you've tried to be politically correct, incorporating all races, but you're still hunting humans based on race, and that's sick.
