This movie is from the 80's, but it looks like it was made in the Stone Age. The effects are very extravagant. My copy has Sandra Bullock on the cover, which is why I bought the film. She was in the movie for about 5 minutes of total screentime. She would probably deny all involvement. <br /> <br /> In short, there is no part of this movie that is worth to be seen, except to laugh at how bad it is. Rent this to see the worst movie ever made, bar none.
