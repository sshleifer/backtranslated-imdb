Every time I see this movie, the blood gushes out of my eyes. Yes, you read this correctly: I watched this miserable, fetid thing more than once. <br /> <br /> Caddyshack 2 went wrong for many reasons: Harold Ramis dialing in a script and giving up directing duties, Rodney Dangerfield (wisely) walked away from the project because he would not let him mess with the script, Bill Murray showing excellent judgment and not being part of it, and a puppet being pushed forward as the main character of a cast that deserved much better. <br /> <br /> I can not help but think of Dyan Cannon in this and wonder why she is perpetually laughing and smiling. The only conclusion I can draw is that it is indeed the face of pure evil. Stay with me for a moment. She must have been watching as the film merged and delighted in the countless agony that would inflict countless regrets on moviegoers who would have this movie inflicted on them. She may also have been extremely drunk. This is what I need to be now to wash away the dirty taste of this complete and utter failure of my mind. If I'm lucky, it will be wiped out forever. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie several times. I blame several of them in childhood and being a very boring and stupid boy who apparently had no aesthetic sensibility. Maybe the puppets are funnier when you're a kid. No, the Muppet show is funnier now ... I guess I was just bored. Caddyshack 2 is that rare kind of movie that is so extraordinarily disappointing on so many levels that you become convinced after the final credits that it could not have been as bad as all of that. That was it. This is. This will only get worse over time. <br /> <br /> My reasons for coming back to this movie, fortunately, are getting smaller and smaller. Randy Quaid is limited in his role as Jackie Mason's lawyer. His opening scene is not bad and brought me my only laugh. We see him a few more times, but he becomes as tired as the rest of the movie and descends with unfortunate speed, from fun to the barren land. Randy Quaid acquits himself well, and this film owes a lot to him, because if there was reason to watch this movie as something other than a torture tactic, it was. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's the trick of the movie. It has potentially captivating qualities that people watch, they are horrified at what they did to themselves, but then, because the choices were so small, they can only remember what really amused them. Years later, they watch him again and the cycle repeats itself. <br /> <br /> Jackie Mason has a lot of blame for this movie, but to be fair, I'm not sure he deserves it. He's really trying out there, but it's impossible not to notice that he spends the entire movie doing an imitation of Rodney Dangerfield. It's to whom the movie was written, but I'm not sure if it could save him. Ultimately, this fails miserably by dire direction, bad editing (must we count the continuity errors?) And a repetition of the same story with none of the ironic humor or heart that made the first film captivating. <br /> <br /> He dragged kicking and shouting up to three out of ten instead of two for the determination of Randy Quaid's bulldog. It's not even bad enough to laugh. I definitely have seen worse, but trust your memory - this is a dog. If you have never seen it, you have made excellent life choices and I welcome your excellent judgment.
