If there's one thing I've learned from George Romero's creepshow, it's that if you run into a mysterious old crate that someone has obviously gone to great lengths to hide, it just goes well: there's probably something nasty inside. Obviously, Professor Gordon Crowley, Robert Englund's character in Jack Brooks, Monster Slayer is not a fan of Romero because he opens the old wooden box he finds buried in his backyard only to find out? "surprise, surprise" an old demon who owns his body (initially causing him to eat and vomit rather). <br /> <br /> When the demon eventually erupts from Crowley's body during chemistry class and begins to turn the body students into infernal beasts, tearing flesh, it is up to plumber Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) to try to stop the fetid creatures , armed only with a piece of pipe and fueled by a lifelong hatred of all monstrous things! Jon Knautz's low-budget DVD packaging promises It's a fun ride, offering extravagant thrills and splashes of the kind one might expect from his 80's mid-life creature (toothed creatures, rubber monster suits, horrible blood and absolutely no CGI!) and in the last 15 minutes, that's exactly what viewers get: non-stop splattery effects; a demonic little thing resembling a finch, Jabba-style; It's a pity, then, that the rest of the movie's running time - a whopping 70 minutes or more - is spent most of the time with Jack as he continues his boring life, everyday business: plumbing, visiting his psychiatrist, going to chemistry class and disturbing his girlfriend. If you think you might like a movie that focuses primarily on dealing with childhood traumas and anger management, buying spare boiler valves from a hardware store and the chemical properties of sodium, then this is the movie for you; but if it's a huge dose of monsters you're looking for then I advise you to look elsewhere!
