The time I lost watching this movie, I demand it back! I felt bad afterwards, but not because it touched me in any way. It's pretentious, trying to make the public feel bad about the people involved, but I could not care less. The characters are soulless and stupid. You do not get an explanation for some of the scenes and leave no thought later to come up with your own explanation. Every student in the movie has problems, but since you do not feel for them, you do not believe in their problems. <br /> <br /> If I could write better in English, I would never stop. But I can not, so I'll stop now. <br /> <br /> Do not watch it.
