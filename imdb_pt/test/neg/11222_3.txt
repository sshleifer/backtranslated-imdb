This movie is an obvious copy of Underworld USA, starring Cliff Robertson. You owe it to yourself to invest a few hours and observe the original. I found this one to be disjointed and difficult to follow, with many scenes that did not make much sense. I am not opposed to violence in the movies, but all this seemed to be more than an excuse to take one person after another, many of whom were only marginally attached to the plot. With everyone being killed, throughout the movie I wondered why Frank did not just blow up Johnny's brain. He certainly could have and Johnny certainly did not act like someone who could be trusted. Another thing that bothers me is the sex scenes; Why do these people have sex with their clothes? Should that excite us? Certainly they did not think they had a chance to get a PG rating. Nothing in this movie seemed to play naturally. as if someone were watching people in real life, instead, it was done in a heavy and superficial way.
