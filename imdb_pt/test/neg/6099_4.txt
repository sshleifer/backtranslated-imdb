The Three Stooges are arguably the biggest comedy team in movie history. For that reason alone, they deserved a much better finish at Columbia than they did with this shorts. <br /> <br /> "Sappy Bullfighters" is not good. Surely, this is not Joe Besser's fault. I personally feel that some of their shorts are fun enough simply because of the departure of the usual fanfare of the Stooges they contain, and the fact that Larry is sometimes shown more. However, this short just will not do. And the fact that it is known to be the last short of them that has already been shown, well, this only adds to the general disgust. <br /> <br /> This movie just summarizes how short guys were in their last dying breaths during that time. and how little effort has been made to do them. This short is so sloppy. It's a simple overhaul of a short Curly, "What's the Matador?", Filmed years before. As if that fact was not bad enough, the studio actually showed footage of Moe and Larry from the original (which was filmed nearly 20 years earlier). Are not these things obvious? Risible or sad? You are the judge. <br /> <br /> Another part of this short that makes it miserable is the fact that it's basically a showcase of Joe Besser, with him showing that all he is (at least in this movie) is a Curly- want-to-go-completely-wrong! Moe and Larry have little to do in this short. As a Larry fan, I must also say that I feel a little shameful that Besser used the joke that Larry initially popularized in the short "Ants In The Pantry." To see Besser say "I can not see, I can not see!" and make Larry say the simple "Why do not you see?" while Besser starts playing "I closed my eyes," is wrong on all levels. <br /> <br /> The two brave soldiers who were trapped. for all these years, Howard and Fine, have so little to do in this short. There's almost nothing funny with them. The only thing that qualifies is Larry hiding under the bed of a jealous husband, trying to be "Pepe", his dog. <br /> <br /> No one can blame the dynamic duo. Larry and Moe give it their all. No matter how ridiculous things could be done (and I'm sure they had their opinions at this point in their careers), Howard and Fine never gave anything less than their best. Their efforts did not pale from 1934 to 1959. <br /> <br /> I often enjoy many shorts that some dismiss as horrible. I'm all for your more "experimental" shorts, unusual. At least those contain new ideas. However, this short, I think everyone can agree, is not only good. <br /> <br /> Thank God TV later discovered the boys after the department shorts closed. If they had been forced out this way, well, that would have been a gross injustice for all the years they invested in making the audience laugh.
