I laughed twice watching this movie and in case you were wondering, I was not having a bad day nor was I subjected to anything else that would have distorted my opinion while watching this cinematic gut movement. This movie is bad. I wanted to enjoy it and I just could not. With all this talent, you think that would be at least possible, right? Wrong. <br /> <br /> Let's play Sucked and Non't Suck! John Travolta- Very nice. Although obviously buried under much makeup, I found it enjoyable to watch. It was not shit. <br /> <br /> Uma Thurman - After Kill Bill 1 and 2, the girl deserves more than this horribly written character. The great moment of this character was to show someone how to operate a T-Mobile Sidekick. Successful. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn - The killer role of a white guy who thinks he's black goes to Vince "Money" Vaughn. Is this character model still considered funny? I love the guy, but I want to see him in something better than that. It looked like he was slumming. Sucking <br /> <br /> Cedric the Artist - This guy is good. He does a great monologue after being called a racial slur (you can probably guess what it is) that was probably the best part of the movie. He was funny and really raised the material he received only with his presence. It did not suck. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel - Sucked due to a phone call in performance. <br /> <br /> James Woods- sucked, but not his fault. Actually, yes, it was. He reminded me of his role at the Casino for some reason. I do not like the maniac James Woods, I like the slow burn James Woods. Victim of evil writing, perhaps? Andre 3000- Sucked, but he came down swinging. I think he has potential as long as he is not being hacked by his next photo. <br /> <br /> Christina Milian- She's absolutely beautiful and obviously talented, but this movie is not going to make her a star. . Not sucked, but you need a better vehicle for your talents that is not driven by a hack. The Rock-This should have been the role that catapulted him to the stardom of the film, but as directed by F. Gary Gray, ends up sadly mistreated. In this film, Rock projects this charisma that makes him so kind that I feel sorry for him. He tries hard and, despite not being successful, gets an A + out of effort. This guy is not afraid to be ashamed and go completely against the guy, throwing a gay bodyguard with eyes on stardom. I really want to see it grow. He has what it takes, as long as he's not being hacked. <br /> <br /> What drives me to what I feel was the weak link in this production. I could just go out and say that, right? F. Gary Gray's direction was as solid as a very bad diarrhea. Wow, that was bad. Who had the brilliant idea of ​​leaving this guy straight? The Negotiator was good, but what else on his resume convinced people that he was the man for the job? Between her direction and the atrocious writing, I am willing to take advantage of the two culprits to get a lead salad in the knees. Want to see John and A dance? I might be able to think of another movie with the two that I could recommend watching instead. It's not worth the ten dollars and fifty cents that cost me to enter the theater. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been good and was not even "just ok". <br /> <br /> CLASSIFICATION: * out of *****. <br /> <br /> PS Fergie's Black Eyed Peas is noteworthy. Sizzling!
