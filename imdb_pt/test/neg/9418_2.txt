When you see Barry Corbin in the cast of a movie, you can never be sure whether it will be a classic or garbage. Guess which category ONLY fits. Apparently derived from a popular science fiction novel, WEAPON, SOLO star Mario Van Peebles as a human-looking robot who decides to think for himself and is therefore target of elimination. He hides in a Mexican village, obviously to save money on rentals and extras. Paying in pesos is cheaper than paying in dollars, I suspect. William Sadler is together for the ride, as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy Van Peebles. Van Peebles manages to beat all of them easily, of course, while Corbin watches this by surprise. The film is a horrible imitation of THE TERMINATOR and CYBORG series, and apparently has little to do with its source material. It's horribly written and acted, and the big fight at the end is frankly comical. Van Peebles, a decent actor elsewhere, is a cry when he pretends to be a synthetic-coated robot. It seems like he's doing the robot dance most of the time.
