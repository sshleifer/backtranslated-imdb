Want a great recipe for failure? Take a leftist political plot, add some weak and completely underdeveloped characters, and then play in the worst sequences a movie has ever known. Let it cook for a week (the amount of time you probably spent doing this crap). <br /> <br /> The result is 'Steal This Movie', a cinematic experience that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotic places, never before conceived. . <br /> <br /> This movie exploded into pieces on my face the entire time of execution. Words can not convey how painful it was to watch. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit and make fun of. This is not the plane of outer space. This is a long, boring and sad waste of time. 'Steal This Movie' is the biggest waste of energy and talent I've ever seen. It depresses me when I realize that people * really * took time out of their lives to act in that foolishness, if you can call it "acting." But again, when you have a bad direction, a poor writing, EVERYTHING - "acting" is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This movie is like an immense and disgusting shit that you yearn to expel quickly. of existence, afraid that a friend or loved one could somehow see him. I really wish I could somehow destroy all copies of this film so as not to pollute the minds of aspiring filmmakers. Thank you, Robert Greenwald, for giving me new respect for all the other movies I've seen. You have shown me what is really horrible and why should I enjoy all those movies that are merely bad and / or annoying.
