Ok, here is a very short review: this movie exploded. I would like to have a review declaring this principle simple, but I must bore you with more bad words of the critical type, such as "horrible," "clich√©," and "unassailable." It's the kind of movie you watch when you're drunk or you're stuck on a deserted island with nothing to do. Here's the premise: the vice president is captured by a terrorist group in a play-off hockey game and only Van Damm can stop the madness. Really, really terrible, but again, I did not pay to see this for the first time around and only my dad felt the absence of thickness in his wallet after this movie. I hate the fact that he's a Republican and everything, but again, he spared me the horror of paying for that piece of junk. Ok, this is now enough space to be recognized as a review, so I offer goodbye.
