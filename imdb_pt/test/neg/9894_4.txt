The Texas Revolution from 1835 to 1836, including the earlier and later periods, is portrayed in this mediocre 3-hour television movie whose only redeeming value is to bring light and pay homage to Stephen F. Austin, the Swede. called "Father of Texas," whose life story had been overshadowed by that of the legendary Sam Houston. The rest of the film is simply the usual plot of "Santa Anna is a tyrant" and with a weak attempt to show the Mexican perspective with a fictional Hispanic character exhibiting stereotyped Latin machismo. Combined with short and low budget battle scenes such as Alamao and San Jacinto, this movie is recommended only to real history buffs who do not come from Mexico. To their credit, Mexican uniforms look accurate, and the romantic subplot (another love triangle) does not take up too much time on the screen. Overall, this film shows the violent secession movement of the Anglo-Saxon racial minority of Texas as a positive and just revolution against the Mexican tyranny personified by General Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna, the so-called "Napoleon of the West."
