Why is it that women of "virtual x-rated video games" can speak through their mouths, but does the virtual fight game champion Dante have to use a combination of telepathy and dramatic facial expressions? I feel like or they needed to cast someone who looked more like a villain (Michael Bermard's big brown eyes do not exactly cause fear in the hearts of the good ... anybody, except perhaps casting directors who consistently climb him like a villain or a hero 'bad boy'.) OR they just had to let him use his real voice (and move his mouth), and maybe give him a fantasy that would not make him stand out like a sore thumb as he walked down the street. (but of course this is the future and we must assume that bad taste in fashion is considered the norm).
