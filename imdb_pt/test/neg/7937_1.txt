Is it just me, or is this an AWFUL movie? I'm going with it's an AWFUL movie ... <br /> <br /> Knowing very well that it's a face movie (usually defined as full of car chases, accidents, shootings, explosions, etc.), I I still expect some small degree of credibility. If I can not somehow believe the premise, the movie will not work. So we came to the problem with the "Assault at the 13th Police Station". <br /> <br /> Nothing for the spoilers, I never report details of the plot. However, I will make an exception here because the plot is so insane. The bad guy is stuck in Precinct 13. The bad guy's friends want to finish him off. Surprise. Bandit friends are actually corrupt cops. A troublesome but heroic young cop saves the day while dating the girl. UGH. Yes, it's really so simple, and so stupid. "Assault on Precinct 13" takes place in Detroit. It's not a bad scenario for crime and corruption (I spent 3 months there at the end of 2004, so I know what I'm talking about). Even so, it is outrageously violent and offensive to the police and the citizens of Detroit. I spent a lot of time in downtown Detroit, but I can not imagine what the final chase was like in the jungle of downtown Detroit. I must have lost ... <br /> <br /> There is NO REFUND to watch bad movies. Save your money. There were many good movies in 2005 to waste even $ 3.00 on Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> FINAL CLASSIFICATION: 1 <br /> <br /> (Just because I've seen worse movies).
