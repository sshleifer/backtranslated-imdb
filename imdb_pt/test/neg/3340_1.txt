It's hard to express how bad this movie is. Even in the 1950s, when the intellectual quest for the meaning of life was fashionable and the beatnik rejection of physical comfort, clean clothes, haircuts, etc. was a common reaction to the presumptuous middle-class mores of US and Western Europe, this movie has been a stink. The plot is a mixture of several dei ex machina (if this is the correct Latin grammar); performance consists of expressionless glances broken by occasional hysterias (both male and female); the free view of Catherine Deneuve's (or someone else's) breasts is worthy of a Budweiser commercial; the rehearsed rehearsal of the cacaphonous orchestra in the abandoned building is that I'm sure it's full of meaning in the director's mind but for me it's just another stupid symbol played in this senseless movie - I'm complaining because my time was wasted watching this blow excuse for an art flic. The scenery is beautiful and the sex scene is hot - but under your clothes, this king has no substance.
