Although Charlie Chaplin did great short comedies at the end of 1910, others did not succeed. Examples such as His New Job and Shanghaied come to mind, and I also The Floorwalker in this category. Charlie is mistaken for a manager of a department store (and vice versa). This manager tries to steal cash from the cash register and make a run for it, and Charlie is just an honest customer but is guilty of some lost items stolen by other customers. <br /> <br /> There are not many laughs, except for the last two minutes with some great scenes on the escalator. For the rest, quite disappointing. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
