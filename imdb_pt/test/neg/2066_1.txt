I do not even know where to start ... <br /> <br /> It's not worth writing a comment, so I'll just quote what another user posted because I completely agree, but I give 1/10 instead of 2 / 10 "I do not know how to find the words to express how bad I thought this movie was." The initial principle was promising, but in all respects afterwards it was totally horrible. terrible development. There were a lot of points when I thought "no, no one would do something so stupid." The ending was incredibly anticlimactic.Featured - all the characters were either completely bland or grotesque caricatures.I keep trying to think of one that was not - possibly the mother, but that's it Music - intrusive, inadequate and usually terrible Direction - totally amateur Cinematography - I doubt they heard about it Camera angles / stability / zoom levels frequently I'm totally confused by how this movie scored so highly. It's the worst movie I've seen in movies for years, if not always. "
