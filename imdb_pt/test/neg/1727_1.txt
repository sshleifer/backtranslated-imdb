Not only did the effects and acting in this movie bite, but the story was terrible. <br /> <br /> A scientist discovers that a comet fragment will hit the moon ... world leaders ignore him ... he builds a shelter ... so everyone is upset that he is "playing God" . <br /> <br /> Like lame! He built the thing, why are everyone "authorized" to access? Totally lame story, do not waste your time!
