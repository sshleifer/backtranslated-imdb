From the first scene of the film - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering around reading a dawn field, invoking thus all the clich√©s that the cinema developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded female rebel character in the period drama - I knew I was doing something to make me want to kill myself. Joe Wright seemed not only not to have read the book, but to be under the regrettable misconception that what he was filming was not really Jane Austen's subtle and subtle comedy. in ways conducted through sparkling and delicate social interaction in eighteenth-century English halls, but a kind of U-rated Wuthering Heights. So we were treated to all the scenes between Elizabeth and Darcy occurring outside, for no apparent reason, in inappropriately steep scenarios, and often in torrential rain. Not to mention that Jane Austen, and in particular P & P, is not about passion, sexual tension or love. These are different strategies of negotiation of the stultification of the society of century XVIII. Which was completely ignored, so that the Bennets' house was a chaotic, noisy place where everyone screamed at once, ran from one place to another, left their underclothes in chairs, and the pigs wandered happily around the house; the balls of society turn into noisy country dances a step away from a Matrix Reloaded style dance orgy; and everyone says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for property. Jane Austen's genius lies in exploring the emptiness created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of overwhelming consideration. for convenience, and the tragic predicaments of their characters arise from misunderstandings and communication failures allowed by this wordless gap. Thus, both Jane Austen's brilliance and the factor that allows her plots - particularly in this movie - to work have been completely erased. Subtlety was generally nowhere in his film, sacrificed in favor of a strenuous drama that totally shaken the material and performances. <br /> <br /> I was obviously trying to be a serious movie. Humor - which is Pride & Prejudice, both Austen's methodology and his appeal - was almost wholly suppressed in favor of all this melodrama, and when it was allowed it was treated so awkwardly. Pride and Prejudice is a serious narrative that makes serious points, yes, but these serious points and more important themes are not only intertwined with humor, they are embedded in it. You can not miss Jane Austen's technique, leaving only the bones of the story, and wait for the themes to remain. Not even when you replace your techniques with your own heavy-handed mystic-numinous fauxbrow cinematography. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Bennett must be a woman, an adult, mature, sensitive and insightful. Keira Knightley played the first half of the film as an empty-headed schoolgirl, and the second half as an empty-headed schoolgirl who thinks she's a tragic heroine. Elizabeth's wit, her combative verbal exchanges, her essential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everyone's foolishness, including her own, her strength and composure, and her fantastic clear vision, were completely lost and replaced by ... what? Lots of laughter and looking into the distance? Instead of being able to hold her head when everything about her was missing theirs, she began to cry and scream with the slightest provocation - not genuinely furious, either; no, these were sullen petulants. And where the great strength of Austen's Elizabeth (at least in Austen's eyes) was her ability to maintain integrity and observance while remaining within the confines of society and sustaining impeachable property, Elizabeth de Knightley had no regard for the convention. Besides, she seemed to think that wandering barefoot in the mud in the version of the eighteenth-century jumpsuit made her no doubt so spirited and strong, and therefore nothing in the character as writing or performance had to sustain it. A surprisingly subtle and insipid performance. In what search for mildness and weakness, she was cleverly matched by Matthew Macfayden. Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet seemed weak, ineffective and permanently confused without the bad sense of humor and ironic detachment at the expense of the human relationships that make Mr. Bennet so fascinating and tragic. Her special connection with Lizzie, as the only two sensible people in a world of fools, was completely lost, even because they were both fools in a world of fools, and this completely deprived the film of emotional impact. Mr. Bingley was no more kind and well-intentioned to the point of folly, but was interpreted as a complete retard for cheap laughs, and the woman who was playing Jane was so uncontrollably inconsistent that she might not have tried to do anything with it. the character at all. The script varied wildly between verbatim pieces of Jane Austen - delivered with remarkable clumsiness - and totally contemporary language that would not be out of place in a modern romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Just get the BBC's adaptation on DVD and save yourself the heartache.
