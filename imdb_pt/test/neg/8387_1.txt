I had the misfortune to see this movie recently and have to go through it. A friend bought it for Â£ 1 and insisted that we watch how good it looked in the history of the back cover. <br /> <br /> 10 minutes after the movie it became clear that the actors were amateurs and this was extremely low budget effort. <br /> <br /> The scenes were very misinterpreted, the script was stupid and the story contained many scenes that seemed unnecessarily long, just so that the film had a reasonable length. For example, when the main character rents a warehouse, the film spends an absurd amount of time on this scene with a meaningless dialogue that serves no real purpose or need for the plot. <br /> <br /> The lead actor is allegedly getting revenge on a woman who sleeps with faces to give them HIV, he never thinks about taking the test. Instead, he turns into a crazed killer who decides to torture her before killing her and seeing her in pieces. <br /> <br /> If that sounds good and you're thinking that it's going to take a lot of blood, think again. This movie does not have really bloody sequences and is pretty tame for this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> It does not scare, it does not make you think, it does not offer quick fun. Can, however, put you to sleep, is sure to bore you to tears, please save the despair and follow my course. <br /> <br /> AVOID THIS MOVIE 1/2 of 10 (this does not even deserve 1) <br /> <br /> The film lasted 78 minutes but seemed to have been 2 and a half hours.
