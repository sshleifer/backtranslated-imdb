Second Rock's second venture to science fiction after Seconds is Embryo, a film that combines elements of the Bride of Frankenstein and Pygmalion into a rather strange movie about the lack of a better word, a test-tube baby that becomes Barbara Carrera . Hudson is a scientist experimenting in organic development and has the chance to first try out his own Doberman pincher when he is accidentally hit by his car. <br /> <br /> Some pituitary secretions of the bitch are given to a premature baby and grow remarkably in an adult. Exalted with his success, Hudson catches a fetus from an accident victim and gives him some of the same things. <br /> <br /> What he gets is Barbara Carrera. And it develops physically and intellectually at a prodigious pace. What she does not do is develop emotionally. Still Hudson passes her as her new research assistant to friends and family, such as sister-in-law Diane Ladd, son John Elerick and daughter-in-law Anne Schedeen. <br /> <br /> The embryo does not explore some of the real problems of this kind of science, but explores them. Special effects, as they are, are second-rate. Hudson seems to have lost interest in the project in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> Now what really would have been interesting is if he had had a boy and grew up to be a new harlequin hero. Now, this would have been something that Rock Hudson could have buried his teeth.
