I saw this movie yesterday on TV. I had just read the book the movie was supposed to be based on. In opening credits he said: "This is a free adaptation of the novel by Eça de Queirós." I should have turned off my TV at that moment. <br /> <br /> Vera Sacramento's idea of ​​"free adaptation" is transforming a story about the Church's influence on the people and the hypocrisy of the people who claim morality in the late nineteenth century. in a story about sex. In fact, the only thing she adopted from the novel was that part of sex, which was only slightly referred to in the novel by Eça de Queirós. And, of course, the names of some characters. <br /> <br /> From the characters, in the novel, Amelia and John Eduardo were victims of the influence of the church. Amelia was seduced by Father Amaro and all the time he was controlled by him. Joao Eduardo, his fiancé, was excommunicated by the priests, because he dared to criticize them. In this film, Amelia seduces everyone she knows and Father Amaro is just another victim. João Eduardo is a drug dealer and illegal guns. <br /> <br /> Vera Sacramento transformed a novel that criticized moral attire of an era and turned it into just another movie with a lot of sex (bad). Even worse, his story was completely empty of ideas. Two hours wasted! Eça de Queirós certainly did not deserve this.
