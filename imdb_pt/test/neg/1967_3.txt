Yes, in this movie you are treated with several small snowmen in attack apparently in a very hot weather, so yes, this movie definitely should not be taken seriously. In fact, it is a much worse film than the original, since, at least with this film, the whole production seemed to cost more than a few swaps and a video camera to make. It has its funny moments but really throwing away the low price of your movie and making it your intended laughs is kind of a weak movie making if you ask me. You can not come up with a good story, its effects are going to be really bad, hey let's just make the movie look the worst possible with a horrible lining and we have our movie. The first one at least had a somewhat credible story as the snowman on the one who attacked during the winter and not the equivalent of a feature. It also had better effects too, this is just a step or two ahead of "Hobgoblins" with regard to monsters and you really want to be more than a step up two over a group of hand puppets. Still, it makes up for it all with a super ending that portrays a large sea ship being pulled off by the powerful frost. Actually, I'm just joking, but actually it was the funniest part of the movie.
