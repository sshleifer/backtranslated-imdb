Live-action version of Dragonball via Taiwan. <br /> <br /> The Lord of Evil comes to Earth to take the seven magic balls of the dragon ... er pearls that, when gathered, will make a dragon appear and grant its desire. Lots of action and bad comedy happen. <br /> <br /> What can I say that "the best way to watch this movie is with lots of drunken but witty friends" is not it? I do not know. This is very bad, but funny in the way bad movies can be. Come on, this is one of the few martial arts movies I've ever seen, where you actually see the strings. It's a live action drawing and not so far away from what I've seen of the program that makes me fear for the American version of the big budget you're filming now. <br /> <br /> If you have drunken friends and you feel like picking a movie, watch this movie. If you will see this sober (like me) avoid it.
