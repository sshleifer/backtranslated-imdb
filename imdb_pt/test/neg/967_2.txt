For all intents and purposes, Showtime was the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Why? Because having Deniro in the cast adds immediate credibility and makes you want to watch the movie. I had also made the mistake of watching 48 Hours and Beverly Hills Cop recently before seeing Showtime and for some strange reason I thought Eddie Murphy was still funny. Well, he's not. In fact, it almost looks like he has been neutered. While watching this film, I was surprised that Deniro decided that this was a script good enough to lend his name as well. No chemistry between him and Murphy. Horrible writing, horrible jokes, a movie that you think is good can not get much worse than that. Not long after sitting through the bastard who was Showtime I watched National Security starring Martin Lawrence. The movie had its funny parts, but it was not so good. But still it was 20 times better than Showtime. Please, if you are a fan of Deniro DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!
