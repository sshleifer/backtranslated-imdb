Simply put, misrepresented and directed in an unimaginative way, Flight to Mars is still fun, despite what it has against. A flight to Mars is planned with five people (three older gentlemen, Cameron Mitchell as a journalist, and a female scientist / obvious love interest) "manning" the ship. The spacecraft arrives there and discovers that very human Martians live there and have the technological advances that would make the Earth blush, but not everything is rosy in the underground cities of the Martians (here shown as some caves and some rooms) The Martians are a dying planet and a faction wants the Terrans to repair the ship only to take it out at the last moment and then mobilize for an attack on Earth and another faction wants to talk about peace and see if they can not persuade the Earth to give them living space. The special effects here are pretty lame even for the 1950s science fiction standards complete with slow rocket, pastel / neon alien costume where women wear shorts that would leave lots of blush (except men, of course), and little else offered . Cameron Mitchell is the journalist and is affable, if nothing else. ite Chapman is beautiful in very short shorts, but adds little range of performance. The rest of the cast is filled with some science fiction veterans like Arthur Franz and Morris Ankrum doing useful jobs. This is not a science fiction film debut in the Golden Age by any standard, but it is very watchable and passes quickly at a fast pace.
