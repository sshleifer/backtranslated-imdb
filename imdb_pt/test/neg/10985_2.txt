A few years ago I saw The Scent of Green Papayas from the same director. My feelings about the two films are actually the same: beautifully filmed, but terribly slow and boring. I saw this movie on a preview, and I left after half an hour. I could not take it anymore. How can someone make an interesting movie about people who are constantly talking to each other how happy they are and how perfect their lives are ...? I had a fantasy about a forgotten American G.I, still wandering through the Vietnamese jungle, who did not know the war was over. As he would suddenly appear in the movie, he would start emptying his M16 into the characters in the movie. Their red blood would make a nice contrast to all the green plants in the movie ........... So I was not too impressed with this movie! Time to go!
