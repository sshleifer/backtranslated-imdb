A horrible movie, horrible and horrible. I saw the original as a child and it gave me nightmares in my teens. When I discovered that a remake was on the way, I groaned. WHY WHY remake a good movie? Well, we can thank the Castle of Darkness for causing one more classic horror movie. This time, they replaced a rather interesting story by gore, slower than the slow pace and characters inspired by yawning. Someone said earlier that she was surprised that Paris Hilton could act. Did you watch the movie? She plays a little straight slut. Sounds like typecasting to me. Half the people in the audience actually had fun when she died! That tells you why people are watching this movie. If that's your only reason, then find a better one, because as a black hole this thing will suck more of your life than you want. If I had been alone, I would have left 10 minutes in the annoying exposure. This thing is like an idiot guide to making movies: in the southern southern race, stupid but attractive tracks, full knives, a lot of menacing trucks, I could go on. After watching this movie, I started to really enjoy the Jeepers Creepers, and I thought the movie sucked. Save yourself and avoid this crapfest at all costs.
