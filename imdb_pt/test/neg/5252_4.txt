The future of fantasy never seemed so dark! Christopher Lambert begins to fight the evil demon Grendel in this dark fantasy of despicable appearance. "Epos," I said? Er ... there's only one location, so you can not really call it an epic adventure, can you? The location is a medieval / futuristic castle 5 inches high, so how did they manage to cram in all the actors? Oh, I understand, those where special effects. A thumbnail. You fool me. <br /> <br /> Here are some reasons why you may or may NOT want to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> - Lambert begins to do his tricks of swinging his sword again, as he did in Highlander. <br /> <br /> - The sets and costumes are incredibly cool (if you are 12 years old). <br /> <br /> - Rhona Mitra has a voluptuous pair of her likes to show off throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> - Christopher Lambert has white hair ... <br /> <br /> - Every time they start to fight, the techno soundtrack delirious and exaggerated continues. So why do these medieval slayers struggle while they should be dancing? <br /> <br /> - They do not have electricity in this castle, but they have installed speakers that seem to work well. So, where is the amplifier? I think they borrowed from techno-dj who delivered the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> - See the climax at the end that features a scandalous CGI demonic creature sticking out of any Playstation 2 survival and horror game. <br /> <br /> If all this interests you, go watch (at your own risk), but do not tell anyone I told you to. I strongly suspect that Pinhead is visiting the set while filming, because this movie has no soul. Anyway, if you want to see the beautiful Rohna Mitra really show a little fur, then look at the HOLLOW MAN by Paul Verhoeven.
