Having sat and watched this movie, I can only imagine the reasons for creating the film. This was undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen and had no redeeming features. <br /> <br /> If it was to be funny, then it could have been a very weak comedy, but as an action thriller it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Slow, no plot, no real action, nothing approaching a good dialogue and I have no idea about the characters. What else can I say. Avoid.
