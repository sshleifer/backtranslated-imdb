This is a comedy / romance film directed by Andy Tennant, starring Will Smith, Eva Mendes and Kevin James. <br /> <br /> This is a professional medical dating -Will Smith - known as 'Hitch', which helps men to The earth dates with the women in which it is interested. He is currently helping Albert, a clumsy and clumsy man, obsessed by a very powerful, famous and wealthy woman named Allegra. At the same time, Hitch became interested in a gossip columnist, Sara, Eva Mendes, who was assigned to write about Allegra. When Sara's best friend has a loving disillusionment with a man Sara thinks is a client of Hitch, she plotts a revenge against Hitch and the misunderstanding drives the two couples into a conflicted situation. This film is not one that men must see how He has many bruises and both subtle and blatant hatred of males. There are also double standards that you would have to be blind not to detect. Hitch and Sara are both very protected around the opposite sex, Hitch still likes women despite their burns in the past and is teaching men to make them happy. But of course Sara, is a sexist fanatic who makes frequent sexist comments, in the line of "men want to have sex with anything that walks." She is obsessed with herself and knows that she looks like a goddess and knows there are no "real men" out there. What bothered me most was the "bad" guy who wanted a quick mess with Sara's best friend, who is the classic example of a defenseless "victim" and even after being physically rejected by Hitch, gets hit in the pills by Sara. After that, she says, "Now I'm satisfied." Add to this the "still-oppressed" vibrations you receive from Allegra, not being allowed to spend your own money after asking permission from a men's table. Despite all the assumptions and generalizations of the garbage - do women always know when you're not being straight with them? This movie has the correct point that in America love simply does not exist. There are some funny parts in this movie, such as Albert and his dancing habits, but this movie generally only outweighs the horrible movie Honey for a marginal amount.
