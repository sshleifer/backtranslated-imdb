After watching this movie I felt sick to my stomach and if I had watched another minute I would have to run to the bathroom and vomit until dawn. A sick movie that was not funny and was not worth the money, any money at all. If anyone wants to see this movie, no! Your children will never forgive you and claim illness for a week. So if you value your child's education and want to stimulate your child's mind, please do not watch this movie. I beg you, NO!
