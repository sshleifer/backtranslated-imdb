It may be, although there are still two or three that I have lost. This film builds an interesting nighttime night scene, remembering so many fog scenes from the Sherlock Holmes films, and fills it with sinister, Kafka-like characters. In her midst, the film leaves Mia Farrow, who seems to be still playing Hannah, and Woody Allen, who seems to be reprizing her role in the movie Play It Again Sam. Should we laugh at his stuttering and his handshake? I suppose so, if the rest of the movie was clearly a comedy, but it's not. At least I do not think it is.
