To be perfectly frank, the popularity of this show saddens me. Inuyasha certainly is not terrible - there are some good moments, an occasional flash of intelligent humor and, unlike so many animes, dignity. However, it is absolutely missing the essential elements of a worthwhile story. From the outset, his premise predicts it as stereotyped. The main plot revolves around collecting pieces from a broken jewel before they can be possessed by evil, and is, as might be suspected, an epic fantasy case entirely generic. The story follows a familiar pattern of fighting various enemies for pieces of jewelry and is therefore quite predictable, with no complexity and easy to lose interest. But, as many animes have shown, a bad premise can be rescued from the depths. realistic characters. Unfortunately, no one rescues Inuyasha's story. Kagome, the main character, is the stereotypical anime heroine (and reminiscent of Akane, the main character in the previous work of the original comic author Ranma 1/2); she is kind to other women, but she treats many men, especially her love interest, with unjust, blatant and unjustifiable brutality. Inuyasha is a tough-out-but-inside-out type, and Miroku is the pitiful character of the "pervert." <br /> <br /> The flaws continue with what happens this plot and these characters - that is, nothing. Despite constant action, the story does not progress. Despite the regular romantic moments, nor the main relationship. Despite enough time, the characters never change. And to add a cherry to the mediocrity sundae, all that stagnation is stretched in about 150 episodes. <br /> <br /> My final criticism of this anime is animation. Although certainly not ugly, it exhibits an almost disrespectful laziness on the part of the creators. The animators seem to rejoice in long scenes of Inuyasha jumping in the air with the whistling wind in which they have little to do other than moving a background. <br /> <br /> In short, with all the beautiful animations of the world in With the tips of the fingers attached to the keyboard, there is absolutely no reason to watch Inuyasha.
