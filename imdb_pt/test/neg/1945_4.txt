NOTICE!! This review may contain spoilers. The back of the box is misleading. It tells all this crap about kids telling ghost stories, which they do, but that implies that everyone will be killed by some killer in the woods. This doesn `t happen. The stories they tell are a bit interesting, specifically the one with the dog and all the licks, but most of them are rather boring, monsters in the woods, some girl changes, and the main, the whole movie.
