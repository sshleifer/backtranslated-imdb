This is not exactly what I would call Mad Max movie, after seeing Road Warrior and experiencing the excellence of this movie, I felt a bit disappointed after seeing this. Supposedly started as a kind of children in the movie desert, and was merged with the franchise Mad Max (bad idea). The cast was not exactly the best, I mean, come Tina Turner? One of the main problems of this film is that there are no good villains. No Wez, not Humungus, not even a decent Toecutter! Nothing really happens, if you plan on watching this sub-par action movie (can it even be called that?), Be sure to see Mad Max 2 or Mad Max, or better yet, both. Another problem with this movie is that there are many people, even the battle sequence of the Thunderdome is monotonous, Max does not even kill anyone! The music is bad, the characters are bad (not in a good way) and after seeing this movie, it left a very bad taste in my mouth.
