This movie is not as good as I thought it would be. There is no story, no character, and some dialogue would have been good. The gore effects are good and it gets pretty bloody at times, but nothing over the top. It starts with an autopsy on a man and when that's about the scene with the girl starts. The music is a classic score and fits nicely into the movie. They should have made a 90 minute version where they might have had some time for character development so we could feel sorry for the person at the autopsy table. And some more information about funerals would have made this movie far more frightening than it is. Do not expect a horror movie, but a good, bloody special effects roll.
