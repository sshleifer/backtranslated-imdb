In terms of historical accuracy, this is the worst Roman movie I have ever seen. The list not only of mistakes, but of plot ideas that are impossible would be longer than the three-hour film, but just to give you an idea ... <br /> <br /> Julius Caesar and Augustus are presented as liberal Democrats, taking the side of the "people" against "the nobles." This is clearly absurd. The Caesars were as noble as you could get. His interest was to consolidate power and stabilize a country that had been destroyed by 150 years of civil war. There were reformers, notably the Gracchi brothers, who lived about 100 years earlier, and to some extent defended the rights of ordinary citizens. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that are absolutely ridiculous if you know of something. over the period. "Cleopatra" with Richard Burton will give you a much better idea of ​​how the events unfolded, though it's fantastic. <br /> <br /> Historical accuracy is one thing. Acting and dialogue are something else, and here the film is dangerously close to being a poor production in high school. I started laughing several times, especially when Julia, the daughter of Augustus, finds a lover. They cling passionately as she breathes, "My father ..." "Ah, your father, your father ... your father would disapprove." Peter O'Toole is at his worst, forced to make his way through some very pompous and silly lines. The actor who plays Augustus as a young man is so foggy - and the character is written as such - it is impossible to imagine him as the cunning, cunning Machiavellian politician who created the Roman Empire. Here he is just a whiner who needs to know what to do most of the time. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Rampling manages to emerge from a role subscribed as Livia, the wife of Augustus, with dignity. If she had been given a fuller role, she could have rescued this production from the absurd. <br /> <br /> There are some cool photos and battle images, aided by a lot of CGI. Strangely, this was done for British TV (and it seems to be a British-Italian co-production), but is labeled with an "R" rating. <br /> <br /> The picture on the DVD is great and the Dolby Digital soundtrack is very good, although you only notice it during the few action sequences, as the film is mostly talking about. Almost any Roman movie, even "Cleopatra" or "The Fall of the Roman Empire," has more historicity --- not to mention compelling drama --- than this bizarre Classics Illustrated, Jr. adaptation. This gives new meaning to the much abused phrase, "Based on a true story." In that case, they could have said "suggested by actual events."
