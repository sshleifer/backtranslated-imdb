Somehow, I actually thought I would enjoy this movie because I love mountaineering photos and a great mystery in the plot. I must say that the photography was fantastic and there were some scary scenes that caught my eye. I thought that Nicole Eggert, (Diana Pennington), "Thank you, good night," 01 had a very convincing role as a young woman who had a tragic loss in her life and meets with some characters who want her to guide them. on top of the mountain. Marc Singer, "Angel Blade", '02, played a very unconvincing guy and acted in many scenes with a bad temper that looked comical. This movie was a big disappointment and not worth watching, unless there is nothing on the TV to enjoy !!
