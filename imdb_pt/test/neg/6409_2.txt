What the hell was that? I admit there have been some scenes that caught my attention, like the bullshit of 23 years, in which the protagonist sees or calculates the number 23 everywhere he goes, but this was basically the movie in a nutshell? By crying out loud, this was supposed to be a thriller and labeled as a psychological thriller, I would have expected it to have at least some catastrophic effect on my mind, but instead, what have we got? We just had something as bad as an animal control guy finding himself in the midst of a middle-aged crisis and his journey to redemption. Kind of like an old movie if you ask me. I probably should have just rent Wild Hogs, that would not have made a difference. I mean, whoever we're kidding, they should have made someone else the killer of that girl. Justapondo Sparrow with the protagonist of the book The Number 23, they were giving the movie to the viewers, implying that he was the killer all the time. How would that have shaken our heads? Shame on all the voters who chose to show some generosity towards this miserable job that you call the movie and praise for most of the critics who agreed with my reaction.
