I thought the movie was fine. I do not think it was great. It was a bit too slow for my liking. A lot of drama, but not much action until near the end of the movie. This movie was basically dramatic. movie, with the reward, if you can call it that, not till the end. for me, the scenes of the dam bursting and the water flooding the city, were fine, but very brief. The movie itself is fine, the acting is decent, but that has not happened to me in the long run. I guess it had something to do with the fact that there was very little suspense or tension throughout the movie. at least that's what I think. The other factor is that I had just watched '10 .5 'and its sequel '10 .5: Apocalypse'. These are big budget events movies, which, in my opinion, are a very difficult to follow, in terms of special effects and scenes of destruction. as a result, I have to evaluate Killer Flood: the day the curse broke on 4/10
