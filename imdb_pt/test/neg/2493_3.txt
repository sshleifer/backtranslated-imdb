I watched a few years ago on television when I was sick (I do not know, I tend to be more compliant with my TV when I'm sick; a lot of effort to use the remote, I think). <BR> As I recall, every aspect of the film - cast, acting, writing, directing, etc. - were poorly advised at best. I could have forgiven the historical inaccuracies if this movie had created a sense of what it was like to work in Trinity; but this did not happen. There were attempts to humanize the scientists, but they were insufficient and never transcended the caricature. <br /> <br /> I did not know much about the people involved in the Manhattan Project at the time, but the portraits in the film were so caricatured that I became interested in learning about the real personalities. And I did. So I guess this horrible movie did a small amount of well, after all. <br /> <br /> This is not an in-depth review, but the FMLB does not deserve or require one. You can have fun if you are a fan of bad movies.
