On the verge of being unbearable. Somehow I got a little interested, but was it because I really wanted to know what the "secret" (which, I would say, is quite obvious) or why I expected Scarlett Johansson to wear a sexier outfit? This movie is poor and what's more, it's a disgrace to all the lonely, alcoholic Southern literature teachers out there. Travolta wants his Oscar so much that he is willing to cry drunk in the bathroom after urinating blood. Sorry, friend. . You were most believable is "Staying Alive". Not everyone can pull a Peter Fonda in "Ulee's Gold". If you want the brave anti-hero Oscar, you have to really act. . Do not just pout on the screen. Stop this director before he / she (name is vague about gender) direct again!
