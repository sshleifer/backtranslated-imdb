Terribly disappointed with CITY OF MEN after being led by the CITY OF GOD. Lost is the thrilling and unpredictable plot, and instead, instead, is predictable soft with the obvious attempts at manipulation of the audience by a pretentious production and distribution team. This story ended up feeling like a mellow novel rather than a gritty indie feature, which is what it should have been. This is what happens when distributors try to reach out to a wider audience (ridiculous shots taken from the Rio's seashore, etc.) at the expense of exciting story and characters. I really could not care what happened to any of the characters in this movie - they were all so two-dimensional. In short, sad waste of potential that should have been a great success following the exceptionally inspired CITY OF GOD. Boo!
