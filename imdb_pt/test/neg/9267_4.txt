With a cheap-pound shop having just opened, I thought it was worth looking to see if it was cheap DVDs that looked good. And while the cover verse sounded like a Jeepers Creepers movie, it's actually an anthology movie! and I thought one or two of the stories would feel very familiar. He is still a fun light horror / comedy. The plots: Story one: The classic. <br /> <br /> A young couple feels it is time to try to prove their financial life by taking a $ 1,500 car. But when the guy is going to get a car, a car starts talking to him.

Look at the film: The first thing I have to mention is the rating for the movie in England where it was given a note of eighteen even though it has no nudity, swearing or blood The other thing Strange about all the stories is that they all have happy endings where the goodies win! And while the first story is very close to the Stephen King classic, Christine, the second story is easily the highlight of the film. , with director Tom Parkinson making the madness of the story look like an episode of the low-budget Muppets. <br /> <br /> Final view of the movie <br /> <br /> Although it has a bit of 'redo; Feel it enough to make it a good horror comedy.
