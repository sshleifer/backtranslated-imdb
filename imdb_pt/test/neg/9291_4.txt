Barricade meets Alice Faye with no music as a refugee trying to escape from China without a passport. She's in a lot of trouble, I will not tell you exactly what, and even American extraterritoriality will not help her. <br /> <br /> I mention this because one of the complaints that the Chinese including the thugs who attack The American mission in this story located in the hinterland of China was that particular institution in which American citizens who committed crimes were tried by courts established by our consulates. We were far from being the only country to do this however. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the story begins with her on a train to Shanghai trying to use a Russian accent. The accent Warner Baxter intrigue, which is quite plastered. <br /> <br /> Bandits, however, interrupt the journey and the two seek refuge at the American consulate chaired by Charles Winninger. He is the best of the movie and I just wanted to get a better story because I liked his character. He is a widower and a proud member of the consular service, named in 1900 by William McKinley. He asked for a transfer ten years later and it was the last time he was heard. As Assistant Secretary of State Jonathan Hale appropriately put it, he is the real forgotten man. <br /> <br /> Baxter does everything right in a role that someone like Clark Gable would have done during his sleep at MGM. The heroes would have been more natural to Gable than to Baxter, since the mission is barricaded and defended against the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Alice Faye had a number to sing. Because Alice's music has been cut, God and Zanuck only know. One thing I'm still trying to figure out is when the mission inhabitants take the final hideout in the basement with a trapdoor, only who was left upstairs to pull the rug over the basement door? <br /> <br /> The Barricade had the potential to be much better than it was. But the sloppy issue and loss of confidence in the project caused 20th Century Fox to unveil a project to be completed. Watching Barricade is like eating an undercooked meal.
