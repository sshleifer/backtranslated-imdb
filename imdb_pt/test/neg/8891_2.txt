THE QUICKIE (1 of 5 stars) Very poor film ... an old story about a high-ranking gangster who wants to leave, passing his empire to his inept son. Of course, it will not be easy for someone in that line or job to just give up ... so a contract is put into your life. After giving a big party, an exterminator (Jennifer Jason Leigh, who I think will never act on anything other than TV movies or low cost direct trash with video) is called to the scene. Our "hero" makes a pass for her ... offering her a lot of money for a "quickie" ... she rejects her offer, even if she needs the money ... but ends up staying the night anyway ... even after being brutally harassed by the overzealous son who thinks she was sent to kill his father. Ugh The story goes on and on ... you can see every "twist" and "upset" coming a mile away. The strange soundtrack of a group called "The Tiger Lillies" is going to drive most people crazy ... but I thought there was some kind of cool track in the end. Or maybe I was just excited because I could tell the movie was almost over? Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer ... what the hell happened to you?
