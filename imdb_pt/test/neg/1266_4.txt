I was very willing to give Rendition the benefit of the doubt when it came to all the negative press I read about it. Even about three-quarters of the way, I still found it confusing and somewhat incoherent, but otherwise a solid tale came to its conclusion. And then the bottom fell. Not necessarily wanting to spoil the movie for anyone, but the conclusion turns everything you held to be true about what and when things are going on in your head - for no particular reason other than perhaps telling the world, yes, I am cool, and I know. I love a good turnaround, I love a good time ah-ha, but only when it is relevant to the story in question. The complete lack of guidance on the part of filmmakers has no purpose in the overall story, the timelines did not have to be parallel and did not need to be separated for a week. All that the revelation did was destroy whatever merit I was about to give to director Gavin Hood and screenwriter Kelley Sane, which may be a good thing, because looking back, it was not as solid a film as I initially blindly went credit for. It is an admirable thing to try to bring the term surrender to the consciousness of the cinematographic public, but it needed a story that deepened the connotations and politics involved, rather than brilliance. about these issues to a tale of a woman in distress over her husband's disappearance and the rebellion full of anguish of a daughter against her "interrogator" father. I understand that the bottom line movie participant needs a human quality to understand and for that reason I do not blame her for going that route. My only qualm is that we have not received enough of what the title says we should receive. Instead, numerous plots are shown, all confusedly brought forward before being sent back to the lower regions of our consciousness, never to be returned. So much is happening that you forget what you should be taking care of, the wife? the interrogator? the agent of the CIA? the victim? the senator the daughter of the Middle East and her boyfriend Zealot? In the end, I really gave up and let the movie take me where it was, which turned out to be someone totally different from what was first presented. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens happens as a result of a bomb. explosion. This bomb is at the center of every thread of the story and ultimately ends up being so innocuous that you can not believe how huge the waves that they were spreading were. The old butterfly wings are in full force, because the mission of revenge of a boy ends up destroying the lives of many. Whether by death, destruction, physical and emotional abuse, or career suicide; no one really escapes unharmed. However, at the end of the day, only the story about the man who was extirpated to Egypt for torture is really interesting. We are led to believe that he is unmistakably innocent from the start, but he is drowned, electrocuted, etc., in order to extract whatever information he may have. When those in power include a man without compassion or reason to stop until something is shed (true or not), and an observer without the courage to attend or stop it, the situation lends itself some intrigue on how it could possibly end. The three actors involved are the best parts of the film and prove once again that the film should have cared about them completely. <br /> <br /> I do not want to belittle people like Reese Witherspoon, (wife of the victim), or his Senate former employee, played by Peter Sarsgaard, because they really do a good job with what they are given. Even Meryl Streep, his grumpy accent and Alan Arkin do not diminish much. However, it is the trio of Jake Gyllenhaal's CIA agent, Yigal Naor's interrogator, and Omar Metwally's victim who really shine. Naor is brilliant as the Egyptian trying to stay sharp as a razor during the hours of yet compassionate and worried work as a father trying to locate his daughter. This man is brutal but he is because that is what his occupation requires and why he is reliable to find answers. Metwally never gives a false second during the pain and suffering inflicted on him. It does not matter if he's lying or really does not know anything about the terrorist who's calling his cell phone, we totally believe in his situation and we look forward to seeing how the situation happens. As for Gyllenhaal, someone who seems to have a recycled performance throughout his career with varying degrees of success, he finds a part that suits him. The demons that enter his soul throughout the ordeal, he is forced to be a part of the wear on his body and mind, causing ambivalence and a need to intervene. The two feelings struggle with each other until he makes a final decision, and his stoic and youthful behavior fits perfectly into this battle. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the plot of a line never becomes the main focal point, despite being the film's namesake. With all the clutter around the edges, we, as an audience, are much rebuffed, wrapped up in a sense of time and sequence, and then smack into the face as everything unfolds in yet another laugh at us, then, "bet on you I did not see it coming. " I felt cheated and unfortunately this is the enduring effect I took from the film. If it had been more direct, I might have liked more of myself, but, as it is, it is still possible to take some good points out of the whole with severe failures.
