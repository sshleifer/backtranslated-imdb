Some of the biggest and most beloved horror movies have a wicked sense of humor, but when a movie comes in it's not as original as the "classics", but only risked to laugh, so a bunch of guys to be critical completely slag off. This movie made me laugh several times, this is a testament to the way this film was approached and it shows. The two top leads seem natural and believable together and this really helps in that movie. You cheer for them all the way and laugh along with them, everyone has friends like these two guys. Another highlight for me was the monster truck, it's amazing, intimidating and very well filmed. Inspiring (stealing altogether) many movies, the most obvious is Duel, Jeepers Creepers and probably in reference to Jack Black co-star Orange County. But, in fact, you can choose any movie from a wrong trip and find a reference here. But, what, is not try to win an Oscar, just give the viewer a good dose of surprises and laughter, and at that point is 10! Obviously, he is not getting a 10, I give real sensible opinions and scores unlike 99% of people in IMDb. There is no way that this movie can achieve a zero as many lazy idiots give to many movies and as much fun as it is not to get a 10 as well. It's just a good fun movie for anyone with a sense of humor and liking scares. You really can not be simpler than that.
