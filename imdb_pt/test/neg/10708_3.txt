This movie is horrible beyond belief. It's a low-budget waste, poorly written, meaningless. But on Saturday afternoon I stumbled on TV it's still in my head as one of the most fun I've ever spent in front of the television. The wickedness of this movie is epic - it may not be Ed Wood's epic but close. The premise is hysterical (men are forbidden because they are too dangerous and imprisoned!), Pseudo-dike culture is ridiculously bizarre (there is a clandestine sex trade with women who dress like men to serve as "deviants" " ) and the "last man" of the title is a regrettable reincarnation of Rocky's Rocky Horror Picture Show. I did not get to see the ending, which I have to assume was so dripping with syrup "what did we all learn from it? "an absurdity that would bring a will to brush teeth, but everything in the first two thirds was so bad, even if the last third was an imitation of the rest, still worth it for who gets a kick. , stupid and brainless.
