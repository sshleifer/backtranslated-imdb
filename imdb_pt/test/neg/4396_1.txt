This has to be one of the biggest ignition mistakes of all time ... the script was cool and could have ended much better. The actors should have played better and maybe I gave the film a slightly better note. maybe Hollywood should redo this movie with a few better actors and a better director. The staff is a disappointment, but the movie is bad. <br /> <br /> If I had to watch it again, it would be like torture. I do not want to ruin everyone's opinion with my .. my advice is to watch the movie in the first place .. see if you like and after voting (do not vote before watching!) And by the way ... Have fun watching ! Do not just peek ... watch it to the end :))))))))) !!
