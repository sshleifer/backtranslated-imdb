I was an extra in that movie, but I wish it were not because of your trash. The worst thing about this movie is the music, but the acting, script, editing, direction and story are terrible as well. The main reason is bad because the budget is so low and the only way to make a good movie with a low budget is to have a good script. the script that should have been ripped before the movie was made is not funny, I did not laugh once. what made me laugh is how manufacturers probably think the most important thing was to make the film, who cares if it's total rubbish. the film needed more than a million pounds of budget and a better writer. The only reason I did not give the movie one out of ten is because I felt sorry for the guy who's going to lose a few hundred thousand doing this, if you go see him, make sure you're drunk on the spot. haha
