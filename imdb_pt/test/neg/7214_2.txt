Man stop making sequels for great movies. The original was a great movie that was topped by fights, sex and one of the coolest characters that graced the screen in the 1990s. The story is credible as if you were for bars in the south of the country that you know of. But here comes this piece of junk Roadhouse 2 Last Call. Let's just hope they're serious about the title and never make another Roadhouse. It does not have the charm of the characters from the original, nor is the story really believable. The story is more of an action-type Steven Segal that although Roadhouse 2 is a B movie, it still does not click, since some action from movie B still sells the movie, no matter how tacky it is. The only reason to rent not buying this movie is that we finally found out that the only question is left of the original Roadhouse. Is the character of Patrick Swayze, Dalton, Dalton your first name or last name? Well, I'll save you the $ 4.00 fee. Dalton is his first name as in Dalton Tanner. NEVER MAKE ANOTHER ROADHOUSE !!!!!!!!!!!
