Acting 10, Script 1. "Hurlyburly" is from that unfortunate postmodern theater school that declared that anything resembling a story or plot is forbidden. While people can get away with it on stage, in movies it becomes deadly - or at least deadly boring. We get a lot of great actors spouting dialogues that, while brilliantly written, add up to nothing. Even worse, every character speaks with the same voice, despite its origins. The only attempt to make a difference is to make Anna Paquin, a stray teenager, use the word "is not." <br /> <br /> No matter that the characters are extreme insensitive losers, the camera work is simple and sloppy (for Los Angeles residents) attention to geography is laughable. (Hint: the view from the front window of Sean Penn is about 13 miles from the view from the back window and you can not drive south through Hollywood and end up in Glendale pretending to be Burbank.) Ok, suspension of disbelief and everything that - and I would not normally pay attention to little things like these, because they are just whims of production. But the fact that they stand out so much, despite the pyrotechnics on the screen, says a lot about the weakest element of this venture - the script. <br /> <br /> In short, skip this, even on video. . Rabe chose the wrong quote from the Scottish game for his title; Hurlyburly would have been better named "A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, meaning nothing." A little long for the awning, perhaps - but at least it would be honest advertising.
