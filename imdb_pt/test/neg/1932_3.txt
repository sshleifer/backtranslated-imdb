This movie has more on its plate than a sumo wrestler and the result for the viewer is indigestion. There are some good performances, but the subplots are strange and largely unresolved. <br /> <br /> In addition, I found all the characters unlikely, and if you can not identify with at least one character, there is not much to be excited about. All in all, this is a classic example of trying to do a lot with very little.
