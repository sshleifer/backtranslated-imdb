I wish all mockumentaries and spoofs of terror would go away. If you are going to investigate loch ness..do this for real. Enough of the bull ****. Even with horror and science fiction..if you're going to make a movie and it's supposed to be scary..smooth creep..not funny. I hate it when I watch a horror movie and the character is fighting for his life (or running or whatever ... his life is at stake) and they are telling jokes. It never happens .. tell where all the good directors went? I think horror and science fiction have really come down since the 1970s. I yearn for the days when a horror movie was scary ... all this crap "horror movie" is for the birds. This movie is also for the birds. If you really would like to see a good investigation or here talk seriously ... do not expect this in this video.
