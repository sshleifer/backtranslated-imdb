I'm just going to write more because it's necessary. However, the summary I put at the top is very wordy for what this movie was. You pretty much know who's in it from the start. Despite your attempts at twists - "talent" trying hard to shock and discourage when a turnaround happens - you never have to ask yourself "whodunit" in this "mystery." <br /> <The more I write, the more I feel bad about having to write so much to have a comment, but rules are rules. I really feel bad about saying that, but that's the smallest I've ever rated a movie ... I guess. It makes me wonder what I'm saving votes of 1 and 2 for. However, I thought this movie deserved a 3, as I believe there was some talent in the film. Johanna Watts (or Watson) did a great job. She was crying and disturbed in one part and I thought she conveyed that emotion well. The man who played the character who was "the drummer" also did well for his small part. <br /> <br /> Many of the actors did an "ok" job. But the lead actor, David - forget his surname (terrible with names) - was too bad. I think he must have thought he was making dramatic performances for 'The Young and the Restless' or 'Days of Our Lives'. If you try, you can picture it in a white coat, playing a doctor with several personalities in the "General Hospital." It does not help that the film is filmed as a daytime soap. Although, I'm sure I could shoot that same movie with a camcorder; though without the obvious and soap'ish sound editing. <br /> <br /> First time I thought the money to rent this movie was wasted. However, I would not attend again unless I received a large sum of money.
