Rossini once described the work of the rival composer Wagner as having "some wonderful moments ... and some terrible Wednesdays". Inuyasha, it seems, can also be described in this way. There are many excellent episodes, but between them there are numerous episodes of filling. The whole series consists of about 175 episodes, of which I would say at least 125 are padding or some kind of subframe (I did not bother to count and I would not be surprised if that number was actually higher, though). /> <br /> Some of these fill-in episodes are actually very enjoyable, although many are rather silly or tedious. However, constant touring begins to wear off after the first few seasons, as the plot ends up progressing in a trawling worked through most of the series. Character development also declines considerably, and in recent seasons the cast has become immutable, resulting in increasingly obsolete jokes (particularly those related to the monk, whose ironic characteristics begin as slightly humorous, but become tiresome when associated jokes to them) will appear repeatedly). <br /> <br /> However, all this does not mean that Inuyasha is a bad series. It's simply not a great series of how the Neon Genesis Evangelion, for example, is generally considered to be. As something to watch at the end of a difficult day, it's fine, but it could never be mistaken for high art.
