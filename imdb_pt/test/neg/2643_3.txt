Had it not been for the very attractive Jennifer Jostyn in the lead role, I would have turned off the "Milo" after the first 30 minutes. However, as easy as it may seem, it is not enough to save this movie, not from far away. <br /> <br /> Milo begins with a group of girls who accompany an "assumed boy" in a yellow cape to a house in the woods where he shows embryos in jars. Apparently, the business was that if he showed the pots, old Milo would take a gynecologist's exam in return. One of the group's volunteers is Milo's "first patient" and he drives her behind closed doors. Moments later, the blood flows under the door and we are taken to the present day. Enter the adorable Jostyn who plays one of the girls all grown up these days. A substitute teacher with little confidence and whose closest friend seems to be a goldfish, she gets an invitation to go home for a friend's wedding. Yes! You guessed. Go back to Miloville. Milo, who allegedly drowned years ago, seems to be having a dilemma of remaining dead and begins to terrorize and murder the girls he failed to "examine" all those years ago. <br /> <br /> Milo, the character, reminded me of one of the mutants of Cronenberg's "The Brood." It could have been scary, but how scary can a villain be wearing a yellow raincoat? The plot confuses itself and the conclusion left me wanting my 90 minutes back. I'm sending Milo, an inept horror movie, to stay in the corner!
