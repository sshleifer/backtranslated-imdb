I could not stand the woman who played the mother. I wanted her to shut up. She had a bizarre way of speaking and the lines she was given to read did not improve. I did not know why the men of the city were so worried about her to cause all these problems except that in a town populated by men she seemed to be the only woman over ten and under sixty. Even after a terrible tragedy, her voice was devoid of human emotion, she seemed unable to comprehend the events of her life. She handed her lines with the same emotion if she was saying "I love you," "I hate you," "the bench is closing," "my dress is on fire." Was this really filmed in Ireland? The sun shone throughout the film and the characters seemed surprised by the rain during the harvest. I lived in Ireland during the summer of 2002, the rainiest summer in a century. Almost everything was still picked. If farmers in Ireland could only harvest during long periods of drought, the country would have starved to death for hundreds of years. It seems like there was not much money to make the movie. Black-and-white flashbacks appeared to have been filmed with the security cameras that can be found at Sam's Club.
