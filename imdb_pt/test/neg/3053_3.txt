And do you know why? Because they thought (or at least made the horror fans think) that a bunch of nasty teenagers, dirty-mouthed and screaming, some stupid demons (Where do they come from? What is their purpose? Who knows?) And a dark mansion are all you need to make a horror movie. Needless to say they were wrong. You also need a script, some logic, some rules and some invention. This film has a scene that lives up to its reputation (the lipstick scene, of course), and some funny moments (the description of the younger brother of his mother's cookies, the Linnea Quigley scene "do not look at me"). . He also has more profanity than any movie I've watched since I last saw "Reservoir Dogs." Literally, every fourth or fifth word is an "f ***" or a "b ****". So again, when a movie starts with four fake scares in its first 5 minutes, you should not expect anything like a good movie. (* 1/2)
