The production value of AvP2 can be described by an adjective: AWFUL <br /> <br /> The script is ridiculous even in the fictional area of ​​AvP: What are the good facehuggers on the Predator's ship? Why is the Predator cleansing all the signs of his influence and wasting valuable time eviscerating and even presenting the body of an insignificant human policeman? Why is Predator alone? Why is Predator equipping itself only on Earth, but on its home planet? Why does Predator leave his job so uncomfortable hunting the aliens than bombing the entire field as humans do in the end? Why is Predator tearing down more and more of its few weapons, instead of collecting them to keep them together after using one of them? In the end, he is even dropping his armor before fighting Predilien in hand-to-hand combat: which is a bad plagiarism in the final fight between Predators and Arny between Arny and the Predator. Predator's gestures are so exaggerated that he is moving more like a Japanese sumo than as a highly skilled extraterrestrial safari hunter. As you can see immediately, the whole story is a mess. But it gets even worse because this poorly finished work is filled with a patchwork of meaningless interludes, such as a long episode of ordering pizza or some detailed information on the criminal past of the two brothers (Dallas and Ricky). The sheriff is, of course, the friend of these two criminals that he regularly puts behind the bars. (not convincing and absolutely superfluous to the plot). <br /> <br /> In addition, the cast of actors is horrible. Compared to the high class of directors and actors from the old Aliens or Predator films, AvP2 is an embarrassingly bad piece. <br /> <br /> Finally, the action of the movie is really bad. There is no single action-fighting scene where the audience can see the whole scene. Each and every fight is filmed in short, shaken bursts with close zoom in almost total darkness. This results in an atrocious experience for the public, because most of the time you can not see anything but a shaky screen. I suggest that the two direct brothers, Strause, buy a fixed camera and have a modern computer graphics class. the next movie contains some visible action of visible figures and you may not need to disguise your bad driving skills in this way. <br /> <br /> I would advise anyone (even AvP fans) not to watch this movie: prefer the first or the original aliens or the original Predator movies, but avoid disappointing yourself by wasting your precious time with this failure.
