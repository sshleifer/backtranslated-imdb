There are plenty of reviews that describe this movie as the worst ever made. Certainly there are many mistakes: lackluster acting, a boring script and clich√© and sometimes paradoxical, and the sound of movie B and "special" effects. As has been said, there are many comments about the plot, making _Cave Dwellers_ a fabric of fantasy films, especially in comparison to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, this film is not the worst movie of all times. Most, if not all, of these revisions are written by fans of MSTK3. So many of these reviews are basically summaries of the MSTK3 episode of _Cave Dwellers_. In the episode, Joel, Tom Servo and Crow tell the crazy scientists that this is the worst movie ever submitted to them. Of course, loyal fans took this quote and ran with it. I found this captivating film - not in a way that we think _Forrest Gump_ captivating - but in the effort put into this movie by some of the cast. In addition, this film is laughable without the MSTK3 treatment. That's because Cave Inhabitants do not take themselves seriously, and they're not trying to give their viewers some kind of correct theme. For all the monster dolls, medieval delta and lapses of continuity - this film does not announce what it is, a superficial representation of a rather superficial genre. <br /> <br /> Similarly, I can not hate Miles O'Keeffe or Lisa Foster. Instead, this hatred is for Coleman Francis, Tony Cardoza, Jennifer Lopez, Arch Hall, Jr. and so on. <br /> <br />
