I went to see "Passion of Mind" because I usually get kicked out of the genre of alternative reality novels, ie "sliding doors", "I, myself, I", etc. <br /> <br /> But that was the worst I've ever seen! I had to force myself to sit with it. I did not even have the credits that are unheard of for me. Magical realism was completely absent because Demi Moore was somber and the lovers she had both times were guys who usually play villains, though each of them was kind and sexy. <br /> <br /> There was indeed a psychological explanation provided for the dual lives, with an unpleasant frisson of the Elektra Complex; maybe magic should not be explained for this genre to work. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 5/28/2000)
