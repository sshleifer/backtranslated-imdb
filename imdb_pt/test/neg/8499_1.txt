I would not have given this film such a low rating (2) if its average had not been ridiculously high, but someone had to reduce it to something more reasonable. I sat through most of this movie, watching scene after scene of tagging and theft in stores. No dialogue, just marking and theft. Finally the two taggers kissed. Something happened. But then back to tagging and theft in stores. I left the screening. I recommend this movie only to those who are impressed by the pretentious cinema. I did not like the directors' previous film (an arrogant defense of love between men and women), but at least that movie had a story, interesting characters, dialogues. The Graffiti Artist had only scene after scene of marking and theft in stores. I want more of a movie than that.
