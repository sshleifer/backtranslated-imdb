He intends to be the life of Paul the apostle. He starts off with it involved in a wrestling match with a priest. The Pharisees were so called because they "separated" from Hellenism by being forced upon the Jews by their Gentile rulers. The point is that Saul would never have been involved in Greco-Roman fighting. PERIOD. <br /> <br /> So we have both men (Saul and Priest, Reuben - a totally extra-biblical fictional character) shown being washed naked in a Roman-style bathroom. Again, the Torah, which Saul adhered religiously, condemned in the strongest possible terms the nudity of another man. <br /> <br /> Reuben is shown to be the one who pushes Saul to destroy the church. Again, the scripture does not matter, for it is Paul who says he devastated the church and exalted threats and massacres against the church. <br /> <br /> The film shows "sprinkling" by Barnabas Paul - not by baptizing (immersing) him, when the Scripture says that it was Ananias who did it. <br /> <br /> There is no mention of Mark or his return, so script writers are forced to have Paul and Barnabas argue over Paul's desire to preach in Rome as the basis of his separation. <br /> <br /> Do not Silas in the second and third missions of Paul; No Timothy ... EVER. None Titus; No Apollo ... No, NO, NOOOO !!! It is said that James "has known Jesus a long time" instead of saying, like the Text of the Scriptures, that he is Jesus' brother. <br /> <br /> Why not just call the movie "Frank, the fictional apostle?!" At least this would be closer to the text of the scriptures.
