Like nonsensical, hideous characters and boring movie. Saved by short sex scenes, crazy witch, beautiful desert island and Brooks body. The plot is tenuous, the characters are superficial and unpleasant. That said, I got to watch everything, mainly because I was totally paralyzed with the swaying and kind of hoping that his character would turn out well in the end. The film was well filmed, well directed, but perhaps the cast has somehow diminished. Disappointing. Actually summed up the review on the first line, but this site dictates that you need to write at least 10 lines. It would be better to spend time watching another movie.
