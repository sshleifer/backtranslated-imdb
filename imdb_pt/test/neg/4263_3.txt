Good attempt to approach the unconventional theme of the novels from May to December. However, the treatment is totally unrealistic. Of course, sixty-year-old men can and do fall in love with younger women, but generally they are adult women with whom they share common interests and values ​​and points of view ... not neurotic, immature, and quasi-minor girls. Of course there are exceptions, and they come close to being called pedophiles! Sorry RGV, but it is not credible that a sensible and talented sexagenarian throws away a comfortable family life and becomes a joke to your colleagues ... everything for an 18 year old who does not have a practical thought in his head and who behaves, as an unstable fugitive of a mental institution. You do not need to have a PhD in Psychology to see that Amitabh's character is seduced by sex, and that the girl has unresolved issues of abandonment and daddy. <br /> <br /> As for the recurring scene of Vijay perched on the edge of a cliff, contemplating suicide, it is as close as he gets to having something in common with Jiah, behaving like a wounded teenager. <br /> <br /> On a positive note: the actors did a good job. good work and cinematography.
