A poor basketball movie. A grumpy coach with a dubious past comes to a small Indiana college basketball team in the 1950s and trains the boys for the win by "breaking them first and then building them." <br /> <br /> Not a bad guy. Photography OK. But the plot is totally predictable. No real subplane. Nothing was added to make the movie exciting. You know what will happen from the beginning. Suitable for 4th grade.
