Imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle ages and a resurrected vampire and your maniac companion is chasing you. Where is the last absolute place you want to hide? I would say within the mysterious Virgin of Nuremberg, because there is a great risk of you being brutally beaten to death. And yet, the old lady in this movie stupidly runs into her spiked casket. "The Vampire's Coffin" is a rather disappointing sequence, as director Fernando Méndez does not recreate the Gothic atmosphere of the original 1957, but puts emphasis on comic situations and dialogues. There are no more sinister castles with mysterious spider webs and dark vaults, but confusing physicians and clumsy assistants who elicit laughter instead of frustration. The story opens within the final resting place of Count de Lavud, where an eminent physician and a hired assistant steal the coffin to examine the corpse in a private clinic. Of course, the wooden stake is removed from your heart, and the vampire count comes back to life, immediately enslaving the thief to do his dirty work. The vampire is eyeing a beautiful female patient in the clinic, and it is up to Dr. Enrique Saldivar to rescue his soul and destroy the leech. "The vampire's coffin" uses a limited amount of venues and there is very little action. The whole movie would be really annoying if it were not for a handful of memorable sequences and decent acting performances. The photograph is incredible, however, with the sublime use of shadows and darkness. This is most notably during the scene in which Count of Lavud pursues a young woman through the deserted streets of the small town at night. It's the only really interesting scene in the whole movie, the rest is mediocre and déjà-vu.
