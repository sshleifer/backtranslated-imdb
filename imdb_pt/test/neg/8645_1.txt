I went to see this film in the cinema based on its potentially interesting, good cast, a director who had already done the highly rated "Once Were Warriors" and my liking for noir-ish films set in Los Angeles in the Forty-Fifties. I would say that I am reasonably easy to please in this category of film; I appreciate the classics of the genre, but I will sit back and enjoy a half-decent, if derivative effort as well. However, I found this movie completely unbearable. <br /> <br /> Despite a good situation to put the story, no one seems to do or say anything remotely interesting or entertaining in every two hours more of this sorry sorry. Good actors are wasted in endless scenes of dialogue ranging from banal to embarrassing. The narrative is loose and creeps unbearably, and none of the events it portrays are treated well enough to do anything other than bring the public to the death. There is no drama, no atmosphere, no tension, absolutely no entertainment value and in the end I just do not care what happened because I did not believe in anything in the movie. <br /> <br /> L. Confidential came about a year later and, regardless of whether a version of the story is more true to reality, the last movie deservedly gets all the praise for its excellence in every department. Mulholland Falls, on the other hand, fails in every department, fact even more tragic by the amount of talent involved. If they show it on a plane, I'm still leaving.
