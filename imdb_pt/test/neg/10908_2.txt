Another novelty: this French film is my introduction to the world Eric Rohmer. Maybe I'm a bit rushed when I say this is probably my last Rohmer movie, but I was immediately turned off by the way Rohmer draws on monotonous philosophical conversations that never get to the point. There's a scene in the movie where the characters discuss love that I thought would never end. Honestly, no matter how much I tried, I could not understand why Rohmer is so highly regarded among film buffs. He struck me as one of those detestable, petulant people who are full of hot air. If this is a sample of your movies, I'm not interested. I do not care much about French cinema (usually reflective and speculative with a flaw), so maybe I'm partial.
