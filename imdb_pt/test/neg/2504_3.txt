One of the few films filmed at Coronado High School in Scottsdale, Arizona in the late 1980s, as well as Just One of the Guys, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and Just Perfect (which was a segmented film during the Mickey Mouse Club). it is definitely for kids as the previous reviews have pretty much gone. <br /> <br /> Coronado underwent a makeover in the last two years and many of the buildings seen in this movie are gone. The field where they are playing catch is adjacent to the football field, one of the few areas still there. The inner scenes near the cabinets, I believe, were in the old building 200. <br /> <br /> Unless you're playing late at night on the Disney Channel, it can be very difficult to find a movie. As they have already made strings for this is beyond me.
