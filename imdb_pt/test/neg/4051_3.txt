The movie is about a day in the life of a woman who is going crazy. To show that she is mentally ill, she is much better and the narrator tells us that she is "going crazy." Along the way, she comes out with a fat guy who looks like he could be Orson Welles's brother and then he picks up a building header at one of the only interesting moments in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a weird little movie that's made very cheap - and it sure does show. The film was filmed without sound (probably using 8mm or some other type of cheap film) and had some sound effects and a dominant narration added later. In fact, the narration was the most intrusive and unintentionally hilarious I have ever heard and it is said in such a silly and exaggerated way that you would have to listen to believe it. As a result of these cost-cutting actions, it is not surprising that the film is bad, although the idea of ​​trying to make this kind of film was quite original. Also, it is very difficult to spend the whole movie.
