The words almost fail me to describe how terrible this Irish vanity project is (funded by Canadian - federal taxpayers and Albertan). There is a sudden appearance of a beautiful Canadian (Kathy Ranheim) who in real life was a star athlete in Alberta with no other reason to secure Canadian content. Credits also indicate that certain Calgary pubs were helpful. <br /> <br /> Everything here is poorly filmed and at least in the third hand (bits of Trainspotting, Lock Stock, Snatch and Reservoir Dogs are the most obvious). Avoid like the plague, unless you enjoy one of those "so bad that are almost funny" nights in front of your television.
