I usually take after the benefit of the doubt and go easy with them. But this is very poor. The same thing that happened in the first movie happens here again. Exactly the same. Only they wanted younger children to see him (this explains the repeated presence of Bugs, but why they played 'f * ck' is beyond me). <br /> <br /> They did not even bother to change the character of Jackie Mason from Dangerfield. Let me explain, in CADDYSHACK, Rodney Dangerfield has played a rough-hewn property that enrages the tense members of Bushwood's country club. In this film Jackie Mason plays a coarse real estate owner who rages at the tense members of the Bushwood Country Club. A lot of effort they made to change the script content, right? No, I do not think so. A very dishonest Dan Aykroyd, shamefully, copies the character of Bill Murray. He even goes after the gopher (now more like a Gremlin) in the same way as Murray. <br /> <br /> There is no laughter to be had. A sample of the 'comedy' in this film: Jackie Mason is gearing up for a hot date with Dyan Cannon. He's in the bathroom is his robe. He moves to the door to get dressed in his room when the door knob breaks. Wow!?! That's the best they can do. Eight years to think about a completely new sequel and that's all we get!?! I could have gotten a better script out of my ass. <br /> <br/> See if you're a diehard fan of the original. It's the only way for you to find some kind of laugh. All the others walk away.
