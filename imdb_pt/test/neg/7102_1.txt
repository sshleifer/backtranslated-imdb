Because Lori Petty has been cast as a tank girl, I'll never know. Its acting performance is lack of brightness. His voice is angry. It's almost impossible for me to put into words how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> There are several "pop-modern" references in the film, which I found very strange, given that the film should be happening in the future. It would not have been difficult to make that premise interesting either. Some better writing would have helped a lot. <br /> <br /> Naomi Watts makes an appearance as a gentle and educated techno-geek. I think they probably should have changed roles. <br /> <br /> I'll never know why anyone would like this movie, unless they were a little fan. <br /> <br /> Try not to see this movie. . Total loss of time.
