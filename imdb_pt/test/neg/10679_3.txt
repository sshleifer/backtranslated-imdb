Just like all the cast and crew know f *** all about the movies. <br /> <br /> This movie concerns the adventures and predicaments of a modern killer cockney vampire, and an old woman spat with her seemingly tired vampire lover. This plot, by itself, smacks of cliches and promises of boredom when in a movie as small as this, and that's exactly what you get. <br /> <br /> First, let me say that I did not fire movies because they are B movies, in fact, some of my favorite movies are B movies, like Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter, but this one does not have nothing to do with a mile. <br /> <br /> Anyone with any knowledge of small budget movies I know that acting is rarely exciting and emotional, but Razor Blade Smile creates a new dimension on the screen. Some of the so-called actors are simply indescribably bad, with characters spitting strange phrases falling on the floor, and speeches expressing as much emotion and conviction as the terminator after a pair of horse tranquilizers. <br /> <br /> Part of the movie is also occupied by the vampire characters, the protagonist in particular, unnecessarily tapping their mouths, displaying their ridiculously large vampire teeth and exhaling very loudly. It literally should happen in almost every scene at least once, and quickly became annoying and pointless, as if many stares from supposedly scary vampire fangs were used only to fill in a little time and leave the rest of that film. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what some of the other critics believe here, I feel that this film (the director in particular) is really trying to take this movie seriously in many parts. The sheer number of overly dramatic action scenes and extreme close-ups seems to indicate that the director really wanted people to feel this film and make it legitimate for their genre and not falsify it, and it fails miserably. Attempts of supposedly tasteful sex scenes come out as comic and silly, and the action sequences are sometimes simply stupid. <br /> <br /> Also the end of this movie was one of the weaker and pathetic conclusions I've ever seen. a movie, movie B or not. When movies like this force you to spend hours alone to be rewarded with a "oh, it's all been a game" ending, it's actually sick. It's the conclusion of the "plot" seems a late reflection of the director he discovered on the last day of filming, because they had run to the end of their tight budget. <br /> <br /> But I did not rate this movie as a star despite the large number of flaws, and this is because of the only good point I can really give to this movie. Intentionally or not, it was funny. I'm pretty sure the parts I found funny should not be, and I found that most of the efforts in genuine jokes are fruitless, but when assisted with friends it's a good movie to take away.
