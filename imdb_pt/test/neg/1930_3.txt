**** Spoiler Possible **** If you were making a serious movie involving a powerful but aged father with three seemingly ungrateful daughters, featuring actors of the highest caliber, with great cinematography and beautiful midwestern setting, now where would you go with it? Now, you would shape a modern tragedy after the "King Lear," of course. <br /> <br /> That's what I've been waiting for. That certainly was not what I got. What I got was 105 minutes of feminist guts - a long discussion about the inhumanity of the man to the woman. There was not a decent man in all of history. <br /> <br /> You see very early where this movie may be going, but you can not believe that someone would waste all those great actors and artisans in this story. Banal scenario - you just want them to continue with the King Lear theme. But this never happens; and there is the real tragedy if you ask me. <br /> <br /> In addition to the glorious rural heartland panorama, the only thing worth watching in this movie was the wonderful chameleon, the British actor Colin Firth, practicing his American Midwest accent. . Now there was a treat. <br /> <br /> 3/10
