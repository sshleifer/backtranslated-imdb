If considered as an independent feature, I can not say it is too bad but from where I stand this sequel and the original "Lady and the Tramp" do not agree with one another! They are two completely different films, with different styles, different voice personalities, different narratives and the only thing they share with each other is the visuals (for example, Jim Dear's house, Darling, Lady and Tramp) and none of them. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for some kind of continuity years after the release of the original for those memorable songs like "Bella Notte" and "The Siamesse Cats Song", this sequel will not give you any at all! Just about every song has a bit of pop and those good old characters like Jock and Trusty, Jim Dear and Darling and Auntie Sarah and their cats may well be seen, but they seem to be somehow replaced by new characters, not to mentioning Peg not showing up, whose voices are very annoying. Even Lady and Tramp do not show up often enough and as for Scamp?! He is so spoiled! And treat your father Tramp with total disrespect, so run away without any remorse, even after hearing how much he is being lost at home! And they called their shameless escape an adventure! I would say that Scott Wolf actually brought the abusive bad boy boy into Scamp ending up with the typical cute Disney animal. Even the old characters just drive you crazy about it; Trusty sounds like Goofy sick in bed, Jock (Jeff-stupid-Bennett) - and his voice - sound neither scottish nor worth listening to! Zap it off as far as possible to free our poor ears from his voice and as for the dumb, feather-brain dogs, EXPANDING JUNKYARD !!!!!! Someone put them down !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "Lady and the Tramp 2" It's not completely bad if you're not already having a hard day, but I expect a lot more charm from a sequel to a true classic - Scamp is chavvy, just like your girlfriend Angel and there is a weak plot. Still, I think you should try it at least once because, like I said, there are much worse movies around.
