You can usually ask two questions about the low-budget horror movies of the 80's and this particular "Demon Wind". 1. Is it a good movie? No ... 2. Is it a fun movie? You bet! Demon Wind is a grotesque and nauseating tale, full of makeup effects and unpleasant violence. The story is virtually non-existent and involves a group of young people revealing the hideous secrets of one of the group's ancestors. Apparently, his grandparents used to live in a neighborhood of devotion to the devil, and evil (in the form of demons and haze) still lives there. But, I have to deliver it to this movie. From beginning to end, he breathes the morbidity! The devilish tones, playful blood, and the (relatively) decent action they all do together make this movie rise above the slashers of the '80s without inspiration. It shows some creativity and courage (literally) where other productions of this decade fall into routine and oblivion more easily. These creators were clearly inspired by the success of 'The Evil Dead', and perhaps even in Lambert Bava's Demons, what the hell! It's fun and done with a lot of enthusiasm. Although this film has a high level of quality - the standard - sometimes. Especially near the end, when flashbacks and laser shows are being mixed cheerfully. And what is the story of these two would-be wizards? However, 'Demon Wind' gets my recommendation if your tastes are not too high when it comes to shit horrors!
