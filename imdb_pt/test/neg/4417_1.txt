For me it's a case that you'll never understand if you did not live it ... so read this to know why I would have such unlimited anger ... <br /> <br /> I've heard so much about (Bruce Lee). my father loved him .. my mother who hates any small shot of violence loved him! and how she talks so far about her "The Big Boss," also known as "Fists of Fury," and the experience of watching it in Egyptian films in 1973 with all the gigantic success ... in addition, I watched a very good movie about it (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story - 1993) .. then I saw myself crying: where are your movies Bruce? !! <br /> <br /> I went to the video store ... and it was a stupid move ... (you'll know why!) .. and waw .. I found a lot of Bruce Lee movies .. I selected one called (Bruce Lee in New Guinea) <br /> <br /> I did it to me and saw that .. OH GOD, PLEASE FORGIVE YOUR SERVANT .. I HURTED IT BUT NO DECISION TOGETHER .. I DID NOT I would if I had known its damaging evil !! its mythical level of hideous !! <br /> <br /> After that I did not understand at all what is the big confusion about Bruce Lee as a great immortal star ??? .. why would anyone care if he's here or there .. this hero (whom I watched!) is not so talented and not that genius and of course not that sexy ??? <br /> <br /> Until my father saw this star and he asked me to take a break on any of his closes and then he examined his face a little .. he told me in a very definitive way "this it's not Bruce Lee! " so I was too confused to ask: who is this silly guy anyway? !! <br /> <br /> It was in 2001 .. 2 years after my first entry into the IMDb database ... so I immediately took care to know who the hell this man is ... and I discovered the truth .. he It's not Bruce Lee .. Not my dear friends .. he's Bruce Li !!! <br /> <br /> And what a huge ... so big difference !! I just want to know who can love this bad clone? Or God forbid .. I love your repulsive movies .. I watched 2 of them and could not bear to finish the third! <br /> <br /> After that I ignored all our video stores because their cheap cunning (writing on the posters THAT THIS IS Bruce Lee! ??) .. and I have the original .. The first and only Bruce Lee, who is really a big star and Oh BOY, he certainly had the right to immortality .. and not less.
