this movie has no plot, does not have good acting, to be honest has nothing, the same songs play a horrible performance and if you can really sit there and watch the whole thing and have fun there is something wrong with you. I wish I could give this 0 out of 10, but I can not, so it has to be a 1 that is generous! ice-t is not even a good rapper and worse still in acting, every bit of the film is bullshit, I took this movie on DVD without knowing what it was for the price of Â£ 1.99 and I thought I had won a bargain So I looked for the IMDb rating and did not take that into account, but after watching it, I discovered that the DVD I had purchased was a complete waste of time, money and electricity. If you have this movie, there are two things you can sell to someone who does not know or burn it!
