Bobcat Goldthwait should be commended for trying to do something different with this surprisingly candid movie, a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of being honest about everything. Melinda Hamilton is Amy, a girl who has had oral sex with a canine in the past. She struggles to tell her fiancÃ©, John. Of course the truth is the ugly, disheveled head. The film deals with the consequences of the said escape. The film is well represented by everyone, except perhaps by Jack Plotnick as Dougie, who never felt like he was good with the picture. And the film while solid enough seems to lose its mark a few times. All the people in the movie fight against massive hypocrisy and with all our difficulty of relating. Bobcat should be praised for doing something different, as I said before, but different is not always equal to a good and this is nothing for the directorial debut of Goldthwaits, the misunderstood "Shakes the Clown" > My degree: C-
