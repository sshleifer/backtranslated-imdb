It's so bad I can not get away. I keep asking myself, "Why?" "Because?" There is no continuity, but again, if you want to make a very homosexual movie with a fetish attitude towards all the big things, big boats, big boys, big airplanes, then you do not have to worry about things like plot or character. I am confused and very concerned that the CAG resembles Richard Pryor so much. It seems wrong to put an appearance of Pryor in such a terrible movie. But I can not walk away. This movie is the first movie I've ever reviewed. This is how phenomenally it is bad and bizarre. This motivated me to enter this site. I counted 50 main characters. Maybe, if I was stoned, I could follow this, but, as it is, I feel like I'm in some kind of bad dream that never ends, where it's always 1988, and we were the biggest cocktry in the world.
