Honestly - this short film sucks. the dummy used in the necro scene is nicely done, but still false enough to ruin the viewing experience. the Unearthed DVD is clear and clear and I have not made up my mind whether this helps or hinders. If the film were a bit grainy, it might have added some "oddness" to what was happening. I have no idea why this movie has so much hype around it besides the subject - but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others are more shocking than in AFTERMATH. All this talk about the movie being about loneliness and all other forms of deep philosophy is bullshit. This is an expensive, beautifully filmed dung. It's not so shocking, it's not so disgusting. if you insist on seeing it, rent it. I give a 3 to the fact that many people do not make explicit films about necrophilia (there should definitely be a bigger selection for us, sick) - the filming is good and has some "blood" (if you watch a rubber looking doll Cutting open is considered gore ...), but beyond that - absolutely nothing goes into this over-hyped mess. On the other hand - GENESIS - Cerda's sequel to AFTERMATH (now available as a "double feature" released by Unearthed films) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film, really showing what a good Cerda director really is when given the right material. Although I do not care about AFTERMATH, GENESIS is so well done that I will forgive Bristle and definitely keep an eye on it in the future ...
