The writers of this miniseries should have been sentenced to the guillotine. They massacred a very entertaining story and squandered the talents of Richard E. Grant. The only thing the writers kept from the original books was the name. All the characters were totally changed and the story was not the same. I strongly suggest watching another version of Scarlet Pimpernel. Any other version is better than this.
