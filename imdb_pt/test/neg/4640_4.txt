Another day - this movie requires you to watch another day to understand it. I really like to see Shannen Doherty and I was quite interesting to see how well Julian McMahon and Shannen appeared together after the roles they played in Charmed. I can certainly compliment the acting skills throughout the film, even the direction - but the plot ... what happened? I'm speechless because I'm still confused. I have to stay true to the actors who really did a good job considering the madness of the plot. I also have to recommend that you watch, because despite the madness of the plot, I would continue to watch it several times.
