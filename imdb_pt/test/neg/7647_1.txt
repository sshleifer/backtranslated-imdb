Honestly, one of the worst written, directed and screened movies I've ever seen. It looked like a movie made for TV. And a bad one at that. I can not believe that people are still hiring Danny Huston after seeing him in this movie, or that they are still allowing John Sayles to make movies. My husband and I came across this movie on TV one night and we were so bored with it that we ended up cleaning the house while it was on. . . and still bored us! It made me think that critics have been so naive with Sayles' earlier films, like Lone Star, who was enthusiastic about him at the time, but ultimately did not contribute much. Spend your time on something better. Anything.
