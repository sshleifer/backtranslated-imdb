There is something going on in this film directed by the X-Files writer, John Shiban, who deceived me. You get to feel like the movie moves that everything is not what it seems but I feel that the film fails to give you enough to continue to truly care afterwards. It's about perception. There are characters that the heroine Nicole (Jaimie Alexander) finds in the film that she talks about it and disappears. This may sound like a spoiler, but it's something that really only inherits a bit of focus on the part of the filmmakers. They seem to be mocking us as we watch whether we should trust what Nicole is seeing or not. He never gets an adequate response and I, at least, was a bit clueless on the point. There comes a time in a movie in which ambiguity can be frustrating because the viewer is led to a chase ending in a dead end with little explanation for what we have just seen ... it seems like an exhausting exercise rather than an exciting psychodrama . Now there is nothing wrong with the ambiguity itself, but give us something to hold on to or you avoid us. That's how I felt when I watched "Rest Stop". This movie is supposed to be about a young woman named Nicole who decides to flee to California with her lover Jesse (Joey Mendicino) to make a success in Hollywood. They do what is supposed to be a slight detour at a rest stop so Nicole can pee, but descends into terror for her when she finds out that her Jesse is completely missing. Someone in a yellowish and dusty truck is a nutcase that seems to be causing a lot of trouble for Nicole and we soon realize that he's behind Jesse's disappearance when things start happening, signals given to her if you want, she'll have to find a exit to a very difficult situation. Nicole is far from any existing city with limited resources to defend against a maniac who provides him with strong evidence of how bad he can be. <br /> <br /> That's the easy part. When a female character comes on the scene, the film makes a really bizarre leap in logic, as we are not sure where it came from, how it got there, and more importantly, where it goes when Nicole tries to free her from her supposed arrest. in the closet of the bathrooms. She meets another, a police officer in the area (Joey Lawrence), who may seem like her savior, but when he is also a victim of the truck driver, surprising things happen again, that question whether he was really right there to begin with. The truck driver commits torturous acts to Nicole (like shoving her in the bathroom and as she tries to untie a wire that the killer wrapped around the door, she gets a nasty bite from him). He then sets fire to the bathroom leaving her without a place of refuge from the beast. <br /> <br /> It is the moment of the truck driver's attack that makes me apathetic. Maybe he just likes to torment her, but he appears appropriately in certain situations where Nicole has time to flee or prepare. It does not make much sense, his motives, that propel the film into an illogical idea. Why does it become so obvious? Why does he allow her to prepare? It seems like I'm coming out at a point here, that he likes to take his prey believing they can find a way to escape just to take away that hope when he shows up with his next terrible attack. Still, why does Shiban decide to play with the viewer causing Nicole to have strange encounters with people who do not exist? What are Shiban and the team of writers trying to say? And to crown the unbalanced strangeness of the movie, there's a family in a trailer. They play a small role in the scheme of things as religious fanatics, but the film does not do enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in that movie.
