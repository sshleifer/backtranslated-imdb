I'm a fan of this usually great show, although sometimes a little dull, but the third season took some terrible directions. The HERO episode is an example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> The story unfolding is that the Cylons deliberately allow the Bulldog - a pilot captured several years before during a black ops mission - to escape, steal a Cylon Ship and return to Galactica. The plan is that when Bulldog returns, he will find that Adama has left him at his destination and become so enraged that he would kill Adama, which he almost did. <br /> <br /> Now the problem is this - the Cylons set it up for the Bulldog to think he escaped alone. That means the Bulldog gets off the Cylon ship without help. So he kills a Cylon and walks out of his cell - that's what we see. So we must assume that he walks to the hangar, gets into a Cylon combat ship and learns how to operate it, takes off and flies back to Galactica. Just like that. Now Starbuck got one of them to work on the first season, which was not believable in itself, but it only needed to fly visually out of orbit before contacting Galactica. Bulldog has to program his ship to make several jumps through hyperspace and can reach Galactica somewhere thousands of light-years away, in an unknown direction. How can he program a ship that contains totally alien technology? Cylons connect to their computers by touch, there are no visual consoles or keyboards. And having accomplished this miraculous deed, how does he then know where Galactica is, bearing in mind that Galactica took off about 3 years earlier and is trying to evade the Cylons ever since - does it not leave the beacons behind? Even allowing the suspension of disbelief that should apply to any science fiction show, this episode still does not make any sense.
