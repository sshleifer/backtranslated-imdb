I'm not sure what to say / think about this movie. It's definitely not the worst of the series (there's still "Halloween 3"). The style is just very different and focuses on other elements that its predecessor did. He tries to explain why Michael Myers goes crazy on Halloween and starts massacring. Well, all those things about Michael Myers being cursed and the evil cult was a pretty nice endeavor, but I did not buy it. None of the other installments in the series attempted to create extravagant explanations. <br /> <br /> The movie contains a lot of horrible stuff. In fact, it's just carnage. If you have not seen the other Halloween movies yet, you'll probably like this blood content. But for a real Halloween freak, this sequel can be very different to be seen as a good one. The suspense was transformed into terror and carnage (blowing heads ... you got the point). <br /> <br /> The end (theatrical cut) is simply awful. Michael is stabbed with a needle, then beaten with a barrel, then stabbed again, this time with more needles, then beaten a little harder until the mud runs from his head (where did that green thing come from?). Basically, it's nothing more than rubbish worth $ 5 million. <br /> <br /> There was one good thing: Michael's mask! <br /> <br /> Dedicated to Donald Pleasance, a great misfortune. My rating: 4/10
