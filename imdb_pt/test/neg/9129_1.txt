Dear Reader, Beware! This movie is not really a movie, although its creators have the impertinence to call it that. If you have not been warned about your content, here goes: the film is simply a sequence of images that flow continuously and are trying to convey a certain feeling, concept. They could be called, therefore, symbols. The images are accompanied by a soundtrack, the purpose is to create atmosphere as well. However, the images that the director chose can only convey feelings to an American audience, because they are, in a crushing number, American icons. Although the film intends to express the idea of ​​"civilized war", it does so not only because of the general chaos, but also because it is very long and tiring, and I felt strongly that many scenes do not do with "war" in any conception. To conclude, I was very disappointed with a documentary that is not a documentary, a film that is not a film, a "something" whose only strong point is the extraordinary use of technology in image processing.
