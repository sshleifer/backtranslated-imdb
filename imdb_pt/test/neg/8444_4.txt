Obviously, this is not the "Piranha" directed by Joe Dante and produced by Roger Corman. It was not so obvious when I bought the DVD for only $ 2.95, as the DVD cover matched that of the comedy / horror "Piranha" produced by Corman, even the DVD's menu (without features, of course) it matched the cover. Half way through watching this weird movie, my girlfriend and I started to think, where are the piranhas? When the movie climaxed, we realized that we should have watched the wrong movie, as we saw in the trailer, which had completely different footage, the synopsis on the back of the DVD did not correspond to the story we were watching and credits (actors, producer, director) were also completely different. Instead, we have a jungle melodrama about a girl and two guys who go in search of diamonds and end up facing a cruel animal hunter. This meek and exploitative thriller is boring and meaningless and is just slightly fun for the value of the old guard camp. Strange that a DVD can be made with the wrong movie in tact, but I suppose it's an easy mistake to make as if they were both B-grade films of the same name made in the '70s. Reading other posts made in this movie, I noticed that I am not the only one with the wrong movie on the DVD. How could this be an international mistake? Is there perhaps some kind of DVD phenomenon in which unsuccessful movies try to get recognition being placed on the wrong DVDs? WHAT'S HAPPENING???
