Okay, my question who's the idiot who wrote this movie, giving it the same name as Dean Koontz's incredible book? is terrible, nothing like the book ... you have the dog, and the observer, but the similarities are over ... it may be good, if you have not read the book ... but it really disappointed me. <br /> <br /> they should make a new one, and we'll koontz write it ... now that would be a good movie ... I'll say it again, this movie made me angry ... absolutely pissed me off. It was terrible, it was nothing like the book. I would never watch it again.
