I know that the Full Moon, or any other movie studio, could never recapture the fun-filled, extravagant sense of science fiction that was the original "Trancers." And with the two last appearances in the series having Jack Deth in medieval times instead of futuristic Los Angeles, it became quite obvious that there really was little hope of reviving the Trancers series. Breathing a new life into a movie is one thing, but taking out the main character of your element and putting it in the past, well, it did not work! So now with Trancers 6, Full Moon breathed so much new life into the series that we did not even deal with Jack Deth anymore. We now deal with his daughter, Jo. Jack is in his body and must go into the past and fight the Trancers once again. <br /> <br /> * MINIMUM SPOILER: THE FIRST SCENE OF THE FILM REVEALED * <br /> <br /> To prove how bad this movie is, you only need to watch the first two minutes of the movie when the original Jack Deth appears on the screen. But it's really not Tim Thomerson. It's clips of him and sound bytes together (trust me, you can tell they're tied together) horribly to provide the viewer with the ultimate in Jack Deth's true mood. And from there, things just go down the hill. Having this girl, Jo Deth, as our main character while Jack Deth should be in his body, is the worst idea in the world. Having this cute young woman acting like a hard and tough man is not the right way! It does not work and it really seems silly. <br /> <br /> I will not go into the aspects of special effects and makeup because most people reading this know what the Full Moon has become: really, low budget company. I do not know what to say about this movie except that I really wish that Full Moon could be as it was in the days of Demonic Toys, Puppet Master and Trancers 1. Back then, while special effects were not good, storytelling was . They made serious B movies for serious fans of B movies and horror, and this does not happen today with the new Full Moon Studios. I yearn for the good old days, and I really hope that Full Moon can come out of this terrible crisis they are in now. <br /> <br /> Trancers 6 gets a 2 out of 10.
