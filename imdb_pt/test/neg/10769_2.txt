I have read almost all the books and saw the musical production in two different languages. I absolutely adored everything I knew before. But lately I've run out of resources to support my fantasy. I still have some books, but they are in transit or the sequences I'm not in a hurry to read. Then an idea occurred to me - Sink me! There are movies I did not watch! So I must observe them immediately. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes of these series were ... acceptable. In fact, I quite liked the variation in the reason for the complaint, however different it seemed. It all came down from there, though. Chauvelin was very ... foppish? And, I dare say, too old for that role. It's not nearly that dark and dashing figure with its terrible ou-ou. (And what was that with the random scene in his bed?) It was very scary - was not it his only love for Madame Guillotine, and his only interest - his work and his only obsession - Sir Percy?) Marguerite ... The most beautiful woman in France? The smartest woman in Europe? I think not. Although, whatever it is that forces her into Sir Percy's study, I have no idea. And what did my lord Tony do to deserve this death? Yes, each member of the League gave his life to Sir Percy, but he would never have endangered any of them, nor fled like a coward when his dear friend faces mortal danger. And if by any means he had to mourn his mate, he would have done it, regret, not just move on as if nothing had happened. Which brings me to another point, Sir Percy. Your portrait was more terrible. He was not a lazy, or an indecent and elusive hero who is a master of transformations. He did not care much about ties (his pronunciation of the word only made my ears bleed) and with his own hands he never killed anyone. So what was it with him walking randomly and killing people? <br /> <br /> The costumes were very flashy for that period of time as well. This is the post-revolutionary France we are talking about! It is not pre-revolutionary. People in such dresses stand out easily in the crowd. It was all just ... gah! <br /> <br /> Although, I must admit, after seeing other parts, my opinion has changed a bit. Observing it as a separate work, independent of the Scarlet Pimpernel series, was tolerable. Just your average other hero in the mask. But from what they tried to get through, it's still miserable.
