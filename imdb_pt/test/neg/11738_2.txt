This is one of the stupidest ideas for a movie. Remake a classic shooting film. I hope no one tries this technique again. In 1998, "Good Will Hunting" director Gus Van Sant attempted to redo Hitchcock's classic Psycho in 1960, and failed miserably. What the hell Van Sant was thinking? This remake does not even come close to surpassing the original. The few changes that were made here did not help. If you want to see "Psycho", the choice is obvious. See the original. <br /> <br /> * (of four)
