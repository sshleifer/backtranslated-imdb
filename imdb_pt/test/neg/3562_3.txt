This movie tries to say something deep; I'm not sure what it was. Too much is not solved at the end so I find out the main point. Some scenes really make me wonder what's left on the cutting room floor. I do not think the wall was very well developed. I never understood what was really going on there. When the mother finally reveals it, I just could not make any connection to the boy's silence. What was the point of the boy not to speak? Was he just delirious or did he acquire some kind of power? What was the scene with the girl burned? Another power that the boy has or what? I do not understand how this developed any character or changed the plot. I have the little bully, but what happened to the dog? Did the dog come back or did the mother get rid of Fido for good in any way? <br /> <br /> There were several additional elements of the plot that were more confusing than the use. Like the radio talk show in the background discussing the Iraq War. I think this should create some sort of comparison to the pain and insecurity that Mother and Addison were experiencing, but to me that was distracting and tense. I did not buy the link very much. I also found the teacher getting into Addison about not saying "here" for the roll call a little too much. The mother seeing the doctor was useless, how did that serve the plot? Was this to show how desperate the mother was getting, or was it something about the remedy I did not get? Was the father coming back in the last scene, or just a guy? So, I wrote in the wall work? What happened to the dog?
