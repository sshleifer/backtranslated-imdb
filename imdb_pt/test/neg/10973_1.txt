Guy Pearce almost looks like Flynn, and this resemblance is the only one that this film can claim. Nowhere in Flynn's autobiography is the mention of the character Klaus Reicher, the homosexual encounter is speculative fiction, and the claims of the film that Flynn has treated the native work poorly are unfounded. Director Frank Howson made no memorable film, and I find it bad for him to slander Flynn to promote his normal career. <br /> <br />
