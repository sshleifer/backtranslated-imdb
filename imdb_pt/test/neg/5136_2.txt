This movie has good intentions, at least in the message "do not be afraid, no matter how difficult it may be. Fear will kill you in the end" It is a good message but the container is so defective that the message is crushed by bad acting , complete lack of credibility in feelings, dialogue that is delivered as if read aloud, stereotypes rather than breathing, people alive. <br /> <br /> Abuses of slow motion effects to compensate for a complete lack of credibility in acting and therefore lack of emotional strength ... <br /> <br /> The suicidal part of this still reminds me a low-budget movie of the 1990s when lesbians seemed to have (at least in celluloid) an absolute inability to live good, happy lives, and a tendency to be caught up in exaggerated dramas that often involved separation, death or imprisonment. If it had focused on the rewards of life according to how we felt it (and not according to how others think we should live it), it would have been less dramatic, more inspiring. But this does not happen, it focuses on pain, loss and leaves the message with only a theoretical ideal. <br /> <br /> I can not see how this movie can be an inspiration for anyone getting out or overcoming fear and rejection. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a really good movie that talks about overcoming fear and dare to live what you feel, return to the magnificent "Desert Hearts" (even better: read the novel!)
