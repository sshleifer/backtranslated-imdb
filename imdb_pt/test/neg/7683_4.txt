Well, "built" Doris Day (as Ethel S. "Dynamite" Jackson) is mistaken for thespian Ethel Barrymore, and falls in love with dancer Ray Bolger (as S. "Sam" Winthrop Putnam). Older Frenchman Claude Dauphin (as Philippe Fouquet) also digs Doris. Honestly?? What were they thinking? - This incredibly inappropriate musical features Mrs. Day beautifully singing the "April in Paris" pattern, and others. Certainly, there is nothing as good as his recordings at Columbia at the time; and nothing comes close to Day's dazzling and future "Secret Love." Although the material does not serve you well, it's good to see Mr. Bolger performing. Some of the musical numbers are unpleasant. <br /> <br /> April in Paris (12/24/52) David Butler ~ Doris Day, Ray Bolger, Claude Dauphin
