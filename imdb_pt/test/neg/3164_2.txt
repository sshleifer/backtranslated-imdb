This movie looks great, and it's about where my praise ends. "Love is a very splendorous thing" emerged in the very schizophrenic year of 1955, when colorful nonsense like this coexisted with an art fair on fire as "Kiss Me Deadly." As a trend toward smaller, socially conscious films such as "On the Waterfront" and "Marty" settled in the mid-1950s, other directors felt the need to maintain the undeniable melodrama that ranks so many other films of that decade, and "Love "is one of the last. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of 1950s film where Technicolor is accustomed to the max and the lighting is invariably high-key; even scenes that happen in a dark room or at night are brighter than the average sunny day. I never want to hear the theme song again, since it's played often enough throughout the movie to last a lifetime, and I certainly do not want to hear it sung by the strident and strident chorus that sings about the final titles . Jennifer Jones and William Holden are passable, but in fact anyone could have interpreted these parts. Jones' role is horribly written - his character is incredibly inconsistent, and it seems that whenever his character is forced to make a decision about something, the writers put a coin to decide what the decision would be. <br /> <br /> People will no doubt tell me that I am taking this film very seriously, that I am not romantic, and so on. But I loved "All That Heaven Allows," released the same year and just as cornball in its own way, except that Douglas Sirk is able to turn the melodrama into an art form, while Henry King (director of "Love") does not is. <br /> <br /> I am usually able to enjoy a bad melodrama, but in this case I was bored. . <br /> <br /> Grade: D +
