August 25, 2003 League of Extraordinary Lords: Sean Connery is one of the greatest of all time and I have been a fan of him since the 1950s. I went to this film because Sean Connery was the lead actor . I had not read reviews or had any prior knowledge of the film. The film surprised me a little. The scenery and sights were spectacular, but the plot was unreal to the point of being ridiculous. In my opinion, this was not one of your best movies, it could be the worst. Why he chose to be in this movie is a mystery. For me, going to this movie was a waste of my time. I will continue to go to your movies and add your movies to my video collection. But I can not see losing money to put this movie in my collection
