Last fall (2001), I did a film class that was given by the director of the film (Mark Hoeger). His vast knowledge of cinema, his ability to dissect any scene from a movie and his achievement of an Oscar in some obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than his independent film director. When he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just directed a movie called "Full Ride" and was in the post-production phase, my interest was aroused. However, this would be the last time I would hear about the film project. Until last week ... <br /> <br /> Last week, I saw on a TV list that "Full Ride" would appear on the WB network. This immediately lifted a red flag, since I can not help but associate WB with teen reality reality shows like Dawson's Creek, Charmed, etc. Also, the fact that Full Ride was going to be released directly to the TV was not very flattering by itself. . But nevertheless, I booked that time and sat down to watch the creation of my former film teacher. After two hours passed and the final credits began to roll, I thought hard about what I had just done. visa. What I just saw was a typical WB quality show, lasting two hours. In fact, it almost looked like this movie was made with the sole intention of only appearing on the WB network. Criticizing this movie will be basically like criticizing a typical WB show. <br /> <br /> Where to begin? The characters are superficial, the story is cliche in every sense of the word, the scenes are completely invented and the character development is forced and unbelievable. This movie just screams "unoriginal". <br /> <br /> The main character, Matt Sabo, is a hot shot on the wrong side of the tracks (literally) playing American football as a quarterback, but then fails. in a life of crime. He is then offered a chance for a full scholarship instead of going to jail. Obviously, without much choice, he agrees to play football with a star football team, but is no exception among his peers because of his poor team spirit and poor attitude. <br /> <br /> So come love. interest. Of course! Where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest? She comes in the form of Amy Lear (played by beautiful Meredith Monroe). She is actually a nice character, unlike the always abrasive Matt Sabo, so we almost cheer her up when she rejects him in the beginning. But, of course, the inevitable happens. She falls in love with him, changes his attitude toward everything, and everything looks good and happy. But now it's time for conflict! Earlier in the movie, Amy makes it clear to Matt that she does not want to score with him, because it would be "shameful" for her and her mother. This is much to Matt's dismay, and his soccer buddies (yes, they end up warming to him), who bet he would not get any. But, of course, Matt ends up accepting these terms and decides it's not all about nookie. This is where the exciting plot thickens. If you do not want me to spoil this surprise, then jump forward. <br /> <br /> Matt discovers that some local guys seemingly apparently Amy Lear tries to score with a face every year of the All-Star team so she can try to use it. (which is disconcerting in the first place) and get to the big city. Suddenly, realizing that he was used and that his love was a farce, Matt tried to return to a life of crime and leave the football field before the "big game." Amy tries to assure her that she was really in love this time, but he is too hot to buy it. So, what will Matt do? Will he take you back? Or is he going to steal gas stations again and be a complete idiot? I will not ruin the super-ultra-amazing end for you. <br /> <br /> So, if I somehow make you excited for this movie, please realize that this was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm. This movie is an uninspired version of 'Varsity Blues' or 'Summer Catch'. And that's not saying much. There's almost no comedy to save him and the characters are too shallow to worry about. So, what did you leave? Not much. <br /> <br /> What I disliked most about the movie was how much Hoeger painted from Nebraska through the film. It seems he was trying to capture the essence of Nebraska's rural life and adolescence in small towns, but his approach is very stereotypical and superficial. The characters' high hopes of making "the big city" and the actions they take to do this are very exaggerated, and this only further strengthens the stereotype that Nebraskans are a bunch of hunters living in farming communities. I'm not sure if Hoeger's intentions were good or not to put his home state in the limelight, but I think he ended up with a very shameful product. If Hoeger wanted to portray Nebraska in a favorable light, he should have taken a note or two from Alexander Payne. While Payne simply chooses to use Nebraska as a backdrop for his films, Hoeger integrates him into the Full Ride plot and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he's shooting that he ends up producing shallow garbage that seems to come from a movie. weird. If Hoeger really lived here, you would think he would know better than that. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'm completely disappointed with Hoeger's first major film, and hopefully next time he can combine knowledge with a bit of originality to create something different and thought-provoking.
