Oh yes, I admit that I blamed myself for the crime of seeing this piece of crap. I can not say I was forced by aliens who pointed a gun at my head, tied me to a chair and made it impossible to close my eyes and then turned this terrible excuse for a movie. No, I did it with free will. I deliberately tortured myself. Let's go through the fact here personally. "The acting is an insult to humanity. - The plot (if it exists) is ridiculous. - Character development is horrible - The characters that appear in the movie are so clich√© that you would recognize them in your regular comic book. - The edition is sloppy and unimaginative. - Camera work is low. "Dialogue is simply the worst in film history. - The direction: well, I bet it was not Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> So to add to these facts, there was absolutely no talent involved, so never. The director must be smoking now to forgive himself for inflicting that poison on the world. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The passport to Paris is one of the worst films ever made. PERMANENT!
