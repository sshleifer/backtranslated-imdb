This is a children's TV series about a Mary-Sue who is both petty and mean-spirited. I could not sit down with 3 episodes of Zoey101. Not to mention that Jamie Lynn Spears can not act to save her life! What message does this show bring to the children? If you're not perfect like Zoey, you're unworthy * rollseyes *. <br /> <br /> It's absurd how Zoey's character is exactly the kind of person who would be despised in real life, but she can become so popular. Then there's Chase who is basically a passionate puppy who loves the ground that Zoey follows. Then there is the fact that all the other characters seem to have been idiots in order to stop them from overshadowing Zoey. I'm sorry, but the characterization in this show = extremely unrealistic.
