Genre: Cartoon without dialogue, African girl and lion. Main characters: Inki, the lion and the minah bird. <br /> <br /> What happens: A lion wants to eat an African girl named Inki. There is also a very confusing Minah bird. Is he on Inki's side, or on the lion's side? <br /> <br /> Message: Erm ?? <br /> <br /> My Thoughts: I agree with Lee Eisenberg, this is kinda bad for the poor Africans !! :-( I like how the main character, Inki (who is an African girl) is a great main character, but they still portray her rudely and make a younger audience not like her very much just because she is HUNKING !! GRRR CHARLES M JONES !! I do not really like the lion and I think the minah bird is EVERYTHING RIGHT (I suppose) Personally I prefer the Looney Tunes cartoons of Charles M. Jones in the future. If you want to watch anyway, then I recommend the YouTube site, just type "Inki" into the main page space and you will be there. <br /> <br /> I wish Charles M. Jones had been nicer to Inki in this short, then there. <br /> <br /> Recommended for: People who are interested in old cartoons and / or people who are just playing on You Tube.
