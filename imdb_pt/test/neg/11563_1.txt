This movie is really bad. Most of it looks like it was filmed in a park or in a basement. There is a giant spider, but all we see is a leg. There are some worms that live in a cave that are just cheap puppets with cardboard teeth. And the plot is a pack of post-apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that makes no sense at all. The whole thing is laughable.
