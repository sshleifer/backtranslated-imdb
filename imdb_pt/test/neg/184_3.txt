This movie is not like the City of God, you may have the same feeling, but it is not, there are no intense scenes of shots or scenes of intense drugs, you get the idea. If you ask me, I think this movie was a waste of time, there are many other films that give 100 times more meaning and teaching than "Wooden Camera". Yes, I may be the one to give a negative comment to this movie, but it's just in my opinion. It's one of those movies where I may have the feeling that I'll be impressed, but when the credits start appearing, my friends and I all give each other mutual looks, and we all laugh at how ridiculous that movie was. So to conclude this matter, I advise you not to observe it. <br /> <br /> Personal note - Making Africans speak English was a big mistake. In the City of God they used their native language, which gave the film much more power and reality.
