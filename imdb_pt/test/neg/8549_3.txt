Despite having an absolutely horrible script (more on that later), this movie is still loosely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors, Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. In addition to one or two REAL stinkers, I probably watch anything with them in the movie, since I'm a big fan of Hollywood's golden age in the 1930s and 40s. However, no matter how much I love their movies, they do not I can recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Fonda and Stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort. The two have not met yet, but the film starts noisily and unpleasantly with a scene in which Fonda moves terribly while skiing. It was made so incontestably and made my teeth grind, but I held out - especially when Fonda fell on a snowbank and that stopped the yodeling !! In retrospect, maybe I should have turned it off! Fonda is eliminated in the fall and Barbara asks for help. Back at the ski chalet, he looks fine, but fortunately she is also a doctor and has x-ray and nurses him back to health. He, in turn, falls in love with her and proposes to her. Although they hardly know each other, they get married and so far the film looks like a sweet but very light romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Once at home though, everything is not pink when she returns to her job. a family doctor and he begins to show signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man because of his jealousy. The film touches everything to laugh at, but frankly Fonda's behaviors were truly scary - spying on her and her patients, attacking or threatening ANY man she treats, tripping over a patient who already has a back injury and stomping on a surprise party and insisting that everyone there (men and women) are out to steal his wife. It comes out as a combination of a sociopathic and paranoid schizophrenic, but everything should be for laughs. Since he seems to be a dangerous nutcase, you'd think Stanwyck would ask for a cancellation along with a restraining order! Strangely enough, she gets mad, but can not get mad at Fonda because he's so ........? I can not think of the right word - "scary" is all that comes to my mind !!! Later, out of nowhere, the multimillionaire Fonda gets a job working at the counter of a department store. So through magical thinking, he and Babs seem to take on their hostility and violent jealousy is all a thing of the past - so a job apparently heals anger and suspicion. When that job ends, the movie ends with Fonda buying her own hospital, giving Barbara a job there and they live happily ever after. They do not go any further with the story, but I assume based on Fonda's character that he spent most of his time as a hospital administrator beating up all male patients. <br /> <br /> The first part in skiing The accommodation and the next do NOT fit well, nor the final inspired section of "Horatio Alger" where the rich boy did well in the business world. They were like three separate installments, but in spite of that, the most serious problem with the film was its apparent excuse to ward off domestic violence and delusional jealousy! What a scary little movie! Thank God, neither Fonda nor Stanwyck are known for this yechy movie, but for all their other lovely films.
