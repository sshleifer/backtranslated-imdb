Wicked Little Things (known in Australia as "Zombies") is a rare find ?? a movie that promises one thing but delivers another. It is one of the few such films to be produced by Millennium Pictures, a European film studio known for making several action films and category B thrillers, some with action star Jean-Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> Karen Tunny and her two daughters, Sarah and Emma, ​​arrive in Addytown, Pennsylvania, to move to a large house that Karen's late husband owned after discovering action of a miner in its effects. After arriving, they think the house is very old and in need of repairs. But the condition of the house is the least of their problems, as they discover that the area is prone to disappearances and Karen is confronted by the owner of the area and ordered to leave. Once the night falls, the Tunnys discover the reason behind the disappearances: a group of zombie children, killed in a mine collapse in the area more than 85 years ago, go out to kill anything that goes into the forest. With the help of a gray-haired neighbor, Karen tries to end the curse before she and her children become the next victims. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD expecting a movie with flesh-eating zombies, but I was disappointed by One thing: the movie is more like a ghost story than with your zombie movie, with the dead children being the embodiment of a curse that haunts the forest, taking revenge on anything that moves at night (though the inner logic is a bit flawed - children can only be appeased by the sacrifice of animals and are repelled by blood wings on the doors just as vampires are repelled by garlic and mirrors - should not these children be zombies?). The plot as such would not be a problem and would be really fun, but the main problem is that the producers have adapted a script with the intention of making a zombie movie, only to fall face to face with that effort. As such, a movie like this would be just like a ghost story, but because of a poor script it becomes nothing more than a totally routine endeavor. The film's greatest strength is acting, with the cast giving better performances than the film deserves. Of special note is Scout Taylor-Compton, who plays her role very well? It's a shame that she spoils her genre with a very poor performance in HALLOWEEN's remake (or maybe it's just Rob Zombie's screenplay).
