OK, it's a historical movie that caused a bustle, shocked people and was banned. I'm going to give it, and that's why I gave a 3 instead of a 1. It may have been ahead of the times, but it certainly is way behind the times now. I am a big fan of Salvador Dali and I loved Un Chien Andalou. This short was captivating with one creative scene after another. L'age d'Or was too long and monotonous - just a pompous film production created simply as a fragile attempt to overcome Un Chien Andalou by creating a complete film (and blatantly leverage Dali's film). name and fame, although he had little to do with it). Total garbage, except for some (very) shots of "shocking scenes" separated by long periods of non-action boring. A waste of time and money. Both my thumbs are down. It goes to my shelf to never be seen again.
