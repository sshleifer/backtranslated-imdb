I can not emphasize this enough, DO NOT * take this movie to the kids. <br /> <br /> By the way, it's best to save the adults too. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe I'm overreacting a little. This is not the worst kid movie ... no, let me rephrase that. This is not the worst movie made by disillusioned adults for disillusioned adults and somehow marketed to kids (that would be "Jack", which I intend to review / gut like a fish). <br /> <br /> Adults will not learn anything amazing (well, if you need to, fast-forward to before the final credits for a Little Educational about an Interesting Cosmic Phenomenon). We usually do not do as adults what we wanted to do when kids like reality tend to get in the way. Well, duh, I could have told you that (then you can have four years of college in an art school, but I degrading). <br /> <br /> I have no idea what kids could get out of this movie. . This is most likely to disturb them (we can see the time when Russ was traumatized at age eight). There's a better movie, "Kiki's Delivery Service," which essentially has the same message but deals with it instead of putting it in your head. And the adults will like it too! <br /> <br /> By the way, there is a moment in the movie made with the MST3Kers youngsters in mind, if they think of those OTHER Bruce Willis with a sad child in it.
