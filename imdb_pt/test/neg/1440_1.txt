The most useless movie of the decade. The responsible parties should never be allowed to shoot again. I have no words to describe the lack of entertainment that this movie offers. You could not pay me to watch this movie again. Honestly, I think you'd be a better person if you had not. If I called it offensive, I would fall into a category of emotionally fragile extremists. I would say that this film goes so far as to ruin the industry. There are movies that I refuse to watch, now that I feel like they can be so tasteless. I feel like an idiot that I did not have the good sense to leave during any of the many times when I was forced to do so. Yes, I have seen the end and I am ashamed of it, like anyone else, including the writer. I'm amazed ...
