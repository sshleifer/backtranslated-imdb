I have to say that this movie was really awful. the performance was average, the rhythm of the movie was terrible, as were the soundtrack and cinematography. I found that I was bored for most of the movie and that the clich√©d lines did nothing for me. the two boys who played the lead roles looked terrible at times and did not take the emotion that was needed in the movie. the girl was sometimes creepy and looked like a doll that was scary. the ending was not satisfactory, although the film was over did not make me feel anything for the characters. this movie was annoying and did nothing for me, I recommend this movie to anyone.
