An interesting picec from the period showing us what was incredible in 1938. Wow, Ma, a fake accident ring suing $ 25,000 !!! I think projected in the 21st century would be a lot of money. The performance would be a pure ham of the 21st century. It's good to see the president as a newcomer hardworking.
