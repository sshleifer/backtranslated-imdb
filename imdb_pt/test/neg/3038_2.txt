The original WASC is by no means an obligatory film in the genre. In fact, if it were not for his first 25 minutes, there would be no logical reason to watch it. The remake takes these 25 minutes and turns them into a mediocre 85 minute horror film. <br /> <br /> Now, I have nothing against PG-13 horror movies, but the trend around them is getting lame. When you see the PG-13 rating you expect a movie full of false holds, teen t.v. or music stars and a storyline that has been used over and over again. Do not even ask for violence or violence. <br /> <br /> I know it is not correct to compare both the original WASC and the remake, but I think it is necessary to do so because the whole idea of ​​the new is based on the beginning of the original. The tension that is felt through the first film is not present at all in the remake. Not even with the incredible settings or great use of rays. No tension, suspense, emotion ... nothing. The movie goes very slowly before it gets a bit "interesting", and that's where the stranger appears. The chase sequence is probably the best part of the movie, because at least there is a sense of "what will happen next?". But that's it. The situations they set for the climax are predictable, boring and lacking in suspense. The original has merit by having suspense in the most important scenes, and also by a chilling climax to the most important scene of the film. <br /> <br /> Now, I understand that this is a PG-13 horror movie, but if you respect the original. Why is changing the most important situation? Children should not survive! After the finale, I felt that this movie made no sense. So the nanny was playing cat and mouse with a madman ... is that it? So the sequence at the hospital was just plain stupid. And worst of all, it means that a sequel may be on the way. <br /> <br /> Camila Belle is the best thing in the movie. It offers beautiful and convincing performance. She needs to choose better projects, although this role can benefit her thousands of teenage fans. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie. Some people say that to support the Horror genre, we should support any movie that comes out. I do not need to agree. If we ignore films like WASC, horror movie producers will understand that we will not accept CRAP. We want good horror movies, not fake movies full of fake scares. <br /> <br /> Watch the original "When A Stranger Calls" instead, because the first 25 minutes are BETTER than the entire remake (meaningless).
