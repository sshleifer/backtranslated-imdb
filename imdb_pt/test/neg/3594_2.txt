"Threat" is not funny. He tries hard - very hard. but rarely brings a smile. There is no acting, just assault. One of the main characters uses a stupid grimace on his face the whole movie. No doubt, as the less talented Wayans brothers starred, wrote and produced the film, they were totally blind to their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> Threat consists of a series of skits no joke. The punchline can be seen a mile away, but you have to wait until it all unfolds. There are no short sentences or sulky dialogue here. Just one scene after another building the joke. The jokes themselves are juveniles. Loc Dog (the one with the grimace of perma) talks to a beautiful woman - but then she has ... bad breath and then she picks up her nose and then, wait for her (remember you should always w-a-i-t) she fart! How funny is that? Ten-year-old boys might find this funny, since they would not have heard the jokes so many times before. Alternatively, if you enjoy watching movies completely drunk or stoned then you will be able to accompany them and even find it fun. The challenge will be getting drunk enough to reduce your mental state to the film level without fainting.
