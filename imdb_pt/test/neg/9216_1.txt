I remember seeing it years ago. He had a reasonably promising start with an interesting premise, but then degenerated into nonsense quickly. Uninteresting characters, failed attempts to add drama and tension, and a bit of simplistic philosophy, all culminating in a terrible ending. <br /> <br /> It's just rubbish. <br /> <br /> Before watching this movie, I thought that I would never have a movie that I thought was the "worst" I had ever seen, but after I finished watching it, I knew that from that moment if someone asked me what was the worst movie I've ever seen, I could say without hesitation - "The Second Coming". <br /> <br /> Avoid.
