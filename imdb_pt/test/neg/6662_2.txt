I understand the draw and call for such a different kind of movie and I'm a big fan of movies with little dialogue, but all of this is absolutely terrible. I went to the Scottish Highlands and found the lack of Scottish accents in the disappointing characters. This plot was strong enough in theory, but cheap sets and the lack of a single realistic character prevented this movie from getting off the ground. I feel that using the silence to create the atmosphere only works when you have actors who can exhale some kind of presence without speaking and these actors certainly can not. If you want a silent movie that captures that presence, try (Le Dernier Combat). There have been very few movies that I could not even finish and this was one of them. Absolute dribble!
