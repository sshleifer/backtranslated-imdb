Walking around in bootlegs, I sometimes thought of an urban comic legend, the first FF movie is as bad as everyone fears. I think Marvel Comics now pretends it does not exist, which with the 2005 version came out in theaters earlier this year. But it's out there, a reminder and the last of the first wave of bad and low budget Marvel superhero adaptations (Captain America, Punisher, most TV movies). 'Low budget' is a very easy description for this FF photo. Due basically to lack of funds, showing the powers of the super foursome was limited to very fast shots (Mr.Fantastic), almost-animation (Torch), and disappears (Invisible Girl, the easiest to do). The Thing costume was not bad and probably half the budget; the part of the face was especially almost convincing. The acting? Alex Hyde-White as Reed is very good; the other 3 are good, although John as Johnny sometimes acts to show his "fiery" temperament. The dialogue is comic book style, and it's the support cast that gets in the way of making it work. Dr. Doom is very melodramatic and without comedic intent, and his two main henchmen are a case study on how not to act or write dialogues. <br /> <br /> The plot? Not very good. It was quite true to the FF's origin story (more than the later big budget version), and even though the non-budget, once again restricted by showing, for example, forced landing, it kept the essential ingredients of how they have discovered their powers in an isolated area - it's the best part of the picture, but you have to wait an entire half hour for that. I also found the music strange in some places; when the 4 are bathed in those cosmic rays, a kind of church choir is heard, as if it were a religious experience. The rest, however, is hopeless. Even without budget, the story could have been made without the character Jeweler (similar to the villain of the Mole Man books); Spends a lot of time with him and his clandestine gang, as does the blind Alicia. These sections are a waste of celluloid and very annoying. The climactic fight with Doom and his men starts well, but degenerates into a terrible mess as the torch fires a laser beam (cool animation, but a cartoon). Fans can revel in the negative effects of FF FX and mindless history if they do not get depressed and outraged first.
