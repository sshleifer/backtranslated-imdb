Feeling Minnesota, directed by Steven Baigelmann and starring Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio: The tense relationship between two brothers, Sam (D'Onofrio) and Jjaks (Reeves), is pushed to the breaking point when Jjaks arrives to Sam's wedding and flees with the bride, Freddie (Diaz), a former stripper, marrying Sam to pay a gambling debt due to the owner of the Red nightclub. Baigelman's writing and debut is a frustrating mess, filled with characters of hatred and lack of coherence. Putting Keanu and Diaz in the same film should at least provide some eyeshadows, but Baigelman even protects himself, leaving reluctant actors with little positive effect. Very poor.
