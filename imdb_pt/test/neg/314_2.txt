Jack-O (1995) was a very bad movie, we're talking snoozefest x 100, no entertainment value, no budget, no blood, Z-grid actors etc etc, this movie was a terrible addition to the horror film industry and shouldn were not made !!! The only reason I bought this movie was because I knew Linnea Quigley was in it, and sure enough, she does her obligatory naked shower scene, which is lovely yes. <br /> <br /> But as for the movie itself .. ...... I fell asleep on the stage for 40 minutes and had absolutely no desire to finish it, it's just lame bigtime OK. <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, I'm an avid fan, a MASSIVE fan, I love low budget horrors, I love all of this, but I hated this crap, so I guess this will tell you everything you need to know about "JACK-O". <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2/10, the "2" is for the 2-minute shower scene Linnea, the movie itself is a ZERO total !!!!
