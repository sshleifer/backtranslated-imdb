It's not a terrible movie ... But there are scenes of monsters where you're going to roll on the floor laughing - which is not good for an action / suspense. The acting is generally pretty decent for a science fiction movie film. Barry Corbin plays a credible US senator, and Lou Diamond Phillips again gives us a decent military / police / sheriff / agent / marshal figure. The special effects are very "special" - for example, the external train shots are very obviously a model train. <br /> <br /> Goofs: A meteor hits a car stopped in the opening scene. The car explodes in flames but does not move an inch. After the impact, the meteor is lodged at the top of the car's hood - impossible from the low angle the meteor came to. <br /> <br /> Spoilers ... <br /> <br /> part of the film's events are predictable, from the helicopter crash (Pull up, pull up!), to the fact that the boring people get, in the end, the classic bridge over a 1000-foot ravine waiting for the train, to the sequel-set at the end. <br /> <br /> The scenes showing the aliens attacking are hilarious. They are cute fluffy dolls and move at the speed of light - remember the Monty Python rabbit? Goof Spoiler: In one scene, four people shooting clip after clip can not hit a single creature because they move at the speed of light. Later in the film, Todd Bridges launches a mini-flamethrower, which he uses to dispatch various creatures at close range. On several occasions, Lou Diamond Phillips is able to easily catch creatures with his own hands.
