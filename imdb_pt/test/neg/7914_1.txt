This movie is very scary with scenes in which the Devil uses Gabriels' horn to open Heaven and take out the good angel dogs and imprison them in Alkatraz. The devil sings and dances for some songs about the joys of being bad, and at one point, eats a live rat. <br /> <br /> We have this movie free with a pizza. You get what you pay for.
