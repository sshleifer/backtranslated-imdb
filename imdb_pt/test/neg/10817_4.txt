Some scientific people descend into a cave for some reason and there is some kind of creature that is killing them. <br /> <br /> I usually give a more detailed plot, but I was not paying much attention to it. Overall, it was annoying and the only time you'll actually be paying attention is during the action scenes, which the director did wonderfully. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, but the characters are so boring and unforgettable. They blend into your mind. You will forget who lived and who died for 2 reasons: 1. The deaths are annoying 2. The characters are boring. <br /> <br /> The ending may have shocked me more if I knew who it was who. <BR> <BR> So you're looking for a movie of creatures in the cave? Check out the descent instead.
