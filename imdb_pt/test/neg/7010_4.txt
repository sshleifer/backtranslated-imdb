*** SPOILERS *** A hot and sexy Linda Blair as Witch Amelia Reynolds is very upset with her friend and rival Witch across town Erica Barens, Julie Strain. Amelia having her husband Hal, Edward Albert, promoted in her work at the Giger & Greengrass law firm on the most meritorious Larry Barnes, Larry Poindexter, who happens to be married to Erica, has a spell on Hal causing him to lose control your car and end up almost killing yourself. Larry discovering about Erica's attempt at the life of her best friend Larry has a violent fight with her causing Erica to fall from the balcony to death. It's when Larry returns to his ex-wife Carol, Rochelle Sanson, that things start to heat up, emotionally and sexually. The evil Amelia tries to get Erica's dead spirit to take over Carol's body and end up killing Larry, whom she considers responsible for her husband, who wounded him, who left him permanently confined to a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> There is not much of a story but a lot of cheese and soft core with poor Larry being manipulated by Amelia through the resurrection of Erica who plans to kill him the first chance he turns his back on her. Amelia is a little tired of not knowing exactly who she is and who is not a threat to her. Amelia even picks up her poor, innocent gardener Stan, Michael Parks, to first lose her family in a bloody invasion of houses, then her mind, for being accused by the police as the killer, and finally is life, being attacked by Love yourself. How it's made to run to the Reynolds house, under his control, as crazy as a hatter trying to kill her and the crippled Hal. Larry Parks looked and acted so strange that you had the feeling that he accidentally entered the set of "Sorceress" and ended up being part of the cast playing the part of Stan. Without the help or benefit of a screenplay, he improvised his way and then slowly realized just how horrible the movie really is. Stan being killed early in the movie was a big plus for him since he did not have to suffer, as those of us watching through the whole mindless and numbing movie. <br /> <br /> It becomes apparent to you, as well as to the creators of "Sorceress," that all this shenanigan is on the screen has to come to some sort of hopeful and successful conclusion, and an end to trick is put to finally finish the movie. The ending is the best, in addition to Miss Blair and the rest of the cast very well endowed, what can be said about the film.
