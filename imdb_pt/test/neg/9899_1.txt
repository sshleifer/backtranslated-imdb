There have been some great television movies in the past. Epics such as "Roots" and "Lonesome Dove" come to mind. Category 6: Day of Destruction will not be remembered for promoting the cause of movies made for TV. A ridiculously bad story, surpassed only by the horrible script, Cat6DD, as I like to call it, inspires more sympathy for the actors involved than the horror in nature that the film should bring. The sound you hear during the movie should be the sound of the wind, but in fact are the careers of Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy and Thomas Gibson (Greg, Dharma and Greg duo) falling faster than houses and trucks and cows can fly away from one of the 15 tornadoes we see in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The movie was billed as "crazed nature," instead, we have an idiotic story about how 15 different climate systems conspired to produce 150-day days in Chicago, then a blizzard the next day from a hurricane that was in the Gulf of Mexico. with a Canadian storm system, but actually had its origins in a jet altered by global warming .... enough !! No matter what the story was, the acting was terrible, the words the actors said were stupid, and 13 scientists across the country had coronaries after hearing the dribble that came out of the film. I did not care what happened to any of the characters, the special effects were insignificant, even to the standards made for TV, and the story lines were useless. All in all, I really do not like this "TV event".
