This is basically just an idiotic pursuit story, almost identical to zillions of other chase stories in terms of acting, suspense, plot, dialogue, characterization (or lack thereof) and rhythm. <br /> <br /> The only area in which 'The Net' diverges from traditional chase movies is in their subject matter: Computers. Unfortunately, the writers clearly did not understand the differences between a pocket calculator and a Cray! <br /> <br /> Computer novices should not watch this movie because it would make them paranoid about computers. No matter what Hollywood tries to tell us, it is not so easy to erase someone's identity through hackers. There is still a lot of paper documentation in the world, and there was still more in 1995. <br /> <br /> Computer professionals should also not watch this movie. I mean, a magic virus that can melt your entire PC when you press "Escape"? Please. And all the virus, including the cool multimedia effects of your screen dissolving (what's this?) Can it fit on a single 1.44mb floppy? Yeah ... whatever.
