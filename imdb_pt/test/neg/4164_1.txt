The film disappointed me for many reasons: first, the representation of a future that at first seemed realistic to me was well built, but only had a marginal role. So the story itself was a faint copy of Lost in Translation. The Middle East scene, the man with the family knows the new girl abroad, karaoke, camera movements and images - all of which was a terrible imitation of the excellent Lost in Translation, which also had credibility. This movie tries to be something brilliant and cultural: it is not. I wonder why Tim Robbins ever thought of making this movie! The female lead actress is horrible - she played the precog in Minority Report? And why do you have to show the vagina in a movie like that? Lost in Translation did not have to show excessive love scenes. R-Rated just for this? This movie is not worth watching from a videostore!
