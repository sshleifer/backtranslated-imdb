I agreed to watch this movie with a group of friends, despite my extreme dislike of horror movies. However, it was not the shock of a monster that discouraged me from this movie, it was the horrendous end of acting and absolutely disgusting. Inside, or the Cave, it has no redeeming qualities - it is poorly made, ridiculously scripted, disgustingly bloody, and the inclusion of the final free scene repels me. No, it's not my dislike for horror movies that make me hate this movie - I've seen such wonderful teen horrors like "House of Wax", it's the fact that the movie leaves you with the terrible realization that when renting the video , you are supporting the creators from within
