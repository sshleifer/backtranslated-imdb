I have not seen many movies worse than this. The plot, the dialogues, the acting: it's horror! The story jumps from a to b and without logical steps in the middle. Every time you think you've lost something, but no: that's how it should be. And why the hell does the character Jenny Garth portray so in love with that guy without a loser (who actually plays the movie Cinderella Man with Russel Crow!)? Well, it's not Spielberg, of course ... I have to write ten lines to post. This movie really is not inspiring enough to write 10 lines! It's a romantic feel good movie with a bad story, so if you're ready for this: you'll get a ball.
