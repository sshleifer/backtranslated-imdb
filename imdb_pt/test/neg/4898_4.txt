The brilliant Australian genius of the comic books Barry Humphries had a rare failure with this irregular and occasionally nasty comedy, which was withdrawn from launch in a few days. The dracken, the perverse Australian diplomat Sir Les Patterson accidentally sets fire to an Arab potentate at the UN and is sent to his small country as punishment, arriving just as a palatial coup puts a new leader (American soap star Thaao Penghlis) on the throne . Sir Les, with the reluctant help of Dame Edna Everage (both interpreted by Humphries), almost accidentally spoils a scheme of the new leader to release a deadly, disgusting and AIDS-like virus in the Western world. Joan Rivers has a tip as the president of the United States, her reading board reading "President Rivers"! Extreme bad taste blends with antics and the usual blunt satire of Humphries in a movie that is nicer in its many funny parts than taken together. Dame Edna's TV fans may be intrigued by the presence of a different Madge Allsop, unfortunately, the one who does not have the wonderful magic comedy of Emily Perry on paper. The film was written by Humphries and his third wife, Diane Millstead, and directed by Mad Max himself, George Miller. To Humphries die-hard fans like me, essential. Everyone else, careful.
