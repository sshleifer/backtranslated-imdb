I just can not understand how any fan of the Who, or just anyone, could find this horrible, lazy and poorly written abomination, even remotely funny. It is so embarrassingly below that it qualifies as a real tragedy. The potential for this was enormous, it could have been great. What a shame that all that acting talent, the scenery, the props, the goodwill of everyone involved was so pathetically wasted by a script that should have been burned. <br /> <br /> There is an obvious lack of any rigorous production. and quality control here. Like those Hollywood movies (mad mad mad world, casino royale), where the stars are just attacking each other and "having a great time", which basically means taking a check to do nothing. <br /> <br /> could have written better who sent me in my sleep. Actually I have, although awake. I did it in year 10 in high school and did it with a lot of classmates. It was better, I look now and the jokes are funnier. Steven Moffat YOU ARE NOT A BUM OF TALENTS! What a waste, what a wasted opportunity. It makes me want to cry ....
