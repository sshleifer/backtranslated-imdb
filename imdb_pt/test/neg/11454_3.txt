Like a lot of movies from the earliest days of sounds, Cimarron should be seen more by historical interest than as attractive entertainment. The performance of leader Richard Dix, nominated for best actor, may be excused as a relic of the silent film acting school. However, even giving benefits of doubt, Cimarron is a poorly shaped piece of drama - a bloated movie that moves from sequence unrelated to unrelated sequence with little dramatic impact. Officially, the film is two hours and four minutes; It seems like four hours when you're watching. There is no reason to waste your time on this unless you want to see all the winners of Best Movie or take a keen interest in the early days of sound. In my opinion, Cimarron is the worst choice for the best picture in Academy history and the award should have been for City Lights or Little Ceasar. Cimarron is little remembered today, and would have been remembered at all were it not for his Oscar win.
