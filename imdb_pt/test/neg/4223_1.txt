"The Danish Bladerunner" is boldly stated in the box. Are you kidding me?! This movie is a complete drag. When I'm thirsty and have a soda in the kitchen, I usually pause the VCR so I do not miss anything. Not this time. I actually found myself looking long and hard in the refrigerator, just so I did not have to go back. Why the hell is not there a science fiction writer out there who has a clue how computers work? It is incomprehensible. One of the premise of the film is that our hero (who is a hacker) has a little computer assistant to help him (the clip of Microsoft Office finally caught up in the future). When he loses the assistant in the movie, he is helpless and can not get on any computer. He's a hacker! It's like saying you can not drive your car if you do not have your "driving cap" in luck. I will not even get into the lightning effect when he gets an electric shock ...
