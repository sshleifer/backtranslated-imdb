I just saw this movie and it turns out to be pretty ridiculous, as mentioned by other user comments and the only thing that bothered me most was the southern accent that some of the characters had, it happened in Wisconsin, not in the south. As mentioned in other reviews, Ed Geine was not a big guy, so why does the guy who plays Jason and Leatherface portray him? <br /> <br /> I've moved forward a lot of the time being that there are many slow parts. <br /> <br /> I hope someone does their homework in Ed Geine and in town and make a more accurate film
