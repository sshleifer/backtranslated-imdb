Okay, for starters, this movie was not like the book. I read the book when I was 13 and since then it has always been my favorite. When I'm waiting for a different book to come out, this is the book I come back to fill the time. I have 3 copies for God's sake. Anyway, I knew this was not going to be anything like the book, but come on! They could have done a little better than that. I mean seriously if I wanted to watch American werewolves in Paris or London than watch these movies. They made a perfectly good story and turned it into a copy of a story that was told repeatedly and frankly I'm tired of watching it. I mean, hello, the best part of the whole story is that it ends with Gabriel. He does not die. What was that? And he's old in this movie. Gabriel should have been only 24, not 44. Awww And Astrid whom he ** got the idea of ​​Astrid being Vivian's aunt no no no no no. Astrid and Vivian hate each other. Awwww. Anyway, yeah, that was my little serious speech. I hope this has helped.
