I was all set to hate it, but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable - although the MTV style of making movies (shot in DV for starters) is a sore eye! I liked the script's self-mocking style as well as its central idea of ​​having the female vampire duo as a hired killer. As for the cast, Eileen Daly (better known as the "star" of those hideous intros "Redemption") has an undeniable presence on screen - and is quite sexy, despite her age; however, Christopher Adamson's boss villain is unpleasant. David Warbeck has a brief medical role (dubbed "The Horror-Movie Man!"), Which conducts autopsy on one of the vampire's victims; the film seems to have taken a long time to film when Warbeck died in 1997! There is a lot of nudity and violence in the hand, but it does not make much sense (especially since its sub-plot involving a secret vampire society infiltrating power structures is underdeveloped); the film is also long for its purpose and eventually gets bored during the last half hour.
