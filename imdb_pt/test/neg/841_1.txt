Okay, so one night I and some friends decided to get really stuck and watch a movie. Unfortunately for us, we chose 'Ernest Goes to Africa'. I've never laughed so much in my life. This movie is beyond evil. I literally made better films than 'Ernest Goes to Africa'. (I poop movies) <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film, at least for me, was the opening sequence when Ernest is making faces. When they showed it with a head the size of a peanut, I lost it. Maybe I found it so funny because at that moment I was the tallest. Maybe you're right. <br /> <br /> If I had to guess what would be George W. Bush's favorite movie, I would say 'Ernest Goes to Africa'. Never before have I seen a film relying more on the stereotypes of people of color of 1950. There were times when words escaped me and I just looked with admiration. <br /> <br /> As I was watching this, I could not help but wonder, is this movie for children? Do literate adults actually watch this? How could there be a whole franchise of 'Ernest' movies? Is this really my life? This is real? <br /> <br /> I hated this movie.
