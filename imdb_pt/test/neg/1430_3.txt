Dee Snider is the villain in this movie and his bad acting and exaggerating kind of ruined me. The whole movie seemed to take itself very seriously. He tries to reach the somber atmosphere of "Seven" without the good performance. The film highlights the subculture of urban industrial rock / tattoo / body art and expects us to be impressed (scared?) By the size of the piercing on a guy's nose. I'm not a movie expert, but the script and acting in that movie is terrible. Dee Snider looks like part of the villain, but his way is totally horrible. I recommend not to waste time with this unless nothing else is available.
