Terrible adaptation of Heminway's discreet love story. An American soldier (Rock Hudson) falls in love with a British nurse (Jennifer Jones) in Italy during World War I. What's wrong with that? Pretty much everything. Hudson is out of his depth here. He could be a good actor, but not in this movie. Jones is too old for her role (she's 21 in the book - she's 38 here ... and it looks!). Also his performance oscillated between exaggerated and badly spent! They picked up a simple and unobtrusive love story and blew it all out of proportion. The film is fatally long (just over 150 minutes), self-indulgent and padded to a ridiculous degree. It seems that producer David O. Selznick thought he was doing "And the Wind Took" again. Some of the landscapes are really impressive (even on a small TV screen), but there is not enough history to match the pictures. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! The end at which Jones dies is supposed to be tragic, but the bad acting and exaggerated theatricality made me struggle not to laugh! <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the actor Vittorio De Sica excels to a degree really embarrassing. Exaggerated, self-indulgent, poorly shaped and slow. Very terrible. This was (understandably) a financial and critical bomb and ended Selznick's career as a producer. You may want to tune in some of the scenery in the end, but it really is not worth it. I give it to 3.
