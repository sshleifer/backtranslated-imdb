... out of this movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry to say, this was exhibited at the Cleveland International Film Festival. Our copy had no subtitles, so I asked the Festival staff if there was any problem with the impression received. "It's not like that ..." I was told. "The director wants it that way." <br /> <br /> Once again, I regret to say that my French level is only elective in high school (for over three decades). Much of the initial dialogue is in French, so I'm sure I missed the nuance and many details between my understanding of some keywords. <br /> <br /> I rated this as a "1" mainly because of the irony of a director who has worked making subtitles by refusing to put subtitles in a movie to be seen by an American audience. Excuse me, even though most Americans did not know where Europe was on the map, not even a movie festival audience should know the "native language" of a given film. Even though some of us do not know Finnish, I would still expect subtitles for the few "idiots" who are not sophisticated enough to have experience in the 37 different languages ​​presented. I will bear this ego of David Lynch, not Litvack.
