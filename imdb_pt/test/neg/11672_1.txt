Every time I see this movie, I get the same impression: some parts are so incredibly stupid / bad that they drive me crazy, they are not intentional, and there are many of them; the rest is simply bad, stupid and / or irrelevant. A film like Evil Dead gets credit for being bad on its own because it's the intended result - it's stupid and tacky because Sam Raimi succeeded in what he was trying to do. This movie does not have that excuse, it's stupid and tacky because the filmmakers have failed so miserably. The result of crap builds up on crap and crap performances, to make it a shame that the lowest note a movie can give is one for "horrible". Watching this movie has the same effect as listening to an essay by Billy Madison - "Everyone in this room is dumber now because I overheard this." I should be able to give this film something around -5.
