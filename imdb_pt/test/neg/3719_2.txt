If this movie becomes a festive tradition, I will have to hide at Christmas for the rest of my life. How would you compare this to 'A Wonderful Life'! It was absolutely awful! The singing boy made my fingers curl. And what the hell was the deal with his hair? Performance worthy of Emmy?! Please. Granted, Lucci did OK but an Emmy ????? I think this movie is a waste of money. The fact that they got so close to the original story, pretending to give a modern twist and retro, made it even worse. There was lack of enthusiasm and persistence in all accounts. Lighting, wardrobe, makeup, it seemed like everyone wanted to go home. Just a big NO of me.
