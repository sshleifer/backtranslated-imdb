Dead Mantis will certainly not scare anyone, but as science-fiction programmers, it's better than most. A volcanic eruption on the south pole thaws a prehistoric, prehistoric mantis on the north pole. Military disappear. Dr. Ned (William Hopper - son of Hedda Hopper and better known as Paul Drake on TV show PERRY MASON) is called for i.d. the creature - but by that time the creature has already devoured several Eskimos and is on its way to the Washington Monument. <br /> <br /> About a third or more of the movie consists of movies: educational films of the old government, military in radar rooms, airplanes - and would you believe the Eskimos would go out to sea? Which explains, of course, why an Eskimo tribe is attacked in the film. ("Hey guys, do you think we can work on it?") Mix some insignificant special effects, some awkward dialogue, and some sexist attitudes, and you're good to go. Not so original as THE MONSTER THAT HAS CHALLENGED THE WORLD, but the big bug fans of the 50's will have fun - and the kids will have fun throwing popcorn on the screen. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer
