On a flight back from London, I saw She is the man; apparently Air Canada has a bad movie policy. Maybe that's not the best way to start a review of this movie. Amanda Bynes plays a girl who loves football so much that she pretends to be her twin brother to form a team at a boarding school in the city. Even if you check your mind at the door (on a 6 hour flight you have to), the story is implausible and ridiculous. There are a few moments of humor, especially the comedian David Cross as the beginning, but the intricate polygon of love does not really inspire emotion, though it is cleverly mixed (with the proviso of irrational plausibility). The end is as ridiculously foolish as the rest. I think if I was a 12 year old girl, I could have really liked that one.
