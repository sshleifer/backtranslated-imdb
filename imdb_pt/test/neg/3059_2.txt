By the time this movie was released in 1996, director Mark Lester made tight, sharp B-action photos for more than 20 years. He was responsible for the great "Truck Stop Women" of the 70s and several other precious things; unfortunately, he is also responsible for this failure. It's a shame to see the talented - and still smoking hot - Theresa Russell wasted once again, but she's still the best actress in that photo. Eric Roberts appears for a while, does his Eric Roberts thing, then leaves, a not entirely unwanted occurrence in a photo with Eric Roberts. Frank Stallone, in fact, is not bad, which should give you an idea of ​​how this image is really pathetic. As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the action scenes - which is why such an image is made first - are almost completely illogical and unreal, as well as being somewhat ineffective. In addition to some "vintage" clothing and some old cars, there is nothing for the 1930's, the time when this movie is set. A script by numbers with annoying lapses of logic and little historical accuracy - this is not a documentary, of course, but filmmakers could have at least TRIED for a bit of authenticity - and performances ranging from grade B to grade school relegates that little quickie to 4am on HBO, which is exactly where I saw her.
