Plodding, maybe that should have been the title. Bad dialogue delivered in the rhythm of a snail. All of the characters are unique in size, except for one. Unfortunately, this character has some of the worst lines and does not seem to fit into this two-hour drag full of cliches. Having grown up in the seventies, this film is seriously lacking in detail, atmosphere and authenticity. Surprisingly, this was produced by Kelsey Grammar, someone who should recognize an acute dialogue and a narrative consistent in a script. Cameron Richardson is the only element that illuminates this film. The music of Robin Trower is also a welcome addition.
