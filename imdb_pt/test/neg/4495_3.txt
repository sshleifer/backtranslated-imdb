I'm ashamed of myself that I actually went to the theater to watch this movie when it was first released. Although I suppose his veiled description of the story of Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy is well made, it is a film that should never have been made in the first place; Hence, my low rating. <br /> <br /> The film tells the tale of a rich Greek business shark named Theo Tomasis, who courts and beats the lovely young widow Liz Cassidy of a dead American president. Sound familiar? Yes, everything except the names. <br /> <br /> The cast is not to be criticized. Anthony Quinn plays the Greek magnate to perfection, and at least it's a little consolation, having just read that Ari himself asked Quinn for the role. Jacqueline Bisset is naturally beautiful and sophisticated in the (for all purposes) part of Jackie, and James Franciscus has the American's good-looking President. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie since I left, nor do I want to see it again. I remember a bit of bad language and some general rudeness. Otherwise, I suppose it is a sensational and intimate glimpse of the jovial life of the rich and famous, playing on their yachts, beaches, swimming pools, etc. Yes, the scenery of the Greek islands is spectacular, the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> Of your kind, okay, I suppose. There is no end of TV movies about the Kennedy, which I confess to occasionally tune in, not to my credit. This is basically just another. Much better to allow Aristotle and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to rest in peace.
