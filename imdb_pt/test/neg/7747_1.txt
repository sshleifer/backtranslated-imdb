In the 1960s, those of us who were fond of bad movies thought that "Plan Nine From Outer Space" was the worst film ever made, and it would remain that way all the time. To put things in perspective, however, we also thought that $ 3,000 was too much to pay for a new car. As we grew older, our innocence was gradually being eliminated when we were exposed to such films as "Hercules in New York" and "Overdrawn in the Memory Bank," which completely redefined the genre "bad movie." In that context, last night, my son and I saw "Alien From L.A.," which carried the envelope to an unimaginable extreme just a generation ago. Calling this movie "bad" (or miserable or execrable) completely fails to do justice to it, just like any other label in the English language. Even if there were words to accurately describe this film, it would have no consequence since they would be banished in civilized society. <br /> <br /> The Alien mentioned in the title is played by Kathy Ireland, who apparently took some time out of modeling swimsuits for Sports Illustrated to start her film career. Your cast may seem like some kind of recommendation, until you really see the movie. The makeup artists earned their money by making Kathy look so monotonous and unappetizing that you would not want to touch her with the end of a broom handle - no feat. To be frank, in this movie she has a face that would freeze the Medusa. Even worse than his gaze, though, was her voice, which was so hoarse that I could not begin to credit it as originating from a human being. Throughout the film, I found myself longing for a slate to drag my nails to cover the strident sound of his dialogue. At the end of the movie, Kathy finally recovers and finds herself in her beloved swimsuit. I suggested to my son that the film would have been better if they'd put it in the bathing suit at the beginning of the movie, so at least we'd have something to watch. My son pointedly pointed out that if they had removed the swimsuit and put it in his mouth, the film would have improved considerably on two occasions. I admit the clear glow of his remark. If you have any questions, compare this detail to "Barbarella," in which a competent filmmaker shows how to explore the assets of an ethereal and beautiful protagonist of the fantasy genre. <br /> <br /> From the plot itself, there is little to comment on, since there was little evidence. They say that if a million monkeys typed incessantly for millions of years, eventually "Hamlet" would appear. Through the process of elimination, the rest of the time they would appear with something similar to this script. Imagine, if you will, a modern day Alice falling into a hole and falling to 500 feet on a stone slab, after which she rises, walks out of the dust and begins looking for her long-lost father in the kingdom of city ​​of Atlantis. . Once in Atlantis, she spends most of the time running, fighting, or climbing stairs and stairs, and basically trying to stay out of the hands of a general who does not seem to have soldiers to do what he says, and who would do the Tiny Tim looks macho. This summary, as abridged as it seems, is probably longer than the film script. On the plus side, as you revel in production values ​​and absorb everything you can from the scenery and costumes through the smoke and haze, you realize that this is a movie you can actually see on the screen where all the $ 20 of the budget was. The thought that kept creeping through my mind was that filmmakers should not be having access to drugs and alcohol while they are filming a movie, or maybe before, to get results like "Alien from LA" though to be fair, acknowledge that I do not know if they were really involved in substance abuse. or were simply killed in the brain early in the project.
