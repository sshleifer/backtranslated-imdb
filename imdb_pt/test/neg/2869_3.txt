I like CKY and Viva La Bam so I could not resist this when I saw for £ 1.99 at Gamestation. It is the debut film by Bam Magera, written by him and Brandon Dicimaillo, and starring all the CKY team (Ryan Dunn, Raab, Yohn Rake, Jenn Rivell, Dom Vito, etc.). Brandon is also responsible for the artistic direction - which is one of the film's greatest merits -, is quite CKYish in his color style - but also shows progression. <br /> <br /> Basically follows (very loosely) Ryan Dunn's break. with girlfriend Glauren (played by Jenn). Vilo (played by Bam, in honor of Vilo Valo, by chance?) And Falcone (Bran) interpret their best friends that cause havoc when doing various acrobatics. <br /> <br /> It's a bit like CKY movies, but with a linear plot (which is actually very basic) and poor acting. It's weird, the usually super charsmatic gang seems to have their lives sucked out of them when they know what they wanted to say next. <br /> <br /> The acting and screenplay is very scary for the most part, but the second half of the movie is much better than the first (90 minutes is an excerpt for the movie), and there are a number of redeeming factors such as Tony Hawk's appearance, Dicimaillo's subplots such as 'The Futurstic Invention Awards' and 'The Diamond Bike', the soundtrack is also very strong (it's not ALL CKY and HIM - in fact, Bomfunk MC steals the film in terms of music usage). In the second half of the movie, the sense of fun is much more real - especially since Don Vito has a fairly prominent role in the latter part - and he seems to steal all the scenes in which he is. <br /> <br /> The film will appeal to those who like CKY antics, but only because of the main material and not the stuffing or the bullshit of the plot. Oh, and someone will tell Bam that skating rides, especially in movies, are so crazy in 1998. However, the best part of the package on the DVD is not the movie - but the making of of 40 minutes. 'doc. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of the documentary deal with Raab's true alabolism and the crew's true feelings towards the other, surprisingly (as usual Bam appears as an idiot, especially for Raab's drink problem and Ryan Dunn comes across a really cool guy down to earth). The last ten minutes of the documentary dealt with a friend (who is an infrequent member of CKY) trying to kick heroin while staying at the Mageras' house with the crew - and an attentive unit side of the gang (esp. Ape and Ryan) really stumbles. an amazing jewel in an otherwise dull DVD. <br /> <br /> For £ 1.99 I am very pleased - although I hope Bam continues with the improvised and short skits from now on.
