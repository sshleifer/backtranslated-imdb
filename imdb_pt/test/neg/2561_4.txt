I remember when it happened, it was the first kung fu movie I ever saw on our way and we were all excited to see it for sure. Although the action was mediocre at best, it gave us the first experience of kung fu and our first taste bad dubbing, as well as poor film production or, more precisely, the way the Chinese made films at the time. They were admittedly inferior undoubtedly but there was entertainment value here and this caught on for sure. The kung fu mania had begun and Bruce Lee and "The Chinese Connection" would soon follow this or "The Chinese Boxer" with Jimmy Wang Yu. In any case, this film was chosen to lead the way.
