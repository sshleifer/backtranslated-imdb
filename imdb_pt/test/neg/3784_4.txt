If Corky St. Claire in WAITING FOR GUFFMAN had directed Blaine's citizens into a horror movie with comic touches, the result would have been very much like MILPITAS MONSTER. <br /> <br /> To be generous, this was the longest. 20 minute film and 20 minutes I've ever seen. To call the glacial rhythm is to be gentle. <br /> <br /> Almost no one associated with this project ever made another film, with the exception of Ben Burtt, who made the special effects really admirable (given the budget). He started making sound for movies like MUNICH and several other big budget projects. The narration is by veteran broadcaster Paul Frees, who probably donated his efforts. <br /> <br /> When you watch the opening titles and see the Milpitas Unified School District listed as one of the producers you know. Pollution at the depot in Milpitas, California, becomes so toxic it creates a monster. Remember that this is 1975 and ecology was a hot topic. Only a few years earlier, moviegoers had been treated with GODZILLA VS. The SMOG MONSTER. <br /> <br /> So far so good. The monster is a winged creature at least fifteen feet high and has the ability to separate the city. Instead, he steals trash cans. <br /> <br /> Fundamental to the premise is the idea that this monster can prowl a small town and leave footprints eight feet long behind but not be noticed by anyone. There is a well-designed scene where she passes in the middle of a carnival at night, but somehow no one notices. <br /> <br /> The only person who sees the monster until the final scenes is George, the town drunk. Throughout the movie I expected, I hoped, George to be shattered in the cameras, but that did not happen. Drat. In fact, no one is dead. George supposedly sacrifices himself to save Priscilla (he is tied to a helicopter to lure the creature - George smells more than rubbish and the monster is attracted by the smell). <br /> <br /> Nominal leads are a high school group. students. There are beautiful Priscilla and her undefined boyfriend and some "bad" boys who (surprise, surprise) get ready to help defeat the monster in the final scenes. <br /> <br /> The monster is involved in four main sets. . He attacks a Browning-Ferris garbage truck and leaves it on the side of a raised road, but nobody notices. He walks through the carnival, again without being noticed. He rips a building (good work in miniature) and no one sees it except George. Then he attacks high school during a dance and grabs Priscilla and carries her like a certain tall monkey did several times, most recently last winter. <br /> <br /> There are plot ideas that come out of nowhere and are discarded. Local citizens pick up at the city hall because they want their trash cans to come back. An elaborate secret weapon to track monsters is brought in a private jet, scanned and forgotten. <br /> <br /> So, why did I watch the whole thing? Because these people were having so much fun. I had the idea that firemen were firefighters, businessmen were being filmed in their own offices, Priscilla might as well live in that suburban home, and scenes of people in their backyards may have been in their own yards. <br /> <br /> They may not be great actors, but they are real people. No one is unbelievably handsome. In fact, I would estimate that four out of five adults on the screen wear glasses. Since this is the middle of the seventies, we see some really bad clothes and some of the men have terribly bad facial hair. A dignitary being interviewed before a meeting at Ciry Hall has a tie and a sports jacket so high that you think he's on his way to playing Marcelo in THE MAN OF MUSIC. <br /> <br /> And it gave the film two extra stars. Zero for history. Two points for special effects, sometimes decent. And two points from the fact that the people in the community really came together and did it. They can actually say that they have appeared in a movie; despite lots of stage experience and working behind the scenes of live television, I can not say that, and I'm happy for them. <br /> <br /> Remember those great old movies with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland? At some point someone would say, "Let's do a show! Aunt Edna has all those old clothes in the attic, and we can use Uncle Ned's barn!" So they would do 'neighborhood shows' with sets and costumes that would cost well in seven figures if duplicated today. <br /> <br /> This is the spirit that the good people of Milpitas had for this project, and bless them for it.
