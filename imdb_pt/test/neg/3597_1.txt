I do not understand the humor in this movie. I also found it offensive how the Koreans were portrayed in that film, despite being just a caricature of Koreans in those areas. First, the actors are Japanese and make the coarsest expressions of the Koreans in this film. It repulses me in how these people are expressed. I felt anger just watching that scene, and how they were so poorly made in the movie. Humor only lasts for a laugh, and then you do not understand why it's even funny. It is a crude humor with the most disgusting representation of society there. I thought it was an offensive movie in general ... Maybe it was because I never lived in the "hood" or saw any "hood" movies, but I do not want to.
