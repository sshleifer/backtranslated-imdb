The word honor must be erased from the vocabularies of all nations. It aggravates the inactivity of man and is responsible for the death of millions of innocent people. Anyone who does not agree should not mind continuing to read this comment. As can be expected with these writers, Yakuza is an engaging cop thriller, with a lot of respect for the ethnic background against which it is. acted out. Friends of blood and violence will also not be disappointed, but especially in relation to the end, violence becomes somewhat useless, redundant, and utterly foolish. Unlike other reviewers, I found Robert Mitchum's performance not very good. This is an actor who definitely has not improved with age. He looks like a tired janitor (does not fit very well with the part), and his air of detachment that made him such an impressive presence in previous years is confusing or disinterested. Ken Takakura and Richard Jordan are very good as men of honor and young, intelligent, and are bandits respectively. <br /> <br /> The best way to support this movie is to see it as a tragic comedy. Things are set in motion by the character of Mitchum asking the character of Takakura a favor based on wrong assumptions. The error quickly becomes evident, but the sense of honor demands that they not go away. Then they begin to sneak, shooting in all directions, wielding swords and destroying the artistic apartment of their friends (although the guy begs them to stop, please "throughout the corresponding fight.) Bodies begin to pile up and history ends with Mitchum's If you give him your little finger, I'll give you my Well, it's the least he can do, can not he? Then he takes a knife, breathes and begins to saw the end ) It was a moment that probably should have been solemn, it just made me laugh. <br /> <br /> The use of locations is very good in this film.I particularly enjoyed the scenes shot in and around the International Conference Hall on Lake Takaragaike, an interesting futuristic building by the architect Sachio Otani (the Kyoto protocol was signed there). For me, the presentation of the architecture seems better here than in Sydney Pollack's latest documentary of Frank O. Gehry which is about architecture and nothing more.
