This is easily the worst adaptation of the Greek mythology I have ever seen. It fails completely as an adaptation of the original myth, inventing silly twists and reducing the 12 jobs to ... 3 or 4, I think. It compiles totally unnecessary things to try to integrate other myths in an awkward way that calls into question writers who have read the myths, such as changing birds to harpies, lions for sphinxes, the Delphic oracle for Tires, and bulls for a pedantic. version of Proteus, even integrating aspects, never seen outside the series of entertainment of Sam Raimi, referring to his first marriage, to a woman with the cooptado name of one of the Furies so it seems appropriate to the period. <br /> <br /> I could accept a lot of this, but also completely fail in pure movie standards; The most painful is the dialogue, leaden, portentous pseudo-Shakespearean cud. It is a poor reinterpretation of the myths, making a sad attempt at the kind of postmodern revisionism that "The 13th Warrior" of Crichton attempted in relation to the Beowulf legend, while still including strictly mythological elements such as clear interference from the gods and super -Magic strength. A sad and sad failure of an entertainment experience, which I am sure many of the quality actors involved deeply regret.
