This is the voice of one person, who just watched the second season of Rome, almost at once, and took the opportunity to see "what happened next" - this film takes off conveniently where Rome ends. If you find Rome an abomination, a feast of little historical accuracy, then you may like Imperium: Augustus. But if you feel that Rome is a good thing, if you like the complicated intrigue, the atmosphere of decadence and the work of the actors, then Imperium will obviously seem to you as an overly timid, superfluous and boring novel without many redeemers. There are some actors who, to my taste, seem a little better than these in Rome. I particularly disliked the image of Cleopatra of Rome as a sex-soaked drug addict. There must have been a lot of strength and dignity in that woman, and the actress at Imperium fits the play much better. O'Toole and Rampling are good as well as others. But then ... If you've come to know - and love - Atia as the super cool bitch, you'll find her representation in Imperium - like a mother goose in an apron - absolutely ridiculous. There are supposed to be some malicious characters in Imperium, but these actresses rely heavily on facing men and nothing more. You will not find interesting female characters in this epic. There are also the painfully comic Maecenas, which we see as a raucous drag queen, although there is little historical evidence that he was such (he was already called "effeminate in his pleasures" in the annals). The interiors are rather scarce and depend on clichés and clichés. The great hall of Cleopatra looks like something out of a computer game or a children's recreation room in an Egyptian theme park. There is a loooooooo of really bad 3D graphics, not up to the standards of 2003. <br /> <br /> The action is presented as a series of flashbacks that old Augustus is reliving. So let's take a quick look at some historical events, some of which are presented well while others are not. A disproportionate amount of time is wasted to show Livia as the "eternal flame" of Augustus. This case does not bang for a moment, the dialogue is superlame and everything is tempered with an unkind musical score. Whatever reality the series purports to capture, each fragment of it is destroyed by dry and synchronized dubbing (most actors do not speak English). <br /> <br /> Everything is warm in this epic. It is true that there are more historical precisions than in Rome, but, dramatically speaking, it is simply annoying. The characters do not have depth and sharpness of the dialog box. Camera work is often reduced to still photos, and lighting offers nothing that pleases your eyes. <br /> <br /> There is no one to love and no one to hate in Imperium. Regardless of whether you liked Rome or not, there are much better movies and miniseries. Ancient Rome: The rise and fall of an empire would be something I recommend.
