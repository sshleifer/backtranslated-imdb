I can not believe that anyone would make the green light, let alone voluntarily star. I will never be able to get 90 minutes of my life back. <br /> <br /> This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Some movies are so bad they are good. This has gone so far again that it's somehow so bad that it's terrible. I was not exactly expecting much, being a low budget, bandwagon jumps, a replay of a B movie, but it was still on the way under my expectation levels. Even TV movies have higher production figures. There were (very) bad special effects, shocking dialogue, terrible acting and a completely inexplicable plot. Who cursed her and why, why did 6-inch snakes turn into 15-foot snakes, have anyone heard of highly poisonous snakes or pythons? 100 passengers? 3,000 snakes? So many promises, none delivered. <br /> <br /> Some comments make you believe it's worth watching this movie in the last five minutes. Nor is it worth renting. Stay at home and watch a low budget movie, you will like it a lot more. <br /> <br /> Why was this done? Oh yes, for blatantly money on the internet phenomenon that is soap. Shame on you Mallachi Brothers, shame on you
