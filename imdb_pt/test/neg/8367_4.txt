At least if you are a Disney fanatic (well, of the variety that loves your live action movies as well as the lively things) if you are a child, if you are a child at heart almost to the extent that you hardly realize that you are an adult, if you absolutely love any movie that features animals, especially when they are doing tricks, or if you are not too picky, Air Bud: World Pup is a nice bit to watch. I'm a Disney fanatic. I liked that movie enough, and I'm going to watch it again with pleasure. <br /> <br /> But he has many problems. The main flaw arises from a combination of many characters, many plot lines and not enough time to take care of them all. In the space of 82 minutes, we have adults getting married, teenagers falling in love and trying not to be clumsy in this, teenage competition for love and jealousy, pre-teens playing espionage games, dogs falling in love, puppies playing football, puppies having puppies, parent manipulators who will do anything to get their children to be taught a lesson for their children, dilemmas of housewives and thieves cooking and executing elaborate plots. I'm probably forgetting something, but there are 10 major plot issues to be dealt with, with less than 10 minutes per thread to deal with them, and presumably we intertwine them into a coherent whole that is not too complicated - it's a movie, after all. accounts - and this is also funny and comforting. Not surprisingly, director Bill Bannerman, in his first shift being completely in charge (he has a lot of previous experience in the second unit), was not up to the task. I'm sure it did not help that there were at least three writers involved, and probably dictating producers as well. <br /> <br /> The end result is that the Air Bud: World Pup is extremely hectic. Events occur with little justification and, worse, often too little explanation. People find and do things primarily because they need - and fast - everything to arrive where it needs to arrive in less than 90 minutes. From one cut to another, the time can advance six months or more. We have adults who seem to be mentally handicapped and children who intuitively discover what a dog is thinking and rush into some unexpected action. Some of the topics should have been simply removed because it's hard to get too involved in the movie when, as soon as you get introduced to an idea, it has already passed you. <br /> <br /> It's also not helping. the fact that one of the topics is basically a robbery of Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961), minus one character Cruella De Vil. And another problem is that given the way the film is edited, I have to assume that the dog, Air Bud, probably could not do much with the soccer ball. Unlike the first two films, a dog practicing a sport is almost a late reflection here, and when we see it, it is very fast; from time to time, these bits seem to be even helped by computer animation. <br /> <br /> However, for someone like me, there is an extravagant charm for the Air Bud: World Pup. The script and performances often oscillate between ridiculous, mushy and half clich√©d. I like to like this combination. This makes the film a bit predictable and subtly bizarre. And sometimes, like the ending, when the film completely abandons its consistency and basically becomes a commercial for the US Women's Football Team, Air Bud: World Pup is so brazenly cheesy that you can not help but love it.
