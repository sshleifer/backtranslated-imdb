Let's be realistic here. This is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. My wife and kids showed real promise in their first season and only went down hill after that. It's so bad that words do not describe. The acting and writing are so terrible on a consistent basis that I wonder if Damon Wayans was producing such an atrocious show on purpose. From top to bottom, every performance is ridiculous. Damon Wayans gets in touch with him and George Gore II is so horrible that I shrink in all overlapping lines. Can anyone really watch this show and find it fun and much less funny? Please I beg you. Do not watch this show. As soon as the TV affiliates stop picking up the distribution, we can finally get rid of this absolute rubbish.
