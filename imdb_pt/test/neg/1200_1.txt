<br /> <br /> I still can not believe that Louis Gossett Jr. agreed to appear in this movie. Everything about this movement seems artificial, forced and planned. The air strings are flat. The enemy characters look like dolls. This is just a bad excuse for a movie. At least Top Gun had airstrips that looked good (the outer photos anyway). Queen's songs are cool, though. Rent Midway instead.
