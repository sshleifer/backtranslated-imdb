My friends and I always joke about movies being in real time. But this movie really is ... They literally show 4 minutes of stable of nothing but a guy digging the earth with his hands. It has no plot, and an incredible amount of free shouting. I honestly do not believe he won a prize for being a suspected suspense. If you're like me and saw the first movie and loved it because of its horrible acting, on the one hand, on the one hand hilarious and on a lower budget, it does not matter; this is so bad that bad memories can even erase any good memories of the original. You'd be more entertained if you were looking at a blank screen.
