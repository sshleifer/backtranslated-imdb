Yes, this has to be one of the most ridiculous movies I've ever seen. It's totally tasteless, has no style at all, the story is so thin you can watch television through it, and the whole movie has so many holes that you can drive a tanker through it. <br /> <br /> Of course, I enjoy a good B movie as much as most white male homo sapiens. But this has to be the worst I've ever seen. It's actually so b lacking that everything makes an interesting B movie. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is based on artifacts as charming as the characters hitting each other, various bodily functions and complete lack of sanity of anything on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's not even funny. In fact, it's just the opposite. I found it annoying at times because of its extreme predictability. <br /> <br /> I can not find anything good to say about this movie. It was a waste of time watching it and hope the others did not make the same mistake. If you also pay for it, you should do a good job of brain.
