Not too bad, but ultimately lack the quality that the Australian series has. <br /> <br /> The jokes are few and far between, actors are attractive (should not), filmmakers think a lot about cinematography (it's like a home video) and it's like a serious version of Kath and Kim ... it's stupid. <br /> <br /> It's too normal to be Kath and Kim. . Kath and Kim must be two middle-aged women who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes. There is no "Look at me, Kimmy!" jokes Kim's fat friend is not fat or even stupid at all. She's a stereotypical black / Latino girl. <br /> <br /> It's not as stupid or funny as the Australian series. Does not compare. Nothing is the same. I'll admit, this show is very funny at times, but it's nothing like the Aussie series. I was looking forward to an American take on a bogan family. They failed. It's supposed to be REALLY stupid and hilarious, but the actors do not act stupid! For me, this is just a typical American TV show. It's a letdown if you want it to be something like the Australian show. <br /> <br /> 2 stars because it's an OK show, just nothing like what it should be.
