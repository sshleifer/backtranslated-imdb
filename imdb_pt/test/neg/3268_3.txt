Caddyshack II is nothing compared to the original Caddyshack. But there are legitimate reasons for this. (1) Rodney Dangerfield should be the star of this film, but he did not like the script, wanted to change it, his request was denied, so he did not make the film. (2) It was low budget, Bill Murray had grown to superstar status. Ted Knight passed away in 1986, and Chevy Chase's "so-called" ace of the first film (despite having been Rodney all the way) could not be in more than 5 minutes because it would cost too much to pay for it. But you had Dan Aykroyd, Robert Stack, Randy Quaid, and Jackie Mason, all useful substitutes, who did not have their best performances.
