The frustrating thing about a movie like this, with a real potential for greatness, is that it almost likes to be heavy. We speak of allegory, of metaphor ... but the truth is that there is no avoiding the fact that there is absolutely no plot or real character. <br /> <br /> At one point, we know more who the people are. are ... even if we never understand where they are going. Pure pretentiousness was wearing me every time I tried to understand the truth in this film. Call it beautiful, great and incredible ... I just call it "cheating". All style and no substance. Of course, it is a matter of taste ... but I would never take a confused modernist pastiche of symbols and splashes about the spiritual clarity of Jean Cocteau or Renoir. But if it works for you, I'm all for it. Art is a personal thing, I think.
