This movie should have a warning that it was similar to the Left Behind series. I did not know it would be a biblical movie. I hoped it was actually a movie about UFOs and alien abduction because of entertainment. As previous reviews by the reviewer, it would be good to show in a church, but not in a public theater, at least not without the prior knowledge of the consumer about what the premise of the film is. I felt cheated by my spending on this film, since nothing in the summary refers to its religious implications. If you go to church, it will probably be shown there for free for a while. In addition to the cover-up of his true subject, the film was good with regard to acting and screenplay. But I have to say that I left an hour in the movie when I saw in which direction I was going and that I would not have fun but preached to.
