If I had known what I was undergoing, I would have run away from the theater. The movie is terrible, in the literal sense of the word. Despite stunning images, intriguing locations and a subject that could have been fascinating, the film is dead. <br /> <br /> I was not familiar with this period of Greek history and I prepared to try out a great movie. The filmmaker's hand is heavy. it is not enough to see a passing train; we must watch it from afar, we must watch it car by car, we must see the smoke, we must see it more slowly, and we must see it stop. The director's approach is didactic. Likewise, the characters he creates never develop, they never change. Are they so stereotyped that we wonder if they should be all men? Everygirl? Everyoldmusician? Is there any point to this allegory? It's the most pretentious movie I've seen in a long time.
