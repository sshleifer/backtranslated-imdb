When you're accustomed to Lana Turner in the Postman Always Sounds Twice, and compares her to this low-budget, low-talent, low-quality movie, well, I was just embarrassed by Ida Lupino's "singing" (more like talking) piano playing scenes. When the first unsung scene began and everyone just stared at her, I was sure everyone would roll their eyes and start dating or at least talk to each other (she stinks, let's get out of here). Actors are flat - emotions are emptied. And Ida is a real spoiled bi-otch at all - just a 100% deviation. That was how Betty Boop in conscious sedation meets a gas station attendant nowhere in the United States. The story was flat, the music was flat, the acting was flat, the chest was ... no matter. I felt sad for the rest of the actors. Maybe if the right actress had been given the lead role and the male actors had more excitement then the film might have had a chance. Sorry for offending those who thought you were out of this world. I would not have cared if I stayed out of this world.
