This movie is really bad. In fact, the only reason I gave a 2 instead of a 1 is because it made me laugh. Without revealing anything, a man's head explodes in this film. It was so pathetic that I laughed. I do not believe the scene was meant to be funny, but it's absurd. Absolutely absurd. The original Halloween is such a good movie, it's a shame they had to go and make such a stink.
