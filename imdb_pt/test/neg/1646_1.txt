This movie is one of the worst movies of all time. I'm kinda upset that this movie is not in the bottom 100; deserves a place at least 60 or 70 on that list. This is not just a movie I think is bad in a fun and fun way of MST3K; it's just bad. This is one of the few movies that I really hate. Freddy Got Fingered is in the same category as bad. <br /> <br /> So the story of this person says that the daughter (Gugino) goes to California to go to school and back with Crawl (Shore) and he tries to learn to be a farmer. Then the boyfriend tries to get Shore to get the girl out of Crawl and come back to him. It ends and what's left of the audience can go away. <br /> <br /> The main goal of this film is for Pauly Shore to watch the camera and try to be funny; but I would say about 100% of the time he fails at it. His horrific inaccurate and outdated view of farms and farms is offensive and there is nothing in this movie that is worth seeing. If you think of seeing: no. The only time I saw the movie, I felt like I was watching for 5 or 6 hours. If you have ever seen it; You have my sympathy.
