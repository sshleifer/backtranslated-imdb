Now, before I tell you the synopsis, this is a spoiler-free review. Bone Eater hits its mark for being the worst movie of the year. I do not know how these movies come to the DVD. If I saw this in theaters I would be extremely annoyed. Bone Eater is about these people who unearth an ancient cemetery and find some bones. It's the 'Bone Eater' and the more bones it consumes, the more powerful it gets. <br /> <br /> First of all, I thought well, the DVD work looks scary and sounds scary. When I rented and looked at the DVD label, it looked scary. But when I played, I could agree on one thing - the title 'Bone Eater' is better than the movie itself. Tell me what's the dumbest? A bone eater who just strikes throwing a bone ate and disappeared? Do not worry, it's not a spoiler you see that happens in the first 5 minutes. Or is it more stupid that 'Bone Eater' has a horse? Do you know what I think is the most stupid? The whole movie. <br /> <br /> The CGI is horrible. Yes, I thought the idea of ​​'Bone eater' was scary, but once you see the real thing, you think this is some kind of action movie or just a cruel joke. The film seemed longer than the Titanic and it lasted half an hour. Once the movie really has its moments of suspense, it simply stops. I admit that the acting was not the best, but really decent and that the violence was not exaggerated, but everything else is bad. <br /> <br /> The bone eater is a movie you can skip. If you like interesting movies with great creatures, great CGI and suspenseful 'Bone Eater' is a movie to jump. If you like bad movies, no matter how tacky they are, then 'Bone Eater' will satisfy.
