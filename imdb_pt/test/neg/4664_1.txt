Two films: "the fifth element", "armageddon". Same subject: save the world. The same lead actor: Bruce Willis. One difference: "Armageddon" is far inferior to Luc Besson's movie. Some spectacular special effects can not hide a well-crafted and globally conventional script. Several parts of the movie are showing this. I think of the president's speech and especially Willis's relationship with his daughter, "Grace." At the beginning of the movie, he tends to neglect and overprotect her and that leaves her tired. So at the end of the movie, it is true love and understanding that shine on him. On the other hand, the film falls into the following trap: Michael Bay takes his subject very seriously. Of course the movie tries to be funny, but the result does not work, since the humor introduced in the film is generally coarse and beautiful, whereas in the "fifth element", humor was crazy, involuntary, and serious side of the action. The film suffers from two other disadvantages: it often falls into ridicule (the Russian astronaut) and almost all the actors are misused. Bruce Willis is the opposite of the "fifth element" character. He interprets man-man, he talks and sometimes he is unbearable. The other actors are hardly credible in their own roles, particularly in the Willis team. It seems like this team is here just to have fun. One of them is considered very qualified, but he seems like an idiot. And poor Liv Tyler! She's at NASA just to be decorative. <br /> <br /> When the film was released in France in August 1998, Bruce Willis expressed his fatigue in saving the world. His tiredness was probably justified by this spectacular but poor movie.
