In mission in scenic Italy, Lana Turner (as Fredda Barlo) talks to the singer and older prince, Ezio Pinza (as Mr. Imperium). The two fall in love while enjoying the beautiful Italian landscape. Unfortunately, Mr. Pinza is called to the royal father's deathbed, leaving Lana in his hand. Twelve years later, Turner is an actress from Los Angeles, about to make a movie about falling in love with a king. Turner is being romanticized by co-star Barry Sullivan, who wants to marry her - so does King Pinza re-enter her life? "Mr. Imperium" provides a grueling story for the sex symbol Turner and bassist Pinza, who appeared for several decades at the New York Metropolitan Opera. Pinza probably earned his MGM career after appearing in the successful production of South Pacific (1949). The cast album, and Pinza's gold single, "Some Enchanted Evening," sold millions. Supporting founders Marjorie Main, Cedric Hardwicke and Debbie Reynolds give the film an even greater sense of wasted resources. <br /> <br /> *** Mr. Imperium (1951) Don Hartman ~ Lana Turner, Ezio Pinza, Barry Sullivan
