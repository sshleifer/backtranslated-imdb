Stay away from this movie. So far. Phil Fondacaro stars as the demented leader of a Freakshow. Every presentation is flat and insensitive, except that of Fondacaro.

This is missing in every department (humor, sex, horror, etc.) other F.O. Ray's films stand out. The version I saw also contained a feature-length feature in the making of which the director makes comments like "We had a limited budget" and "with our limited timeline", which talks a lot about how much Charles Band mattered with this movie. You'll rent "Droid Runner" (Fred Olen Ray) or "The Dead Hate the Living" instead. Full Moon must be ashamed of themselves (and that's saying a lot after seeing "Killer Eye") <br /> <br /> Grade: D-
