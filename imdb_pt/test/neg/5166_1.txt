A totally pathetic attempt at a film about the sacrifices of Australian soldiers during the New Guinea campaign. Total waste of money, even if you only see it on DVD. Fortunately, the video store provided a free weekly rental with the DVD, otherwise it would be a complete waste of money. Probably made by artistic types and full of symbolism that the Chardonay socialists of today seem to be. Frankly this movie is an insult to the memory of the brave guys who never came back. Someone please provide the funding to make a decent movie at least equal to Saving Private Ryan. I hope the RSL puts as much distance as possible between you and this movie. History has to be told on all sides, Australians, locals and Japanese - though it is highly unlikely the latter will tell the truth about anything that happened during World War II. Basically your junk, do not see it, do not buy it. Go away
