The role of Buddy Ackerman is no big deal for Kevin Spacey. He played version of this character often other better movies. That's fortunate because it gives his performance a certain resonance without which Buddy would be as flat and incomplete as all the other characters in this meaningless little farce. The script leaves little time for the development of the plot or character, looking like a porn movie in its haste to get to the "good stuff." The difference is that here "good things" are not people giving themselves pleasure, but inflicting pain, making it appropriate for young adults. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is nothing wrong with a porn movie if you want to watch people having sex, and I think there is nothing wrong with "Swimming with Sharks" if you want to watch people go through tortures physical, emotional and psychological. But if you are looking for an incisive satire, interesting characters or anything else that tries to engage more than your most basic passions, you should probably look elsewhere.
