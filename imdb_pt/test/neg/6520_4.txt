There is nothing evil or evil about this movie. It's awfully bland. Dizzy is the photograph - the film appears old, faded and faded. Maybe it was up to 16mm up to 35mm, I do not know. Dizzy is the script, which is tedious and 'Jules Pfeiffer'-ish. That is, type of bossa nova cocktail of the 1960's legal. Like our Beatniks grandmas could have said if they were trying to look really straight. The "slice of life" characters were mostly annoying. True, they were real to life, but, hey, if I wanted to see really ordinary people doing mundane and ordinary things, I just watched. I would not crumble to the movies and spend five pounds, and one night, watching someone do it. <br /> <br /> I expected a funny and brilliant romantic comedy. What I got was more like what two smart and moderately talented youngsters of 19 or 20 could have produced on their first day with a new video camera. <br /> <br /> I gave a 4 to 10 because it looks like someone tried, at least.
