Danny is sorry. <br /> <br /> He keeps making the same mistakes, and is no longer interesting to watch. At first I could feel for him, like a self-addict. My heart went out to him in the beginning, and somewhere along the line he passed the line. It is almost as if he continued with this behavior to continue the show and, at the same time, was seriously risking his life and the well-being of his family, especially his children. It's hard even to pity the poor boy. I think he needs to watch this show, maybe he has a chance to save this marriage. I can not understand how Gretchen stays with him, and I wonder how much is just to show, and how much is love. Danny, get a life - a new one! ... and do not get me started on Dr. Gary. What about him and his face? Your skin seems to be stretched to the max. Besides, looks do not mean anything, but he does not seem to be particularly impartial. I think he's also keeping this to his own monetary gain and often not in the best interest of Gretchen or Danny. These people are few confused and each reminds me of a dog chasing its tail. sad very sad. Let's go together.
