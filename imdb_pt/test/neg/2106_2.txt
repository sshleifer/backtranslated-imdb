Really, truly awful. I do not even know where to start. This is a perfect example of a movie that does not know what to do with itself. I'm not sure if I could assign a category to myself, except that I'm sure it's a slap in the face of everyone, everywhere. Even the unborn. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought I was watching a parody, or some kind of farce. Sometimes just a bad movie B. But I kept defending the porn, which, I fear, is almost (but not entirely) non-existent. <br /> <br /> Someone advised to jump to the end. I would definitely second that emotion. The last five minutes are intense and certainly contain some of the best movies / CGI you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood would be proud.
