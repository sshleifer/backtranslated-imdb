Michael Caine's character has problems. He is a simple, short-sighted and insecure man in his early 40s. He is married, but the wife does not seem to love him anymore. He has a bad relationship with his only daughter. But her most immediate problem is that an incredibly beautiful young woman, played by Michelle Johnson, is chasing him with passion, kissing him, groping him and trying to start sex at every opportunity. What's the poor guy to do? <br /> <br /> This movie must be taken from the comedy section and placed under the science fiction. Only an intergalactic brain chip can explain the actions of the character of Michelle Johnson. Let's see - 3 billion men in the world - she may well have her choice - she goes with a clumsy and aged loser. This goes beyond a middle-aged male fantasy into something so delusional, you just expect everyone involved to voluntarily undergo therapy. <br /> <br /> There's really nothing funny here. There are some quick attempts at Caine's intelligence, which often seems to interpret Hawkeye Pierce more than a new character. Joseph Bologna is like nails on the chalkboard. Michelle Johnson is not an actress - she has a crying scene that she would not pass in a high school play - but she is beautiful and takes off her clothes. Then buy the DVD, skip to scenes 4 and 9, and forget the rest.
