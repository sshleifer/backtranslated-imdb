Glenn Ford, a New York boy who is saving his money, signals to the Arizona ranch he bought, where he hopes to find HÃ‰VEN WITH A BOTTLE FENCE NEAR. A film with a script and story by Dalton Trumbo, directed by the extraordinary villain Ricardo Cortez, starring Glenn Ford and the restless Richard Conte, should not be so cool. Although the system - viewed mostly as police and railroad bulls and real estate swindlers - is as terrible as would be expected from the leftist Trumbo, every proletarian is so sweet and pleasant and salty from the earth that one feels nauseous. It does not help that heroin - a sweet blonde person who is an illegal foreign refugee fleeing Franco's Spain - is annoying for reasons of roleplaying and acting. <br /> <br /> So why watch? Richard Conte, in his first role, already has his personality and a good part. And there are some moments of the leftist camp of the thirties that are quite amazing. (Did Dalton absolutely have to define an important part of the film in the Russian worker's mission? All that was lacking was a portrait of Radiant Joe Stalin!) In addition, this is the first important role of Glenn Ford (although his performance is not good ). <br /> <br /> Why not watch? Essentially, the film offers unconvincing insight, is linked to a political point of view that is laughable and the two protagonists have made much better films. In addition, Dalton Trumbo's strengths as a screenwriter are not in evidence. Instead, we have a movie that the Coen brothers Barton Fink could have written in an instant (and avoided that hellish fight with the writer block).
