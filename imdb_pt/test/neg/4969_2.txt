I finished watching Mandy Lane about an hour ago, and I felt like going straight home and getting up here to warn anyone who was spending money on the DVD - NO. <br /> <br /> The supporting characters are superficial, the failure to act is greater than that of Matthew McConaughey's films, and until the end cheer, the plot is all but obvious. On nine of ten, you can see the next scene coming five minutes before it starts. The whole movie is more or less without a motive or message, and the killer's halfway revealing simply kills the little interest you might have left at that point. What could have saved this superficial and tedious film is some decent, or at least bloody, splash worthy of the "Slasher" genre - It also fails there. <br /> <br /> If you need a background movie for a party that you can get in and out of without losing anything, I recommend buying All The Boys Love Mandy Lane. <br /> <br /> If you're wanting to sit down and really focus your eyes on the screen for more than 15 seconds, I do not.
