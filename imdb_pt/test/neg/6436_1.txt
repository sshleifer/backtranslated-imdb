The other low-scoring reviewers have summarized this sewer so perfectly that there seems little to add. I must point out that I only had the filth of Cockney imposed on me during the visits of my children, who insist on attending the Sunday bus. Oh my God, it's depressing! Like all soaps, it consists entirely of totally unpleasant characters being unpleasant to each other, but it is ten times worse than the worst possible. The reviewer who ridiculed the "true for life" basement, quoted by his supporters, was sincere. If someone lived in a social environment like this, they would cut their wrists in a few days. And I can assure anyone who is not familiar with the true East End that he is more "ethnically enriched" than you will ever see here. Take my advice - avoid this low point of the British TV industry. AND BAD.
