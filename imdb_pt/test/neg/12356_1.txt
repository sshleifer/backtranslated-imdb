SPOILER ALERT. <br /> <br /> This movie will spoil your afternoon or "very few hours of the morning" viewing slot. <br /> <br /> I like Marc Singer. He portrayed good characters in the roles I have seen. Until this movie. <br /> <br /> What begins as a promising film soon disappears with the disastrous background of the cgi and the extreme close of the person about to die ... <br /> <br / <br /> So it gets worse. <br /> <br /> Much worse. Describing it as an unworthy act would insult the pigs. <br /> <br /> In addition to Marc Singer's overcooked, Mike Dopud steps and walks around the stage seeming to be afraid of falling on the rocks and his grumpy 'manic' wide-eyed guy only makes him look like an idiot. He is nothing threatening. <br /> George Stults looks like a deer stuck in the headlights. He claims to have been threatened by the other two, but his character would have been threatened by a box offering him "paper or plastic". <br /> <br /> This is really a vehicle for Nicole Eggert as an independent woman who takes her life back despite attracting the wrong kind of man ... She was not remarkable. <br /> <br /> This is not a remake, but it is incredibly similar to "Cliffhanger" - experienced guide, loses someone in a fall, conscience stung to help someone, a lost treasure that is worth a lot of money and a gang of n 'er-do-wells that explores the guide. Except Cliffhanger was a great vehicle for Stallone and Lithgow. I must admit, Lithgow stole the show. <br /> <br /> Even unintentional comedy was bad. There were times when I was not sure if they were wearing a rubber model as a substitute for Singer while trying in vain to invade the weather station (no pun intended). Pressing his face on the door post and his awkward ways generally did not help his character. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> No, seriously, avoid it. Save 96 minutes of your life and do something more constructive, like seeing if the paint dries or the grass grows. Or just close your eyes and examine the back of your eyelids for 90 minutes ...
