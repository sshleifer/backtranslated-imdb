Tommy Lee Jones was the best Woodroe and no one can play Woodroe F. Connect better than him. Not only was he the first and the best, he was the only person who could portray his pain and confusion. It was a bad disappointment and I'm surprised you made me watch. I can even begin as unfortunate they did Woodroe. I understand he would be old by this time, but everyone knows he would never let it knock him out. The first movie was the best and the only one I watched. Hopefully no more directors plan to continue or remake the wonderful classic without Tommy or Duval. Without them, the films are useless waste of time and money for everyone, including the director. If you plan to make another dove movie of any kind, take mine and billions of others, do not waste time. Continuing the movies is just grinding the first on the floor. Thank you.
