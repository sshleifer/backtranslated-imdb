This movie is a cyborg itself: half absurd / half Lifetime Original Movie. <br /> <br /> As a cyborg, this film has only one goal: to make you wish you had spent the duration of the movie. in a dark room punctured in the testicles. <br /> <br /> Unlike many people, I did not rent this movie because of Angelina Jolie (I'll explain why I rented it soon). I'm not a big fan of Mrs. Jolie, though I tell her her performance was stellar! Her empty stare and robotic acting really made me believe she was an android prostitute. If someone has a clip of her in 'Inside the Actor's Studio' explaining how she prepared for this role, please send it my way. I'll make sure to use it when I try James Lipton for crimes against integrity. <br /> <br /> So, what prompted me to rent this movie? One might think it was the hope of seeing Angelina Jolie's nipples, but it was not. No, the reason behind this rent depended only on one of the images on the DVD cover; the face of Jack Palance! HALF OF HIS FACE WAS ROBOTIC! When I saw this, I imagined that legions of "Palaces" marched slowly through a devastated land, devastating any human who was foolish enough to resist. In my mind, all members of this Unholy Army of Palaces had a bright red eye; a bright red eye that looked at humans and saw only "flesh." They would be the Architects of Forgetfulness ... a cold and steel Apocalypse ... a nightmare of which Humanity would never wake up. It is a beautiful image that I will love until the end of my years. <br /> <br /> Like most things in my life, the movie did not live up to my expectations. No, there was only "one" Jack Palance, and the only visible cybernetic improvements he had were located in his legs. Unfortunately, these improvements have not really "increased" anything. That is, unless, you count WALKING AS A VICTIM POLICY as a superpower. At least their scene was where Jack - grinning like a trigger happy Alzheimer's patient - had to shoot some people. I was waiting for him to shout, "I'm too tired to pay too much for prescription drugs!" Unfortunately, any outbursts of geriatric rage were few and far between. The film had an abundance of an undeveloped love story about a man (Elias Koteas, also known as De Niro's poor) and a cyborg (Angelina Jolie, aka Demon Spawn by John Voigt). Oh man, can the love between a Romeo of Flesh and a Silicon Juliet be able to last?!?!?! It may be that you follow Jack Palance's simple advice: "You have to PROVE the TIME of each other". <br /> <br /> Yes, I'm not sure what that means. However, I'm sure I do not want Jack Palance to be the one to explain this to me. I'm sure I do not want him to show me! As an experiment, I suggest you ask your partner if he / she "thinks we have reached a level in our relationship where we can begin to savor each other's time?"
