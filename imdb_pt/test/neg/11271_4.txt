Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps best known, at least in his homeland, for his Japanese gangster films, a series with which this film shares several characteristics. Violence and political intrigue are themes throughout Samurai and Shogun's Unmanned Battles and Humanity, and both feature a main character who finds his loyalty challenged by betrayals. Both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose other than to die, and as very little is done to develop them, their deaths have little impact when they arrive. This movie has other flaws as well. Make-up, costumes and sound design are distractingly poor, and battle scenes were also below standard, inferior to other samurai films of previous years (Seven Samurai comes to mind). Sonny Chiba plays Sonny Chiba's character in Shogun's Samurai, the master swordsman who crosses the film, making a menacing grimace. What a boy; he even wears an eye patch. If you were hoping to see the legendary Toshiro Mifune, you might be disappointed; your appearance equals little more than a tip, and when it looks like your character can do something interesting, it disappears forever. Overall, the film's strengths are its history, which is infinitely more understandable than gangster movies, and the challenges posed to traditional concepts of good and evil. Two brothers are challengers to the throne of their recently deceased father, who may have had some help in his way out. In the beginning, it seems that we will come across some characters who could not be more clearly good and bad; after all, the older brother stutters and has a birthmark, the sure sign of a villain. Eventually, however, it becomes clear that in a struggle for the power of the victor takes everything, there are no heroes and villains, only winners and losers.
