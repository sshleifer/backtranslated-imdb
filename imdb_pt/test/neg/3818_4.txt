Let me give you some advice, if you watch this movie just to see a lot of nasty characters being massacred in a dozen different ways, then you will love this movie because everyone dies in a horrible way, beyond sorrows there is not much else. <br /> <br /> Where should I begin: -The characters do not appeal to the public, as there are no background stories for any of them, as I did not feel connected to any of the others. they actually did not like any of them, and I was so tired of them that by the end of the movie I was hoping that the disfigured creeper would kill them all (which he did by the way) <br /> bad acting; I mean, I did not get it, take the Asian tour guide, for example, first he spoke perfect English then after the little thing from the tour boat sink he somehow got an accent from nowhere, then was speaking normal English. (if you can call it that) after the monster / human mutant kills almost everyone, he is killed by the last two idiots, or else they thought! the monster / human thing is finally dead when beauty and geek stick a post in the heart / nick (it was hard to say) and presumably he died right in front of them (within range of arms) but later he comes back and kills them (wtf) I mean why not just kill them when he was next to them. Arghhhh! I mean he was too retarded, it was as if the writer did not know where he wanted the story to be (or he was a few minutes before the 80 min, so he added some delayed plot twists so people could get 80min worth crap instead of 75min. <br /> <br /> What I did not get was why they just did not kill the damn thing while she was unconscious, instead they just walked away from her like idiots and left so he could go back and kill them, the only reason I gave a 4 was because of the blood that was actually the only thing I watched this movie to the end, and to see them all being killed. I'm serious)
