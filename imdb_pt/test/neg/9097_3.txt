This movie has some pretty gorey parts like a biting boob and other big bites. Castle Freak himself is a good monster. I would be afraid of pieces if he were coming after me. However, the movie had some stupid parts about it. <br /> <br /> A husband will drive drunk and kill his 3 year old son and blind his teenage daughter. I suppose death is a greater harm than blindness, but you never know that parents really feel bad about their daughter being blind. All they care about is that "J.J. is dead!" While her teenage daughter walks around rushing to things and talking about how she will never be able to drive a car. Parents are like- "honey, stop walking without a guide, you know better than that," and then they cry and never stop being depressed because JJ is dead. Sounds like favoritism to me. <br /> <br /> The lines of dialogue are not very realistic or well done. For example, when a giant shock is heard in the castle, everyone rushes to the basement to see what it was. It was a huge mirror that fell to the floor and broke. The husband runs to the broken mirror in horror and says clearly: "The mirror has broken." I do not know, I would say a little more than that if a giant mirror mysteriously fell to the ground in my castle. <br /> <br /> Husband and wife have some major relationship issues and it's fun to see how dumb they are to each other. No one believes in the blind girl. Tip: If a blind girl says she hears things, believe her and do not tell her to shut up. I think that's the moral of the story. Listen to people when they tell you things or you may end up killing yourself to prove your point. <br /> <br /> Finally, I thought the best character was the main cop. He was the best actor and character. All others (besides Castle Freak) were well executed in the mill. 3/10
