Yes it's right. If I were to ask my friends this question, "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" They can answer something like "Armageddon" ("You can drill the hole?!"), "Shriek", "Plan Nine From Outer Space", "The Medallion", "Scooby Doo" etc ... No - Do not be offended by is thinking that you have seen something that could be in the same department of naturally produced human fertilizer that this film is in. If the worst movie you can think of is, let's say so bad it really annoys you .; So you do not know anything about my friend. <br /> <br /> Crazy Six ... I remember the day that I and a friend of mine went to the local rental company to rent a movie. We've both been through most of the movies there, and on the "new movies" shelf we see we're looking at each other. "Wow, there's some good actors in here. Tell me something about the Mafia, let's get it and get out of here." This was undoubtedly the film's worst mistake in my life-loving movie. It was also the worst mistake of all the others. Movie Lover or Not Watching this movie is as much fun as watching a glass of ice water (or ice-tea ....) until you reach room temperature. Watching this movie will make you dream an eternal dream of death, if death is just light blackout and nothing, and then you realize that you are just staring at the TV-monitor. Not looking. You're really paying so much attention that it's humanly possible. This is not a joke. <br /> <br /> This movie is the perfection of making a bad movie. It's not the kind of bad thing you can watch, point and laugh at, it's the kind of movie that's so bad that you have no chance of getting out of your memory. Unless you use electric shock therapy to cleanse the brain. .... ... (Hey! This could be something similar to how I remember myself and my friend felt after seeing him ....) With best regards from me for you Albert Pyun. -Joergen
