Oh dear - as well as Alfred Hitchcock (North by Northwest, Spellbound, the 39 Steps) could end this nasty and cheap shock is beyond me. Do not bother to look for hidden depths or deep meanings - there are none. This is awful, decadent and cheap. The only redeeming feature is the home life of the inspector leading the investigation - his wife imagines herself as a gourmet cook and constantly offers her repulsive culinary experiments for her poor husband. This is fun, and it almost saved me from putting the film on 'horrible' support, but the film as a whole is one of the most unpleasant I have ever seen. I think this was Hitchcock's penultimate film - maybe someone was trying to tell you something.
