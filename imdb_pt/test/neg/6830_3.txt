I would rule out any temptation to see this movie, it is simply boring. The characters are predictable and stupid. The killer is totally non-enigmatic. There is no tension, no fun, no style or even a glimpse of originality to be found in this train crash. And the tangle of Hollywood clich√©s is stifling. Oh, and you have a movie that makes a hero of an IRA terrorist. Cute. And now I need to talk a little bit to fill in the ten lines. And a little more Is that enough? Not well, now what? No, well, more conspiracy should do the trick, but the Jackal is not really worth ten lines of exposure. The original was great though.
