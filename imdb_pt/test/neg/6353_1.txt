Gee, I do not even know where to start commenting on this thing they called the movie. I really do not know what the hell David Bradley started smoking after doing Hard Justice, which in my opinion was a good movie after the characteristics of the American Ninja. I had not seen any of this guy's latest movies after Cyborg Cop. Lucky I saw them on Amazon for about 5 pounds each and I can safely say the following: If I had flushed the 5lbs I spent on Total Reality, Crisis and Expect to Die, I would have ended up happier than having to sit down for the 90 minutes each of them lasted. My God, how the HECK can somebody label them as "movies" ??? And why do martial arts / action actors fall to their knees when they peak? I mean, David Bradley is not an Oscar, but his early films were a lot of fun. Tough, cool guy with very good martial knowledge who delivered tacky lines, but at least entertained fans of action and martial arts to a certain extent. But I'd seriously like to know what went through this guy's head after doing Hard Justice. Your last three movies have to be frankly the worst I've ever had to do. As I mentioned before, I would love to have my money back on the 3 DVDs I bought. The crisis was the epitome of drowsiness, Total Reality was hard, but this Dying Hope is just total nonsense. I bet the director was mega-stoned when he did this or he was just peeing at all of David Bradley's fans who would go through that pile of crap. The plot revolves around a doctor (Bradley) who develops some kind of Virtual Reality game in which he is just killing different people one by one. Sorry, but I just could not take this guy seriously playing a villain in that stylish hairstyle, glasses and gray pants and doing absolutely no physical fighting (frankly, his best asset). The movie is even worse than any of those Saturday night B movies because the acting is laughable, the direction is horrible and the few fights in the movie, well, what can I say ... The actors seem to be training with their friend of academia. We have a muscular and dumb cop who starts showing his fighting things like an hour in the movie and crashes heavily ... a French version of Van Damme who simply can not fight, act or talk to save his life and Bradley, the supposed protagonist, playing the evil doctor for whom I was really happy when he stopped doing this kind of disposable trash. I even think he did not give a kick in this movie, probably because of his heart condition already playing with him. For an actor from B, I must admit that I really liked this guy, his style, physical, fighting skills ... But I'm very, very happy that he stopped acting after this monstrosity because I honestly would not have been able to sit through ninety minutes of peeing material like this. Avoid at all costs, even if you are from the family of David Bradley, you will be glad you did, word.
