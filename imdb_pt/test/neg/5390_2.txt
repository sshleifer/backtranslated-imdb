Most of the other posts have won this movie, and deservedly. I just talked about the technical ineptitude of filmmakers. It would have been nice if the director had at least had lunch with someone who knew what a gun was, because he had no idea. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD !!! YOU WERE NOTICED !!! <br /> <br /> Stupidity: <br /> <br /> Special operations team mounted on several military units whose members have never met before. <br /> <br /> Maybe two people in the unit would have met. weapons that use the same magazines, parts, ammunition, etc. <br /> <br /> The sniper school trainer uses a secondary machine gun (caliber of pistol) instead of an rifle that we would assume she would be more proficient with. <br /> <br /> The night vision optics of a poor team member weigh more than the rifle. You can tell when he deals with this, which is SERIOUSLY heavily superior. The team leader sends a team member to "challenge" the Skeleton Man when confronted for the first time. Challenge a 200-year-old Native American skeleton with a long spear and an attitude mounted on a dead warhorse with severe nosebleeds? I do not think so, Bubba. <br /> <br /> Bullets do not light up when they hit the trees, Mr. Director. (Some people have already mentioned that.) "Air support" teams consist of a ubiquitous "black helicopter", but this one has a pair of side missiles underneath. Someone forgot to tell the helo crew that the Skeleton Man does not fly, and they are in the heart of America, where there will be no enemy aircraft. They should have carried some air to the ground missiles. Helo air for ground munitions consists of a door gunner with a semi-automatic AK-47 (or 74?). Needless to say, it only hits dirt. He should have brought a belt fed with a light machine gun. <br /> <br /> The door gunner later discovers that a grenade launcher is also quite useless. <br /> <br /> A wooden arrow from a damn recurve bow does not down helicopters, Mr. Director. <br /> <br /> I could not take it anymore after this point (about 30 minutes) and gave up. You seriously need a morphine drip to get through this movie, it's painful.
