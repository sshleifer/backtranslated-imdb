This image hit the movie screens on June 6, 1980, starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor, Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt, JD Hinton as Buzz and starring Playmate of the Year Dorothy Stratton. The image begins with the infinity police roaming space looking for I think criminals. There is a ship suddenly attacked by an unknown spaceship. Enter Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to find out who the unknown ship belongs to. When they fail, they call Captain Comelius, who instructs his crew to fight back. Enter the beautiful Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina, who is a man made of robot. Now a few thoughts about this image. This movie was a stupid plan and is one of the reasons why I do not go into Sci-Fi. If you like Sci-Fi, you would have noticed that the laser's sound effects were borrowed from a science fiction movie titled Battlestar Galactica, which aired in cinemas in 1978. Many of the door sounds you hear in this movie came from other. Science fiction movie that aired in 1966, entitled Star Trek. Now, for the reason I bought this movie, Dorothy Stratton. She is beautiful in her one-piece suit. I think her talents were wasted on this picture and she should never have gotten involved in such garbage. Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted as well. In the photo alone I give this star of the weasel of movie 1 and in Dorothy Stratton I give her 10 weasel stars, even if she does not deserve to be put in a trash film like this. If you like photos like this, you can get the DVD version on Amazon.com
