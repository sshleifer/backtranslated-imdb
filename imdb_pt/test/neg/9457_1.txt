Nothing but the director's youthful fantasy comes to life. This 'film' is nothing more than an excuse for the director / actor to make a face of a kiss with a attractive young woman who otherwise would never give him the time of day. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, the direction is non-existent and the movie trails while the actor / director / writer / narrator narrates. Do not be fooled by the 'X' rating, there is no nudity or minimal violence.
