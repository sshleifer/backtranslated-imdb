Let me start by saying that this remake of one of the greatest films ever created, "Psycho" (1960), has been nothing but a good example of bad direction, bad acting and bad cast. The best way to describe this movie is to compare it step by step, acting according to the process and processing the original. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock, one of the greatest film directors of all time, intended to photograph the original in black and white despite the availability of color at that time. Okay, people in the 1960s may not be accustomed to bloody or creepy scenes as much as we do today, but that did not stop people from liking and were nominated for 4 Oscars. Gus Van Sant had absolutely no reason to release this in color except that the year was 1998. What should have seemed realistic in color was not. After the shower scene, Norman washes his hands, it's easily understandable that whatever was used for blood looked like some kind of red wax. Once he washes the blood, his hand is red. <br /> <br /> About the acting, there might not have been a better cast of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins in the original. Perkins matched well with Norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiled and talked to the stranger. Hitch wanted a handsome and good actor and it worked very well. In this version, I personally think Vince Vaughn looked perfect, handsome and strong to play the role of Norman, unfortunately his acting was nothing short of terrible. In the motel office, where Norman and Marion have their long talk, he had zero expression on his face and his voice and face never change everywhere. In the original, in the same scene as the hospice is described, we can clearly see the sudden change of expression on Perkins' face and he looks scandalously irritated, though not aggressively. Vince Vaughn works all the talk as if he had his color lines. Again, the acting terrible. So does Anne Heche. In the opening scene of the original, we can see how nervous and nervous Marion (Janet) is when she drives to Phoenix. She was happy to get the money, but at the same time scared of life. This is what I call acting. In the remake, Heche has no signs of fear and she smiles periodically to get the money. I do not think anyone would be "happy and smiling" when they stole $ 400,000 and all state police are behind them. In the shower scene, Janet in the original tightens the curtain, turns and dies after being stabbed. In the remake, Heche is stabbed, turns around, swings to the other side, has a silly expression on her face and can die with great effort. Again, a terrible performance. <br /> <br /> There are also some changes especially introduced in this movie from the original that seem to have nothing to do with the plot and the current situation. In the scene in which Arbogast is assassinated, two scenes blink between the blows. One with a naked woman and one with a sheep. Many people, including me, are not sure if the second scene showed a sheep or a cow or whatever. What the hell a beast or a naked woman has to do with the murder of an investigator! The changes were just inappropriate and unnecessary. There are some changes in the final scene as well. <br /> <br /> Let me add some (and the only) good points along with that. I felt Julianne Moore did her job well and played a good character from Lila. And William Macy acted well, it was almost exactly how the character of Arbogast should have been touched. <br /> <br /> It is common man's knowledge that the aim and intent of a remake of a movie is to make the current generation aware of a movie. which has a good classic plot, and try to make it look better than the original. And if anything happened here according to what I just said, it's directly the opposite. Unfortunately, many people like me were not impressed after watching this movie, unless we knew of the existence of an original unforgettable version. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie, it is not even close to the original and the original will always be one of the best movies ever created, if not the best.
