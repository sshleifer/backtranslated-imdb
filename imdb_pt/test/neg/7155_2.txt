I'm just filling in this comment because I could not bear the fact that a positive review was presented on the "full info" page. I really think this is the worst movie ever made in my country. This is not only because of the terrible plot, the poor English and a voltage curve that is as flat as our country. No, it's because this was a serious attempt to make a good action movie, according to the Hollywood standard. It had to be "The European Action Film of the Year". For this purpose, they even hired Fejda van Huet, the actress in the Oscar-winning film "Karakter," to get the job done. I do not care about bad movies, I can even enjoy them if they are unassuming movies. but I can not stand movies that are terrible, but supposedly kind films.
