I usually start my reviews with an explanation of how and why I watched the movie I'm reviewing. With that, I simply can not explain. I needed to get up early for work the next day, so the last thing I wanted to do was watch a movie about which I knew nothing. But something kept me glued to my comfortable futon while I watched this Heather Graham vehicle. Ah, that's right. Boredom. Graham plays Joline, a crazy bohemian who seems more obsessed with her marriage vows than with the guy she married (played by Luke Wilson). When her husband decides to go in search of better things (work, women and scripts, presumably), Joline begins a fanatical quest to find her husband and free him from his "spiritual wheelchair." It seems like I'm making this up, but unfortunately I'm not. In fact, this is little more than an acting exercise for Graham, as she cleverly gives this role of Phoebe-from-Friends an exercise. Oh, and Goran "ER" Visnjic is also there for some reason. <br /> <br /> TV shows had this as a comedy, but I could not find a single laugh anywhere. It seemed to me that this was a personal journey for Lisa Krueger (the director and the writer), in the same mold as "Girl Interrupted," but even that had more laughter than that. Graham's character is simply too self-centered for the audience to care and I felt sorry for the drunken husband as he fought bravely for his freedom from his clearly mental wife. Very little of that movie made sense, as the characters simply appeared in the story as if standing, hoping that Graham would appear as the extras of "The Truman Show." In fact, the only positive note I can produce from my scribbles was "Heather Graham - nice baps". And it was not because I was too tired to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is very difficult to think of someone to recommend this movie. Graham Purists (a VERY small number of moviegoers in general, I think you'll agree) will have to commit to watching this scum, and possibly the hippie students who collect the American Indian dream catchers will get something of this. I was amazed that the average rating (at time of writing) was 5.0 - which would make this movie as good as "Die Another Day" and "Gothika" in my book and that just is not right. "Committed" is a weird mess of a movie that neither entertains nor illuminates. It's complicated, pointless and just plain boring for my taste and probably yours as well. Do not even think about watching it.
