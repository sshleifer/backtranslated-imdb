I never meant to see Venom, but I got the cable. It has good elements. The atmosphere of the Louisiana swamp for one, something that unfortunately we will not see much in the movies because of Hurricane Katrina. It is based on an interesting concept, an ordinary man imbued with the evil spirits. His confrontation with his son might have been interesting as well as much of the film. But as it tends to happen in Hollywood, an interesting idea is a familiar direction: Kill all the characters and save the good girl, starting with the blacks. I'm a fan of Agnes Bruckner, but the other characters, the aforementioned son of the villain, CeCe, who must become a voodoo priestess, are more interesting. And for God's sake, once I'd like to see the virgin be killed. We all like the easy girl, why can not she live? In this case, it was Bijou Phillips, and we loved her. <br /> <br /> The ending did not make sense considering what had been established about the villain's invincibility. All the carnage and atmosphere, and this leads to nothing.
