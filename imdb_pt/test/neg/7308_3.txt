This problematic young Elisabeth so much that she never forgot the subject. We must remember that she was only 16 years old. She was so embarrassed that she kept her fear of sex all her life. Maybe it started to look like a trauma. Also the constant intrusion of his aunt and mother-in-law. As you say, she kept all her children away from her, criticized her teeth and manners (which she deemed unfit for an empress), and when Sissi finally went to Venice with her husband and children, her eldest daughter died, and her mother the law blamed her for that unfortunate and untimely death. She never recovered.
