Another sadistic and ultra-sleazy revenge movie of the '70s and early' 80s? Wes Craven certainly launched a popular trend with his "Last House on the Left" Although "Terror Express" is more like a blow from other lies, like "I spit on your grave" and especially "Night Train Murders". In general terms, this movie has nothing new to offer, so the only thing left for director Ferdinando Baldi is to multiply the sleaze factor by a thousand! This is actually just a softcore porn movie that gets a bit difficult near the end. On Rome's train night they are three hopelessly hopelessly deranged imbecile loser. They provoke male travelers and sexually assault females. Things get a bit out of control, and a convict on the trip comes to the aid of a prostitute who is still being tricked by the three. This is a very tame movie and there was not enough budget to buy some fake blood bags. This type of film is often infamous for brutal rape sequences and discriminatory behavior towards women, but sex on Terror Express is not disturbing at all. On the contrary, these 'rapists' spend more time orally giving their victims pleasure, then getting some of themselves! The music is great, the dialogues are unintentionally hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous I've ever seen. The villains are weak and the passengers of the trains are so immobile that they seem part of the scenery. If you like your exploration as sleazy as possible, this is your movie. However, their blood hunger and controversy will definitely not be silenced. "Terror Express" should be in the porn section of videostores.
