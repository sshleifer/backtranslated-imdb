"The evil that men do" begins with a truly repulsive torture scene, followed a little later by graphic verbal descriptions of equally repulsive methods of torture that the heartless, sadistic villain likes to use. But despite the use of such effects strictly by shock, filmmakers can not really cover up the fact that this is only a low grade Bronson vehicle. Bronson himself is solid here, but he should have chosen a better script.
