A group of four young men, attending a prestigious private school, belong to an ancient alliance that was formed by their ancestors during the time of the witch hunt in the late seventeenth century. Each of them possesses a power that ages them whenever they use them and suspect that a new kid in the gym might be from a family believed to have died long ago. This new guy wants everyone's power for himself. <br /> <br /> This is not a horror movie as it tries to perform. Yes, there is magic and all this supernatural stuff, but this is just an action movie. A very mediocre action movie. Concentrating almost exclusively on being legal and smooth and paying minimal attention to the plot, which has plenty of space unfortunately not used for interesting twists. But none has been put and even before the movie reaches half you will know what is being touched and by whom. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes here and there, most notably an exploding car that is magically rebuilt after colliding with great equipment, but that's about it. Worst of all is that director Renny Harlin, who has some really fun movies, if not clever, relies heavily on blowing up metal music and leads to overly sexy movies, which makes the movie "dumbest" since the disastrous movie. "Alone in the dark." It's not as bad as "Alone in the Dark", as the few slippery scenes are really slippery and not ridiculously incompetent, but in the end, the most this movie can expect is a nice, cozy house in the late afternoon. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Score: PG-13: Violent action
