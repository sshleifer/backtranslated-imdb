The first thing that impressed me about this movie was the terrible acting. The whole cast was so incompetent to deliver their lines that I began to laugh at the terrible dialogue in the middle of the movie. An even bigger problem with this movie is that at no time do we find out what motivates the actions of each character. The somewhat redeeming aspect of the film is the innovative visual effects of Halfdan Hussey. However, however attractive they are, they do little to compensate for the flaws mentioned above. A horrible script mixed with the theater level of the community does not contribute to a pleasant sight. I was sincerely shocked at how bad this movie was.
