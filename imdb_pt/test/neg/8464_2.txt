Boring movie Poor plot. Poor actors. The film takes place in a room supposedly in Morocco, but actually in some American city! The "Arab terrorists" are the patriots the blonde patriot is the "Arab terrorist" ... DANCE! <br /> <br /> There is something good about this movie (which is why the result is 2 out of 10). The director turns to the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism that the media feeds us every day, the terrorists are American (or Western, if you will). <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two parts. The first part of the movie concerns the Dutch travel (15 seconds), while the second part is about staying in the amazing dark brown room (1 hour and something like that). The Dutchman is going to deliver money in Morocco to some "charitable organization", leaves the plain, picks up the bus and ends up kidnapped in a dark brown room. He is kidnapped with another guy who is shot after saying "They will not shoot at us". The surviving Dutchman is forced to play chess with an Arabian guy resembling Morpheus for so long that you will learn to play chess too! In the end, the Dutchman reveals his plot not because they cut four fingers of it, but because he is fooled by such a bad game you should watch the movie! <br /> <br /> Good when you're so tired you can not sleep.
