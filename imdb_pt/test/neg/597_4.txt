I gave this movie a four star rating for a few reasons. First, I felt that this movie was definitely preaching and I hate it. Still, it's my fault for watching a Christian movie in the first place. <br /> <br /> My friend and I rented this movie because it sounded interesting. The back of the cabinet said something along the lines of a spiritual battle, someone opening some kind of boundary that let the demons into our world and stuff like that. Something I'm very interested in, actually. This movie almost hit the mark. It was more like the edge of the target, more on the tree than the target itself ... <br /> <br /> The basic plot of this movie is that two couples are kidnapped by a group of terrorists to be victimized experiments. However, as their experimental serum is derived from the research of a scientist who claimed to be able to fill the gap between the physical and spiritual realms, the men of the couples are now able to smell, smell, hear and see the demons. of the spiritual world. In that order. Apparently the sense of taste is not present in this realm. <br /> <br /> This movie is very clich√©. They took the title seriously, while the men, chained to the beds, require their women to look back because there is something there. <br /> <br /> Although it's a good effort for what it was, I think the special effects could have been made much better. The demon that scratched the woman was, in a word, hilarious. The wife was hateful as hell and everyone in the room practically cheered when she died. We were all expecting her to be beaten by the other woman with the chair, however. <br /> <br /> The message is one that I do not mind commenting on, plus I think Christian filmmakers should have found a better way to do that. <br /> <br /> And then I give four stars because it's not the film's fault I'm not a Christian and I do not like that kind of message, and I had a lot of fun commenting on everywhere. My friend and I watching this movie seemed to resemble an episode of MST3K.
