"The Yoke on Me" is arguably the most controversial film of the Stooges' short years. The reason is understandable; by current standards, this film can be considered racist. For this reason, it is rarely shown, if at all, on television. <br /> <br /> Let me just state that for the record, the Japanese seen in the movie were not soldiers; they were Japanese-Americans sent to a relocation center during World War II. They were treated and shown as the evil enemy in this movie. According to all reports - including the US government, which apologized and repaired in the 1980s - Japanese Americans during World War II were as loyal and hard-working as any American. His arrest during this time is a bleak blur in American history. <br /> <br /> There is some laughter from Stooge in this film, but memories of how the Japanese Americans were treated during this time mess up the value of entertainment. Let's not confuse loyal Japanese Americans with their portrayal in this film as malefactors. The loyal Japanese Americans and the Japanese empire of World War II are not synonymous. 2 out of 10.
