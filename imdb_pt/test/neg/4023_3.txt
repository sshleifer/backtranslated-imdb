The original story had all the ingredients to make a completely exciting movie. But she failed miserably in this version, for even Cherie Lunghi was a pale imitation of what she would become - so much so that I suspected she should be an accomplice to the end. Sherlock Holmes was transformed into a warrior completely different from anything that was suggested by Sir Arthur Conn Doyle? In fact, it was Dr. Watson who showed what little common sense was happening. The dwarf blackened by the boots of the Andoman islands seemed unable to get out of a paper bag and what the villain was doing on tea at Baker Street, for a breakout was beyond anything the old Scotland Yard could imagine. So, consign this TV movie to your Black Museum, please.
