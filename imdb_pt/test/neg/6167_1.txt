The most predictable movie I've ever seen ... extremely annoying, I feel like I've seen a hundred movies with the same plot as this one. Acting is OK at best, there is no action really and definitely there are no emotions. Actors capable with a terrible script think it could have been written better by a 10th grader. It felt more like a task to be observed, because I hoped there was something in that movie that would put it apart from all other types of junk, but it fits perfectly into the pile. The whole movie was waiting for something good to happen, but it never came. I never rate movies and never review movies, but this movie was so bad that I had to log in here and post a comment to try to save some poor souls from wasting their time (and / or money) with this movie. I hacked and wanted to never have lost space on the hard drive. If I spent $ 10 to see it in theaters, I'd kill myself.
