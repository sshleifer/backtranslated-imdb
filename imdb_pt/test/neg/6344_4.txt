Gene Hackman is a former Marine Corps Colonel who gathers a handful of Vietnam veterans to return to Laos and rescue some Americans who were listed as missing in action. Hackman suspects that in fact the half dozen MIAs are secretly being kept in a remote field by Laos to be plagued and provide more hard work. Hackman is being paid by the wealthy Robert Stack, whose son, as the son of Hackman, is considered one of the MIAs. But the circumstances are such that Hackman can only buy old and obsolete weapons, although he gets the help of a fervent anti-Communist Loatian and his two daughters along the way. <br /> <br /> I do not think the film was deliberately invented to endorse the myth of the Vietnamese still holding our MIAs for propaganda purposes. The myth was real enough. If anyone remembers, there were many stickers in 1982 and 1983, bring back the MIAs. I think instead the film was made in part to profit from the myth. It was absurd in the face of it. Why would our old enemy refuse to return MIAs? Advertising? Where is the value of advertising on something that is kept secret? To add the job offer? Do they need one hundred extra workers in Vietnam and Laos? The motives behind this film - with its triumphant music and high body count - were gross. <br /> <br /> But what about the movie itself? Stripped of his theme of rescuing mythical mistreated MIA, he is a routine paramilitary actioner, no better and no worse than dozens of others who appeared in the 1980s. Gene Hackman's performance is the only one that manages to keep his head above water . He is almost always trustworthy. Of the others, this being a stereotyped plot, derived from "The Dirty Dozen" among others, I kept trying to guess which gang would sacrifice for the mission. Of the three anti-Communist Asians, I imagined that one or more were dead meat. That's why Asian assistants appear in movies like this. (I was right twice out of three.) I also figured Patrick Swayzie as the rookie former officer, the youngest of the group, who never "earned the respect" of others, because he had never seen the fight, it would also have that go somehow heroic. Wrong. He becomes a hero, it is true, but he survives intact. I thought there was a fifty percent chance that Hackman would have to leave, too, but he did well. The formula also does not apply to originality. Charles Bronson's claustrophobic prisoner of war escaped from "The Great Escape" is here in Fred Ward's former tunnel, a claustrophobic man who is forced to crawl through a drainage pipe with a snake inside him to make a reconnaissance in the field. Laos. The title, "Uncommon Courage", is a tribute that Admiral Nimitz made to the men at Iwo Jima - "Unusual value was commonplace on that day." Nimitz was certainly right about that. Whether or not the men who fought in Vietnam were equally valued is far from the point. Anyone who saw the combat or came close to him, putting their lives at risk for the guys in line next to them, was heroic enough. This film, and the way it exploits our bitterness about the Vietnam War, does not really do them justice.
