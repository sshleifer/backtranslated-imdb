DO NOT BELIEVE IN HYPE! <br /> <br /> I had to see why all the critics flatter this movie. I have seen and still do not understand. The lot is thin, very thin. After the movie ended, I still did not know the name of the female main character and one of the two male characters did not even have a name on the credits, he is credited as "the farmer". I did not care about the characters, so I did not care about the movie. <br /> <br /> The scenery and cinematography were brilliant, but so was National Geographic or the Discovery Channel. <br /> I can not recommend this movie to anyone.
