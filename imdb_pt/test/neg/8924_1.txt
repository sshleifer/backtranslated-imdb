I found this movie on a local TV channel last night. Frankly, I've never heard of this movie before. I just lost track of the recent Seagual movies, because each one is worse than the previous one. Here again we have a dull Seagal as if he was insisted by his girlfriend to make this movie and he accepted it forcefully. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is below zero, and there is not a single aspect that the movie is not collapsing. I just have no idea why Seagal did this movie. Man, it's worse than "going out to kill"! If you watch this movie, you will begin to feel sorry for Seagal. He seems to be running out of ideas, enthusiasm and money. Avoid this movie and do something worthwhile.
