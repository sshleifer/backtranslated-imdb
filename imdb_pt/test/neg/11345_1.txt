Dude ... I liked both Buffy and Angel and the next science fiction freak ... but that's awesome. The worst leading actress of all time !! Not even David "Hot Pants" Boreanaz is able to save that crap. Is it any wonder I never watch Fox? it blows !! We totally took a chance, and continued to suck. We watched four or five painful and agonizing episodes. I want to kill executives of the SO BAD network! Why is the money being spent on this nonsense?!?! I do not understand and I do not support and you should never waste your time watching this show ... unless you like it when your eyes bleed from your links! <br /> <br /> Crap. Filth. Filth.
