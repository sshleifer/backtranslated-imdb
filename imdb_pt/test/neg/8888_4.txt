I swore some time ago never to have another Joe Castro movie (maybe after "Almost Death"), but I ended up getting this by accident, since it was a release from Troma and I did not read the cover carefully. Oops Well, I watched it, and it's not good at all, but it's, I think, a kind of "irony on the cheek" ... if it's not, it certainly looked that way. Some intrepid people at the University of Rio Grande go out to find out if the Chupacabra exists because of footage from the GOAT BARN surveillance camera of someone who shows this weird thing jumping through the field of vision. And also because the person whom this thing supposedly killed was the leader of the expedition's uncle. There are a couple of cameramen, one of whom whines all the time, and there's some former Marine named "Army" (?!), Who's some kind of ammunition specialist or something. Anyway, they find the Chupacabra on some guy's ranch and set out to find him, wrapping himself up with two so-called witches along the way. The creature itself is rather ridiculous, with spines on its back and a large long tongue for which Gene Simmons would die. Eventually, after a group of people is killed, so does the Chupacabra, and they take him back to the university for an autopsy. So it's from another planet? Is it a genetic creation of some laboratory in Puerto Rico? They do not really tell us. It's not exactly intriguing, but it's not terrible either. Definitely not a wide audience for this. 4 out of 10.
