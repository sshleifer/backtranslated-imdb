The young maid, who does not associate with women of the same age and is staring at the retirement gentleman, invites an apparently mute young man to her apartment on a rainy day. Nervous and overly educated to hide her own sexual insecurities, she is more pleased when the boy heads home in his guest room ... but he is not so happy when he starts out the window at night. Sandy Dennis is not an unfortunate actress, but why she was attracted to those sad roles, I guess we'll never know. Based on a book by Richard Miles, and as far removed from a commercial drama as possible, this shocking material not only attracted Dennis, but also director Robert Altman (whose work is static, at best). The narrative seems almost a sexual reversal of "The Collector," a label that may have sold the rights to the film, but that does not prove to be a good cinematic idea. Even the best sequel to the film (Dennis buying a prostitute to satisfy her) does not come out, with Sandy acting bad and outraged (whose idea was this plan?). Michael Burns is very good as the boy who uses this grumpy, doughy woman just for his comfortable digs, but he is very shy with Altman, with many strategically placed towels and colored briefs (Altman was clearly not ready for a mature image with adult themes at this time). Sandy Dennis has a handful of very good scenes; she does not talk without thinking here, she thinks before speaking and is cautiously careful in her actions. Unfortunately, the paper itself is a bummer, with an apparent slump in the mental deterioration that seems to happen off the screen. As such, the abrupt end is maddening and the overall results are timid. * 1/2 of ****
