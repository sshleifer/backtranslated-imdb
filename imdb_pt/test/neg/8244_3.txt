Oh, what the hell, I'm going to reveal the secret: this movie stinks! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some cool dinosaur effects that for your time were probably really exciting to watch. Now they do not cut, but they are not terrible. They are good enough to tolerate without being able to laugh at it. So they just sit there, and I sit watching this, not laughing, not excited, just, well, bored. It stinks! <br /> <br /> If I can exercise my Jay Sherman for a moment, the film really does. The box promises cowboys against dinosaurs and, in a very generic sense, offers. Boys dressed as cowboys fight with two large dinosaurs. But really these guys are a bunch of fags, and the hero is a loser (more on that later) and the dinosaurs are hardly intimidating. The plot is a yawn, and there is not much technically wrong with it that is there to laugh at. Everything is just gray and bland. <br /> <br /> After horrible filmmaking (filmed in one and a half colors I called), we took the plot that involves some people, doing things. That's what I got. Oh, and they are at the turn of the century in Mexico, so they at least dress like cowboys, even if they are not like that. <br /> <br /> So, a lot of these people, which I think were human. , they go into the desert, and they stumble on these dinosaurs (after they find a miniature horse ... I do not know, let's just move on). Then the film degrades into a real pathetic King Kong in the final act. At that moment I had lost the will to even keep my eyes on the television level, and I plunged in and out of consciousness. <br /> <br /> The "hero" is played by Beneath the Planet of the Apes. who essentially played Charlton Heston when Heston decided he did not want to be in the sequel. He was chosen because, shocking shock, he looks exactly like Heston. That's all he has for him. I was really upset when he was the hero of the movie because all he does is glower, snear, bag the girl in the movie (who is called TJ .. unfortunately she is not a prostitute or finally the origin of the name would have been revealed) . Meanwhile, your friend kills all the dinosaurs, saves the day countless times, and what does he gain from it? No recognition, nothing! And he dies, sacrificing himself for his friends! They do not even wait for it while they escape! <br /> <br /> Boring, long, slow, with little to enjoy until the movie decides to copy the script of King Kong for its own, it is best to avoid this movie unless you like the pain in the let scale drop an anvil in your eyeball.
