To start my comments about the film, I know the topic is horrible and words can not adequately express the compassion that any decent person would have for the people who deal with the post-horrors of an atomic bomb that fell close to them. <br /> <br /> However, this movie does not read horribly except in the first 10 minutes. Some of the images are gruesome and should be a reminder of what devastation nuclear weapons can produce. Seeing burned people walking aimlessly or the man combing his hair and tufts of hair coming out, etc., is not a pretty sight. <br /> <br /> But after the first 12 minutes, this Japanese movie deals with people who deal with the aftermath of Hiroshima in the late 1940s. I actually found the story developing rapidly in a boring novel. <br /> <br /> Nearly the whole story occurs five years after the bomb and deals mostly with the problems of a family at that time. That is why it has become more of a melodrama than a shocking history of nuclear disaster. Is it simply a story about how these people had their lives from the 1950's if one of the women was permanently damaged and if so, should she get married? <br /> <br /> This could have been a real-life movie, but it was not in that direction
