This movie was really bad. I mean really bad. The scenes were like a parody and special effect sucked a lot. And it was filmed in 2003 !!! I think this was a big waste of time and money and Michael Shanks with his 'Shaggy from Scooby Doo' image made me laugh. Never waste your time with this photo ... I really do not know what the director was thinking after seeing the final cut of this movie, but the fights were so unreal that it hurt my eyes to look at them. The fighters of 'latex cat women' were like sheep rolling backstage and looking scared as if they had no idea what to do on the scene ... I think this is a beautiful example of the background photo 100.
