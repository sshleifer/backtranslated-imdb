"Dolemite" is the poignant story of Dolemite (Gotta love blaxploitation movie titles), a former convict who probably should still be in jail. He gets in trouble with cops, friends, drug traffickers, women, prostitutes, and society in general. He's not that nice. Neither is the film, although it is still hilarious and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The fragile premise is that Dolemite (played with as much enthusiasm as Rudy Ray Moore can) is in jail for a crime he claims to have committed. did not compromise. When a drug attack or a drug or drug seizure something is about to subside, the director frees you to stop, or help you, or just see you. Not very clear. All I know is that I did not know that the justice system frees the damned so they can prove their own innocence. My ignorance, I think. <br /> <br /> The plot is complicated and unimportant, basically Dolemite goes around killing people (usually with badly choreographed karate), having sex and cursing people, sometimes even rhyming as well. The joys of the film are his utter incompetence, and his utter indifference to the subject. <br /> <br /> I stopped counting the number of times I saw the microphone boom after he was in a scene for the entire duration (about two minutes of film). I stopped questioning why the director was looking where Dolemite was sitting, even after he stood up and turned around when they cut off the remaining shot and Dolemite was inexplicably seated again. I stopped wondering why Dolemite dressed like this when he was naked on the street to change clothes, because he did not want to get in his car with the ugly (read: normal) clothes that the chain gave him. And I stopped wondering where he learned karate when he shakes his hand in the stomach of some guy and somehow opens it. The only time I was remotely nervous and tense was when the disgusting white mayor is walking naked, with nothing but a towel hanging from his neck that barely covers him. You keep saying "Cut ... cut ... cut", but by the time you do, you're already emotionally tagged. <br /> <br /> The film is ridiculous in every way imaginable. Moore like Dolemite, it's funny, cool or both. If you're looking for a bad movie, you've found it with "Dolemite."
