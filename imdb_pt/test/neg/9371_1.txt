Tru Calling was good, but it could have been great. The concept was intriguing and allowed for seriously strange and frightening scenarios that could have been explored in the future. Unfortunately, the writing and the actor left the show aside. <br /> <br /> The writing was not so bad, but there were holes. In episode 13, "Drop Dead Gorgeous," an incredibly toxic poison was supposedly used to kill the victim. This was so toxic and dead so fast that the victim did not have time to run or even scream for help. However, there was no plausible explanation for how the killer got such a powerful poison. <br /> <br /> In episode 15, "The Getaway," the off duty cop reacted unrealistically. In the second dinner scene, he (humbly) tells the thief to drop the weapon and when he does not follow the order, and in fact turns the gun toward him, he allows it to become a stalemate and then becomes a hostage . situation? the same situation in which he had been warned. His answer should have been (would have been) to shoot the thief when she did not follow his command and after she turned the gun on him. There are other flaws in the stories, but I will leave with these two examples. Despite the writing flaws, I enjoyed the show. <br /> <br /> The other problem I had was that I simply could not accept Eliza Dushku on this test. In my opinion she is very inexperienced and mild to take that part. She never walked anywhere, she marched; and often she abruptly stopped at her mark. <br /> <br /> She also had no facial expression or emotional intonation. She has a thoughtful look or a cute smile; rarely other emotions are apparent. When she tries to look dramatic, she begins to look the other way and "then" turns her eyes to the actor. Or, alternatively, she starts the line looking at the opposite side and then looks away. Both are annoying when done as substitutes for true emotion. An example of his lack of intonation is in episode 20, "Two Weddings and a Funeral," during his second marriage speech is devoid of emotion (eg, hearts in our hearts). <br /> <br /> I liked all the other actors in their respective parts and they were all believable. With improved writing and a leadership change, Tru Calling may have succeeded.
