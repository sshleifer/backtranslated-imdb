Another Lo Wei production to completely ruin the talents of a young Jackie Chan, To Kill With Intrigue is a strange blend of wuxia, melodrama, supernatural action and kung fu fighting that is quite boring despite presenting several surreal WTF moments. and many ridiculously bad dialogues. <br /> <br /> In an effort to protect his pregnant girlfriend Chin Chin from the Killer, a gang of ruthless assassins who are about to attack his house, Cao Lei (Jackie Chan) pretends to be a cruel cad, and thus save it from danger. During the attack, Cao's relatives are all dead, but he is relatively unharmed by the gang, whose leader, a scarred woman with a face, seems to be horny for him. Cao then goes in search of Chin Chin, whose safety he entrusted to his close friend Chu Chuk. During his quest to find his true love, Cao befriends the head of a courier company whose precious cargo has been stolen by the leader of the evil clan 'Bloody Rain'. Eventually, after being injured in a fight against nasty clan members (a fun scene with many silly frames), and then regained the health of Killer Bee (who shows his love burning his face!), Cao finally discovers that he is a a poor judge of character: his friend Chu Chuk is none other than the power-hungry clan of the 'Bloody Rain' clan, who has plans to marry Chin Chin. <br /> <br /> Cue the prolonged climactic battle with Cao being kicked in the face repeatedly before eventually smothering his former traitorous friend to death with a handkerchief. <br /> <br /> Even dying Chan fans will find this a hard job to sit down with only the final fight managing to show off some of the star's amazing acrobatic skills. Fans of general Asian strangeness can dig the frightening appearance of the Killer at the beginning of the movie (with a character inexplicably demanding back their severed hand!), Or the moment when three men float through a window to attack our hero, but to most, this movie will have a very limited appeal.
