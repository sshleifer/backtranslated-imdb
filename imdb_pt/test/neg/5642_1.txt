No wonder the producers of this hopeless film could not find a distributor in the UK, and then had to release it as a free DVD with a Sunday newspaper. Distributors could clearly see what the filmmakers and Sunday newspaper could not do, that this was a movie that was not going to recoup its costs. As it is a thriller about puzzles, it would have helped if they had chosen a lead actor who could enunciate correctly, rather than the grumpy Vinnie Jones who seems to pronounce "enigma" as "riell." And it would have helped if the dialogue had not been flooded by noisy places or scenes filled with distracting and inappropriate music. The plot is ridiculous: The lost story of Charles Dickens supposedly helps our hero solve a series of modern murders, but also a copy of Herge's Tintin Adventures, since the connection between Dickens and Jones is more non-existent than tenuous. And we have the ridiculous premise that an investigative journalist who puts his hands on an uncovered Dickens manuscript would take several days to read it, just so that Dickens's flashbacks can continue to be displayed throughout the film as if were any connection to it. What they do not. I mean, if you found a new Dickens manuscript, would not you just go somewhere quiet and read it? The film ends with one of those surprise revelations that have become mandatory since The Sixth Sense, but in this case it does not surprise you as much as it insults your intelligence. If the movie suddenly became supernatural in the twelfth hour, then revealing that Vinnie Jones is a robot may have been more acceptable. It may not look so turgid if the film had been stylish, but it is not. And in several places it seems decidedly amateur: there is a scene where a table is laid with a leap technique of 60 years, but they did not guarantee that the person who is actually setting the table is completely out of the frame between the cuts. Consequently, you can see things changing on the edge of the frame when you should be seeing things changing in the center of the frame. A good rule of filmmaking is: if you do not understand how to do a technique, try something else. <br /> <br /> The real puzzle is why someone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie. first of all.
