My tolerance for the shlocky direction was overwhelmed by some of the choices in this could-be-really-good-time-waster. When the "romantic" breaks were of a nature to get me out of the story and in "How and why did the movie-maker-do-that /?" So, you have to find out that something is missing there; restraint and good taste, I think. <br /> <br /> Brian Brown is a capable and empathetic actor - usually. I think he did not like the project or the people, and it shows. I do not remember anything the other guy did. You can not even imagine his face. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it does not have to be good to be fun; some of the vignettes and twists are fun and even ingenious. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie (purchase of $ 2.00 at the video rental site) against the writing board; I understand he was tempted to remove his name from the credits. It's a matter of pride, I bet.
