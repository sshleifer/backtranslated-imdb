I did not like this movie. It did not make much sense to me. It was hard to figure out what was really going on. I did not think it was scary either. But I thought it was silly, even absurd, but not in a good way. Radha Mitchell is the main character in the movie, which cam in 2003. She was also coincidentally in 2006, "Silent Hill" that I hated. This too I found confused and useless. "Visitors" is not so bad, but I think it is certainly below average. there is nothing special about it. The script is very confusing and there are things in the movie that do not need to be there in my opinion. I think Radha Mitchell is probably a good actress if she has more to work with. My vote for "Visitors" is 4/10
