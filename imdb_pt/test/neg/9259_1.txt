Get a bad script, some bad acting and throw a politically incorrect tale of morality and what do you get? Something that is supposed to go through the quality of the family. <br /> <br /> Seven Alone is the story of a 19th century family that travels across America in a wagon, waiting for a new life in Oregon. There are seven children (three boys, three girls and a baby whose sex I'm not sure), hence the title of the film. <br /> <br /> The story opens with the family living a seemingly normal appearance. life on a farm in the middle of nowhere. The eldest son, John, is an early teenager, "lazy and good at nothing," as his father constantly reminds him. We see right away that he has a joke drop when he ties the ropes in the hair of his sleeping sisters and connects them to a nearby mule. When the mule is moved, of course, the poor girls are taken out of bed. John is caught by his father and is immediately punished with a strap. <br /> <br /> That same day a wagon goes by. Pa is tempted to join because it promises a new life in the wild and wild west. Then the family picks up their belongings and leaves. From the beginning, the film seems weak and amateurish. The acting is below the level, as if from one of those films exhibited at the school about the pioneers. I can not blame the actors, however, because the lines in this movie are silly and simply plainly sweet and optimistic. <br /> <br /> I must tell you that I caught this movie as it launched channels on a tedious Saturday afternoon. on a Christian television station. Not from a religious mind, I watched in horror when Seven Alone offered moral statements that were not only outdated but downright offensive! If I were a good Christian, I would expect that I would have the good sense to complain to the television station for airing such garbage. However, because I am a cynical, non-believer with a wicked sense of humor, I chose to sit and laugh silly me. <br /> <br /> In one of the opening scenes, the role of the father as the stern ruler of the house is established when he proposes the idea of ​​leaving for Oregon for his wife. Your answer is a "my dead body" warmed up. We are expected to laugh, I suppose, as the film cuts to the next scene with Pa and Ma smiling as he drives the cart across the prairies. I suppose even the most convinced feminist would have to admit that this "father-tastes-best" attitude was the norm in those days, and one could argue the need for such a dictatorial rule when living conditions were difficult, but somehow I I got it feeling that this movie supported this notion, until today. Lovely message from a Christian television station. <br /> <br /> In any case, things get worse for the family, and the moral integrity of the films is further diminished. An Indian (or Native American) steals John while he was sleeping in a field. Like an ordinary savage, the Indian takes clothes and belongings to Johns. Fortunately, Pa, with the help of Kit Carson, is able to kill the Indian, as well as some of his delinquent friends. Kit Carson tells John that his father is a true hero. <br /> <br /> The family is accompanied by resident doctor of the train, Dr. Dutch (played by Aldo Ray). He shares Pa's feelings about John, stating that he is a useless brat. Maybe so, but he is also the best thing about this movie. Aldo Ray's doctor is a buffoon, who seems unable to tie his own shoes, much less treat one of the girls for a broken leg. Fortunately the child did not cry when the wagon ran over and broke his leg in two because Dr. Dutch did not seem to have the proper way of bedside. We know of the disadvantages of constantly belittling a child. Here is a movie that promotes this behavior. <br /> <br /> Later on the father develops food poisoning, or something, I was not paying much attention, and he dies. His deathbed scene is the great thing that is made of action. Frankly, the man did not even look sick. <br /> <br /> Soon after, Ma dies too. Children are left to fend for themselves. And that's where the real adventure begins. Passing through the rapids, finding more Indians (these are good, though) and venturing out on snow-covered terrain, these kids do it all. And I kept thinking, "What a load of crap!" <br /> <br /> Sorry, but there was nothing redeeming about this movie. This small low budget house on the Prairie is a shameful waste of time and an insult to "families" everywhere. I'm surprised that in 1975, at the end of the feminist movement, and at a time when Native American treatment was coming into focus, something like this could actually be done. <br /> <br />
