When I first saw this film in the movies, I was very angry. That totally exploded in my opinion. I have not seen it for a decade, so I decided what the heck, let's see. I'm watching all the hell movies now to see where it went wrong. My guess is it was with sequel 5 that was the first to implement the whole "I'm in a dream omg I see strange things, oh noes what's happening, oh it's a dream, oh it's not a dream, oh wait I I see something scary, oh no matter "-sucky plot. These sequences do not even require the box to be opened, or they follow the rules of the first 4 movies that, if you have seen the pinhead, are practically screwed and killed. The first 3 hellraisers joined this plot which made it so scary at first. No fancy, nothing strange, the box was opened boom they came. Kirstey was the only one who could bargain his way out, first because of Uncle Frank. Then because she had information about the cenobites. This movie, at least, tries to stick to all this, even if it was a bad story, was still a bit overwhelming. No, I'm sure Part 5 was the first part to completely and completely destroy the Hellraiser series. Now they're redoing 1, and I do not even think I'm going to watch it. Oh who am I kidding I will probably and will probably be disappointed .... again.
