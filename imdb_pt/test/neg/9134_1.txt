Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are both beautiful films, but this final part of the trilogy is a big disappointment. They were very excited about filming and photography, so little content. The executive producer puts his own image on the film ... It's just pretentious. Maybe if they had more than $ 3 million to spend, maybe it was something. I really thought Steven Soderbergh directed it because it was so bad, but Godfrey Reggio, director of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, directed that. I'll have to assume that they just do not have the budget to make a decent movie. You'd think Francis Ford Coppola would like to be a part of this movie and help get more money together.
