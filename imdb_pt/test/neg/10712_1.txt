This has to be one of the worst movies coming out of the Sci-Fi Channel. Here's how the movie begins, Women are the only humans on this planet due to the fact that in the not-too-distant future chemical warfare is OK, as long as it only targets soldiers (If you're wondering, Men) However, the virus back fires (big shock) and all men on earth die slowly. So all men are condemned to die when the president is murdered by a man. now we're taken in 60 or 70 years, two female scientists are working on cloning a female and one of them says, "Hey, why do not we bring men back?" The other says that not the world is not ready for it, but readily ignores it, and thus a man walks again in the Eath. <br /> <br /> First, this film assumes that all men who are not genetically altered are blood. thirsty monsters. Secondly, the writer forgot to mention that today's soldiers are a good mix of male and female officers, so there is no real reason to have such a virus. This is the longest range of time you can find. This film has managed to insult my intellect, not only by the bad story, but by the lifestyle of life. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I give this a 1 out of 10, but only because I could not go lower.
