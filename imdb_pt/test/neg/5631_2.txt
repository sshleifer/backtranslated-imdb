STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Unorthodox journalist Mike Sullivan ( Vinnie Jones) throws out his time to roll up the local police and trying to romance a member of the police staff. But everything changes when the owner of the bar next to the Thames who frequents is found murdered and a transcript of an unpublished novel with the confession of the legendary writer Charles Dickens is found. As he delves into the two mysteries, he delves deeper into mystery and danger than he expected. <br /> <br /> In 1998, former footballer Vinnie Jones shot out of nowhere and surprised everyone with the cult classic gangster. Padlock, warehouse and two barrels that smoke. Okay, no one was impressed with his acting ability, but his presence as a tough man seemed poised to secure a decent career as a tough-guy movie. But all this proved to be a marvel of a hit, and all he really got after that was supporting the role of much more acclaimed actors in films like Gone in Sixty Seconds and Swordfish, before heading down to hell, the most recent being this confusing and laborious thriller, which might have been good if he had not taken other acclaimed and promising talented stars like Derek Jacobi, Julie Cox, Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng and Mel Smith along with him. What drove him to fall so quickly from such a stunned success (besides being a pony of a trick) is that nobody knows (a dubious personal life is a guess), but here it is. <br /> <br /> So distant and incomprehensible script as this would have been a task at hand from anyone, but with a miscast looking at Jones in the lead, it is still more a task to understand. The juxtaposition roles of Jacobi as a former homeless man and Dickens himself speaking directly to the camera are obviously suggestions of something and the script is predictable in other areas as well. Add to that the inexpensive-looking production values ​​and debut director (also writer) Brendan Foley made a bad first impression. <br /> <br /> What exactly did I expect with something that came for free with the Daily Mail? *
