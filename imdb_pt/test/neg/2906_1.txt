This is by far the worst movie ever made. I have no doubts. I've seen this crap like Hands, Space Mutiny, and everything, and I can honestly tell you that they do not cling to crazed science. <br /> <br /> Science Crazed has no desirable plot. Something about a guy impregnating a woman with a turkey, and the child who was born * hours * later is fully grown and ready to kill. Of course, being a newborn, it takes about an hour to kill people. The director loops constantly, and it takes about fifteen minutes to create an awkward death. There is a dialog page for the whole movie, however the dialogue comes about a minute after being spoken. <br /> <br /> Example of scene: The monster is walking down a corridor. We know this because there are about ten minutes of looping footage of your feet. In the intervals between us, we are treated with two working women. Repeat ad nauseum for about 20 minutes. When the monster appears, no one moves, and everyone looks like deer in the headlights as the monster takes another 10 minutes to reach them to kill them. By the acting level, you would guess that people are already dead. <br /> <br /> I know my description does not seem so bad, but believe me, I can not completely describe the pain that is Science. Crazed. <br /> <br /> Stay away, and boycott all the video stores that carry you. :) <br /> <br />
