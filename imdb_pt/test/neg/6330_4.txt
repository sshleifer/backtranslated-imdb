I do not understand people here. The movie is not as good as it is as bad as some people say here. Except for De Kok, the performance is good. The problem with the film is mainly the script. The characters are not credible. Sex is fine, but the psychology behind people makes very little sense. The movie does not look good, but what do you expect? The film was filmed for very little money on video. Of course it does not look as good as a normal movie, duh! The only thing I agree with is that the music is bad. It sounds like a soft, cheap erotic movie from the 80's. The movie is not good, okay, but you have to give some credit for taking it away without any money.
