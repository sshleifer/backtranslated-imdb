Every James Bond movie has its own set of rules. Just as every Indiana Jones movie has its own set of rules. And the fact that the writers do not break these rules maintains the integrity of the characters. With a completely unnecessary twist, the integrity of both Ocean films falls between Airplane 2 and a Roadrunner cartoon. Imagine what would happen as you rocked the rope bridge outside the Temple of Doom if Indy told Shorty and Willie not to worry because during the first two films he secretly had superpowers and you can take them to a safe place. <br /> <br /> Fun? Of course, for a Roadrunner cartoon. But Spielberg would never have done it because it would have destroyed the integrity of the film. More importantly, it would have distressed the public. They were already sitting on the edge of their seats for 3 hours of Indiana Jones movies and were counting on Indiana to get them off the bridge in a believable way. If he were to fly? People would have left theaters the same way people did during Ocean's 12. SPOILERS 1. Julia Roberts's character Tess infiltrates a museum disguising herself as ... Julia Roberts? !? A clever twist? Breaking the fourth wall three hours after we were introduced to these characters? Is that Naked Gun 33 and 1/3? It's an example of how a cheap laugh can ruin an entire movie. But wait ... if you have not already left ... <br /> <br /> 2. The suspense builds throughout the last hour of the movie - how they will remove the robbery - there are only 10 ... 8. .. 5 ... 2 DAYS LEFT! And then, in the last 12 minutes of the movie, the ONLY fun part of this movie, we see that the robbery was done days before and took Matt Damon in 30 seconds to be released. The last 10 days? A complete waste of your time. <br /> <br /> BACK TO INDIANA JONES ON THE ROPE BRIDGE ... "Just relax, Willie! I stole the REAL stones a month ago, plus I convinced you that you were Kate Capshaw!" < If you have not seen it, cut your losses and go see the Polar Express. I do not want to ruin the ending for you, but there really is a Santa Claus. More importantly, you will not feel cheated when you leave the theater.
