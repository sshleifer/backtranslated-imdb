I got this for my birthday in a box with the name Broke Skull. Well, after watching one on the DVD and being pleasantly surprised, I put that sucker. It was worse than I expected, and I did not expect too much. This movie is basically a complicated story about a guy who dies and comes back to life with mob and other bullshit. There were some interesting ideas that were never followed. Now everyone has said there was too much blood, can anyone tell me what it was? I have seen a bad effect of a head being crushed, brain tissue (or something ...) and blood coming from the penis area twice. I have to say that the part where the guy got his man hood made me squirm, that was the only good thing about that movie. And that gay sex scene was played there for no reason. The acting on it was atrocious, really, it exploded. That Asian girl was annoying, then the annoying Mexican boyfriend who comes to be killed. I say if you can get it in a box set, fine, but do not spend money on it, no way.
