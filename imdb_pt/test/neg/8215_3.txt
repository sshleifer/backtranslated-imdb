** May contain Spoilers ** The main character, a nobleman named Fallon, is stranded on an island with characters so evil and lethal that he could have been better drowning. Count Lorente de Sade speaks in his own hallucinations and sees all the intruders of the island like invading pirates. He routinely beats Anne's mute servant and tortures his unwilling guests in the dungeon. Inadvertent laughter is provided by the giant slave "Nubian" Mantis, who speaks with a deep South accent and Sade's help to hunt invaders in THE MOREWIGEROUS GAME style. De Sade's maddened wife, devastated by leprosy, provides some truly scary moments as she walks through the dungeon and hugs an impotent, chained prisoner. (This scene was seen on TV late at night by many kids who took memory into adulthood.) The person almost normal in sight is Cassandra, who has self-deprecation until a science. ("I used to be a nurse, now I'm not much of anything.") She and Fallon plan their escape and end up finding a more fearsome foe than Sade and Mantis combined. <br /> <br /> This film was filmed in San Antonio and directed by a man more competent in drawing horror comics than in horror films. (I'll say this a lot to Mr. Boyette - he shows his fixation with contagion here, as he did in his comics.) It's a bit like a Andy Milligan melodrama minus the cutlasses. The wardrobe of the time, the music of the library, the abuse of the disabled and the generalized misanthropy make one wonder if Andy was not called as a consultant. However, Milligan made better attire and wrote a better dialogue. Technical gafes are very numerous to list here, but you know that this movie is in trouble when you see the opening wreck, which looks like it was filmed in an aquarium. Also, a movie made in Texas should have real spiders and snakes instead of rubber. Gloriosa Eastmancolor gives this melodrama the gaudy appearance it so richly deserves. Fallon's first encounter with the Leprosy Countess is really horrifying, as is the farewell of the movie. If the rest had been a little distressing, THE DUNGEON OF HARROW would have been a horror classic. Instead, it's a funny trick that garbage thieves will love, for all the wrong reasons.
