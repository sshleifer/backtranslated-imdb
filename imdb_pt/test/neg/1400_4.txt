Stylized Hollywood Westerns, full of family conventions, seem to have eternal life and this is an avatar. Everything seems to have been ripped from the bottom of a 1939 drawer, a larger budget was applied, and this production was launched. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper has played this kind of role dozens of times - the Southern dislocated, fast in the draw and steadfast with honor, although it is easy whenever possible. He plays Blayde Hollister, who travels to Texas in search of the gang that destroyed his cotton plantation. He wears a fringed shirt and packs two ivory-cord shooters. He speaks with a country accent - "A guy can get hurt by doing that." (Cf., "Sgt. York.") The gang is led by contempt Raymond Massey, who buys and sells land, usually by covert means whenever possible. The gang includes Steve Cochran, who can not be a Westerner, despite being very good at slag bags in general. The woman requested is Ruth Roman, daughter of the owner of a Mexican plantation, who looks and speaks like Mexican as a brown betty from Boston. <br /> <br /> I do not think I'm going to bother too much with the plot. No doubt someone went into it in some detail and is not worth mentioning. As in any Western of 1939, it is labyrinthine. All but Cooper and his friends are disguised and there are multiple double crosses and exchanged identities and hidden secrets. <br /> <br /> Everything is retro. The plot, the dialogue, the wardrobe, even the music. The score is from the robust Max Steiner, from Warner. He's the guy who marked "King Kong." That was in 1932. This movie was released in 1950. Cooper's name, by the way - "Blayde Hollister" - led me to examine the records of the RACA - the Real American Cowboy Associaton - to see if that name appeared in his archives, dating from the beginning of time until February 4, 1911, when the last Royal Cowboy died due to an unfortunate encounter with a demented little pig. There was never a real cowboy named Blayde. Hollister, yes, but not Blayde. In fact, there is no record of any Real Cowboy named Wade, Luke, Cole or Matt. The most popular names for genuine cowboys, in descending order of frequency, were Clarence, Mortimer, Noble, Nebukadnezzar, Plauto, Pinchbeck and Hortense. <br /> <br /> If this movie had been released in 1939, it would be routine. In 1950, it is a calamitous monument in the history of human recycling.
