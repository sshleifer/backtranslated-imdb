The comments already left for this show are a lot funnier than the show itself and are all accurate. I feel exactly the same way, that I'm very disappointed with how Rick Mercer fell when he used to do some really good things in This Hour Has 22 Minutes, but now he's just doing antics, going places and talking to people. He does some excerpts from the studio about things happening in the news, but they're never funny, just really sad and predictable jokes about headlines. Most of his show is him going somewhere to talk to people, for example, this week he is going for a rodeo and the video pieces are all grimacing and acting scared of the wild horses, etc. It used to be funny, but it's been a lot less funny since This Hour Has 22 Minutes came out and this show is not funny either. Now that Air FARSA is out of the air (finally, thank goodness!) Mercer and This Hour Has 22 Minutes has to be next in line for the ax, just old and tired predictable comedy that hardly anyone finds funny anymore. Sadly, considering that Rick Mercer used to be the funniest man on Canadian TV!
