A film about an interesting and sensitive period of the story, filmed in beautiful scenes, was able to present an amazingly trivial production and clich√©, rough script, poor continuity, intrusive and dirty music, sugary cast and pale performance. <br /> <br /> It was a discussion between the script and the acting on what was worse. The script probably won - historical, historical and character descriptions were detailed with painful detail in the dialogue. .. in fact, words can not describe how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> In a pre-release exhibition, there was a great exodus of about thirty minutes. About an hour, many of those who remained were laughing loudly. I must add that I am a Francophile, I am fascinated by Canada and I love historical films. That really was an out.
