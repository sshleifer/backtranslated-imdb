How many disaster movies can exist before we get tired of them. Come on, we can see them on Discovery Channel all day. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment that the first part of this film is just a novel. The grandson of the Great Preditor makes a prediction and everyone begins to complain about how he is ruining the family name. The evil mother-in-law convinces the wife to throw him into the arms of her lover, whom she wants to know. Can you believe that? The wife wants to approve the new wife! At the same time, the lover has someone in love with her that does not have a wife, but she sends him away. <br /> <br /> Now that the novel is over, the earthquake appears. /> <br /> Special effects are really good, but dubbing is bad. That's why I like subtitled movies. The actors are all very experienced and have won many awards so you can see some of the best in Japan in a story often repeated. <br /> <br /> But the story of the novel returns with a complicated end.
