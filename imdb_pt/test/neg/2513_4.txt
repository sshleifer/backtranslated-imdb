Based on a story by Ray Bradbury; a professional photographer (Brian Kerwin) returns to his modest home near a small, deserted city where most citizens want him to stay away. A lonely boy (Jonathan Carrasco) clings to him for attention; and the two witness the landing of an alien ship in the rocky desert. The aliens become the images of the people of the city. Kerwin must convince the evacuation of the city and falls in love with the mother of the young person (Elizabeth Pena). Acting is very superficial; the plot is not worse than others; This movie leaves you feeling that you have been shortened to a decent end. The supporting cast includes: Howard Morris, Dean Norris and Mickey Jones.
