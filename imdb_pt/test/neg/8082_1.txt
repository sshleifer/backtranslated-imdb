Oh the science fiction channel. How many times do you disappoint me? Many times I think: have you ever shown good movies? OK, you gave me the great heroes and the reasonably good 'The Lost Room', but they're series, and as for the movie, there's nothing positive to say. Bad acting, bad direction, terrible characters and a superficial story, and that's just for starters. I checked director Allan A Goldstien and was not surprised not to find anything interesting on his resume (in fact, I'm kind of thought this is a pseudo-name). The facilities of four motorcyclists in a national park when one of them has an accident that needs a ranger to rescue them just to be caught in a forest fire is weak and predictable as you know every beat before it happens. Leader Bryan Genesse, the park ranger, is so bad it's terrible. Cast as the action hero kid martial arts in the footsteps of so many others that this guy does Seagal and Van Damme look like De Nero. The support cast is a bit better and well before the end, waiting for the fire to wrap them all up, then the film crew. Avoid at all costs
