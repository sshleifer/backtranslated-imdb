This is the worst movie I've ever seen, as well as the worst I'll probably see. I do not see a need to redo what everyone else said earlier, just be warned ... <br /> <br /> This is not one of those bad movies that you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun , is simply bad bad bad bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is the equivalent of having a "pet rock" as your friend. You wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen. Unfortunately, this never happens. At least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into. The Lion Gate completely fools this bomb ... No ... this is a disaster. After watching this movie, you could swear that George W. Bush had his hands all over the film ... yes, he's such an idiot. <br /> <br /> Stay away unless you just want to watch the movie. worst movie of all time. It's probably like Lion's Gate imagined that he would make some money with this piece of gut.
