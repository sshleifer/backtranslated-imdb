From the creators of Underworld, we have by far the worst werewolf movie I have ever seen. It's basically a rebuilt version of the underworld, but no vampires (no big deal), cool effects (a big deal), and generally all that can be done to produce a decent movie about lycanthropy (the biggest deal of them all!) . A twenty-something chocolate coffee maker named Vivian is currently living in Romania since her family was hunted and executed in front of her years in America for being werewolves. There she belongs to a small society (or group) of werewolves and apparently is chosen to marry against the leader of the pack, Gabriel, whose son - some frog with British accent - decides to hunt outside the herd. They have apparently been discovered in other countries before and want to remain established in Romania, avoiding negative attention, so of course such activity is considered prohibited. Vivian ends up falling in love with an American artist who is unaware of her involvement with the group of bloodthirsty predators. When they end up discovering the secret relationship, things get confused when someone is killed and the human is forced to participate in a deadly tradition in which he is loosed in the forest and is hunted - giving the pack the chance to become his "wolfy The whole movie is like a tamed underworld with a few romantic montages and very little action.Watching this in the theater, I could not. A devastating and boring deception.
