I watched this on cable because I was a big Leelee fan. Big mistake. What a horrible movie. You do not care at all about any of the characters in the movie. Chris Klein plays a guy who is a complete idiot in the movie and steals Josh Hartnett's longtime girlfriend. If the writer knew what they were doing, this movie would have followed the proven formula, and made Hartnett an ass, and Leelee as the girlfriend trapped in a bad relationship, from which she is saved by Klein. But Hartnett is a really cool guy, who shows a lot of excitement and love for Leelee. <br /> <br /> You then hate leelee because she betrays Hartnett with Klein, who is an idiot to everyone in the city who is trying to help him and really stuck. <br /> <br /> He is also very exaggerated, and the characters do everything but walk around the kitchen dancing and doing lip sync, using hairbrushes, spoons and fake microphones (although they do come close). What a horrible horrible movie. You do not even care what happens in the end because the director never lets you care about the characters.
