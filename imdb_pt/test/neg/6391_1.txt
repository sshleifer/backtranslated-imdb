I never intended to write a review of that movie. Actually, I was just looking at the name of the movie star and then I started to read reviews ... I guess I'll never learn. This movie is horrible! I will not justify my comments with specific reasons because I really find it hard to believe someone with some taste really likes it. A guilty pleasure? Okay, I think. But such a bad movie that wasted so good talent (Caine, Gelbart, and Donen) is a motive to mourn not a pleasant diversion. A low point for everyone involved except, perhaps, Bologna, who should sit at night trying to figure out which bomb was the bomb that destroyed his career.
