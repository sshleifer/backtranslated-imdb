Red Spectacles <br /> <br /> I loved Avalon, I think this director made some insane visions of the future. This film, however, was pretentious and boring crap. The opening scene showed great promise for what the cover art and description promise a live action surreal amimae style future noir. I feel like I have this with Avalon. With the Red Glasses, I was only led to feel discomfort when I wondered what the hell that was. The movie barely made sense to me and I could not care less about the people in it. That would all be okay if the movie was an effective art. Although the opening scene seemed interesting and the scene with the giant robot-suit holding the giant machine gun in the rain seemed cool, she did not watch the movie that deserved to be seen. <br /> <br /> Thumbs down.
