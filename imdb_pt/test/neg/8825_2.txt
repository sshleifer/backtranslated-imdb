Othello is set to burn the eyes of viewers of this film. The misrepresentation of Shakespeare's characters, and the terrible interpretation of the love that Desi and John had, made this film the terrible dirt it is. By far, Othello, directed by Jeffery Saks, is beyond mediocre and atrocious. <br /> <br /> The film Othello is a pitiful drama about the love between John and Desi. Your fidelity to each other will be tested by the friend of man. In the opening scene of the film, it is clearly shown that the love between John and Desdemona is inseparable beyond belief. Moments later, Ben Jago, John's friend, appears on the screen scaring the viewers and immediately shows them how much he is a liar and hungry for power. From far away, this film was far more horrible than Shakespeare's own novel. With that said, it has a minuscule amount of good parts. For example, the love that was shown between John and Desi was described very well and it seemed that the couple was so inseparable; as was explained in the book. Although the love between them was shown exceptionally well, it still did not show the envy that Othello had between Cass and Desi as well as he should have. <br /> <br /> Love, jealousy and falsehood, this movie is based on the three main topics of Shakespeare's novel. The novel, however, explains how all this was so much better than the movie. For example, the conclusion of this story ends much more differently in the book than in the film. Much more detail is also placed in the novel. That's why this movie is a disappointment, trust me, those who read it will find it disappointing too. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie was by far the most horrendous representation of a novel that has already been published by mankind. By avoiding watching this movie, viewers will not only save an hour and a half of their lives, but will also protect themselves from an eye or two of Ben Jago's unpleasant face.
