You can see that if the movie is not directed by your brother, that's the best he can do. It's sad to say that the best of it just does not cut it. "Ice Cream Man" is a very bizarre horror movie, which is a real blast to see if you are in the mood. In a bad mood, it is known that people violently attack loved ones, so please watch carefully. Clint Howard star (Did something really star Clint Howard?) "evil" "psycho" "bizarre" (Yes, all quotes, he's not any of those but he's getting close ) man of ice cream, who tortures the local kids with bombs that are really melty and ice cream that cut off humans and dogs in them. Ick. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot is just an excuse to show the ... well, the ... um, well, it's a plot. Oh wait, I know! It's an excuse to show all the loser's actors! There are Jan Michael Vincent and Lee Majors II (The sequel?) Like cops tracking the elusive man of the ice cream. And even Doug Lleyweln appears as a supermarket clerk. <br /> <br /> Even better than that, it's some of the bizarre idiots in the movie. I really like the fact that for some reason, instead of hiring a fat actor to play the unhappy "fat boy" of the group, they just make that kid a kid wearing clothes under his clothes. And the whole premise that someone would go for scoops of ice cream from an ice-cream man. Who buys ice cream balls from the ice cream maker? Then there is the whole scene of the psychiatric ward, in which the performance of Jan Michael Vincent ranges from mildly interested to bored beyond the state of consciousness. These are the cops who also scour the Ice Cream Man for clues, but manage to complete the glare on the ice cream truck (where, of course, the various bodies and objects are kept). Oh, well, better luck next time troops. <br /> <br /> Howard himself acts as if making sure people from two cities can see and hear him. Everything is just stupid. And fun enough to laugh at in the good tradition of The Pumaman or Gymkata. You will have a good laugh with the right sense of HUMOR. I love this. <br /> <br />
