It's just a bad movie. Not as bad as the R.I.C.C.O. But it got me hooked at first, so I totally lost it after that. The acting was very far and then going very far. Do not watch this movie at all costs, trust me with all my heart! The directors who are brothers are not the next HUGHES BROTHERS, who made great films like DEAD PRESIDENTS, HELL, AMERICAN PIMP and MENACE II SOCIETY. The only person who made me watch this was the performance of Paris Campbell who will be a great actor one day if he makes better films than that. Christina Caparoula also did a good job for what she got. I hope FITTEST is 10 times better than this piece of crap!
