Like many other people, I heard about "more" and I wanted to watch it because of the song that was composed by Pink Floyd. I must say that I was really disappointed, not because of the song, but because of the movie itself. It's a boring, tasteless movie that has no rhythm. Where does this disappointment come from? According to me, of different things. First of all, the subject of the film, the drug binds badly with the movie's idyllic sunny atmosphere. This should have happened in the sordid areas of Paris and should have given rise to a gloomy and defenseless climate, for example. Moreover, it is supposed to count a descent into hell, but this descent is softened and poorly sketched. Barbet Schroeder does not dwell enough on the dramatic side of the story. You might have wanted a little more madness, cut. On the other hand, Schroeder can not win the emotion and the public's adhesion in the anguish of the two main characters. You carelessly watch your drug trials. Considering the two main actors, they are perfectly expressionless and hardly evolve during the film, especially Mimsy Farmer. In the end, you only retain the beauty of the Mediterranean landscapes bathed in sunlight. The film created a huge sensation when it was released in 1969. Nowadays, it looks dated. Hippie culture is nothing short of a distant memory.
