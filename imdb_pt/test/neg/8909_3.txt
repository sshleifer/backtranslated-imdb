The movie quickly arrives at a major chase scene with increasing destruction. The first really bad thing is that the guy hijacker Steven Seagal would have been beaten to the pulp by Seagal's direction, but that would have probably ended the whole premise of the movie. <br /> <br /> It seems like they've decided to make all sorts of changes to the movie's plot, so just plan on taking advantage of the action, and do not expect a coherent plot. Turn any sense of logic you may have, this will reduce your chance of having a headache. <br /> <br /> I really hope that Steven Seagal is trying to get back to the kind of characters he portrayed in his life. most popular movies.
