Reaching the ground running, the film begins with three killings in a row. No plot, no characters, no motivation; the second murder happens off-screen, and the victim's severed head is used to snatch the third victim fairly efficiently to the death! This is a high point. But the Lewises are obviously smart enough to lead hard; soon they are shrouding scenes of badly crafted dialogues with the voice of detective and taking endless and awkward sarcasm in a grand ugly plane. Now the horror atmosphere of Betacam's production is quickly giving way to an insurance infomercial vibe, with the monumental (and rather friendly) clarity of the leads, further distorting things in that direction. Shlub cop investigates, meat cuttlefish face massacres, repeat, early climax with a memorable cut-finger-in-the-salad gag. Just how the fingers went into the salad? And the purpose of the blood cult was not to collect the appendages that they separated? When GORE stops making sense, you know you're in trouble. And without ruining the great and absurd final turnaround, just take my word: the fascinating incompetence of the first scenes gives way to a deep impulse to break cathode tubes. The basic reaction is to try to leave behind and move on with your life.
