Obviously it seems like a lot of people really liked this movie, and that's wonderful. It's certainly a very well-intentioned film, and I appreciate it in an era of heartless or emotionally damaging movies. Unfortunately, the film has many problems and was not something I enjoyed watching. <br /> <br /> The main problem is writing. It's not very funny. When something tries to be grumpy or witty and fails, this is much worse than when you have tried nothing. This film is to a large extent a series of "quick" but delicate returns among adult members of the family, none of whom looks creative or fit. There are also some central premises in the film that seem too much of a coincidence or character motivation to be believable or actually working. Part of the story seemed more intriguing, and served to decorate the story around the edges reasonably well, but could not make up for the moment-to-moment leveling that pervaded almost the entire film. <br /> <The direction / edit also does not support the movie, though I do not know how to explain exactly how. Somehow things always seemed false to me, and the actors were forcing the passage of unnatural material most of the time. They tried, and I do not blame anyone here. There were also many small and unassuming roles in her out of the immediate family. <br /> <br /> It's not a good rental in my opinion, although apparently a number of people have found it very charming (I'm 38; I suspect that maybe people over 60 might like this movie better ?).
