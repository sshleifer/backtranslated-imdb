Uggh! Hanna-Barbera from the 60's and 70's! What horrible and countless caricatures were imposed on us by these hacks! It's a pity, in the 1940s and 1950s, "Hanna-Barbera" meant quality - because they produced so many wonderful drawings of Tom and Jerry. However, with the major cost cutting efforts of the late 1950s, cartoons in general began to look very poor and budgets were reduced. In fact, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera were sacked by MGM and replaced by a team of Czech animators who had never seen the original cartoons! Then in the late 1950s, the team was unemployed and decided "if you can not beat them, join them" - and started producing horrible little designs - with horrible animation, backgrounds and writing. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate, but the production of the bad cartoon team worked very well - making them rich and successful producers of the 60s and 70s. During that time, again and again, poor production figures were his norm and a long list of VERY forgettable cartoons was created. In this case, the incredibly bad INCH HIGH PRIVATE EYE - a completely dull and stupid idea. If you want to know about what the program was, the title says it all. <br /> <br /> It rotten to the core and strong evidence that the production team had utter contempt for us children!
