"The King is Alive" is a flawed mess of a movie that comes off as a self-indulgent excuse from the author to transport a lot of actors to a Namforsaken Namib desert where he can play great Dogme-domo and film his selfishly designed drama silly and exaggerated, with total disrespect for the real forces of human nature, market appeal, common sense and even good art. In other words, this is a stupid movie and if you do not believe it, your penance is watching. Only for filmmakers, critics, dilettantes and the like. (D)
