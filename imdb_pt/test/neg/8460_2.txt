If this was nominated for a screenplay award by WGA, a professional association of screenwriters, then it's time to turn off the word processor. Surprisingly inept writing, directing, producing, at all levels, even for a TV movie. No clich√© remains unexplored in this jaw-dropping movie. What were they thinking? Does anyone really believe that kids are stupid enough to watch this?
