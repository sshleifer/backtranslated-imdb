* Warning: 1 small inconsistent spoiler * You're right. This was not Bridges of Madison County. As soon as the lone woman and Richard Gere checked into the big empty hotel, it was an inescapable conclusion that something amusing would happen. The question is: how will this happen? The answer is a stupid hook-up story that is not worth analyzing. In a supposed union experience, they get drunk and clean the closet of old cans (this was my spoiler). And the next day they put them back. LOL It was not convincing at all. I am an old married woman like the one in the movie and my friendships are more interesting than the romance with Richard Gere. I LAUGHED A LOT . . . He had that advantage. You go away and go, oh brother. . . even I could have written something more believable than that. I think my life is not as monotonous as I thought it would be if I could mock a romance with Richard Gere. I LAUGHED A LOT! And that friend inherited that all-contemporary mansion, probably computer-generated, resting in the ocean, from his GRANDFATHER who built it AFTER THE CIVIL WAR? Maybe your grandmother is Oprah and that was well after the Civil War? And yes, WHERE WAS THE EMAIL? In what alternate universe do these people live? I never want to see another movie that pretends we do not have email, facebook and text messages. And, OK, maybe these people have a horrible aversion to broadcasting news over the phone, but do not ask me to believe anyone in this age of instant communication that someone just drops into your life without calling first.
