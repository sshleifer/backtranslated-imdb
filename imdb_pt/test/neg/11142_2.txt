I like underground movies when they have something to say, or show, for that matter. I tried a lot like "Trash". I tried to see some artistic achievement, or some interesting representation of New York life in the early 70's. Or at least be entertained by it? But the film stinks and can not be called either art or entertainment. <br /> <br /> "Trash" is basically an excuse to expose Joe Dallesandro's naked body for 2 hours while he encounters other uninteresting and annoying figures. I agree, this is a beautiful body, but there's no excuse for a whole movie about it, right?). Holly Woodlawn, as Joe's girlfriend, gives some good laughs to the end, but it's too late to save those wasted hours. Lou Reed's classic music, "Walk on the Wild Side" is a better portrait of these people and of that era, even more fascinating than they really were. 1.5 / 10.
