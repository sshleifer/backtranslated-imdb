This movie was so bad. It was not at all funny. Not even the sarcastic scenes were funny. Oh man, bad, so bad. Thumbs down. Spoofed, Karate Kid, Teen Wolf, Footloose, Dirty Dancing, Some Kind of Wonderful, Soul Man, and probably another or two. Chris Kattan in the worst case, as the high school janitor who is a talented dancer who runs a dance studio in a warehouse. He has a jealous girlfriend who breaks his ankle and his dance point goes to the blond newbie Chris has eyes for. I thought the acting was really bad. I like laughing comedies out loud, that was not one of them. "Not Another Teen Movie" was not funny, but it had much funnier scenes than Totally Awesome. "Scary Movie" is funny suuuper. I always laugh when I watch, super nice. This movie is not funny.
