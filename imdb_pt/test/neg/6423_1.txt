Recently released on DVD in the USA; stay away from it. <br /> <br /> I usually give enough room for stupidity in horror films; I'll settle for almost everything remotely suspense, supernatural, scary, or even just a vaguely interesting concept. This simply stank. I knew there were problems when Sara's "best friend" in college, who had considerable screen time, was not even listed in IMDb credits! I was not surprised not to recognize any actor, but that character ("Daysha" or "Day-Glo" or whatever her name) apparently did not even exist! <br /> <br /> I'm so embarrassed that I actually paid a rental fee for this junk; deeply, deeply ashamed ...
