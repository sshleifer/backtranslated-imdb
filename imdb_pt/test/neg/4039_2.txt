As you can tell from the other reviews, this movie is just about the worst movie ever made. Let me see how many different words I can use to describe this: boring, unbearable, laughable, lousy, stupid, horrible ... <br /> <br /> I could go on with these descriptions, but you'll probably have a point. <br /> <br /> I would have given a 0, if possible - bad acting, bad direction, bad production, bad plot. <br /> <br /> This was done in 2001 and looks more like 1965. Very low budget, annoying plot, horrible acting, very bad special effects, etc ... <br /> <br /> I rarely see one science fiction movie that I absolutely think is so bad. I mean, this is just crap. There is nothing for that either. As for a "B movie", this is the lowest point of the lot. <br /> <br /> I think I'd be more entertained by looking at a blank piece of paper for 90 minutes. Trash like this gives good low budget movies "B" a bad name. That makes Ed Wood's films look good. <br /> <br /> The thing about watching direct movies is exactly when you think you've seen the worst, you see something even worse! <br /> <br /> DJ Perry is a horrible actor and has no individual features that make him stand out. <br /> <br /> Avoid this waste at all costs! Oh mankind!
