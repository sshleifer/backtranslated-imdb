When you sit down to watch this movie, keep in mind that you are about to see something that you have probably never seen before. Keep in mind that this is a movie in which they obviously spent insane amounts of money on explosions and not enough to act or anything else for that matter. The craziest thing I've noticed is that each character is completely portrayed, and it seems (most of the time anyway) that the movie was "sped up" to make the characters move faster! (I wonder if the Hong Kong version was also dubbed?) I understand that the cartoon had this, but it does not work for live-action. It seems strange ... as if the film crew decided to act because it could not afford real actors. <br /> <br /> The English version is terribly dubbed, and the character's words do not match the mouths. I would have preferred subtitles, but as this is a children's film, and as some children do not know how to read well, I let it go. But there is something extremely strange about this movie. It's supposed to be a kid's movie, but there's a lot of stuff about SEX, RAPE, and STRIPPING that is not exactly for the young western audience. (In the East, they have different laws and sexuality in children's films is much more accepted). But parents are warned! There is a scene in which two characters talk about rape, several scenes in which people say 'sexual maniac' and a scene in which this young Japanese insanely does a sexy dance for one of the 'sex maniacs' and shows off her breasts! Whose film was it made of? <br /> <br /> Oh, and the special effects are laughable. You may say that the spaceship-like things that bombard the village are cardboard cutouts (or animation, I was not sure) that seem unconvincing, even to a child. The creators of this movie left out many cool cartoon things simply because they could not budge the kind of money they needed. I did not like how the names of all the characters were changed ... it made me wonder if this movie was made by the same people as Dragon Ball Z. <br /> <br /> I really do not recommend this movie to anyone. Kids, adults or fans of Dragon Ball Z. It's just a poor representation of the cartoon and obviously someone will be able to say that this movie was rushed and that no kind of care was put into it. I'm not even going to get into camera work ... just wait until the final credits on the still image that stays there for 2 minutes ... most of the scenes are not framed correctly and the movie seems to be made by amateurs. Quality of granulated film too <br /> <br /> Just horrible !!!! <br /> <br />
