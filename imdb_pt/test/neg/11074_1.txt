The person who wrote the summary and criticism for this movie is either an idiot or an avid fan of shitty movies. From the beginning, this was all about a cheap imitation of "The Descent," a much superior film that definitely does not start slow. From the earliest moments of The Cavern, I was amazed at how bad it was, how unoriginal and unpretentious it was, how poorly written, misrepresented, and misdirected it was. This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life, and that's saying a lot considering I recently suffered from "Pulse." I can not believe this piece of junk has really won awards, which only serves to show that the quality of marijuana and other illegal drugs is much better in Australia and in other countries than in the US. <br /> <br /> The scenes in which the group that is fleeing from the "creature" is misdirected, especially the retarded "inverted camera", intended to show disorientation but only coming off as a cheap effect that a film student Unfortunately, this "director" will probably make other films, probably of the same quality as this "movie", since I'm sure he did not learn from his mistakes, which in this photo were excessive. <br /> <br /> If I had my way, all the cast and crew would be sent to the river for life without parole. This movie is a crime against humanity.
