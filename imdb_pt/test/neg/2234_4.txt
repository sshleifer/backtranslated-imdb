This is the second addition to the trilogy of Oz films produced personally by Frank Baum. It is essentially the same childishness as the other two images, although I consider it preferable to the other ones because it is shorter. As in other films, there are artists in animal costumes, an adult woman pretends to be a boy, and the characters and plot jump all over the place while the camera work is static. This time in the center there is a magic cloak that grants wishes, and the boy played by a woman is made king. <br /> <br /> Most of the special effects are witnessed at the beginning. Fairies are represented by multiple exposure photography. And there is a man on the moon who looks like those made by Georges Méliès years before, most notably in 'Le Voyage dans la lune' (1902). Méliès' creative fantasies and creative effects made him the leading pioneer of old cinema, and the films he made around the turn of the century were far better and technically more advanced than this insignificant Oz series.
