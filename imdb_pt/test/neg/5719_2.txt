Possible Spoilers As Peter Jackson has shown so brilliantly in his "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, it is quite possible to make good, even great, movies within the heroic fantasy genre. The genre distinguished literary antecedents, which go back to medieval knighthood novels, particularly the Arthurian legends, on which Tolkien and other authors drew. "Lord of the Rings," however, it is hard to think of any other sword and witchcraft movie that is good. I would agree with the reviewer who said that the best of a bad group was Ron Howard's Willow, and even that achieved little distinction apart from being a merely mediocre film as opposed to a positively bad movie. "Red Sonja," however, can not achieve the still more modest distinction of being simply a bad movie as opposed to a shocking movie. As with "Willow," many of the plot elements in "Red" Sonja are derived from "The Lord of the Rings". An evil ruler seeks to gain control of an artifact with supernatural powers in order to achieve an ambition for world domination, but is thwarted by a diverse group of heroes. The film, set in the Hyborian Age, a barbaric era in the remote past of Earth, begins with the villain of the play, the evil queen Gedren, making unwelcome sexual advances to the heroine Sonja. When these are rejected, Gedren (not a woman to take no for an answer) reacts by killing Sonja's parents and brother. (In 1985, presumably, it was still considered politically correct not only to make the main villain a woman but also to make one of the main motives of his villainy frustrate the lust of lesbians). <br /> <br /> Gedren's next step is to capture the Talisman, a kind of fluorescent green soccer ball with magical powers, slaughtering the all-clad priestess in charge to protect him, just as they are about to destroy because they feel that their powers have become too dangerous. Among the dead is Sonja's sister, her only surviving relative. Sonja herself, however, was not idle, but enrolled in a martial arts academy, which forms summa cum laude, and decides to take revenge. Along the way, she joins Kalidor, a heroic swordsman king who resembles Tolkien's Aragorn, Prince Tarn, the spoiled childish ruler of a kingdom that fell to the powers of Gedren, and Falkon, the loyal servant of Tarn. The rest of the film is quite predictable, as Sonja and her allies try to overthrow Gedren and prevent the destruction of the Talisman's world out of control. <br /> <br /> What does that do? movie so bad? Well, acting to begin with. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Kalidor gives the typical type of wood and poker face performance that became his trademark, at least early in his career, complete with a strong foreign accent. Compared to Brigitte Nielsen as the heroine, however, he looks like Laurence Olivier. Miss Nielsen seems to have had even worse language difficulties, delivering every line in the toneless, mechanical voice of someone who has just completed the third lesson of a "teaching yourself English by correspondence" course. One wonders if she was hired for the role just to make Arnie look good by comparison. The other characters, though not conducting their own private struggles against the English language, are just caricatured cartoons, especially Prince Tarn, who must be one of the most odious young men in history. <br /> <br /> A failure even worse than that of English. The bad acting, however, is the almost complete lack of imagination of the film. This is a particularly glaring flaw in a fantasy film, since films of this genre must rely on their imaginative power to persuade the public to suspend the natural feelings of disbelief that would be brought about by a fantastic plot. When we watch Peter Jackson's masterpiece, we can convince ourselves, at least for the next three hours, that we are in Middle-earth, that elves, magicians, and hobbits really exist, and that the fate of the world really depends on the destruction of a ring Magic. When we watch `Red Sonja ', we are not persuaded of anything except that we are watching a bunch of bad-accented actors fighting each other on a slope for possession of a lime-green soccer ball. <br /> <br /> This lack of imagination even begins with the title of the movie. British science fiction author Brian Aldiss, when asked about the exotic names given to his characters, replied that there was no point in creating a fictional alien society with its own culture if you were to spoil the effect by calling Joe's hero. . (Admittedly, Tolkien was able to escape by the name of Sam to one of his main characters, but that was because Hobbits should be comfortingly familiar, the equivalent of Middle-earth tweed tube, English men). Similarly, giving the heroine of a ostensibly defined tale in a long lost barbaric age, a name of ordinary girls like "Sonia" (which is how the name "Sonja" is pronounced) is as appropriate as calling it " Betty "or" Mary-Jane. "The film seems to have been made on a very small budget, which makes me wonder why they bothered. Fantasy has to be done convincingly or not It was obviously filmed in a remote mountainous area with little or no attempt to suggest a distinct culture.The few buildings we see, such as the Talisman temple or Gedren's palace, are obviously cheap sets. destroyed by Gedren using the power of the Talisman, but in fact we do not see this event, all we see is what could be a storm on the other side of a hill.At first you wonder how Sonja intends to overthrow an entire kingdom with only a few allies, but when I go you see how small an army Gedren has at his disposal, this becomes more understandable. When an earthquake threatens to destroy the palace, you wonder if this is the Talisman in action or only one crew member inadvertently leaning against the stage. If we can enjoy this movie for nothing else, we can at least take advantage of it by its inadvertent humor; a good example of film school so bad is funny. Ed Wood would be proud of that. If it had been shown on Californian television the night before the recall election, Gray Davis would still be the governor. 2/10
