I will never, ever, ever forget to watch this show around the age of thirteen. Even at a young age, I remember thinking, "This is a Baywatch show without the only thing that makes Baywatch tolerable. Girls in bathing suits." However, I was too small in those days to be the remote control holder in my house. The high point of Pacific Blue was an episode in which a couple of gangsters are coming to beat someone with machine guns ... on motorcycles !!! At thirteen I never laughed so hard at something I should be taken seriously. Even I knew that the task of going out and getting Uzis (for murder) is a task that should never come before borrowing someone's car for the day. That was the turning point of this show. Simple Crimes and situations tailored by hack, so they could be taken care of by the unknown hero of the crime fighting world The Bike Cop. It does not get much dumber.
