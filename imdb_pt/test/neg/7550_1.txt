I had seen Rik Mayall in Blackadder and the New Statesman, so I thought I'd try the movie. <br /> <br /> Around 4 pm I bought, around 8 pm I started to watch, around 8:15 pm I quickly sent the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for one human being with a brain ... but there was not. Around 8:45 p.m., I threw the DVD into the trash. And that's where this "movie" belongs. <br /> <br /> What happened to British humor? The witty, witty, witty, witty humor you find in Sim, Minister, Blackadder, Vicar of Dibley, Fawlty Towers, or The Fast Show? The black humor that Britain is so famous? I do not want to insult anyone, but I presume even stupid kids do not find it funny. They deserve smarter fun. And Rik Mayall, you can do better, so please do!
