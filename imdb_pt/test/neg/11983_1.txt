Not a very good movie. Of course, it contains action, but the effects are not so good for a 2008 movie. Shooting effects are downright horrible. Acting is "meh" <br /> <br /> It's nothing like Far Cry, as well as names and the basics of history (super genetically engineered soldiers going crazy). The super soldiers are very different, the mercenaries are different, the scenery is completely different (tropical island in the pacific in the game, island in North America in the movie). <br /> <br /> I love playing Far Choro. I loved the history and the scenery. I hated the movie.
