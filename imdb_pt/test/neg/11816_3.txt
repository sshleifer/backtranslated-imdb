The title pretty much lets you know what you're getting. It's a Grade C howler monkey, but not as blatantly funny as I'd hoped. Directed by filmmaker Eddie Romero from a story that originally came from Jonathan Demme (long before directing "Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia"), this 1972 low-budget film was obviously filmed in the Philippines but set in some anonymous. third World country. Playing prostitute and drug dealer Lee Daniels, blaxploitation superstar Pam Grier plays the first half of the title role, while Margaret Markov long forgotten is the other half, Karen Brent, an unlikely revolutionary-like policy Patty Hearst wants to partner with his comrades to overthrow the oppressive local government. Naturally antagonistic to each other, they are in a prisoner's camp for women where they wear inexplicably shiny yellow mini-skirts as uniforms. Directed by a closed director and a lascivious matron, the jail is just an excuse for a long bath scene and a cat-fight indifferent, as Lee and Karen are against each other. Of course, they escape, but handcuffed to "The Defiant Ones" and keep fighting until they attack some nuns to steal their habits. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, various groups of men chase - the loutish dealer looking for Lee who stole him $ 40,000, the passive revolutionaries looking for Karen, and the incompetent police (who suffers the humiliation of exposing their to the trafficker). Needless to say, everything ends up coming to a head, but not before free nudity by a number of Filipino women, a dog wears Karen's panties and some of the worst male fashion from the 1970's (a potbellied revolutionary uses a leather top with a straight face). There is a rather sad ending, but what is truly sad is how much potential black comedy is lost entirely in this absurdly hilarious exercise. Unfortunately, Grier is disappointing on this tour because his character does not have much to do but deal with all the "participants", while Markov is a blonde Amazonian who I am convinced is desperately trying to have credibility. Since no one has a talent for acting, the rest of the cast is not worthy of notice, except Sid Haig, bald and bulging-eyed, who uses his standard psychic personality as a drug dealer. The 2003 DVD contains only the original trailer as an extra.
