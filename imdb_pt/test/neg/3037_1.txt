Unlike most critics here, I hated this movie simply because the writer's / director's bloated ego was in the way of a potentially interesting topic. Many movie fans equate "EXTREME self-indulgence" with "GENIUS!", But I do not buy this cult of personality. A movie should be about it, not its director (unless it's a Woody Allen movie, of course). * SPOILER * (which is good, spare your time ...) There's nothing shiny about showing you the pornographic star of a foot you know - in the last frame - which is actually called a tacky maneuver that SCREAMS hackism of cinema-school. <br /> <br /> Has the poseur film achieved "great movie" status based on its indulgence and favoritism to the public? which, in the first place, is the writer / director. But the rest of the audience should also disregard the brutal and aggressive nature of pornography. The film had an indifferent angle to the porn industry, looking at all the players who could attack. It does not matter, just love your writer / director. I love those four-minute steadicam segments, which supposedly show the energy of the moment, but somehow had all the vibration of a switch turned off. Love the story - no matter how boring - about the rise and sordid fall of a porn star. But look down too, of course. While the subject has the potential to be fascinating? innocence, money, degradation, beauty - your writer / director somehow managed to make everything look, again, DULL. Partly because of its runtime. Here's something that your author hero did not try: Give the dimension of characters. Or soul. Anything to give a joke about, other than the genius Paul is, of course. But I'm not buying. I do not buy into indulgent hacks with amazing hype. <br /> <br /> Another piece of autonomous hacker, with fifty times more publicity than quality. I know some of you agree. The rest will probably see this indulgent movie again. It's not my problem.
