I just watched this because I saw a couple of good reviews for this so I was hoping for at least a half way cheese movie. Toybox will not even deliver that. There are so many problems with this movie, that I do not even know where to start, so I'll list some of the major issues (again, spoiler warning. Just read them, you'll save it later). <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie begins with, and often mentions, the mythical folklore of both Celeste Noir (A Witch, which the main character claims she is the reincarnation of), as in the middle folker (or something like that, an evil man with a big smile who cuts people off with hooks and sells his bowels in pies). I liked that, it was a cute concept, anything to do with pies is just nice. But then you watch the movie and it's all about that stupid girl and her boyfriend. (And what was the matter with him?) Was he psychic, did he have powers, why did he keep seeing visions that even the so-called Witch had not? That's what most of this movie is, arguing, and they barely touch on the so-called myth again, except in some confusing scenes that you can not make faces or crowns. <br /> <br /> In one scene, Berenice (The main character related to witches) wanders and does some kind of ritual by candlelight. It seemed to me quite important, but absolutely NOTHING happened after she did it, she just wasted more of my time. <br /> <br /> And who the hell was that guy with your dog? You see him walking towards the house from the beginning of the movie with that evil dog of eyes red, and then he finally gets there and is dead? He was the half-folker? Was your dog possessed? Someone killed the dog? They never showed it. Besides, any scene involving the vicar was completely useless and only served to explain the lame end weakly. It was as if they had all these interesting character ideas and they all came to naught! The boyfriend, who obviously had some kind of power, but never explains them. The grandmother, who also seemed to have some kind of witch power, but never used them. The Vicar, who ... OK, never mind, there was really no reason for his existence. And then there was Berenice and her stupid amulet. Could she really do magic, or did she just use it to reflect light and blind people? This was a complete waste of time, and the only reason I give it two stars is because a) Berenice is kind of cute, and b) mentioned pies. Save yourself the money from renting this and dear god, do not even think about buying it, unless wasting money is a new fad.
