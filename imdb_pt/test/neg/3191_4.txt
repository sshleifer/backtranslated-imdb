I usually do not watch Hollywood dribble, but I was dragged along with some friends to see this one, which ended up being fun in places but totally devoid of any originality. Do not worry, you will not have to think - the Tarantino-type plot leaves enough obvious tips so we can accurately predict where this is happening fifteen minutes before each "turnaround" - I was left there worried that the movie was building very well for a Hollywood movie, but that would have nowhere to go in climax. And boy, my fears were realized - the YMCA could not save this, but Liv Tyler almost succeeded. I suppose being a man and my early twenties helped, but she did a great job - obviously she did not have to do much except look incredibly sexy, but what she did was fine! McCOOL'S certainly will not be one of Hollywood's greatest hits (or should I say "should not" because the dominant American film industry is not going anywhere at the moment, and has not for at least a decade saved the odd hit as AMERICAN BEAUTY , TITANIC and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and even those had major flaws), but if you're a teenager, do yourself a favor and see Liv - she's hot. Rating: 5/10. See also: Anything from Quentin Tarantino, any American teen movie of the last decade, anything with sex as its main selling point.
