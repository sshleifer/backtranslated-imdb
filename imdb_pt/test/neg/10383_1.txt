Let me tell you one thing ... this movie exceeds all laughter Troma and gore the movies with hands down, as it really tries to come across a serious movie. From the terrible performance ... "I knew, I knew she was possessed!" ... for the priest to accept sexual favors and enter a shower with naked teenagers ... this piece of manure takes the cake. I'm lost trying to compare this with another equally bad movie. This may only be in a class of its own. The kicker is supposed to have some Cardinal supervised the production to make sure it was true to the actual situation. I did not know that the people at Backwoods USA act like absolute jerks. I'm not sure if I'm bothered by renting or stumbling on a comedy gem. This was a very guilty pleasure ... so horrible that I watched with his hands over his eyes half the time (while I was not laughing so much that I was crying). The ending just did not make any sense, bringing the whole thing together perfectly. If you want to watch something so horrible that's funny, here's your movie. If you want a horror movie in the exorcism .... move on.
