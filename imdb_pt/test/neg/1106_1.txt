I usually love this kind of movie. However, this time I found myself wanting to kick the screen. Since I can not do that, I'll just complain about it. That was absolutely stupid. Things that happen to dead children are really cool, but living people are absolute idiots. I am a grown man, very big and can defend myself well. However, I would not do half the things the girl does in this movie. In addition, the mother in this movie is reckless with her children to the point of neglecting. I wish I was not so angry with her and her actions because I would have liked the movie. What a number she was, take my advice and move quickly on everything you see until the end. Also, is someone else tired of watching movies that are filmed so dark? Once again, one can hardly see what is being filmed. As a public, we are impossibly involved with the actions on the screen. So why the hell can not we have night vision?
