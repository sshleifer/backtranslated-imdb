First, let me mention the fact that, despite its title ("Stories" in the plural), there is only ONE Kitchen Story. As to whether Isak died or not at the end, I'm not so sure, for in one of the last scenes, HIS PIPE is seen lying on the table beside the two cups. On the cover of the DVD, there is a reference to Tati. He claims that the film is "très drôle: rappelle Tati!" ("Very funny: reminiscent of Tati!") The great Jacques Tati relied mainly on silent and mythical attitudes to achieve his comic effects and offer his critically satirical opinions of its 'modern' French society of the 1950s. It is clear that the 'Kitchen' occurs in the 1950s and offers some (somewhat discouraged) satirical references to the absurdities of bureaucracy and there are some long moments when words are not spoken - but they Are all those small details enough to make "Tatiesco" a "Kitchen"? Having said that, I must admit that "Kitchen" deals with the false objectivity of scientific research versus the "truth" of the film. In general, the film was agonizingly slow, without anything happening - with almost no "dramatic impulse": the surrounding parts were assembled during the first 15 minutes or more, and during the last In fact, the last segment was - FINALLY !!! - interesting and moving. It may seem like it was a short subject, less than an hour, unduly stretched to about 90 minutes. Now, about the set-up (a "scientific" remark about the behavior of single men in your kitchen): at first it seemed very promising - with mapping the comings and goings of singles in your kitchen as a way of determining what new inventions would be more useful. But very quickly this premise turned out to be only a prologue, an "excuse" to introduce the real subject that was only fully developed at the end and that was about solitude and the invaluable bond of friendship. Feather! I sincerely wanted to like this movie. Yes, it looked so promising when I heard about some of his unusual "anecdotes" -which were present and which I liked-like burning a man's nose (instead of using scissors to cut it), the "investment" of having a huge amount of "valuable" black pepper piled in a barn, the role of reversal (the observer becoming the observed), the mouth of a man emitting sounds from a radio program. And there is also a sick horse becoming the catalyst for half-hidden human despair, the relative importance of right or left-hand car driving in Sweden and Norway (a reflection of the importance of each of these neighboring countries very close to assert their individuality ?). Am I the only person who did not totally like this movie? Does that necessarily mean that I am wrong? Is it generally praised that 'the good points' were in fact 'too subtle' for me? Perhaps ... My individual views on this film may ironically reflect the very essence of the film - what would be the vital need to have the right to differentiate, to affirm individuality and not to blindly follow the tendencies and opinions of society? Each of us has the right to have different personal visions and not to be a slave to the demands of his "dictatorial" breadwinner demands: we often have other alternatives that would allow each of us to be useful to our society respecting the principles. In short, being true to himself - the way in this film Folke (Isak's "scientific observer") ends up giving up his job while preferring to stay in the house of his new friend Isak and help him with the tasks of his farm .. And so, "Live the difference," as the French say!
