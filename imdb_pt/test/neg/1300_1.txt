It was inferred by an earlier poster that the military would not be subordinated to the police in a disaster as described in the film. In fact, the military role would be to provide help to civilian authorities when asked to do so. Civil authorities would maintain primacy. In practice, the Army would need 48 hours or more to mobilize, with little presence of the Army in London, especially with current commitments abroad. Even so, they would be dependent on calling the TA. <br /> <br /> As for COBRA, we were given the impression that it was a government emergency department in its own right - even a reference to a Met Police Police Division. In fact COBRA stands for Cabinet Office Briefing Room "A". It's just the room where PM or DPM meets their advisors to discuss the current emergency!
