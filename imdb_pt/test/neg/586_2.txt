A very strange script by Cameron Crowe (shortly after the "Fast Times at Ridgemont High") has little inspiration and turns into stupid jokes. At least, the "Fast Times" had a fair share of satire and sensibility behind the slapstick (courtesy of a good director, Amy Heckerling, and Crowe's undeniable attraction for capturing perfect teenage speech lyrics); here, Chris Penn (the brother of Sean, natch) is the goof-off that makes life hell for straight arrow Eric Stoltz, and the filmmakers seem to think he's hilarious. Jenny Wright has some good times as a mall worker, but Illan Mitchell-Smith is lost in a head-scratching plot about a teenager who seems to be in love with a former soldier in shock. A confusing and uncomfortable nonsense, given a brilliant glow and a soundtrack full of pop-rock songs, but the characters one would expect to avoid. Supporting players Lea Thompson, Rick Moranis, Lee Ving and Sherilyn Fenn are wasted on idiotic roles. * in ****
