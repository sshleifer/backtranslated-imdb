There is nothing in this that the viewer can point to and call "good." The performance was monotonous and sedated. Scenarios and cinematography look like they were developed by someone who grew up in a Starbucks and tried to make the perfect Gap commercial. Characters have no motivation, motivation or reason to worry about them. There is so much lack of interest and tension that it is difficult to follow banal action and dialogue. And the plot ... if anyone finds it, I'm sure it would be as annoying as all the rest. <br /> <br /> That's not funny, it's not romantic, it does not reflect on the human. condition. If you want a good comedy, see Half-Baked; if you want a good drugged drama, watch Trainspotting. The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of one is because it's fun to see some familiar faces in the mid 90's cast. What is a superficial reason to give the film a star, but again, this is a superficial film.
