Like the beauty of the jungle, Jessica Alba's beautiful smile and sensual appearance hangs over the film, but unfortunately, they are the only two things worth watching this movie. When, in theory, we should be attentive to the narrative. <br /> <br /> The plot is thin on the floor and hard to believe. As beautiful as Jessica Alba is, she does not add any of the sparks she injected into the credible series 'Dark Angel'. Since Dark Angel it seems that Alba has been reduced to a mere eye drop (but what eye drops!), And is the only reason to put it into movies. The concept of the dormant dictionary is stupid and implausible, with little character development (or character for that matter) to make us want to perform the 109 minutes of runtime with this world. Despite the films in short time, it still manages to seem long and laborious. It seems a shame that talent like Brenda Blethyn, Emily Mortimer and Bob Hoskins are wasted on a wicked narrative that barely raises a wrist. This movie seriously loses a trick, an exotic setting, a more than capable cast with beautiful cinematography, and a chance to use dualistic themes and concepts of 'civilization'. But there is little narrative to speak, no drama, no sense we are watching a love story, another story of lust and woman happy to please men without question. Let's be honest, if Jessica Alba was allowing you to sleep with her, do you think you would be able to focus on learning a tribal language? Therein lies the great problem, both in suspension of disbelief, as well as in which the female characters are limited and reduced to. Take for example the fact that the character of Jessica Alba suffers the mental and physical tribulation of pregnancy and the birth of her forbidden love, but all we see is that she is beautiful and curvaceous in a minute, then lovely and full of curves , with a baby. It's a pitiful state to see a movie with promise that does not match anything close to its potential. I could write endlessly about movie flaws, but it hurts me to do that. The movie looks good, the premise could have been turned into a lovely movie, but unfortunately it was not meant to be.
