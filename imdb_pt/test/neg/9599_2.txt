Alright, let me start by saying that I love the original RS for 64. The graphics were new, the ships were very fast and cool. The missions were a challenge, but you had a strategy to propose. The computer did not tell you every step of your mission, you could wander and explore. <br /> <br /> This is the first thing wrong with RL, everything you do is on a schedule and is controlled by other people. I mean, should not you, as a leader, be telling people how to handle every mission? <br /> <br /> And speaking of quests, why do they interweave the original trilogy with completely fabricated crap? Does not matter. <br /> <br /> I was so looking forward to this game when I knew they would let you fly through the Empire Strikes Back asteroid field. I think anyone who is a fan of the movies wanted to do that. So they give it to you. It's the most stupid level of the game. You start flying through the asteroid field with the loops running behind you, and your whole goal is to go further into the field while shooting the draws. You have to kill them all to move on. Hey, remember how many Han killed when he was in the field? None, they all had poor riding skills compared to him. I just wanted to be able to dodge the asteroids when they came to me, but instead I have to use my automatic machine guns to kill the bonds behind me. <br /> <br /> That was the biggest disappointment, you have no control over your flight, everything is slow. All except the A-Wing, probably the fastest and most maneuverable ship of the entire fleet. But, oh yes, did not Han say the Falcon was? Anyway ... <br /> <br /> You finally get to the Battle of Endor. Here is the last level, you can destroy the Death Star, the first instinct of all is to catch the Falcon and be the leader. But, of course, you get there and have to make stupid pre-chosen strategies like finding (not to mention deciphering the difference between) the tie-bombers. This is impossible in the hawk, when you see a group, the frigate is destroyed. The only way to get through this part is to choose the A-Wing. After that, you have to attack the destroyers of stars and this is a really stupid task. This game makes you feel like you are the one to defend the rebel alliance. <br /> <br /> After getting frustrated by the "fun" fight, you reach the death star. And here, you may think 'yay! I can destroy the star of death, 'and again, as in the Asteroid field, you have to do something tedious as you pass through the tunnels of imminent destruction. Your mission is to protect the ship in front of you, remember that from the return of the Jedi? It's so stupid because if you choose the hawk, you will die because you are not maneuverable enough, but if you choose the x-wing, you have to keep locking and unlocking your s-foils. So it's a choice to kill the bad guys or try to reach Lando, who apparently does not know how to maneuver. Thus dying in the process. <br /> <br /> Bonus stages are not worthwhile as each level becomes increasingly frustrating. It makes me feel the way I did when I saw the new three movies, upset and needing to kill something. Lucky for me, Smash Bros Melee exists. <br /> <br /> I hope with the Wii they have something much better and have the levels of the original trilogy at their full capacity. I'm going to sell this game on the first chance I get.
