I do not see this movie! It's repulsive! The beginning is really good, but in the middle everything falls and I really regret spending 80 kroner (about 11 dollars) on the ticket! Peter Dalle should consider this as his last chance to win people's interest. Picture AWFUL! The only bright spot is the splendid work of Robert Gustavsson, Lena Nyman and GÃ¶sta Ekman. <br /> <br /> I hope you take my advice ... The photo is crap.
