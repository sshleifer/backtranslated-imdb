The monster will look very familiar to you. The same will happen with the rest of the film if you've seen half a dozen teenage movies stuck in the woods. Ok, so they are not teenagers this time, but they may well be. Three couples decide that it might be a good idea to visit an almost abandoned ghost town, hoping to find the gold that people were killed for a scant century and a half before. You would think that with a title like "Miner Massacre" some interesting things can happen. They do not. In fact, only about 1/10 of the film actually happens in the mine. I had imagined teams of terrified miners running through their lives in the cavernous confines of their workplace, praying that Black Lung Disease would catch them before the Grim Reaper demanded of their terrible vengeance, but instead made the terrible twenty-somethings fornicating a case, defecating - in the woods, a bunch of idiots with a collective IQ, it would be difficult to take a plastic ring from a Cracker Jacks box, much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine. No suspense, no fright, and many embarrassing performances give this turkey a nudity.
