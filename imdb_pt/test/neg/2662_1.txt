Have you seen the movie "Marathon Man"? The part with the dentist? I'd rather it happen to me than go through "Random Hearts" again. It was not simply uninteresting, or uneventful-it was terribly, painfully, and agonizingly boring. At one point, I momentarily lost consciousness. To the ordinary layman, I may have seemed to be asleep, but the other patrons of the film realized that I really extinguished myself. I thought I was going to die. When the movie finally ended (I think it lasted for twelve hours, but I'm not sure), I let out an exasperated "Thank you Jesus, It's over !!", which all other moviegoers celebrated. If I had to hear Harrison Ford angry angrily in that monotonous moan, I would have been forced to look for something sharp in my eyes to divert my attention. That's 136 minutes of my life I will never go back.
