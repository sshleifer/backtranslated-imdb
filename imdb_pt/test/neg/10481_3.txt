Rivalry between siblings leads to the main plot. Navy Commander Chuck Prescott (Marshall Thompson) has developed the Y12 airplane to test how far man can climb into the atmosphere. His brother, Lieutenant Dan Prescott (Bill Edwards), appears to be the best test driver and is chosen to climb the Y12. Dan, of course, has a problem receiving orders and is also a confident demon. <br /> <br /> On Dan's second flight, he reaches the comfort zone of 300 miles and his ship undergoes a storm of meteor dust. Returning to the ground, Dan becomes a monster that resembles 200 kilos of bad asphalt. He also has a demanding desire for blood, whether it be farm animals or humans. <br /> <br /> Short duration of one hour and seventeen minutes; black and white with quasi-stoic acting ... typical of low-budget science fiction. <br /> <br /> Rounding out the cast are Marla Landi, Robert Ayers and Carl Jaffe. Curiosities worth noting: about two months after this film was released; the Russians put the real first man in space.
