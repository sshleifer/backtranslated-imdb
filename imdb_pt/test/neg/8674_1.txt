I'm not Jane Austen's purist, but why make a movie like this if you have nothing to say. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper was so wrong for the role that it's hard to know where to start - wrong personality, modern make-up, completely wrong hair (there's no way a young lady of her age to play in public with her hair loose and without the same nail), she did not seem particularly humble nor put by the family and I did not understand why everyone seemed to think of her as particularly holy or gentle. <br /> <br /> The picnic (replaced by the ball) was so cheap that it was shameful to watch and completely miss the Portsmouth section. destroyed the point of the play (as well as lost scenes that might have added a rough counterpoint to that pink, claustrophobic living room). <br /> <br /> For those in charge: - If you do not have the imagination (even the budget does not matter as much as the imagination) to do something meaningful with an adaptation please do not pretend to be praying Jane Austen. <br /> <br /> It was about 10% Mansfield Park and 90% nothing too much <br /> <br /> PS Edmund was very good
