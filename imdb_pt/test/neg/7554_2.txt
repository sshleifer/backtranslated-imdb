The production values ​​in this video are so bad that they are unassailable. The performance came in second with the amazing creations of the wanks studio, with about thirty special effects per minute. It is shot through a cloud of smoke, lasting only one or two seconds per shot, and background floodlights often shine directly on the camera. The lighting was terrible for the filming. There is a constant zoom in and out with total lack of visual continuity. There may have been some good dancing available to the live audience, but video viewers will never know.
