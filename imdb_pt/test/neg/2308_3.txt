I remember when "The Love Machine" was first released in theaters. I was only 13 years old, was too young to see the movie's release but not too old to take my mother's pocketbook from Jacqueline Susann's novel to school and dwell on the 'little things' with my schoolmates . Although I'm not sure what my problem was so soon, but I was very interested in the book. I bought and wore an ankh ring as on the cover of the book, and I remember the Xanadu perfume ads, which were cross-promoted and clumsily presented in the film. Despite such interest, I did not see the movie until several years later. I should have left things as they were. "The Love Machine" is by far the worst of the many bad movies adapted from Susann's novels ... which, of course, makes it more fun to watch. Its defects are many: from the hopscotch script that jumps quickly from one incident to another, with only one connecting thread; its dated, horny (metal instruments, I mean) ersatz Bacharach score; flat and first-scene performances; the boring sexuality - I've never seen such prominent robes in a movie before. It's like a fetish! Whenever sex, nudity or something despicable is required, someone appears in a blue robe! Very strange it; and certainly the circus train of the horrible models of the 70's that are in infinite exposure. The performance of poor Dyan Cannon (which is not a great shake anyway, but rather over the rest of the cast) is consistently undermined by the highs she is called upon to use. However, the main responsibility of the film is the stoic John Philip Law as Robin Stone, the object of the affection of all the girls (and of a photographer of fire). <br /> Law is just horrible and works as if it's taken off the street, delivered the pages of the script in a hurry and said to give a cool reading on the spot. Only without life! Not only that, but he appears in the desperate need for a blood transfusion or something. He looks pale and sick all over and is several pounds shorter than most of his female costars. Robin Stone should be a hottie, not a handkerchief. <br /> <br /> For anyone who finds the film difficult (it's a bit slow by today's standards) I beg you to stay there for the climactic "fight scene." Here Ms. Cannon (balancing 23 pounds of bulging hair) finally abandons her acting style so far starched and released with that infectious laugh of her, setting in motion a truly memorable free for everything that should become a movie clip to this height. Trying to rival the infamous "Valley of the Dolls" wig-down-the-toilet scene, "The Love Machine" finally does something right. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Susann's unique rubbish label is missing. Maybe someone out there has the rights to Rona Barrett's "The Lovomaniacs," and revive the genre.
