I rented this movie because Elijah Wood did a good job and I thought it could be a despised treasure. It was not a treasure. I do not know if this went straight to the video, but it should have been straight to the trash. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood fans will like the fact that he appears shirtless in a very brief shower scene. . But no sane person would like this script. Imagine Memento played by teenage actors, but ten times more confused and a hundred times less plausible. Case in point: Janeane Garofalo plays an attentive psychologist (apparently "keeping the current of mediocrity alive"). As if the syndromes of false memories and the medicine of the mind on matter were not foolish enough, the film also depends on one of those inexplicable psychic twin bonds that keep the plot moving and the audience disconcerted This same bond between twins creates some very invented love scenes between Wood's character and the girl from She's All That, who plays the saintly sister of Wood's raging friend, a cancer victim. <br /> <br /> Scriptural, Wood's other friends are a victim of cancer with mental problems and Kidney, a young black man afflicted by a mysterious kidney disease. Kidney's agonizing desire comes true when Dr. Garofalo gives him his own Walkman. The banal function of this character in the story is matched by his new relationship with the walk. Usually linked to a wheelchair, Kidney has several unexplained scenes showing him pushing the others around him. <br /> <br /> Kindey's characterization may be a small detail, but it is indicative of the many other flaws in this film. The Bumblebee Flies Anyway is definitely clumsy but never flies.
