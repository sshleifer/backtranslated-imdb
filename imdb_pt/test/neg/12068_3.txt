Apparently the writer and director of this direct slasher movie for DVD is a fan of Friday the 13th and other summer camp slashers. This movie has it all - a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend with fun, alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called "Camp Blood", the old man who warns them not to go there; and of course the crazy killer with the machete who keeps hacking and hacking the teenagers for no reason ... The whole thing could have worked if it had been filmed on a 35mm film with Acceptable Special Effects. But, instead, Special Effects are poorly made. The killer walks around like he's on a Sunday afternoon stroll, and the only good thing about this movie is the acting talented main actress and the sex scene in the beginning. Other than that - boring and forgetful. Jasper P. Morgan
