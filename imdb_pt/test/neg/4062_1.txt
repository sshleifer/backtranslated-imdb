The plane is a 747 Jumbo. The cockpit is located on the upper deck of a 747. In the movie, riders do not go up the stairs in the 1st class cabin to get to the cockpit. They walk to the front of the 1st class cabin and through doors in the cockpit. What a gaff !!! The front of the first class cabin has a cloakroom for jackets and a TV screen. In addition, it is the radar dome. Before takeoff, a 747 is shown to start the taxi to the runway. On takeoff, the airplane is shown with only two engines. Areal 747 has four engines. Who was in charge of the continuity of this film? During the initial part of the flight, the front of the plane suddenly includes toilets - another cheating trickster !!! After that, the front of the plane becomes rear and vice versa. At this point, I stopped watching. Absolute rubbish !!!
