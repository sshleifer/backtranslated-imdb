Ants are shown in cartoons as being able to carry the legs of chicken, watermelons, people, etc. This can be an admirable feature because the ants carry the Phase IV movie. This is not because they want to but because they need to. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a narrator who mysteriously explains that some cosmic event has come to Earth, and that a fellow scientist has been working on the film. effect that this disturbance has on the ant population. The film is divided into segments; the first part after the cosmic event is Phase I, and so on until the end of the film, which is Phase IV. What is Phase IV? Who knows? We can not see this part; presumably, has something to do with the union of one of the scientists who study the ants and a girl who lived in the area. The girl, who looks like a cross between Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler, is angry with the ants because they killed her horse, but, except for an outburst of rage, she runs the biodome with an empty stare. /> <br /> These ants are very smart; or scientists are pretty dumb. I'll give credit to the ants. Because? Anything that usually spoils my picnics, which can then build reflecting towers, blow up trucks and adapt to the poison with the greatest ease, is my vote for being the most intelligent species, at least in this movie. <br /> <br /> Sterno says stomp in this tingling. <br /> <br />
