If I had to choose the most depressing film, try to be suspenseful. I saw that would be the one. I know how good the original is, it better be better than this. The film is so gloomy and depressing, but it's also not interesting to watch - I've seen thriller movies that have been saved because of the suspense of counterbalancing and balancing the quality of the darkness. Vanishing did not have this, it was so disturbing to watch to get started and there was nothing positive to make this classic type movie. I think another poster of IMDb was right to say that this genre has just seen the thrillers done in a much higher way. I completely agree - I would recommend skipping this - maybe I watch the original someday, but I doubt it. I give it to 2 out of 10.
