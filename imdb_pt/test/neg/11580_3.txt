A team of amateur journalists and tree huggers captures a secret government project, the Carnivore Project, on a remote South Pacific island. Scientists there are producing giant-sized maize, but genes are spreading to other species, creating dragons of abnormally large Komodo and a snake (one that is bulletproof and nothing underwater). With the help of the scientist's daughter, can they escape the island and tell the world? Even though I had not seen this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel (which, unfortunately, I did) it would shout "Sci-Fi Channel" with its low production value, poor acting and some of the worst special effects in history. The effects here are comparable to another creature movie, "Raptor Island", although not as bad as that. I suspect there must be at least a handful of people who worked on the two films, but I did not bother to confirm this and probably not. It will be a sad day when I see some of them again. <br /> <br /> Which does not mean that it is not pleasant. I watched at two in the morning with my sister's boyfriend and I can not speak for him, but I thought it was a good use of time. Worst of all, it's a fun photo if you like to make fun of movies and the scientist's daughter is attractive enough to carry the movie (I believe the actress's name is Michelle Borth). Michael Pare also appears as a ship captain, and his poor choice of roles here makes his work on "Furnace" look respectable (even though the film is intolerably bad). <br /> <br /> I can not be too Hard in this movie simply because it was more or less exactly what I thought it would be. Bad effects? Low budget? Actors without a name? I have no greater hope. However, that does not mean it is incredible either. Coming on par is nothing to be proud of and this will disappear slowly in the distant memory department. For the fan who likes this movie (and calls it "KvC"), hold onto your copy because you'll have a lot of time to get a replacement.
