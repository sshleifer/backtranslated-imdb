The only reason I checked this movie was to see the "beginning" of Kim Bassinger. That, and the fact that my TV guide said it was an "exciting thriller", was rated as three stars. The assessment must have come from the man who wrote this drivel because the only suspense in this movie was whether or not I would end it. Robert Culp becomes what has to be the "disaster" of his career as a police officer who is nowhere near believable. At one point, everyone is a suspect, including a frail woman. If you deliberately want to watch a poorly written, misdirected, misunderstood film ... then go ahead. It can make you enjoy thin films by comparison. I wanted to be that hour and thirty-six minutes ago.
