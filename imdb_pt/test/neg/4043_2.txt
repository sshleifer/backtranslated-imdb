This movie was so stupid that I could not believe what I was seeing while watching, it was like a huge train crash - I could not look away because it was horribly awful! I can honestly say that I have never seen anything so bad in my whole life. It was so extravagant and the acting was so deplorable that I just kept thinking "this just has to be some kind of joke, right? No one would really make such a bad movie on purpose, right?" I really hope this is just a bad joke and these people do not really expect people to watch it with a serious face, and I really hope that the people who were in this movie were acting on purpose and did not believe they are good actors Drag queens are a lot of fun to watch, as are the cheesy special effects from a science fiction movie from the '80s. Note this if you've watched all the other first existence movies and there are not nothing else to watch! I would give a "0" if it were possible.
