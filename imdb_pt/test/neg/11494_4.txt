I just read Forsyth's novel, 'Icon'. I thought it was one of the most detailed, detailed and turn-around pages I've ever read, definitely in my top 10. I got a DVD version of the book starring Mr. Swayze. OK, let me first point out that to fit a decent adaptation of the novel in 2.5 hours the movie time would be impossible, so I understand the reason staffs to swing from the book version and differ. However, when I say "differ" what I should really say is "take the characters from the book, add some, leave some out, remove the plot from the book, add a new modern storyline, add the name of Frederick Forsyth in somewhere ". I'm not saying this was a bad image, far from it, some of the effects were top notch and the acting was not kind of bad. History was a drug and did not depend on logic or reality. Forsyth's novel was so good and real and altered the facts of reality rather than exaggerating them. This could have been a lot more if it had taken a long time and turned into a 10 part series. If you have not read the book yet, expect a decent TV movie with a good cast of actors, if you've read the book, try to forget it by watching it.
