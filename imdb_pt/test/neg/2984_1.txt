I only saw this movie last night and I almost cried. No, it was not because I was completely petrified. It was absolutely HORRENDOUS! Sometimes you see movies that make you wonder what will become of the human race in the near future - this movie is one of those. It's as if the writer, the actors, the director, and others simply come together and copy and paste scenes from their favorite horror movies, put it all together and say, "Hey, here's Satan's whip !!!" After seeing this movie, I could not help being tormented by the vision of people who call themselves "actors"; waltzing as if they were some kind of talented artistic performers ... make no mistake, they suck! Do not worry about wasting your time or money !!!
