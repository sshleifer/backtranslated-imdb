Patsy Kensit and a few random Australian stars as a duo of tough-guy cops in the midst of investigating a series of art gallery-related killings, but in between they can still find time to shoot young thieves and suspect the police officer's new wife of being an adulterer. The serial killer is suddenly no more important when the supposed lover of his wife (who is basically just a co-worker of hers) is found murdered and the male police officer becomes the prime suspect. "Tunnel Vision" is a really dull, implausible and tension-free Aussie thriller that obviously mimics the popular thrillers like "Fatal Attraction", "Disclosure" and "Wild Instinct." The characters are extremely one-dimensional and pretty much every good-cop / nerd clich√© is amply described in the script. The position of women police struggle in a body full of men, the first toss-ask-questions-later mentality, alcohol problems through stress, etc. etc? Even the unhealthy eating habits of cops are a joke. To yawn! Kensit really tries her best to make this film more bearable, but she does not have the credibility and talent of a true movie heroine. The final twist is more or less interesting (not entirely original, remember), but by then you've stopped caring for the characters for a long time. The scenes filmed in sex clubs look ridiculously fake and Clive Fleury's direction is completely uninspired. What total loss of time?
