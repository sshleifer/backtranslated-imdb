Mod Squad is not a movie, it's a void. Is this the most fascinating thing about this and the thing that kept me watching? I had never seen a movie that offered absolutely nothing before. It's a movie with no reason to exist, apparently consciously designed not to attract anyone as if it were made purely as a contractual obligation to someone the studio really does not like. There is no plot, no characterization, no action scenes, not even scenes like this, just a progression of increasingly empty shots projected at 24 frames per second. I'm not talking about empty as in the stupid but empty summer blockbuster as in "We do not have the pages yet so just point the camera at something and stop when you have 90 minutes worth." This makes you appreciate the "artistic achievements" of Charlie's Angels and S.W.A.T. a lot more. What he offers is too much of Giovanni Ribisi in his most tediously execrable making his bastard son a thousand idiots embodying the acting method of Marlon Brando, Michael Lerner dancing with Omar Epps and? is not it. Oh, Clare Danes has a nice smile all at once. And Dennis Farina has the good sense to be killed early. Genuinely the most senseless movie of all time, it's like L'Humanite without the jokes, but, you know, for kids.
