Okay by the time you read this I could have stopped crying. This movie was so horrible that it got pretty annoying. The creatures are kind of cute, but the only really good thing about the movie was the growing attachment between the prisoners and their guard after being isolated on this crazy island. Even seeing Barbara Bach with her hair all shivering, there was no reward for buying this poop dung. She continues with a whisper that I have never used my voice before soprosa that they simply do not wash when someone is screaming a bloody murder. (Hey, the protagonist was cute too, but I still do not feel relieved.) This is an imitation of beer on Dr. Moreau's good island. Poor Richard Johnson, who was certainly born for better things, is just hopelessly bad as the villain. I mean, how bad can a bad guy be? (Ask Richard Johnson). Joseph Cotten struggles not to look embarrassed as he staggers through his appearance. In the name of everything sacred, do not rent this bomb.
