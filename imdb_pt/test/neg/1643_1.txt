Yes, this movie is obviously trying to be a Conan, the Barbarian, and what surprises me is that this is a continuation (did people require another?). The first part of the movie is a flashback showing the original. From what I've seen, it's not worth checking out (and apparently Actor always kills a huge puppet in his movies). Well, now Actor lives in the ends of the earth with his uncle Thong friend. A girl seeks your help as this evil guy has his father in his custody. Let me just say that this guy is extremely patient as the old man constantly insults the villain and just chatter endlessly. The bad guy waits until the end of the movie and finally beats the old guy around to let you ask yourself "What took so long to take out?" Meanwhile, Actor, his partner and the girl go through one adventure after another. They fight against cave men, invisible soldiers (do not ask), rent thieves and people who love snakes. Actor also faces a giant snake and hang glider (again, do not ask). All the time you will be thinking that Conan would kick the butt of Actor.
