Of course, this movie in Eastern Europe is full of sensual but absolutely has nothing to do with Nicholas Cage's movie "8mm" The daughter of an ambassador and his fianc√© mingle with a local woman in a trio that ends up being recorded . The tape is used for blackmail and bets get louder as the couple tries to resolve themselves rather than go to the authorities. <br /> <br /> Sex comes and goes - and would be the only reason for it. rent it, I suppose, if you like that sort of thing - and it's pretty free to the middle, when we cross the porn scene looking for "another woman." I definitely question how this fit into Blockbuster, even with a Youth Restricted Sticker considering as just a hint on the edge of the soft core it is. (Oh, that's right, it's the double standard.) Real movies like "The Dreamers" and "Y Tu Mama Tambien" are castrated R versions, but the crap of Straight To DVD like that makes the UNRATED banner proudly attached The plot is tediously unoriginal but really the worst offense is the idea that this is an 8mm sequel.I would give the movie a D for a note and it would be cool, but considering they tried to fool me, that makes the F, frankly, deserve it.
