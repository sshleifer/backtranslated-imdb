Unfortunate and unnecessary sequela of a genuine classic. An American werewolf in London was arguably a movie gem: humorous, demented, just a touch of romance and very, very British made me want to stand up and sing God Save the Queen every time the movie ended. Then came this abomination. You know you are in real trouble when the links are so totally unpleasant that you are happy when they are slaughtered, and really begin to root for the lycanthropes. To tell you the truth, folks, I only managed to talk more or less in this half of the CG hoax before I lost my will to live and shut it down. Absolutely pitiful and a putrid waste of anyone's time.
