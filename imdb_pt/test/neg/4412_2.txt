The son of the native chief is unjustly accused for the death of his father. The evil Witch Doctor orders him to execute it. He then comes back as a killer tree (!), Tabanga. Well, what can you say about this "movie"? If it was meant to be a horror movie, there was obviously some kind of bad judgment involved. And for a comedy, it's still not funny enough. I do not know why people make movies like this. I think you have to be in a bad mood to watch it. Or you might want to see the incredible "monstrous" tree, which gives a new dimension to "slow death." Or maybe you want to check out the excellent acting skills of everyone involved. (Mrs. Kilgore!) Or the dialogue and script, which were strangely ignored at that year's Oscars. <br /> <br /> "Should not we try psychoanalysis on that tree? Maybe the mother is afraid of oaks."
