The sound is terrible, the image is worse than worse, the acting is horrible, the main actress is chubby, and the story is ... wait a minute ... There is no story ...! The plot is very bad and the title of the film is misleading. If you expect to see Piranhas, you might be disappointed. This movie has nothing to do with the Piranha movies of 1978 and 1981. In fact, I can only think of a scene involving Piranhas. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about this movie, apart from the fact that it works for only 85 minutes, is the song at the end. It is written and sung by Jim Stein and is called "Love all things that love the sun." <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie. It's so bad that it's not even funny to watch. I fell asleep after the first 20 minutes and I'm the kind of person who watches everything.
