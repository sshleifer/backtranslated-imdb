Van Sant copies Hitchcock's masterpiece for the shot, including some modern facets: a walkman and nudity by Anne Heche. Unless you have a strong desire to see Mrs. Heche naked, there is absolutely no reason to see this movie instead of the original. Hitchcock's masterpiece is much better and Van Sant does not realize that by hiding nudity and blood, the original shower scene is even more frightening. Ask Janet Leigh about it. The acting is also much flatter and the technical aspects are much less impressive.
