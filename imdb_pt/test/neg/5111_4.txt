When I typed the Savage Intruder into the IMDb search engine, one of the options he created was Savage Garden: The Story So Far (1999), the only reason I mentioned this is because I'm a big fan of Savage Garden. And you should do yourself a favor and check out some of your songs like Affirmation or To the Moon and Back instead of worrying about that ordinary cauldron, sorry, I just wanted to say that. Anyway, the Savage Intruder begins with a bizarre set-up of what appears to be a MGM music recording and some rotating portraits that have no meaning in the long run. It's the late 1960s in Hollywood, and amid glitz and glamor, a serial killer is at work selecting elderly actresses, killing them and dismembering their bodies. A young man named Vic Valance jumps out of a tour bus looking for a job when he stops at the house of an actress Katharine Parker (Miriam Hopkins), who was "one of the biggest stars in the world." film but now lives in a large house with an elderly housekeeper named Mildred (Florence Lake), a personal secretary Leslie Blair (Gale Sondergaard) and a young maid named Geta (Virginia Wing). Katharine broke her foot recently and needs a personal assistant and gives Vic the job. Slowly, Vic enchants the way for Katharine's affections and, more importantly, for her large wallet. Vic begins to turn Katharine against the other employees, but Vic is not what it seems. Vic is a crazy drug addict who impregnates Greta while still having sex with Katharine. Greta threatens to tell Katharine and ruin Vic's dishonest plans, but she has a close encounter with an ax, no one in the house is safe while Vic brings drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll party and gardening to the Parker mansion while her sinister plan begins to get more and more apparent ... Written, Produced and Directed by Donald Wolfe I thought the Savage Intruder was a bit messy but a little fun at the same time. The script is all over the place and can not really decide what it wants to be, Savage Intruder suffers from an identity crisis! The film begins with the discovery of a severed head and limbs, shortly after another woman (Dorothy Kingston) is killed by a mysterious unidentified figure, but ends up completely abandoning the horror movie elements she has just built, never coming back to them . The Savage Intruder then becomes a kind of good movie when Vic befriends Katharine and shows how to enjoy life again and have an implicit sexual relationship with her, it's actually disgusting to think of how old she is to be her grandmother. Katharine stops living the life of a recluse and abandons the alcohol while Vic appears to make her happy as they go to the party together and feast for Katharine's friend as she has also used. That part of the Savage Intruder would not seem out of place in a Disney movie! From time to time the boredom of the good thing is interrupted by Vic shooting up and having silly hallucinations about his mother (Sybelle Guardino) and cutting his hand with an ax, he has sex with the Great at one point too. So, after Greta was murdered, Savage Intruder becomes a bizarre horror movie when Vic is revealed by the evil he is. The Savage Intruder simply does not flow properly like a movie, in my opinion, because it mixes several genres with little success. Likewise, the elements of the murder mystery do not work and are frankly a kind of puzzle, as they strive to hide the identity of the murderers during the murder scenes, but make it clear who is committing them during the rest of the movie? Vic as a character did not work for me, one moment he is a cool, calm, intelligent and dishonest con man, and then he is a crazy raving madman! Why kill all her other victims, but with Katharine try to convince her? What makes it so different? If it's because she has money, why not go after her to start? So many questions and so few answers ... Some of the 1960s dialogues are very funny to hear nowadays, like when Vic offers Greta a painkiller, actually heavy drugs, and Greta says "what I need is an analgesic ? " Vic helpfully replies "because its a pain" wow this guy knows how to charm the ladies! Or when Katharine suggests that Vic do gardening and ask "do you have green fingers?" he replies "no, but I'm good at grass!" There is not much blood in Savage Intruder, some severed limbs and some decapitated heads. There is also a fairly impressive shot when someone has their hand cut with an ax, which is probably why it is repeated three or four times. Drug hallucinatory scenes looking silly need to be seen to be believed. Technically Savage Intruder is OK, the local filming in the grand mansion and Hollywood Hills probably give it a better look than it deserves, the acting is average, as is the rest of the production. Overall, I would say that the Savage Intruder seems to be a murder mystery that unfortunately leaves the killer away and, as a result, simply does not work. It's a bit of fun watching a time at best and a complete mess of a movie at worst, you decide which one!
