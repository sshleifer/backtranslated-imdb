I only voted on 2/10, mainly because Hitchcock agreed to direct it. He certainly had a day off with predictable plots, stupid kid characters who are desperately trying to be funny. There were "fragile sex" hygienic, sanitized and emasculated "scenes" at a time when Hollywood's Code Production was at full strength. Lazy male characters in the movie who enjoy "soap" characters never do a job scam for which they are paid. It always irritates me when food is usually never eaten by actors (an exception was in the eating scene in "Tom Jones" (1963), although copious amounts of booze are consumed - actors have to leave their mouths free for the next line! Lombard certainly fit the idealized image of Hitchcock's "cool blonde" of a heroine, but what he already possessed to direct this worthless script, he should have been stuck in his suspense films.He certainly did not wear out in the last 69 years I could not wait for it to end, for it gradually irritated me.
