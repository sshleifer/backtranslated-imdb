This movie was a failure as a comedy and a movie in general. It was a very slow movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message, but the message was a clich√©, a hopeless mess to begin with. This movie falls into an unashamed environmental spot, even making an arrogant point of destroying an SUV and promoting Animal Planet. Sitting on it, I could not help but notice that Steve Carell could not get more than a single, really funny line. The only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the unfortunate attempt to give comic relief lines to Wanda Sykes. Your character gets frequent, lines worthy of charm, where they absolutely do not fit. <br /> <br /> Far from the brilliance of Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty blows his entire record budget into special effects devices that prove to be barely advancing the plot. The film passes the first half of Evan's ark building, but in the end we learned that the ark was completely meaningless, and the whole plot was just a boat for stupid jokes and even more stupid messages. The film concludes when we learn that the whole ark, flood and gathering of animals was only a weak political statement of none other than God. Yes, God was trying to influence politics.
