yeesh, talk about craptastic.this thing is brutal.horrible voice acting, acting even more awful and without noticeable plot. Apparently there are some great chase scenes but the problem is that you have to get to that point first, and I couldn The 20 or so minutes I spent seemed more like a root canal than a movie. I suppose I could have sent it quickly, and I recommend you do the same, unless you have extreme pain tolerance or a masochist. I do not fall into any of the categories. I still have a migraine from this thing, so I'm about to perform some dental surgery without anesthesia just reliving the migraine. The bottom line, horrible. 0/10
