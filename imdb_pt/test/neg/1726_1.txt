Like many others, I relied on Dennis Hopper's appearance so this was not a complete waste of time. I was sadly mistaken. Everything negative said about this flic is more than truth. What takes the cake, however, is the horrible, horrible plot for the main character. <br /> <br /> Here's why: The planet can be destroyed, the ONLY way to recover from it, so that the entire human race is saved through that, is to bring so many intelligent, capable, legal, and competent people into one. hiding place. And Dennis Hopper is the only seer / vision scientist who was prepared for the worst, and who realized that. But what is the main motivation of Stevens (Sonny D'Angelo)? He is angry because Dennis has decided who will be saved or condemned! While explaining clearly to Stevens that Dennis's character did everything to warn people about the danger, but that he was ridiculed. The character Hopper was the boy with the finger in the dike, and now Stevens is blaming him for "choosing and choosing" ??? And if that is not enough, he wants to prevent everyone from entering this hiding place, because "it's not fair!" And ... he is responsible for the death of the only man who is the savior of mankind! OH MY GOD, how stupid can you be? <br /> <br /> What is also maddening that IMDb compels you to write at least ten lines about this crap. I mean, TWO MILLION in the budget, what could have been done with it? Think Clerks, Blair Witch, and many other films that were made for less than $ 100,000 and were still better. AAAAARGH! I consider myself lucky not to have paid a penny to see this crap, and to sit down at the end of this total crap, is one of the most heroic things I've done this year. No wonder the writers of this excrement pile had jobs as camera operator and title designer before ...
