I was watching TV one day with a friend and we got the last twenty minutes of "Going Bananas". Believe me when I say that was enough to have a good judgment of the movie. The first scene I saw was the monkey, the boy, the fat man and the Negro who looked like Dave Chappelle, flying around in a duster thousands of feet in the air. While all the others were solemn about the trip, the monkey seemed to be in some kind of drug spree, where he kept shouting something that resembled the English word faster. They then disembarked on a twenty-yard-long dock in Africa. After a heart farewell where the monkey cried (Hahahaha), the "villains" of the film appeared. They were ripping full ass in their vintage Cadillac when the evil monkey took an Air Jordan jump from the dock to the boat that was leaving 40 feet away and made them sink their beautiful car into the Pacific Ocean. After watching this movie, I have a new purpose in life; to find the dwarf who threw the monkey and stab him in the eyes with a fountain pen.
