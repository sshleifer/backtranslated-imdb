I watched Gomeda at the movies in my city. My friend took me and I was really curious to know what it would be like. Well, I must say that this movie was not a horror, it could be that we can say that it is "Fantsastic experimentation" ... Ok, here I go anyway ... But there were many problems of filming, acting, dramatic, theatrical and storytelling. I can understand because the director is very young and Gomeda is his first feature film. The direction of this film was not too bad, I see. Unfortunately, due to the restrictions placed on the film by its extremely low budget, the visuals are often as obscure as the plot. And there are no powerful gothic scenes. As a horror film really fails, it does not scare at all and is quite confusing and annoying. Some people say that 'Gomeda' is an art film, but I could not see a laughable, terrible and irreverent art film. So how can we say it's an art film!
