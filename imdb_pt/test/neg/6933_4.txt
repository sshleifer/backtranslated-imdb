A four-and-a-half-hour O'Neill piece is summed up to just under two, and much of that time-span is dedicated to actors with frozen expressions on their faces as they read the thoughts of their characters in the narration. . It may work on stage, but it seems too hilarious in this novel adaptation, which conveys the misbehavior of its heroine and never explains why it captivated so many men. Norma Shearer and Alexander Kirkland, exaggerating ridiculously, are outclassed by a naturalist Clark Gable - he is the only one who makes the technique of freezing the face work. It's even funnier when the son of Shearer and Gable, a bad-tempered bitch, makes the frozen face look. There is also Frank Morgan's brother, Ralph, as an unsuccessful suitor, given the soliloquy of "poor Charlie!" time and again, and a young Robert Young and Maureen O'Sullivan. By the time they appear, the excesses of voice have been largely abandoned and function as a mature soap, with a sentimental glow that actually plays "Silver Threads Among the Gold" as background music. The direction of Robert Leonard is boring and it shows little facility to control the hiperactive actors. It's certainly fun - there's nothing like that unless you count Groucho's satirical spoof on "Animal Crackers," or an old Mad Magazine satire that made Shirley Booth's comedy "Hazel" a "Strange Interlude" . But this is not good.
