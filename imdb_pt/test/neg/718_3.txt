This film was recommended to me by some academics. From his comments, I had some pretty high expectations. But this movie was nothing short of disappointing. The director's goal is obvious-to use an interweaving of speeches / poems as a way of arguing against Bush's doctrine. But the director fails miserably in that. I also seriously question the director's choice of the main character. He is a bum who is definitely not worthy of being heard. The rise of corporate power, so what? More importantly, this film gets a negative score on its power of persuasion; is clearly intended for those who have already formed their opinions. It is true that the aesthetics of the film is quite pleasant. But pretty much everything else in the movie is just plain stupid.
