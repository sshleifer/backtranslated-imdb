Please - if you have not yet tried to get through this crap and are thinking of watching this movie / miniseries - do yourself a favor and find something else to do. Floss your teeth, start learning how to play cello, beat your dog - anything you choose will be a better time than watching this crap. This is not a bad movie so you can take a few laughs - it simply sucks in every way possible. Just annoying from start to finish. <br /> <br /> And for those animal lovers out there who feel that my comment above is insensitive - if your dog could talk, he or she would beg for a beating instead of suffering watching this mess.
