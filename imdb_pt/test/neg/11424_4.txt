I, like many tonight, faced the cold winter and the long queues to see what I expected to be one of the best films this year. However, I was sad, in many ways, after the credits rolled. But to be fair, there were redeemable (though very few) qualities. Let's start with what worked. First, the Lycans: on point in every way? from its terrifying physicality to its pure ferocity. The action: sublimely visceral? when it occurred. Nighy / Victor and Sheen / Lucian: Perfect. Now, what not (and there is so much). This was less a movie and more a collage of sequences (and we do not expect to see any supporting characters from the other films except Raze and Tannis). Deeply absent was a well-written screenplay and anything of real substance to put together these pieces of film. Did the story seem to start right in the middle? at the top where Lucian had decided to rebel. So there was no context; without tension; no sense of betrayal? the devices needed to make everything else work. In addition, it ended where the climax should have begun (which needed to be after the contest boiled a bit). Oh, and it was too short. Purist will also find offense on some freedoms taken for certain facts previously revealed in the first two films, but judge for yourself. In the end, this film took a long time for what should have been brief "background" scenes (for example, several council scenes), and as a consequence, we never actually met or cared about the main actors ... or film (ai). -D
