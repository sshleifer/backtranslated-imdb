This movie is a shame, especially considering that Andrzej Wajda is not an amateur but professional director. However, this movie fails to deliver anything you would expect. <br /> <br /> First of all - I'm Polish so I can tell the whole background story because I read books. But as you can tell there is even a war in that movie - a bunch of people are coming and going, some soldiers are screaming ... Is this really World War II or the soldiers are on vacation? <br /> <br /> Acting and dialogues - poor, miserably poor. A.Å»mijewski, D.Stenka, M.Komorowska, W.Kowalski, A.Chyra fit into their roles, the rest of the cast (Polish) is out of place (most notably M.Ostaszewska, one of the main characters, which an unfortunate choice). 99% of the dialogues are not spoken, they are put there, the actors have difficulties to introduce themselves and no surprise, considering what strange things they have to say. <br /> <br /> And that brings us to the most disappointing. question - you can not feel it. Everything is so theatrical, artificial. There is no real life, there is no feeling in it. There are a lot of original images from World War II and, guess what, the material is much more powerful, dramatic, than what A.Wajda did. <br /> <br /> I can only see one positive - despite historical errors (like the acronym ZSRR; it was made for post-1945 propaganda purposes, to please the Polish that ZSRS is gone, and now there was ZSRR, but in 1940 there was no ZSRR!), luckily it is undoubtedly shown that killing in Katyn was done by Soviets (yes, it is a fact, not some controversial gossip). Great, two hours for 5-10 minute scene. <br /> <br /> Anyway - wasted time and potential. This is a tragedy of epic proportions, willingness to fight in 1939 (not shown), not to declare war against the Soviet Union by the Polish authorities (sic! Not shown here), arrest of soldiers shortly thereafter, living in scandalous conditions (not shown here), wait and love what will come next (barely shown), and then ... extermination. Hand in hand with the Germans - The Soviets were exterminating the Polish nation, destined for people who constituted the backbone of Poland. Unfortunately they succeed, and the results are still visible today.
