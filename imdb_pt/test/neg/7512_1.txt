If you like me you'll see this in a movie history class or something at your school, try to convince your teacher to see something else. believe me, anything is better than this movie. Is it slow, confusing, annoying, poorly constructed, bloody, thick, need I go on? The message is good, but I've seen them being treated better in several other films. The acting is not good. This movie is even stranger, since it starts as being funny (not intensional) because of its surreal story, than in the end, it just becomes uncomfortable to watch. <br /> <br /> I honestly feel that 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life have been stolen. Why would anyone want to watch a girl describe a trio for 10 minutes, than watch him go through a traffic jam for 20 minutes, listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear, witness a kind of rape, than see the female lead role her husband. <br /> <br /> Honestly this movie deserves only 1/10. And if you're not happy with my preview, seriously I'm an open-minded guy and I like movies that protest through symbolism, but this movie was just plain awful. make any excuses you can to avoid this movie.
