I hope this was done before Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds, because it was bullshit, Seagal was not guilty because it was the direction of the crap when the few action scenes happened. The plot was also confusing and basically just felt rushed, maybe it has been filed and released to capitalize on the latest Seagals movies. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> He's not done yet, bring Under Siege 3 and lose some weight!
