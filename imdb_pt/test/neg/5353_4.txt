There are other comments here expressing similar opinions, but I still feel compelled to add my comments. The film is generally well done from a technical point of view, in addition to possibly being too long. The acting is very good, although Kevin Spacey does not have much room to explain his character's motivation (apparently ambition, rather than racism), and Sandra Bullock's only role seems to be an eye candy, which she admires very well. <br /> <br /> At a fundamental level, the heart of the film is in the right place to oppose racism, and I get the impression that it has tried to establish some sort of definitive treatment of racism, perhaps because so many famous names have agreed to be in it. However, it seems that the writers bit more than they could chew (I did not read the book, so I do not know how much of it belongs to Grisham). The biggest problem, as many others have said, is that he ends up defending vigilant justice. Besides the fact that I do not agree with this position, I do not think such a vision really helps the anti-racist cause - it is more likely to be applied to acquit white defendants who kill black victims. In the end, the prosecutor invites the jury (and the public) to imagine that the girl raped was white - but after that, imagine the defendant as a white man who murdered black rapists ... in the end, the message seems to be that it's okay to kill someone as long as you hate it enough. It is also fitting that the dead man be presented as utterly perverse and his guilt to be without doubt, which eliminates any probable moral ambiguity in a real case. Samuel L. Jackson gives an excellent performance, but unfortunately this also weakens the plot - he appears as someone with considerable integrity, but it is hard to believe that he would be willing to hide behind an application for insanity (and, in fact, it does not when the push comes). We supposedly think it's because he faces the death penalty, but actually at one point he offered a wrongful death case, although if you blink you might miss. Why not accept, given that he must know that his chances of acquittal are small? Or if he wants to sit in court, why claim insanity? <br /> <br /> There are also less serious flaws. The medical specialists, whose testimony the case supposedly rests on, are jokes - both are discredited for highly implausible reasons, and none of them offers any real psychiatric diagnosis. The message seems to be that expert witnesses will tell everything they are asked to do, and they should not believe it. The fact that the injured policeman supporting Jackson is moderately plausible, but still a bit convenient (and if he had died?) I find it hard to believe that KKK marched down the street in broad daylight. Other apparently serious crimes (riot, arson, kidnapping, attempted murder) go without any visible attempt to detect or prosecute them. And the scene where the dog comes back is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> My final reaction is to get a little dirty - like I'm racist because I do not agree with the resolution. It may be that the film intends to explore different points of view and let the audience decide, but if so, it seems that they forgot about it when they came to an end. The film made me think about my points of view, read what other people thought here and add my own opinion, so on some level I might have succeeded - but I worry that this may have reinforced highly illiberal visions in some people, which I hope is the opposite of what I intended. <br /> <br /> Final Thought - Try to watch Law and Order, it covers such issues in much more depth in about 38 minutes of screen time!
