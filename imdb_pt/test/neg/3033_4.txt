The film moves very well, but the acting, direction and editing leave much to be desired. The characters are mostly taken from other movies and Vinnie Jones' Sperm came out of Gone in 50 Seconds. The gangster comedy movie is a genre that must have a lot of contrast, the stupid drug dealers of Lock Stock and the shooting that leaves everyone dead. You should never really know if you should laugh or just sit in shock. This movie had the right elements but it is very easy to sit there as a person knitting on the little details that should have been pinned somewhere along the line and, since the belief was not suspended, it only became each more critical. A shame because it was a brave attempt and although Clint Eastwood is famous for saying it will be good for a scene, he puts the job before shooting and he is Clint Eastwood. Here a little more imagination with the camera and a little more training and rehearsal for the delivery of the lines would have made a big difference.
