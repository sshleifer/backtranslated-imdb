STAR RATING: ***** Not permissible **** Very good *** Ok ** You could go out for a meal instead * Avoid at all costs. The tale of the titular Adam ( Mark O 'Halloran) and Paul (Tom Murphy), two heroin addicts in the Dublin slums and their everyday lives in their meaningless lives in search of the next dose that will make their day. Along the way they try to reconcile with close family and friends that they have managed to disappoint and destroy over the years. <br /> <br /> I know that many Irishmen like to drink, but it seems that some of them have problems with heroin, also because of the look of this movie. I know there's a bit of a problem with drugs out there, as it happens in many parts of the world, so another humorous approach on the subject is not a totally unexpected thing. <br /> <br /> I do not know. remember the last Irish movie I saw (the movie is filmed in a style that highlights it from any movie I've seen lately!) And judging from it, obviously I'm not as enlightened in your mood as I could be . The film is quite funny in certain parts, but it is obviously another comedy that is not afraid to laugh. The scene in which the mentally handicapped boy is robbed at the bottom of an alley is certainly true of what a couple of addicts can do to feed their habit, but it is nonetheless utterly contemptible and I'm not sure if that meant black humor Anyway, but certainly did not put a smile on my face! It is also a stark contrast to previous actions where they are seen showing off their soft side swinging a baby back and forth. In light of this, some may find the ending sad, others may see it as just desserts. <br /> <br /> Overall, I could not see the point in the movie. I did not see any motivation in the 'story' I was telling. It just seems to move forward without actually engaging the public in any way. Unlike Trainspotting (which handled similar themes!), It was an unsuccessful effort for most of the time that left me on the brink of shaking despite being a very short runtime of 83 minutes. It really is not nicer than following two real life addicts for one day. **
