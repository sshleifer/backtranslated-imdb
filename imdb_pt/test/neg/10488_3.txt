Ok, it's terribly, and I mean terribly, easy to separate this movie. Let's what you expect with the title, synopsis and lead actors like Carol Gilley, Ralph Baker Jr., Dorothy Davis, Bill Thurman and, my personal favorite, Roger Ready. Yes, John Agar's star is here as a sheriff to rid the Texan landscape of a robot-like monkey from a NASA experiment that went awry. The film has terrible performances, terrible scenery, terrible special effects and terrible lighting. I really can not find very good to say about it, plus bad movies you could do a lot worse as much as finding something awful to sit on. It is unbearably short and has many moments of unintentional humor. Lost signs, faux pas lighting, off-screen horror, an incredibly futile score, and of course John Agar trying his best level to be the core of the movie with a serious performance amidst that filth. The beginning is the hardest part of sitting, as it seems like it takes forever for these two teens to receive their rewards for traveling through the jungles of the Texas highways, where great primates will soon feel their vengeance in their own terrible way ... Okay, right! Scare of the night! Bah!
