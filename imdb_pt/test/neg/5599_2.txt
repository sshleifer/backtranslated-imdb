OK, if you are looking for a fun lesbian joke. This is not the movie If you are looking for a fun movie with hot sociopathic characters (in the tale of 'cruel intentions' or 'wild things') This is NOT the movie if you are looking for a classic movie of seductive vampire lesbian. This is not the movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you are looking to waste an hour of your life, this is your movie. It is badly written, misdirected, poorly marked, poorly filmed. He had bad special effects ... I mean very bad special effects. I think you can actually generate the same special effects on imovie lol. <br /> <br /> IT'S REALLY A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE. <br /> <br /> The actors were classic starlet beauties, however they look more like porn stars. It's filmed like a soft core porn, but you never get the money and the actors seem bored of their brains. the scenes of 'girl with girls', who suck btw, were so LAME that hardly worth mentioning. go watch the 'almost sex scenes' on youtube because that's the only reason you'd like to watch this movie and even there it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> A MOMENT OF MONEY AND TIME !!! nor get it, go watch 'Cruel intentions 2' - the same movie without the bad special effects, bad plot, bad writing, bad dialogue and bad acting. in fact I could go watch now just to purify my mind
