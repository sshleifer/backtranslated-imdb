I love watching Steven Seagal's films not because of the action of the big plot holes, but only because it makes me laugh <br /> <br /> oh it makes me laugh so much this movie totally has no meaning and is ridiculous compared to this movie Pearl Harbor rocks !!! and Ben Affleck does not need any acting school just to give an impression of how bad <br /> <br /> First of all, there are so many idiots and bad deeds, it's getting worse as when Steven tries to get out of jail one helicopter lands on the first security warning and they take them ashore when they fly away, suddenly a guard starts to shoot <br /> <br /> or when he kills that guy in the car he and treach walk away you can not see any oil on the ground behind him steven notice that there is oil even without seeing treach trows a lighter and the car explodes <br /> <br /> and there are plenty of more idiots Steven uses his basic action when someone is pointing a gun for him, he catches and shoots him totally bullshit !!! like a gangster would let that happen. <br /> <br /> The acting is also much worse in the fight scene in the jail place outdoors you can see steven clearly wait to get into action just kick back a couple of time and you realize the bad acting <br /> <br /> It just makes me laugh I hope someday I'll come to the movies here in Holland so I go there with as many friends as possible just to laugh at myself to death
