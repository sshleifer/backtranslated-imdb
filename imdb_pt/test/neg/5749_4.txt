A wallflower is thrown into the sea and turns into a pirate costume like a maiden in love with a pirate apprentice. Energetic and humorous, perhaps, but a poor-quality undertaking; a fake musical performance of "The Pirates of Penzance" with a cheap feel, backlot, chewing gum songs and a constant and malicious exam. Kristy McNichol's film career has had a real success after that, while actor Christopher Atkins can not control any particular emotion, his voice wavering for an appropriate tone. You have to wonder, if this is the best title they could create, what will be the intelligence level in the actual script? The affection for "Grease" movie for musicals does not match his propensity for the slapstick to the "Airplane!" Although McNichol works a long time and is effervescent and almost makes flaccid handling seem captivating. For the most part, it's a constraint. * 1/2 of ****
