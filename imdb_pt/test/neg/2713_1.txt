This has to be one of the if not the worst movies I've ever seen. After watching this video, I felt I should write to Madonna and demand compensation for my time, but now I feel I should write to Madonna and demand a great album from the 80's (considering she can not record a good album for save your life more) in exchange for this disaster. <br /> <br /> For the movie itself, it can be summarized like this: <br /> <br /> It consists of Madonna jumping like a spoiled teenager who got lost. She's trying to impress the absolute jerk of an actor who plays "the lawyer" in the film. But the best was the end. I was staring with my chin on the floor for the television while the credits rolled thinking to myself. "Is this the end? This is the end, what the fuck!" If Madonna was not a pop icon at the time of this movie, this movie would have destroyed her career alone. And the funniest thing about the whole situation is that I just watched the drug movie to see where they put the song "Who's That Girl". Well, guess where they put it? ............................ .......at the end!
