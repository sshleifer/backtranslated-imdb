After hoo-hooing American Indian scalp number one son, frontiersman Bruce Bennett (as Daniel Boone) seems, at first, how he wants to stay even; but he really wants to make friends with the natives. When the sad-eyed Indian chief Lon Chaney Jr. (like Blackfish) also loses his number one son, it becomes more difficult to clear up misunderstandings. Apparently this was Republic Pictures' attempt to make "Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer" what Disney Studio had done successfully with "Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier" (1955). Dan'l Boone "song, whistled and sung by a group of children in a wagon, did not follow" Davy Crockett "from Fess Parker to the Hit Parade, singer Faron Young (as Faron Callaway) he does not play the title song (perhaps wisely), he sings "Long Green Valley" and makes a good impression as a blond boyfriend for Boone's daughter.But Spanish actor Freddy Fernandez is the film's most valuable player. Fernanda remembers Mr. Young the name of the character ("Susannah") that he should be in love with. <br /> <br /> Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer (10/5/56) Ismael Rodriguez ~ Bruce Bennett, Lon Chaney Jr., Young Faron, Freddy Fernandez
