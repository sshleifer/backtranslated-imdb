This movie was supposedly based on a non-fiction book. I'm not sure what book the writer (s) read to write his adaptation, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the real adventures of Frances Mayes's life in Italy. Instead, it's an uninteresting tale that takes liberties at all times to beat men. Look at the following examples: <br /> <br /> ************************************* ******************************* <br /> <br /> SWITCHER DETAILS <br /> <br /> * ************************************************* ************************ Bash number one: Lane's husband betrays her and her marriage ends in divorce. <br /> <br /> Bash Number Two: Take business ventures in a local Italian town and is promptly solicited by all men on the street. <br /> <br /> Number Three Bash: Lane is saved from the city folk horny men by a charming gentlemen. She falls in love with him after consuming an afternoon of love. She later discovers that he is already stuck and cheating on her. <br /> <br /> Number Four Bash: You have to broaden your horizon for this because the reference is definitely in the movie. Her lesbian girlfriends decide to have a baby by fertilization with invetro (SP). I have been told that in most lesbian relationships, you have one person taking on the female role and another assuming the male role. In the film, after the female became pregnant, the "male" lesbian decides to run out in the relationship because she can not deal with it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie has nothing to do with the movie. book that was supposed to be based.
