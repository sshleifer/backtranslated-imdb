First of all, I have nothing against Christianity. I believe, every person has the right to believe in what he or she chooses. But I can not imagine how a person has to be dumb to believe it! What a waste of money from believers. It is best to use it to feed some hungry families in third world countries. I do not want to talk about acting chats or plotting this "movie" because I have not found any of it. The story is simple - two reporters, one (A) is atheist, the other (B) for some reason abandoned religion. B regains his trust in religion and teaches A to a lesson - believe in Christ or go to hell. This message appears after ten minutes and keeps repeating until the end of the movie. People, do not believe in the classification of this "movie", read the reviews first. I did not do it and I lost an hour of my life :( PS: Why is it classified as science fiction because of these few strange sounds and some bright light from the sky? PPS: UFO = Satan does evil?
