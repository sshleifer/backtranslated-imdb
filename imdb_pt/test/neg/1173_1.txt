I did a review for this director's fictional recreation of BTK. I also saw this movie and it was terrible. Please save your money and time. This movie was terrible and this director has no talent. I do not understand how he's funding these movies. They are horrible. I decided to make sure to check who the writer, director, and producer are, and if the director's name comes along, I will not waste my money. There is nothing worse than renting a movie on a Friday night, make the popcorn and then realize that you have been deceived by the creative art in front of the movie box. To stay away. So I guess I should do a few things to fill the lines? I've always checked the IMDb for revisions before, but I do not think I'm going to. This is ridiculous. I have been corrected in my comments many times. There are not enough rows? You can cancel my account. Your site is a pain.
