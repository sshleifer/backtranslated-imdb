There is a phrase from experimental filmmaker Nathaniel Dorsky that says some movies are structured like a camera mounted on the head of a dog that descends an alley, smelling everything along the way. <br /> <br /> That's what a movie is. The structure is "Kurosawa started as a baby, so he became a boy, then a young man, then a film director, so he started doing 'masterpieces', so he aged, The End." The word 'masterpiece' is widely used in this film to describe Kurosawa's production, without explaining * what * makes his films so good / great. Just because the off-screen narrator reading a screenplay says a movie is a masterpiece, should we kiss your ass and accept that a certain movie is one of the great works of art of the twentieth century? And one more point. Paul Scofield's voice is used as the voice of Kurosawa, when excerpts from the director's memoirs are read on screen. It brings Shakespearean pear-shaped tones to the text ... but why it? If you were making a documentary about Billie Holiday, would you use Dame Judi Densch as your voice?
