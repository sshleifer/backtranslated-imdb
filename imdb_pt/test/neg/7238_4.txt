When I first saw the octopus film it was a laugh to see the effects acting on cheese and shocking. This movie seemed to outweigh the acting, but not the special effects. After Jaws and Piranha, of course, why not make a movie about a killer octopus? The octopus invades the waters of New York, where two police investigators try to stop the furious beast before July 4. <br /> <br /> A nice clean lot and downhill events, but the octopus was very scary, it's nice to see they actually did this time but it looked like a piece of plastic ... Best on a big budget, this movie could have been a good watch. There are a continuous amount of errors where it would not surprise me if they did not research how the octopus lives ... <br /> <br /> Look at this, if you like cheap DVD sequences, otherwise you'd better see the Jaws .
