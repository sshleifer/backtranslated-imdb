The box for this movie is totally wrong. The hood shows a view of legs and panties with a short skirt. The title is "Tart". The synopsis on the back of the box made it seem like Cat, the main character, was an outcast who became one of the most popular students, but that popularity led to a bizarre lifestyle she could not escape. All that the box built this movie was a horrible lie. I expected a kind of crap, direct video version of "Heathers" aimed at today's teenagers. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you what 'Tart' was really about. Yes, this is really the plot; so if you do not want to know what happens, stop reading. We have a rich, boring and nasty girl. This girl's best friend who is evil is a skank. The skank is kicked out of school, so the lovely girl becomes friends with a British girl. This leads to the nasty girl who dates this boring guy, whom the box refers to as "the most popular boy in school". If that guy was the most popular guy in his school, I would have liked to go to that school because I could have kicked his crap. Either way, as any movie will tell you, the most popular guy in school is invariably a killer, a drug addict or a thief, or in this case, all of the above. Anyway, everyone ends up not liking the main character because she's Jewish. Then the most popular guy at school beats his best friend, bitch, to death with a stone, because the skank caught the most popular boy in a homosexual act. The impassive mother of the girl and the hypochondriac younger brother are there for her in the end. Oh, and the whole movie is about rich kids and their horrible parents too. Wow, what's wrong with that? That sounds like a fantastic movie! Well, that's what I thought. But you see, there are no friendly characters in this movie. The main character is boring. The filmmakers have averaged, while during the film she continues to talk about what she is an aberration. The skank is not skanky enough and has little screen time. The popular guy is nothing to write. The popular girls are just your rich and mediocre girls. There are no moral lessons. Cat, the boring main character, is not an aberration, has never become one of the truly popular girls, and (worst of all) after all the crap she goes through, she thinks she's still too good to make friends with the one Cool girl, stupid girl. To be honest, I have no idea why the movie is called Tart. I kept asking, who's the pie? Is she the pie? Are they all pies? At 94 minutes, theoretically, this is not a long movie. But after actually watching this terrible waste of a VHS tape, and not knowing who the pie was, I was surprised that the movie lasted only an hour and a half. The movie seemed to have two hours and some change. After a while, I was hoping the movie was about pop tarts. At least when you look at a box of pop pies, you know what to expect.
