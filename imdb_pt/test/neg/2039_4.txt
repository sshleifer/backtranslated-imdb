Kind of boring, kind of rude, kind of upsetting, that was not horrible, but not very good. There is a bit scary when the statue comes alive, however, it sticks to that scene. Not much happens and the movie looks kind of scary. I was happy when it ended, and I do not believe anything about it being a true story ... very surprised that this is on average around 6.
