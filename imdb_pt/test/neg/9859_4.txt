Being an admitted chess addict, I was excited to see a documentary about the 1997 rematch between Garry Kasparov and IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer. He hoped to see in depth the departure and much of what Kasparov had to say. Boy I was wrong and wrong for a mile. This documentary is very much like many modern documentaries - there is a lot of flash, but no real substance. After watching, I am sad to say that I felt I wasted my time. One of the most annoying aspects of the documentary is that it does not stay in one place for a decent period of time. It has the typical MTV type edition, where the camera displays different pictures and quick touches of people every five seconds. It is very sad that the cinematographic production has been reduced to the attention of a child of 10 years. <br /> <br /> I understand that it is difficult to make a film about chess, but that does not mean it should make it flashy. 'Game Over' had some interesting ideas. I brought the idea whether computers can think like humans or not; if computers have advanced to a new, single level. This is what Kasparov thought after the match, but this film is not deep enough with that idea. In addition, this movie tries to bring a bizarre theory. He tries to imply the paranoid that a human being was doing the movements along with the help of the computer. Kasparov had suspicions about this, but still there is no evidence. Near the end of the film, he tries to suggest the oddity that maybe Anatoly Karpov was the human being who was secretly doing the moves with the help of Deep Blue. Interesting to think about, but I do not know how plausible or realistic it is. I still would not recommend this movie, not even for chess addicts.
