Like anyone else who bought this, I was cheated by the "20 pieces of extreme blood" and "banished in 20 countries" or whatever it says on the box. I have to admit that I'm a big fan of Gore and I'm always amazed when the movies can put it in the thick and look convincing doing it. Tom Savini, Rick Baker and Greg Cannom are some of the best in the business. The revolutionized makeup effects in the 80's. Today, you do not need them because everything is done on the computer. But computers can not compare with the visual magic these three men could conjure. But I digress. Watching fantastically bloody movies like Fulci's Gates to Hell or even Savini's biggest achievement, Friday the 13th, the final chapter, you can appreciate all that goes into making a terribly bloody movie. You can not tell the difference between reality and magic. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine another reason why anyone would see Cannibal Ferox, but the blood that is ostensibly omnipotent in this movie. If that's the reason you're looking for this movie then you're wasting your money. As many reviewers have noted here, most of the blood is a remnant. You do not see the torture, or the bloodshed as it happens, you see what it looks like afterwards. <br /> The blood? Well, it's here, but not as much as one would expect or expect. A man is castrated and a woman is hanged by the breasts, but others are those two scenes, and one involving a scalping; There is nothing really much to this movie. The blood scenes, even in these three mentioned, are still very tame compared to what you were expecting. Maybe it's just me and my experience sick and distorted in the horror and gore genre, but I've been waiting a little longer. Call me sick or twisted, but is not that the only reason people are watching this movie in the first place? I honestly found myself bored in many places. <br /> <br /> Cannibal Ferox is just another movie that tries to take advantage of the craze of a top film. While the Cannibal Holocaust is not exactly a great movie, it's a lot better than that. If you go out of your way to buy this for $ 20.00, you will feel cheated. <br /> <br /> 3/10
