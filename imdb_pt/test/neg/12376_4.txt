I saw this movie when I was 12 when I left. I remember that the most frightening scene was the big bird eating men hanging in parachutes from the air. The horror. The horror. As a kid going to these B movies on Saturday afternoons, I was still sick of the formula for those monster-type movies that usually included the hero, a pretty woman who could be the daughter of a teacher and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end. I do not care much about the romantic angle as a 12-year-old boy and the predictable plots. I love them now for unintentional humor. <br /> <br /> But about a year later, I saw Psycho when he left and I loved that the star, Janet Leigh, was eliminated at the beginning of the movie. . I sat down and took notice at that moment. Once writers are making up the story, make it as scary as possible and not from a well-used formula. There's no rules.
