The Quick and the Undead is finally the first movie to actually make its own plot null and void. It is essentially a gigantic conspiracy hole. Besides, the acting was bad enough, there were nonexistent or unbelievable character motivations, and there was not a single character worth hanging our hat. The most interesting cast member (who had great potential to be the protagonist of an underdog) was killed in the middle of the process. <br /> <br /> What Quick and Undead serve is a great example of how to do good. color time. It seemed excellent, when you take into account the budget considerations. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's as if a guy had gotten a hundred dollars and watched some westerns (mostly The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) and then just played a bunch of randomly in one movie ... "You know, they have movies where the characters do it! It fits here? No, but who cares! They do it in other movies, so I should do it here!" <br /> < > Perhaps a good insight into the expanding cinematographers and colorists (first year film students). Otherwise a must-miss.
