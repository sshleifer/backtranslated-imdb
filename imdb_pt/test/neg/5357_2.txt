What can you say after watching this movie? That is, if you had the interest and concentration to see it to the end. I was speechless because of the stupendous story, the irritating situations in which one American equals fifty or more Iraqis and a boring dialogue. I think if this movie has something to teach, it's probably like "Do not play with the US, or we'll kick your asses". In addition, this movie really encourages and votes to kill masses of foreigners in the name of war. I have the image of playing chess pieces off the game board. Except, now it's fast and there's not much thought. And besides ... no character has any spirit; so how can you care about what happens to any of them? Excluding the fans of tasteless war movies, I would not recommend this to anyone. There must always be something more interesting to do.
