The Hindi remake of Mrs. Doubtfire, starring and directed by Kamal Hassan, is a somewhat insignificant version, and not as good as expected. <br /> <br /> Kamal Hassan clearly struggles with the Hindu dialogues, even after all these years, and can not handle it. even an effortless scene. The guy got old and should rest. Hassan brings nothing new to the role or character, as Dustin Hoffman tells Tootsie, or Marathi actor Macchindranath Kambli does for the character of Mavshi (aunt) in "Moruchi Mavshi" (Moru's Aunt, comedy). /> <br /> What was the child doing playing with fireworks when it was not Diwali? Most of the romantic "cross connections" of Chachi - Vs Amrish, Paresh and then Johny Walker, seem redundant to the main plot. The Tabu bath scene was unnecessary. The family is from northern India, but it should be remembered the night of Karva Chauth by a 'Maharashtrian' Chachi. Yes right. Good acting skills of not one but four actors, such as Tabu, Om Puri, the late Amrish Puri and Paresh Rawal, were wasted in this film. <br /> <br /> Watch the original Mrs. Doubtfire - clean, crisp and crackling with fun, very different from Chachi 420.
