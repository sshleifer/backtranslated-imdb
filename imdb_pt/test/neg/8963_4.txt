**** SOFT SPOILERS _ BUT YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE SHOP **** The woman is raped and decides to take her anger out of all humanity. Oh, did I mention that the rape victim was mute? That's the problem with MS 45, so the rape victim decides he's going to kill men, but is there any logical explanation for that? Surely the whole movie would be better if we had Thana giving a voice on why she's hitting on any man she meets? There is not enough development for this plot <br /> <br /> As you would expect from a Ferrara movie, it is not a complete waste of time. is much better than COST IN HIS GRAVE and pseudo-intellectuals will have a field day pointing to the irony of the woman holding a knife like a penis while Thana makes a killing at the end. But the script is somewhat silly and underdeveloped and hinders any serious commentary the film may have made.
