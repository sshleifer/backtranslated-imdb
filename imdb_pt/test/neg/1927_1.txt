I watched this movie to see the direction in which one of the most promising young talents of the cinema was going. Unfortunately, with this film, Leelee Sobieski chose a path not only well spent, but completely free of any significant destination. This movie used all the banal tricks in the book to leave the screen, touch you on the shoulder and politely ask if it can have your heart strings to give them a good tug. Romance can be done well, and when it is, the viewer is feeling the love portrayed on the screen. During the emotional climax of this film, I laughed. Sincerely. To save you time and money, I would suggest that instead of watching this movie, you have a meal of Karo and Velveeta syrup. It's the same.
