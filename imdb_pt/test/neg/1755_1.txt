What gives Anthony Minghella the right to ruin two extraordinary works of fiction? First, he destroyed The English Patient, which was bad enough, but now I find out that he massacred Cold Mountain - massacred !!! <br /> <br /> I had such a strange reaction to The English Patient. My son and I went to see the first weekend that was released, and I was so disappointed, but told my son that I needed to read the book. I drove straight to Barnes and Noble, bought, read and tried to find out what the critics were talking about when they said that Minghella had trusted enough in the minds of the public to give them a great movie. . This is what he certainly did not do. <br /> <br /> I do not usually read much fiction, but Cold Mountain was so highly recommended by friends that I felt compelled to read it. I did not see Cold Mountain, the movie, when it hit the theaters, and it was because of what Minghella had done to The English Patient. But as an idiot, I rented today, and I'm so upset that I had to vent my frustration and, most of all, my sadness, that someone could have taken away this beautiful story and worked on something almost as beautiful as canvas, and now they never go. <br /> <br /> READ THE BOOK AND LEAVE THE MOVIE CIRCUIT ON THE SHELF. I will never be taken by a Minghella project again. I think he may be one of the worst directors working today, and I'm tired of the compliments Hollywood has in his head. It must be that no one in Hollywood reads more. This movie bears no resemblance to the book, except for the names of the characters. Minghella's ego should have no limits, and if he did not like the book, why did not he write an original script and leave the book alone. Even if I had not read the book, I would still consider this film one of the worst I've seen since 2003; and I've seen almost everything that was released for viewing in the US. <br /> <br /> Elaine, you're not going to like it either.
