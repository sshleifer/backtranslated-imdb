I will never go back the three hours of life that this movie stole from me. <br /> <br /> The film is basically a psychedelic drug trip disguised as an important creative process. I'd love to know what they were doing when this movie was made. <br /> <br /> It is also the historically more inaccurate film that exists; 2001 has come and gone without any of the events or forecasts that are taking place. <br /> <br /> Characters are unpleasant, design is simplistic and all simply ramblings without any sense or logic. <br /> <br /> And the ending is probably the worst: it's supposed to be thought-provoking, but the only thought that popped into my mind is "What is F $ * K going on ?!" <br /> <br /> I would say that for anyone looking for serious entertainment, avoid this movie at all costs and choose a science fiction movie that is NOT to your liking @ $$.
