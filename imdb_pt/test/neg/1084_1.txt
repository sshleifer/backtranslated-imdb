I'll say it again ... one of the worst films ever made and was made by the director who made one of my favorite movies - "Excalibur". I was shocked to see that it had a note of more than six. This movie sucks. It looked terrible. It looked like it was filmed in 18 days and Boorman must have slept when he drove it. Arquette did nothing. Simply terrible, rotten, unbearable, and probably the only flaw in Boorman's celebrated career. <br /> <br /> 1/10 !!!!!
