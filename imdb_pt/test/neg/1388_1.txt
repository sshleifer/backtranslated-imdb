... If you have laughed a lot for a long time, and need to take a break. <br /> <br /> After reading about 25 unfavorable reviews of this show, I decided to call it and check it out for myself. Everything each of these people said about this show is absolutely true. Mind of Mencia is like a half-hour version of Mad TV, but with somehow worse jokes. <br /> <br /> One satire I had the dislike to watch was "The Second Annual Stereotype Olympics." What's funny about the black guy who has trouble swimming, or gay guy named "Sparkles", who wins a banana eating contest? None of these concepts is particularly new, insightful or entertaining. Do we really need a joke about Star Wars every episode? This movie came out 30 years ago. Mencia's solution to funny things is to cast some stereotypes about Hispanics and throw some "beans" in there; and call him a day to go home to roll into his pile of money. Pure comic genius. <br /> <br /> Then he shamelessly ripped off Jeff Foxworthy in a second show I watched, with a "Your gay if ..." bit. You could imagine the laughter he had when he got a joke from Ryan-Seacrest-gay. It is not as if one of these had ever been done to the death. <br /> <br /> Unless you're a big fan of the Jason Friedberg and Adam Seltzer movies, please stay away from this show. Especially when there are authentic comedians like Dave Chappelle out there who can play about racing and racism and still be insightful.
