The Canterville Ghost (1996). The director made this very sappy a production. Maybe it's the generation, but I really enjoyed the Charles Laughton version. There is a time and place for "emoting" and this production does not translate very well. Patrick Stewart, reciting Shakespeare, was very good but still inadequate. Would not recommend or watch again. The close-ups and padded text and sub-plots were lost on me. Adding strange material and scenes strips of a truly great job. The writer should find another profession to deceive his talent, perhaps the evening novels would be a better place. Check out the really good version and pass it on.
