This is the kind of late night cable movie usually associated with Andrew Stevens or Shannon Tweed. Although unlike most T & A fuel-fired vehicles of Tweed and Stevens, this is lethally annoying! <br /> <br /> Let's get right to the point. The real reason to watch this non-thriller is to see the breasts of Shannon Doherty. Anyone who declares otherwise is a LIAR! However, most of her appetizing sex scenes seem to be all smoke and mirrors. <br /> <br /> Note that all shots where the head and chest are shown at the same time are fast peek-a-boo flashes. The frames where the camera stays on her naked body, there is little or no face trapped or she is behind a wet and dripping shower door. <br /> <br /> All breast watchers know what that means - double body! <br /> <br /> I must admit, however, that the end of Doherty's bound, blindfolded, and threatened with a knife provided some fetishistic emotion. <br /> <br /> If you find a VHS copy anywhere, buy it! As all involved are probably too embarrassed to let this go out on DVD!
