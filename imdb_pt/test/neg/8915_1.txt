For starters, I love Steven Seagal, man is a genius. But recent movies make me think, is he trying harder? His most recent films almost show no effort on Seagal's part. In Out of Reach, it is very obvious that your lines are dubbed. . What Seagal does in this film is not only a slap in the face of his fans, but even more so to Jean-Claude Van Damme and his fans. In the second scene, as he prepares for the zipline to cover the drug dealers to steal the jewels and the money, he shows the gun and holds it in a neon sign. You may be saying to yourself, "Hey, so what does this have to do with Van Damme?" Well, this scene was stolen from a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie called Order. Rent both, watch both, compare the two and you will lose respect for Seagal. Not just today's junk you were dying for, but it was, I daresay, an insult. Seagal's Aikido moves are still good, but why he is not making great movies like Death Marked or Above the Law, he still has the moves and the attitude, I just kept asking myself 'Why Seagal, why?' . There are such idiotic scenes in his latest movies that have nothing to do with the plot, and those silly stories on top of that. I hope that the next Black Dawn movie is another Exit Wounds or Beyond Justice, because these last movies he made, especially Today You Die, really made me wonder if he has the material to do more action movies like Double Team. . Please do not watch this movie, unless you hate Seagal, if you love your movies, do not watch it, it will make you question his future in the action movie genre.
