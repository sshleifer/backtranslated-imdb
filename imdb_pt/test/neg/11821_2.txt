Imagine an explorer remake of The Defiant Ones with a black girl and a white girl attached to each other. Set the story on some Caribbean island where drug dealers dominate and the revolution has come. And the black woman is from the Huggy Bear ladies' stable and the white woman is a watery Patty Hearst and you have a black mother, a white mother. <br /> <br /> In those last days of the drive-in This item must have been a great success. All the hot buttons of the seventies are pushed into this one. Even if the two fill their clothes better and get some whistling from the males in the audience, no one will confuse Pam Grier and Margaret Markov with Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis. All right, Halle Berry and Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> Margaret and Pam are prisoners where the guards and the director glance lasciviously at the new incoming fish. Margaret is a rich girl from the state who took over the "revolution" while Pam is her basic, high-priced girl who has been serving the local drug kingpin and got tired of it and tried to leave the island. <br /> <br /> Margaret's fellow comrades ambush the bus that transports them from prison to town, but they get lost on the run. Both have their different agendas, but like Sid and Tony, they can not come to terms with the agenda of those who come first. It makes some interesting moments, like the police, the drug dealers and the revolutionaries are looking for these two ill-fated comrades. <br /> <br /> Just so you do not get the wrong ideas, the boss of the revolutionaries and Markov's partner is named Ernesto, played by the Filipino actor Zaldy Zshornack. All the mess was filmed in the philippines that were starting their own film industry began. <br /> <br /> Nice location photography in the Philippines is all that Black Mama, White Mam has to recommend it to. But if you are a fan of bad black exploration movies, this is one for you.
