It's a joke right?! Lynch failed to produce this as a TV show. He was broke, so what to do? Well, he somehow got a few bucks and "completed" the pilot and created that mess by just blending everything ... How can anyone see a failed pilot for TV as a cinematic masterpiece? <br /> <br /> And now everyone is guessing about the deeper meaning! Well, wake up, there's none! As in that other Lynch TV series, what was the name again? Same procedure there. Build a mystery and then make up nothing. I think Lynch will repeat that concept until people realize, the emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> In Germany there is a comedian named Harpe Kerkerling. He dressed like an opera singer and "introduced" some new "artistic songs". Sing a complete nonsense like this: <br /> <br /> "The wolf, the lamb, the meadow, Hurrz!" <br /> <br /> It's a classic now. <br /> <br /> Anyway, afterwards he argued with the audience. And they were talking seriously about the deeper meaning of the wolf / lamb relationship. <br /> <br /> You give this movie a rating of 8.0 on imdb.com, you can be one of them. <br /> <br /> So let's say it all together: "Hurrz!" <br /> 0/10 Macaulay J.
