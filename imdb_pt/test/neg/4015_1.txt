I saw the episode about living with minimum wage. It was as far as the appearance of Oprah Winfrey for that episode. It's bad enough that people struggle to meet their goals week by week. So having this hypocrite exploiting the problem. I did not appreciate the constant complaint from him or his significant other, everywhere. Queston is how anyone has the power to pay their medical bills from the emergency room? of course he shows that the account is high, but he paid the remaining balance (his own pocket) after his "harrowing" experience. How many poor people have this kind of privilege after 30 days to pay their bills. Instead, they are starving and "stealing Peter to pay Paul." Complaining throughout the episode is not a humiliating thing for him. The scene of the movie and the restaurant is scary. Another privilege he has that poor people do not.
