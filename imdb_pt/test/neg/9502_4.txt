(Only light spoilers here) <br /> <br /> Steal Sinatra is a half-assed comedy about kidnappers, dimwit victims and a few other side stories thrown in to eat some time. <br /> You will see some bad performances around this movie. Drama is forced and humor does not make sense. Whether you're watching kidnappers threatening the victim who does not shut up, or the parent of a victim responding to the criminal's threat of death with "Taking care of a tea?" None of this is believable. This fits comfortably into the "wannabe movie" category. <br /> <br /> You will also be listening to a repetitive music track throughout the movie. It is very unprofessional and adds nothing. It's really just a sad attempt to make a painfully dull movie look a bit witty. <br /> <br /> However, if you can see beyond all this and suspend much disbelief, you can have fun with the movie. plot. <br /> <br /> I voted for 4/10.
