National Lampoon Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure (2003) Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Dana Barron, Tom Jake Thomas, Hi Lee, Eric Idle, Willard Fred, Ed Asner, D: Nick Marck. The embarrassing direct video failure has cousin Cousin Eddie and his family on vacation paid with expenses to the South Pacific by their boss, hoping the donkey will not sue his company after being bitten by a smarter lab monkey! The spin-idiot can not be compared to any of the holiday films (even the European holidays!), With a question of whether or not the writers found the script funny. Not even Quaid, Willard or Asner can do this remotely watchable. 83 min., No classification. *
