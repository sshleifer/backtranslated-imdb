This movie is painfully bad. You can say that all the actors are ashamed of being associated with such a terrible movie. There are obvious budget constraints, but with a little attention and attention to detail, the film could have been much better. For example: Check out the scene where Mickey goes first to the morgue and is talking to his friend, the pathologist, while the murdered taxi driver is lying on the slab. You can actually see the corpse breathing! What, they could not afford to hire an extra decent half that could hold their breath for a 2 minute scene?!
