I usually prefer a lot more French films than Americans, with explosions and car chases, but this movie was very disappointing. There's no way to write a spoiler because nothing really happens. This French couple lives in Lisbon for years and returns to Paris for a friend's wedding. They announce to another friend that they are having dinner with what they are going to share. So nothing much happens, they do not seem to know whether they want to separate or not. I do not necessarily think that your hesitations make a bad movie, it is very human to hesitate before making such a decision forever, but this could be handled in an interesting way, giving a little meat to your desires and relationships, but this does not happen. One leaves the theater without knowing why these two have joined or want to separate. The only piece I liked was the conversation with the drunk. That was true for life.
