I'm not going to waste any more time describing how bad this movie is. Bottom line: It was terribly acted out, it had huge plot holes and was absolutely ON EVERYTHING. The only good thing about it was the description that my digital cable gave to the film: "A man married to a struggling business has an affair with his secretary." There is?? Apparently a wrong movie, though it might have made things a little more interesting if any of the descriptions were true. <br /> <br /> - Shelly
