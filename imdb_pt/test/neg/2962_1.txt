This film was produced by Producers Releasing Corp. (PRC) from the so-called "Poverty Row" film studios of the 1930s and 40s. So you can imagine how you spent little money doing it. <br /> <br /> The music is forgettable. Cast member Gerra Young has an operatic voice, but it's a kind of discount for Deanna Durbin. The IMDb database does not show any other cinematic appearances for her so let's hope she has managed to move to some sort of position at the Grand Opera. <br /> <br /> The opening credits of the label recently broadcast by Turner. Classic films indicate that this film was preserved by the National Film Museum. This immediately begs the question? Are your resources so plentiful that they can afford to preserve the trash? Some low budget or B musicals from that era have redeeming features that make them worthwhile. This movie has none. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, skip this movie. You really waste an hour of your time.
