Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning As a child, Mark Goddard ( C Thomas Howell) sat helpless as his family, including his father hero cop (Jeff Fahey), were brutally murdered by vicious criminals he tried to overthrow. With an inner urge to punish those who make fake mistakes on him, as he grew up as a result of this, Mark employs harsh means by bringing the suspects he is chasing and gets into a lot of trouble with his superiors because of it. But then he learns about "Justice Incorporated," a secret group of men and women led by a mysterious man (Ed Lauter) who serves to hand out punishment that fits into outlaw crime. But then things get out of control and the living can be harder than he thought. The Broom is in trouble from the start because we've seen exactly the same plan done before (and better) in such films as The Star Chamber with Michael Douglas and Magnum Force with Clint Eastwood. The title also makes no sense. But we also have to deal with the film's total ridicule, including a scene where a daughter's headset manages to muffle the sound of her family being shot down, an ending involving a chase with a bad guy that starts on the road and ends in a Wright. Brothers' plane, as well as some of the most ridiculous performances ever made on screen and a very clich√©d and pretentious script. But there are some cool action sequences here and there and the film's involuntary laughter factor certainly keeps you alive with a wrist. **
