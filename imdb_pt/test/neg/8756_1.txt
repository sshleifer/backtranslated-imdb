Most low-budget thriller films made exclusively for the 1980s invariably get worse than the old raunchy stockings. This particularly-discouraged and amateur-not-play "Chicago Nutcracker-gag" nasty necrophiliac nut in the loose blood bath "serves as a depressing affirmation of this ineluctable border fact. A psychedelic fruit cake with wide-eyed, disheveled, long-haired, beads and flowers, embarks on its standard random killing, graphically massacring libidinous young couples who are engaged in strenuous coitus whenever the lunatic lunatic attacks Mansonescos. (Hmm, I detect a fairly obvious and self-righteous puritan message "have sex and die" here?), Boy, it's that man.) Boy, it's this mentally unbalanced male, a real chick: After stabbing his female victims, our Cracker killer Certified likes to make love with their newly dead bodies. At the end of the picture, the mad copulator of corpses is rudely interrupted by the cops while he is in the midst of doing the unthinkable with a nubile corpse, causing the dirty pervert to loosen up with an understandable anguish and shouts of "Nooo!" Now, this gonzo is not a definite love and half? <br /> <br /> Pity that this film is so badly done, if it had been done with just a little talent and proficiency, could The stubborn direction of Wally Koz, the stubbornly immovable and immobile cinematography of Lamar "Larry" Bloodworth, the insipid score of "hard rock" by Frankie "Hollywood" Rodriguez, to be a little gem of a horror exploration item. make-up mercifully inexpensive and unconvincing, inconsequently uneasy plywood acting through a horrible all unattractive and unprofessional, lethargic rhythm (much screen time is wasted in the monotonous efforts of the police (the true identity of the mysterious killer is guaranteed to have you moaning in disgust), the equally boring characters, incessantly quarrelsome and positively intelligent, and a steady succession of sex scenes without a smile that are as erotic as watching two slugs for 90 minutes in a row add to a loose, soggy, deeply putrid and unpaying noodle of moldy clinker. However, to be fair, this movie possesses a stellar virtue: The crazy dog ​​slasher has a great taste unquestionably in diagonal and extravagantly tropical Hawaiian shirts.
