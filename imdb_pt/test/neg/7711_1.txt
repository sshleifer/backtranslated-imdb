I'll keep you for bullet points, so here it goes: 1. Very poorly scripted. 2. Try to be like Resident Evil. 3. Slow and docile zombies in a minute the next minute Mad furious. 4. I have never seen blood wipe so easily! 5. Special effects not as good as the original "Day of the Undead". 6. Act not as well as the "Bold and the Beautiful". 7. It looks like it was written in 1 week and done the following week. <br /> <br /> The Basicaly Med team and Special Forces enter a zombie-infested university to find the first zombie and extract a serum to cure the plague. . Everyone dies, except the 2 main stars, so predictable, though unarmed and filled with hundreds of zombies that survived. However, special forces (who were trained in scouts from kindergarten) took only 1 zombie to kill them, even if they had guns. Also the compulsive idiot on hand to fill any gaps. Total garbage charge.
