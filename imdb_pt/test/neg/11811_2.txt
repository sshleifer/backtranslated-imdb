Well, that's how it should have been called. Mainly due to the ridiculous use of what can hardly be called symbolism by the director. I would not have been surprised to discover that this was one of Lea Pool's earliest efforts and B) at least semi-autobiographical. Turns out A is wrong, though I do not know about B. I bet she went to boarding school, though, and had a rather terrible same-sex relationship of some sort. This is the message that was shot down by this film, and the short that preceded it, whose name I do not remember anymore. <br /> <br /> In any case, the development of the character was clumsy (Who introduces himself by saying what her name means? No one.) The symbols were as subtle as an all-glass elevator full of teenage girls losing one and plunging eighty stories. All about a loudspeaker. Honestly, the cry of a hawk when Perabo declared that she was a bird of prey and jumped off the table? This was ridiculous to the point of parody. And it was just one of the many symbols made to show viewers what she meant. And that was that she had a poor childhood and feels the need to make movies about it, ala Vincent Gallo, instead of seeing a therapist, ward of all of us who follow our lives. There was nothing tender, nothing sweet, and nothing moving about this movie. Brett Ratneresque was a badly staged piece of trash, and the actors could not save Brett Ratneresque at the top of the movie "HEY THIS IS MY POINT IN THIS MOVIE," using filming, writing and acting techniques. Sorry, but it was terrible.
