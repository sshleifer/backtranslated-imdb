I just do not understand why anytime someone does a show about one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country (Houston, Dallas, Austin / San Antonio etc.), they portray the average person as someone who wears wranglers / cowboy hat, talks to a drawn accent, has no sense of fashion and drives a truck on the way to the "saloon" or his next hunting trip, rodeo, target shooting or country music concert. I've never seen a small town cop driving a police truck ... anywhere in Texas. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that this is not done for artistic reasons or comedy ... they are really serious and I think the average person is too stupid to know the difference. Bad scripts and equally bad acting leave that aside. This show does shows in the past, like the Knightrider. At least Knightrider had the talking car.
