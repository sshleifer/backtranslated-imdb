This is probably the most uninviting film I have ever seen. I watched because I have a crush on Leon (everything Besson did was awful, in my opinion, except for the script for Wasabi) and Jean Reno. It is a testament to how bad this movie is that Reno, one of the most charismatic and easily affable actors (admittedly he's just starting here) can not make this movie, or the times he's onscreen, watchable. It's all very philanthropic: black and white, no dialogue, people doing things for no apparent reason, people chasing each other and being chased by a shaky camera. And, predictably, none of this is fun. <br /> <br /> It's not a "French Mad Max" as some people have claimed (actually, I think they mean "Mad Max 2") - that's a superficial comparison. based only on the fact that both films have a post-apocalyptic setting, and it's exactly the kind of comment you expect from someone who does not know what you're talking about. Mad Max 2 was pulsing, Mad Max 2 was exciting, Mad Max 2 was worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is nothing like that. <br /> <br /> I know it's cool to like arty black-and-white French movies and equally cool to say that you saw something in them that other people did not (or you got to sit without feeling sleepy), and that's why I would not trust anyone who claims to like Le Dernier Combat because I see nothing of value in all this; asks a lot and does not return anything. I found myself drifting after about five minutes and never did anything to regain my full attention. Anyone who can sit without distractions is not human, or at best psychotic. (Actually, they're probably just trying to look "cool").
