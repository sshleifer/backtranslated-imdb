I find it almost touching how Star Trek fans desperately try to like this movie, despite its incredible number of flaws. <br /> <br /> For starters, none of the familiar characters really are in character, so to speak. Scotty is described as a clumsy tinker instead of the competent engineer who was in the original series. Uhura ... Gods, I can not even think about what they did to her character. His whole dialogue was painful to hear. McCoy looked like a neurotic stepfather to Kirk instead of his trusted friend. Spock ... well let's just say that Leonard Nimoy was terribly lost. He received a bad dialogue ("I do not believe you have understood the gravity of your situation, Captain." "Gravity, do you understand?") And he became almost a clown. Kirk ... oh man, do not make me start. William Shatner is a hammy actor to start with, so letting him really drive is to invite the disaster that is what we have. <br /> <br /> The plot is beyond ridicule. Giving Spock a brother is a very desperate and needlessly a novel story. But hey, come on. The search for God. Again, a weak frame basis. Do not you think? Okay, let's go with that too. So assuming the two plot elements mentioned are good, what's wrong with the script? Well, on the one hand, it recycles a lot. Enterprise, for example, is malfunctioning again. Should we assume that the Starfleet would send a seriously troubled ship to a skeletal crew in a potentially dangerous situation just because they want James Kirk to take care of the situation? If that is the case, why not put him on a better ship as a counselor? Adding to that ... the crew is totally incompetent. Scotty has the ship in pieces (and apparently it's enough to knock his head in unconsciousness while there are hostiles on board!), No one seems to notice the Klingon ship decapitating at a crucial time (despite the fact that the sensors are clearly showing the ship in the range of weapons) and the crew seems very familiar with each other. In other words, there is no sense of discipline. If this is the flagship of the Starfleet, then it's a wonder the Klingons have not overthrown the Federation. <br /> <br /> As for personal struggles with pain, it sucked. Lawrence Luckenbill is a competent actor, but even he could not save that turkey. In short, no one could. Of all the people involved, I imagine Leonard Nimoy is the most ashamed of it. I hope he is, anyway. <br /> <br /> Thank God, the original cast has not bowed in this opulent work.
