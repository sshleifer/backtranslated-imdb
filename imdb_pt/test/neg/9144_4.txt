That is the answer. The question is: what is the only reason to watch this movie? I loved her in "My Name Is Julia Ross." This is one of the best noir movies of all time. Noir or whatever, it's a very disturbing film. <br /> <br /> She's also entertaining in one of the biggest studio releases ever. That would be "The Blame Of Janet Ames." This one has a scary and promising title. You have a good cast. You have a great director. I was expecting something dark. Maybe something a little tasteless. Instead, it's an uninspired routine spy movie. It's basically total boredom. At least it was for me. Mrs. Foch is captivating. And that's about it.
