This is one of those movies called the "Hollywood Social Commentary," which wants to have both sides. And believe me, in this movie, the two paths are clichés and stereotyped. STOP-LOSS is a 21st-century John Wayne movie that deals with some anti-war sentiment, but clearly ends with the note that "if you are a MAN in today's society, you join and march to war with your friends" . In many respects, the film was a great sequel to TAXI ON THE BLACK SIDE, as it depicted an equally insane and out-of-control military man, an almost extravaganza mixed with a Texas Red Neck world of repressed homo erotic evidence of masculinity. This movie had everything in one scene after another of cliché images. And then military rebel Ryan Phillippe leaves on a "Road Trip" with his best friend's girlfriend, an artificial manipulation to visit families of dead soldiers, mutilated soldiers in military hospitals, etc. and finally address the issue of fleeing to Canada or Mexico. . But male honor and patriotism win in the end, like everything freshly washed and handsome, he sets off for the sunset on a bus with his friends back to Iraq and a world that just a few minutes before he assured everyone that never again could tolerate. COMPLETE METAL JACKET meets SANDRES OF IWO JIMA. But in the end, John Wayne rides again! And a Hollywood blockbuster manages to keep both sides of his audience in the palm of his hand, at least I'd like to think so. As far as I was concerned, just take me back to the most compelling reality of IN THE GARDEN OF ELAH.
