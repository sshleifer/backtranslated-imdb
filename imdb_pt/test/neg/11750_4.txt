The most disposable movie in film history - this is a strong candidate! Why waste so much money for such useless work? The only difference between HItchcock classic and this poor imitation is color, wide screen and Leila's Walkman! A film that should generate emotions and fear makes me completely indifferent. <br /> <br /> No, you will tell I will urge the new generations to see the original - balderdash! This "psycho 1998" is a giant spoiler. <br /> <br /> They could have done something different, for example, by putting an actor closer to Bloch. s Bates, an obese man. They settle for a nasty kings! A smallpox on it! and live Alfred Hitchcock!
