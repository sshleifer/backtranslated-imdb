This is the best example I can think of to prove the theory that when Hollywood runs out of good ideas, they make a horrible sequel and spoil the first one. Now do not get me wrong, I absolutely love the first Beastmaster; I even liked the third very good, but this movie is atrocious. I'm a big fan of fantasy / sword and witchcraft and I hated to see such a terrible sequence made to a classic as the first Beastmaster. So why do I hate this movie so much? Well, where do I start? First of all, the whole idea of ​​the movie is ridiculous. Dar and his evil older brother, Arklon (who was not mentioned anywhere in the first movie, eh?), Cross over to our world through a practical portal to the portal of time. You see, the Earth is simply on the same interdimensional plane as the world of Dar. Whereas with the first film you are led to think that the film only happens in the past but with that you are shown that it is quite another completely different world ... this is just one of the many things I hated about this sequel . It did not work with "Masters of the Universe", and certainly does not work here either! Movies like that should happen and stay on their own timeline and in their usual environment. For God's sake, what comes next? Hercules in New York ... er, uh ... bad example! Moving on ... <br /> <br /> Arklon is behind a device called neutron detonator to be used as a threat against his enemies to rule his own kingdom. So it's up to Dar, his ferrets, his eagle and his tiger (not a spray this time) to come out and save the world ... but along the way they have the help of a young, cool, and hip -man who gets stuck in this whole mess and shows Dar around Los Angeles, takes you for a ride on your BMW and helps get you out of difficult situations here and there. How convenient, right? And speaking of convenience, I found it very convenient and easy for Arklon to infiltrate a highly protected military base and escape with a stolen and highly destructive nuclear weapon ... even with half of the US Army and L.A.P.D. after him .... waaaaay for easy, even for a barbarian wizard of evil from another world. There are a lot of holes in this story that I do not know where to start; how did Arklon go to the Los Angeles Zoo at the end of the movie? He absolutely has no reason to go there; and would not that be like the last place you would attract your biggest enemy who happens to have the ability to CONTROL ANIMALS? <br /> <br /> And you do not love this kind of movie where the police are portrayed as total idiots and even with half a dozen cops shooting at a guy, they still can not reach him? The police in this movie belongs to the "Police Academy" series! They are as useful in this film as reading glasses are for the blind! Even the title of the film makes no sense: "Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time" ... they never went through a portal of "time" because the film is not set in the future of the world of Dar, it is set a world parallel along ours on the astral plane, so that they NEVER actually go through time, just a dimensional world along theirs; then there is NO TRIP in real time involved! This movie tries to sound funny and it's not because of humor, but because it's so bad ... and it's the least. The acting, the dialogue, the plot, the characters and the ending are so cheesy that it's hilarious. What else can I expect from the guy who brought us "Return of the Swampthing" (another bad sequel)? Sorely missing here is the wonderful direction of Don Coscarelli and serious feeling of the first !! Avoid this stinking piece of junk like bubonic plague and stick that first and maybe third if there is nothing better in T.V.
