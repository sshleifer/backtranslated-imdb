Downhill Racer is essentially a movie to see just the terrible skiing sequences. Although there is a story here, the character of Robert Redford, a skier trying to make the US Olympic team, is so mild and unfriendly that you wonder why you care about him. Gene Hackman, in an initial performance, adds very well, but this is a movie that can be watched with the sound off, and that would not make much difference.
