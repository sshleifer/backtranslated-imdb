I know it's hard for you Americans to find European video / DVD movies, particularly the 1980s, but please look for the original version of Vanishing - Spoorloos (1988) title - and you'll see why the Hollywood version of the Vanishing screws. <br /> <br /> I really like Sandra Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland and particularly Jeff Bridges, but this is so shy compared to the original. What are they thinking? Can you imagine Seven with a happy ending with Gwyneth Paltrow running happily into Brad Pitt's arms in the end? The main point of the original was such an international success due to the shocking ending. So why do you accept this kind of shyte remake? Really, avoid this and get the ORIGINAL.
