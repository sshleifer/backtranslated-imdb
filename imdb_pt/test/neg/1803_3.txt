The film adaptation of Heart of Darkness is disappointing, both as a film and as a representation of Joseph Conrad's classic story. <br /> <br /> There are several small differences between the book and the film, but this is expected in any transition from book to film. Kurtz dies in a different location; the manager does not accompany Marlow on his trip; Kurtz's lover spends much more time with him than in history. The real issue is the amount of images that are put into the movie, but it has no basis in the actual story. For some reason, the director finds it necessary to "spice up" some of the scenes, adding drama or actions that rarely make sense and are always unimportant to the story. Some examples that come to mind are Kurtz's "lover" beating Marlow on the head and knocking him over. Nothing happens while he's unconscious and Marlow did not even start the attack. A few hours pass and he wakes up: total waste of time. Kurtz has a pet monkey that for some random reason he kills on a whim. In addition, when Marlow leaves Kurtz's station, he makes the "noble" decision to leave behind all the invaluable ivory he has obtained, for no real reason. Another flaw is Kurtz's character. John Malkovich is a terrible choice to interpret the man who is described as tall and inspiring: a man with a dominant presence. He practically whispers all his lines that, in the hands of a more capable actor, could have been very thought-provoking. I can not remove the image of John Malkovich as a mentally disabled farmer in Of Mice and Men when I'm watching him ruin the role of Kurtz. Above all, I would rate the movie 3 out of 10 stars. It's a good movie if you've read the book and want to see it in film form, perhaps to help you visualize the scenes, but as a source of entertainment, I would never recommend it.
