The TV host who introduced the late Saturday night said he should have won the Oscar. A statement for a movie that I had never heard of ... but why should I have noticed a TV presenter, I do not know. At the event, said speaker was talking guts. <br /> <br /> It's a sad, miserable movie that leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I could not get along with the horrible Burr-Hoskins chewing gum accent. You can not see any advantage in being put into Midland anyway. Unresolved topics are plentiful ... and I usually do not care about it, but half of them does not make sense. And when Hoskins says he's going to get Felicia out of his B & B even though she never told him exactly where she was staying? Or her purchase for the funeral that clearly never happened (and where she was during those days ???) Clumbsy and thought badly about small business, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> It's an emotionless thriller. . It's full of pretentious business. It's depressing ... <br /> <br /> He did not like it. I thought it was rubbish. I do not recommend. Nuff said.
