The TV director uses the astral projection to kill people who take the form of the blue man. <br /> <br /> A horror movie not so engaging that it just stands before your eyes and makes you wonder why you're watching. I sat in the movie to the end and really can not give you more than a shallow account of what the movie was because I kept finding my attention diverted by other things. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this. I think my feelings are best summed up by the fact that I paid a dollar for the DVD as a double feature and I feel kind of ripped off.
