The film begins as we see footage of a huge drought in the 1930s in America. Then a little story is shown about a scary Elijah farmer who made a deal with Satan to get a good harvest. Elija hired young people to work in his garden, killed them and used them as scarecrows. He also fed the ground with his blood. Some time after 2 police come to visit him. One of them is shot by Elija, another kills the farmer himself ... After that, the current day is shown, and a guy named Sean is informed that he has an old farm left as an inheritance. He decides to go there with some friends to see what's going on. Little did Sean know that the next night is "Night of Return" ... <br /> <br /> As for me, this movie had a good story for a horror movie, but the low budget and bad special effects ended up ruining it. this. "Dark Harvest" is a perfect example of lazy movies. For example, we see a scarecrow (an ordinary guy wearing a funny and cheap mask) chasing a girl. When he raises his hand, we see normal human skin beneath the glove, instead of a rotten flesh. The blood is not very impressive either. There are some unpleasant murders by our "lovable" scarecrows, but everything is very cheap and unrealistic. Surprisingly, acting is a bit OK in this movie, or I'd better say it's believable. Some nudity scenes are also presented to fans (even a lesbian scene), but these scenes do not save her. <br /> <br /> Verdict: Good music, good story, solid acting. But terrible effects, cheap gore and plot holes slow this movie. Not really recommended.
