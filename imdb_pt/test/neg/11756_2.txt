This is by itself an above-average movie, but why, in the name of Bog, was it made? It is impossible to treat it as a thing in itself, because it is an almost instant remake of a 1960s Alfred Hitchcock classic. You can not watch it without the 1960 movie penetrating your consciousness. <br /> What does the word "credit" mean? How can we credit Van Sandt and his associates with anything except deciding to use different actors, slightly different sets and color? <br/> <br/> Anne Heche is attractive but does not have Janet Leigh's impassive determination to become a respectable middle class. woman. And Heche is younger than Leigh, who brought in her fruitless attempt to get married and calm down, the despair of a woman of forty. And Heche does not project anxiety the way Leigh did. The scene with the CHP officer looking in the window of his car illustrates the weakness of the paper. In the original, the officer asks, "Is there something wrong?" Leigh: "Of course not. Am I acting like something was wrong?" The officer hesitates before replying, "Well, frankly, yes." This exchange is omitted from the remake for the simple reason that Heche is not nervous enough. <br /> <br /> The worst change, no doubt, is the replacement of Anthony Perkins by Vince Vaughn. It may not be Vaughn's fault. Who could combine Perkins on paper? Perkins is uneasy, bird-faced, long-necked, hooded in an outwardly charming exterior that masks an interior vacuum. Every move of yours (eating sweet corn, with his Adam's apple apple) and every statement, the weak laughter, the barren laughter, is in the right place. It simply can not be improved. Vaughn brings to the role the presence of a short-haired, muscular guy who has just been dismissed as Corporal de Lance from the US Army. To suggest his psychosis, all he can do is to superimpose a manic laugh on what appears to be a perfectly normal Norman in manner and speech. (Unlike the original Norman, Vaughn does not even bump into the word "fallacy" because it resembles "I speak.") He might be hanging in the motel waiting to hear about his candidacy for a UCLA football scholarship. <Br /> <br /> The management deserves some comments. I do not see what that adds to the story when we see Norman masturbating while he spies Anne Heche. I have no objections to this. I wonder why it's there, just as I wonder why the rest of the movie is there. <br /> <br /> And, I suppose, to impress us with how much color adds to the visual experience, Van Sant seems to have lost some of the subtlest things about Hitchcock. Heche gets underwear of all different colors - green, pink, orange and - manga? Is that a color? If so, what is the color of hell? Nevermind. The point is that in the original, when the first-time camera peeks through the window of the Phoenix hotel, she catches Janet Leigh in bed wearing a white pantyhose and a white bra. Later, after she stole the money, we see her in her panties again - this time both the slip and the bra are black. It's a small thing, but it's Hitch himself. <br /> <br /> With that, the idea of ​​filming in color may not have been bad, except that the black-and-white footage of the original was superb. The color and the strange lighting effects in this version turn the ordinary, boring, and subliminally sinister motel into something that seems to belong to the most miserable part of Vegas. <br /> <br /> Above all, the 1960 movie was shocking in more ways than one. I remember seeing it at a drive-in in San Diego and looking horrified at the screen when it became clear that the central character was actually dead - in the middle of the movie! Nothing like it had ever been done before. This murder in the shower in both films was a big improvement over Robert Bloch's original novel, by the way, in which the author writes something like: The killer then went into the bathroom and cut her head with a knife. "I'm not making this up.Well, not entirely.Even here, Van Sant's movie gives us excess.There is more blood and more naked flesh.And where Hitchcock first closed in the blood circling down the drain of the bathtub and dissolve into Marian's open eye, then pulled the camera slowly to reveal his face, he turned the camera from a slight tilt to the correct vertical, giving the viewer a sense of not only disbelief at the murder but a disbelief Van Sant does not tilt his camera to delicate 10 or 20 degrees, as Hitchcock did.He practically revolves around his axis. <br /> <br /> It will not be called Hitchcock because it is not. of Hitchcock material ( already begun in "Psycho" I, II, III, IV and "Psycho: the initial years", and "Enter my hall: the revenge of Mme. Bates, "and" Hand Me, "would you do it: The True Story of Norman Bates.") A twist of really original things, a crenal act, if not a criminal.And not to mention the many honors in other films, especially the French, like the notorious scenes of the "ocean of boredom" between Marcel Brulee and Jeanne Gateau in the highly admired "La Mere de la Nuit." (Perhaps it is better to add that the last sentence is a terrible parody attempt by academic critics. And when the chicken guts crunch the corn, it's a "crunch-like" act. I will not go on, except to say these jokes, beaten as they are, are more fun than the movie. > Children who are too young to know about the original and who do not like black and white movies? Children who are waiting to see another common horror film? Chimpanzees?
