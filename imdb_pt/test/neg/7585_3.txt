I chose that cheepo DVD at Walmart because the cover showed one of the planes I flew during Vietnam (C-123k). I did not fly to Air America, but I knew I was a C-123 pilot, I knew very well who did it, including those who flew into my reservation unit at home. I'm not a film critic, but I wonder about the subliminal motivation of directors and writers who make movies like that. The best part of this movie has to go to the cameraman. Flying shots and stunts (though totally like cartoons) are excellent. The movie begins with the favorite fall character of Hollywood in 1969. But the fact is that Nixon did not start Air America, he did not start the lies. Johnson was responsible for Air America and Nixon inherited the lies, the war and Air America. It is neither fair nor accurate to portray Nixon as a liar on the subject of Air America. All presidents have inherited the lies of their predecessors. No one smart enough to pilot a C-123 was dumb enough not to know what they were getting together. This makes the Downey character unbelievable. A C-123 was a rough plane. He could easily fly in an engine or two auxiliary jet engines. The three stooges shooting a duck with a shot are more likely. The pilots flying with Air America were civilian CIA officers, not reckless soldiers of fortune. They had a good reason to behave and believe in a future if they survived extremely dangerous work. They received a double time for a retirement pension. They were not forced to sell drugs or weapons to get a good pension. The Dope was cool and a way of life in SEA, as it is still today in Afghanistan. If individual pilots tried to make money on the side, it was not CIA policy. The CIA was fighting a war against communism, not drugs. The writer based his story on "war stories". Pilots love someone who's going to buy beer and listen. The writer and director who had an ax to grind on the Viet Nam and Nixon. Watch the movie and remember how it starts - blame Nixon for what existed for years. Remember, he did not become president until January 20, 1969. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the jungle landing. Air America pilots put airplanes in places that aircraft designers never imagined possible. There were many funny stories that could have been shown. Instead, the director chose to use the oversized rubber scene to show how the CIA was dumb. This scene shows that the director and writer fell in love with some speakers and the joke is theirs. <br /> <br /> MDS Fort Valley Virginia.
