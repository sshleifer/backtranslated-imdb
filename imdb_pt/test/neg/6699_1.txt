As a member of the American service, please believe me when I say that this film does not accurately portray the emotional state of our soldiers / sailors / airmen / marines returning from deployments. <br /> <br /> That said ... <br /> <br /> This movie is a great steaming pile of clich√©. The acting as bad (except for the little girl) of the character's past is weak and laughable, and the plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I made an account with IMDb just to warn anyone half a brain away from it. <br /> <br /> Canadian writer / director Francesco Lucente should have been really, really, really embarrassed about this movie. If he does not agree with US foreign policy, he should write a letter to the US government, not punish the whole English-speaking world with a monumentally exaggerated film.
