I do not bother with despicable hosts, nor do I bother with the cynical and arrogant stance that the creators of this crap take. <br /> <br /> What bothers me is that the vast majority of episodes are fake. I would not even be surprised if ALL episodes were staged. So this is not a reality show, but something far worse than Oprah's: junk television with zero comma zero appeal. Like the daily soap opera, but with more action and struggle and less plot. <br /> <br /> The premise would have been great - if it had been executed without cheating the viewer. If only this idea were free of all the legal complications / pitfalls that would surely happen due to what would happen to real people and what would eventually be exhibited. So the only way to create this "reality show" was to pick up some desperate actors and get them to improvise (and that deplorable and unconvincing improvisation is most of the time!). Should not that be obvious to anyone who finished elementary school? Most of the comments I read here do not even mention that none of this is false, much less than all of this could be. Thought of desire or just ingenuity without limits? <br /> <br /> The actors hired in this pathetic show are the type of unemployed actors below the barrel who are miserably waiting at the tables, eagerly waiting for a talk show call (or that crap), which is when they finally have the chance to win several hundred dollars. I even recognized an actress (in the role of "cheater") that I saw years before in "The Jerry Springer Show". And I've only seen 6-7 episodes of "Cheaters". How many more of these loser actors are there that appeared in Springer and "Cheaters" I do not even know? <br /> <br /> However, comparing "Cheaters" with Springer is not fair to the latter. The Springer show is not all fake; a large part of the episodes is not disputed - so it's often a lot of fun. There's no value to be found in "Cheaters" unless you're a struggling actor and want to get tips on NOT taking action on camera. <br /> <br /> Producers use several (very cheap). , transparent) tricks to create the illusion of reality, to give his filming that elusive documentary sensation. But everything is in the vein. In the end, the most intelligent spectator in search of train wreckage is absolutely squat. "Professional wrestling" has more credibility than that.
