A serious effort that succeeds in adapting the classic Odyssey story to a part of the 1930s nostalgia period. Adventurers this time escaped the damned, wandering through the Depression that plagued the South, confusing their path with troubles. <br /> <br /> The greatest strength of the film is the wonderful soundtrack to music, effectively evoking not just the time when it was established. in, but the spiritual references that run rampant in the film. In addition to its value to the tone of the movie, the music is simply fun to hear. <br /> <br /> What harms the film is that the characters really are not so nice. In a comedy, you need this element to have fun with them in their misadventures. Instead, we have a bunch of no selfish, arrogant, soulless, petty people who really do not have any good points. They are not imposing enough to make you hate them too, so it's hard to relate to them. They are offered as clowns, but as people who put on clown makeup and march in parades, they are not funny. Like the story that inspired it, the film takes these guys "odyssey", encountering a variety of symbolic characters (some even mystical). Everyone is stamped with offensive stereotypes, the operative word is "stupid." People are ridiculed right and left, and consequently nobody gets particularly interesting or attractive. The movie does not like its own characters, nor does it let you like them. <br /> <br /> Riverside baptisms, beautiful mermaids, stolen cars, fights, radio preachers, people being whipped with sticks; all are thrown at you in a disjointed manner. Some evoke some laughter, others confuse or bore you. I laughed when a nerdy guy hit the snot of a particularly nasty main character. But there were many more unnecessarily gratuitous scenes; an example: a 30-year-old Dillinger guy throws cows with a machine gun. Comedy? Symbolism? Not; only meaningless violence, which diminishes the intellectual nature of the original material that this story brings. <br /> <br /> Other adaptations of the Odyssey are much better. Unless you're a fan of George Clooney, rent something else. But buy the CD of the soundtrack; the music is great.
