I just watched this movie and I think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was so boring that I caught myself zooming in at speed X2 and finished in less than 30 minutes. I was not only disappointed, but angry that I wasted my money to rent it. He's among the top five movies I've seen, and I've seen thousands of movies! The plot was very confusing. If I had not read the cover of the DVD for the first time, before renting it, I would have been totally lost throughout this film. I would not have thought that Tim Robbins, having made such good movies as "Shawshank Redemption", would have agreed to appear in this film.
