(The beginning may be a spoiler ...) "The Eye 2" is the continuation of "The Eye". It is about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident has happened to her. <br /> <br /> The sound effects scared me, though momentarily, but that's the only scary thing. Some of the prequel scenes are comparatively similar and repeated, so the chilling effects certainly have cooled. <br /> <br /> "The Eye" has a scary and indelible impression, while "The Eye 2" is a horror film and a forgettable drama. Omit watching it. Watching "The Eye" is good enough.
