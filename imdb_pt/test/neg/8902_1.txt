Endless repetition on the evil of the World Bank, IMF, Globalization and the Americans are guilty of all the problems of Africa - and the film is long, about two hours, but seems longer. The French really occupied Mali, the country in which the film takes place, for centuries, but they are only peripheral bandits. <br /> <br /> You do not learn enough about any of the characters to really care what is happening. they are completely marginal to preaching, which continues and continues. There is no plot, character development, humor (except for a few nudges in Bush and Wolfowitz, but this is almost a scam, it's so easy) and the production figures are mediocre. There is no redemption there. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that a movie can spend two hours preaching on such a big topic and transmit absolutely no real information. The Irish ballad "I was dying, and then came the hunger" has more content. <br /> <br /> The movie is boring, the subtitles are hard to read, there is no real content on the subject of the movie. film, and the propaganda is relentless. <br /> <br /> Skip this one.
