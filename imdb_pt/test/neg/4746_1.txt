If I had read Alex Sander's review (sic) here, instead of looking at the more than 6 rating of a select choice of ignorant viewing audience, I would not have seen such desecration. Alien was a fantastic horror / science fiction, dramatic and well done. The Predator was a great mess of science fiction and action. I really only have myself to blame as I've seen 'Alien versus Predator'. It also has an average rating of more than 6 stars from moviegoers who frequent this site. <br /> <br /> STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVE SOME FEAR OF THIS GROUP OF SUSPENDED RIDDEN THAT IS BEING RUINED TO YOU. <BR> From the outset, this movie was ridiculous. No explanation was offered to the Predator ship invaded / not invaded by Aliens. Okay, so maybe they were throwing aliens back to Earth to hunt them down and something went wrong, but how did that result in an Alien / Predator hybrid and why did not the rest of the crew notice earlier despite their great technology? The beginning was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film, because we had an idea of ​​who was who or what, and maybe why. From there it gets really ridiculous. I always let my disbelief strictly suspended above the screen door before entering and collecting it upon exiting. I could not here. <br /> <br /> Father and son are hunting in the forest. The crash of the damaged ship falls to (from the given view) I would calculate at least 10 odd miles away through the thick forest. The man and the boy go there alone, find the ship and hug the face. Even at this point, you feel very little to them, mainly because the hugs in the face are almost comical instead of frightening in their movements and actions, and the father looks like a muppet so reckless irresponsible and idiot. A thriller-like scenario is introduced with an ex-convict who returns to the city near the crash site to be found by his half-hearted and bored police friend of the bus. When I say introduced I mean a weak attempt with bad actors and no feeling is thrown away. A slasher / horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who is beaten by the protective, crazy and nasty Jock type (American sportsman not a Scottish man). Oh the cute / not handsome boy is the ex-gol's brother by the way. Yes, they are clever, these brothers directors, whose name I will research, to avoid any other shit they throw again. Then a modern reversal of roles, oh so boring attempt on the PC, introduction of creature-type character Ripley comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and son. <br /> <br /> Guess what happens next? I'm not going to say much more about the real (smiles sadly to himself about the disappearance of the narrative in the vast majority of recent films) plot just in case you have gotten so far and not be the brightest star in the universe ravaged by aliens. <br /> <br /> The Predator is stupid for the reasons exposed by the previous author whose post I read too late. The aliens are boring. The Predator-Alien is ridiculous. The action is sometimes absurd exploitative, gratuitous and disgusting. The hospital scene with pregnant mothers?!?! Oh, I was shocked. Shocked at how low some people will go to get what? A scare? Some shock? To excite the wicked? What? If you really wanted to shock, excite and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting parents or have no soul, why not just have the Alien / Predator fucking women and teenage girls instead of killing them? The characters have no depth and no plot. It's filmed and rhythmically wrong. It is acted by disinterested people, not that I can blame them. In addition, it stains two interesting and good sets of sci-fi characters. This movie was trash and if you get pleasure from it I really have to worry about you. If you have not yet seen, then please make your own decision. <br /> <br /> PS Did I mention how trained soldiers are killed in about 20 seconds while amateur civilians survive everywhere?
