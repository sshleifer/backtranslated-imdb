This was the dumbest movie I've ever seen in my life. It is a complete waste of money and time. I went to see this movie with my friends and when the movie ended, not a single person in the movie - not that there were many people there to see this terrible movie - said "wow, what a good movie". Someone really left! It was absolutely terrible! It was disgusting and I hated every minute of it. My friend was putting her head on my shoulder to the end, because after the scene with Rick on the peeing ceiling, she was already fed up. It was not funny at all. Believe me, I went with 11 other girls and none of my friends liked it. It was ridiculous! I've seen many movies, but this was absolutely the worst! I mean, one scene in the movie is with an old man hanging out with a dead person in a coffin. I just can not invent these things.
