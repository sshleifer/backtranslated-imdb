I had to watch this movie for a movie class, I suffered all the time. I'm not Asian, but I was still very offended by this movie. The basis of the film is racism, minorities in general (Rex Harrison is not even Asian!) Are portrayed in a limited way. The film ban in Thailand illustrates the degree of inaccuracy and subjective description of Asians. In addition, there has been critical attention given to Anna's Biography. Many critics argue that Anna has added many fictional events to her story to project herself in a good way. Some critics of the film and biography have stated that Anna invented the whole story. A horrible but good movie for the discussion of BioPics as a form of meta-narrative fiction, rather than a non-fiction work.
