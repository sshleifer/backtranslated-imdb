The Comebacks is a parody of inspiring sports films, and let me just tell you it's not a good movie. Tom Brady (the director) probably found it hilarious to refer to sports movies (from the Gridiron Gang, Invincible and even Miracle! To The Longest Yard and Dodgeball - yeah, Dodgeball!) And playing some sex jokes would be the funniest thing ever. Airplane! Well, he was wrong. They did such a sloppy job that you thought it was written in a week. I discovered that if a director loves the genre, the movie will be good. Obviously, Brady does not love the genre he's faking. This movie is a rancid waste that is not worth seeing, so do not see it!
