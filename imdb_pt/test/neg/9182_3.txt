This cartoon is not right, lol I totally disagree with many things he portrayed but ended up on a positive note, but as for me and me we will not see this in our house, mainly because we fight against stereotypes every day and this cartoon only confirms what most white people feel that black people act like. <br /> <br /> The comment from one of the black girls made in the cartoon was that her boyfriend was so conscious (he was white) that really offended me. Something that we, as blacks, take lightly conscious of is a state of being that blacks reach when they realize their true ability.
