I can not really think of a good point in this movie. The story is absolutely terrible. The acting is as gross as a carrot, and the script is so bad it makes you want to kill yourself. Okay well if you love (and you have to love it to understand) snowboarding you can enjoy it microscopically better as it has great mountains and some cool moves but additionally it is terrible. He has some absolutely stupid ideas and is racist, with black and white people insulting the other races. The only time you'll laugh is when you're laughing at stupidity or feeling embarrassed about the movie. I've seen a lot of movies and I have to say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. If you have this movie, I suggest you take it back to where you bought it and get money back.
