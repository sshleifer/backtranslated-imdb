This movie was a mess. There was nothing really going on. The only character who had any appeal was Bobbie Phillips Maya and she was not even worth it. <br /> <br /> The plot is standard, double crosses the double cruiser. With a couple of double crosses to make some sense. Sometimes it means "you're guessing", in this case, "lets you wait". In the end, I just wanted everyone to be arrested or shot.
