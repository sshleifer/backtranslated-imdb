Maniratnam, who in India is often compared to major world filmmakers and considered a genius in filmmaking, proved once again that he can only make the pictures look visually good without offering much food for thought. pleasure that can be derived from cinema as a very old form of art. <br /> <br /> While I would not like to claim and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful films made around the world, yet any thoughtful and educated movie goer can identify that their films contain no novel and naive, contain no lingering effects and contain, VERY, ridiculous ending and MUCH melodrama, seen profusely in Indian films. <br /> <br /> Maniratnam successfully confirmed my disgust for his films once again. <br /> <br /> Excuse me those on this forum were saying otherwise. My suggestion to you: WATCH SOME BEAUTIFUL CINEMAS MADE AROUND THE GLOBE.
