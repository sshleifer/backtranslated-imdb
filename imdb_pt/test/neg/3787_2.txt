Very terrible, but not totally unacceptable. Another comment mentioned "predictable" - and this is almost a euphemism. You can make a game without guessing what the next line will be. Every character is stereotyped or archetypical. The good guy in a bad situation, the fight between the elder and younger priest for acceptance and discipline, the repressed, sexually / emotionally deprived woman returning to the small town after failing in the big city, involved with the weak thought of youth, the indecipherable villains, two "lost boys" in search of a sense of family - they are all here, and none of them with the remotest version of something new. From the first few minutes you can find out exactly what will happen at the end of the movie. The story is not totally idiotic, but the acting direction (even of a cast with some talent) is all thrown together without skill. As for the plot, we've all seen this before in a movie called "Sister Act." This is also one of those films in which the lack of attention to small details appears in an even more glaring light. (As an example, the nurse and our hero head out into the city, but they park several blocks away from their destinations (post offices and hardware stores) - but both walk through empty parking lots for no apparent reason or the passage from morning to night during a scene that should apparently take place in no more than half an hour, the movie is filled with this sort of thing and then tags in an improbable outcome.
