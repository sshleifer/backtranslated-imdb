Two Los Angeles cops tracked down a serial killer nicknamed "the family man" who decimated entire families and when one of the wives of a policeman leads the six deep, the questions are raised and it turns out that a serial killer is not responsible, but yes mafiosos The idea of ​​Seagal in a serial killer movie is an interesting concept, in fact, Seagal may be a good serial killer, but making him a cop that has a ridiculous propensity for prayer beads and sharp credit cards is more stupid than ridiculously ridiculous. Also a running joke involves Wayon's pleasure to eat deer dick powder and well this raunchy stuff is totally out of place. Not to mention the beginning of a school being taken hostage due to the breakup of a boy with his girlfriend. After Seagal neutralizes, the girlfriend tells the young man that she loves him. Now there's a lesson to be learned from all of this, if you want your girlfriend back, taking the hostage from school can bring you back to your good side. I would even think the flowers or the old phone call could work, but again, I'm old-fashioned. Besides who am I to put a damper on someone's brilliant plan of reconciliation. <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (Bad)
