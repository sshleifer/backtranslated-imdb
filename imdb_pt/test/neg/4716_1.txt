I swear I've never seen a movie as bad as Half Caste. Not just because it does not make sense, it's a huge piece of self-confidence and self-confidence that makes me vomit. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Apocada (in Spanish, the pronunciation of Apocado is similar to "apocado", which means "outside" of life and happiness ") makes here a film of the army of a man thinking that he is Sam Raimi, or the boys who directed the Blair Witch project, this is Blair Kittie's project with an expensive low budget. <br /> <br /> The story, a couple of American filmmakers who go to Africa to make a documentary Half Caste does not make the slightest sense.The way you shoot, insert high-speed shots with slow-motion shots, only revolt your stomach more than stupid lines (what the hell is this dialogue about bestiality?) Or weak performances By the way, I do not believe this cast (or caste?) Is American, they all look European to me. To end this, just say that the filmmakers made a smart move about selling the They put a fake award achievement (like most original films) and a cool cover (in Spain the cover had the image of Half caste in negative), so I feel unhappy now, because I can not demand my 14 Euros back.
