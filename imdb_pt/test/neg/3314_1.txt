It's cool that these three young directors have produced films with good production values ​​and decent acting. There's a good job here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they suffer from what afflicts much of modern gay cinema; recycled plots, very familiar devices (I've seen the pool often set up in gay movies) and banal scripts. The most notorious of all is "Dorothy," whose absurd premise is that a cute little boy will have trouble fucking in New York due to a shortage of identifiable gay boys in his neighborhood. <br /> <br /> In terms of cinema, Bermuda play as special little afterschool specials. Not much imagination in his writing or execution; Basically, they follow a convention of "shoot and shoot / reaction shot / main shot" which becomes painfully annoying after five or more minutes. There is hope for queer cinema in the works of Todd Haynes, Sadie Benning and the late Marlon Riggs ... but not here. These films are incredibly middlebrow, singularly whitebread and their values ​​basically give way to a bourgeois gay sensibility. That's probably why they play so well at gay film festivals.
