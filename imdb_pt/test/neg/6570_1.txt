When I first saw it 9 years ago, when I was 9, I thought it stinks. I'm 18 now and still think it stinks. I mean, no special effects or anything, it was annoying and somewhat anti-climatic. My cousin once attended and George Takai (Sulu) kept talking about how much better it should be, but they kept cutting the budget. It would have been a great episode, but it was a terrible movie.
