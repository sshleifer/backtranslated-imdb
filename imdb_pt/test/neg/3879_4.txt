Bhagam Bhag was a waste of money and time great time! I guess Govinda made this movie? Govinda ... dude ... your big fan, you have to make right decisions right now in choosing the movie? I wonder if he had any part in that movie. Govinda's role could be given to Johnny Lever. Akshay Kumar steals the show here! Akshay ... dud u rock! You created space in everyone's heart all over the world! Lara Dutta, Tansuhree .... u deserve better. Paresh Rawal is good at witty! Overall, there were few scenes in which I laughed ... Otherwise, I was just wondering "what the hell Priyadarshan made such a stupid movie?" Anyway, let's wait and watch the next movie.
