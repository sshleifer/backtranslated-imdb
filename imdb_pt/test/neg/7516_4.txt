Do you know they want to dig the real moon? And in Geneve is there a debated project that could lead to making the time machine possible? All I can say about this movie is based on facts about the future (in the time of the moon). film) scientific projects, but real. I hope the moon does not happen like it does in the movie. Now about the movie itself, I saw the original movie as well, and also read the book. The book I did not like but the movie yes. I totally agree with a previous review that this movie was depressing, unlike the 60's. This was very good with the force, this was just a paralyzed future of what is good movie .
