As a fan of the old series, I must say that this is, at best, a parody of a much-loved series. First, the old series would at least try to follow some military structure. I know this P.C. world is not the thing to do, but hey do not turn it into care bears. In the old series, Beachead was a tough-talking soldier, now he's a teenage mutant turtle. Another thing is the flying tank, ok it flies off the base of the snake and rebels the helicopter and both are ok ???? Let's face it if the next one is not better than this could mean the end of G.I.joe.
