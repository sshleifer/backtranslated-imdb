The Toxic Avenger, Part II begins with the surprising revelation that after the Toxic Aveneger (John Altamura who was apparently dismissed during production and replaced by Ron Fazio) freed his hometown of Tromaville from evil, making it a good place to to live. This meant that Toxie no longer had a superhero and now suffers from depression and a sense of utter worthlessness (as directors Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz should feel after producing this), Toxie now works as a concierge in downtown Tromaville. for the blind '. It did not take long for problems to arise, a chemical company called Apocalypse Inc. plans to take on Tromaville for some insignificant reason, but for that they need to get rid of Toxie. After the evil plan's first plan (Rick Collins) fails, he bribes Toxie's psychiatrist (Erika Schickel) to tell him to go to Japan and see his father. After leaving his girlfriend Claire (Phoebe Legere), his mother (Jessica Dublin) and his house behind Toxie head for Tokyo, Japan. Once there Toxie begins to find his father and a woman named Masami (Mayako Katsuragi) in your search. Meanwhile, back to Tromaville Apocalypse Inc., for the killing and without Toxie, citizens are powerless to defend themselves. Toxie finally finds Big Mac Bunko (Rikiya Yasuoka) whom he was led to believe is his father, however Big Mac is part of Apocalypse Inc. plans to destroy Toxie once and for all ... <br /> < > Produced and directed by Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz, this successor to The Toxic Avenger (1985) basically proves that the first film was a complete accident, a lucky accident to combine the right blend of bad taste, bad. -It's good movie-making, The Toxic Avenger, Part II is a bunch of crap in comparison. The script by Kaufman, Phil Rivio and Gay Partington Terry, with many credits of additional material, does not contain a single funny moment throughout its duration (uncut). The visual gags are terrible, Toxie walking through Tokyo with a wig and glasses to blend, for example, or a scene in which he heats a bath with a bad guy and while cooking Toxie puts a lot of vegetables and spaghetti, a scene in who stuffs electric wires into a woman's nose, stuffs an antenna into her head, and a microphone in her mouth to which a Japanese radio announcer speaks, a bit where a Japanese villain has his nose burned in the shape of a fish, a little where Toxie grabs a swordfish head and uses it as a weapon, or embarrassingly stupid and idiotic facial expressions, a literary guy has a fish as a head and becomes literary in sushi, the terrible musical comedy and sound effects and the whole film is a pale imitation of what made the original slightly fun and memorable. Tasteful jokes are not there this time & the silly childish juvenile humor of the first is also missing, it just feels like a real step back from the original and we can not forget that this is Troma here, so that is definitely a bad thing. There are some bloody fights and some serious gore and violence, at least in the supposedly uncut version of 102 minutes I've seen, crushed heads with bodies gushing blood, crushed faces, intestines, roses nudged in someone's eyes & thorns wrapped around from his throat he ripped out his ears, severed arms and a very graphic and bloody scene of a man being cut into pieces. Unfortunately the special effects of Pericles Lewnes are not particularly convincing and come mostly in the first twenty minutes or so. The acting is of embarrassing proportions, as I have already mentioned. Wise action there is an ultra cheap looking car chase in the end & some uninteresting, dull fights using card game ninja stars at one point. Horror wise there is nothing to separate some bloody pieces. Comedy wise this is very bland. In fact, The Toxic Avenger, Part II is a drug at all levels, and in addition everything is atrociously done, most of the cast seems to be a person taken from the nearest corner, continuity is nonexistent, cinematography is the basic point and shoot and special effects are anything but. One or two separate bloody scenes this is total crap simple and simple, do yourself a favor and look at the original again.
