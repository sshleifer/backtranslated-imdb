*** SPOILERS *** This movie - called EATEN ALIVE here in the UK is possibly the worst movie ever made and it's brilliant just for that. A sexy rich girl joins a robust action man to seek out his sister in the jungle of New Guinea. What follows is an indeclinable mix of cannibalism, insane cults, and religious maniacs that need to be seen to be believed. The scenes of cannibalism are quite horrible, but they are so poorly staged and act that they are quite amusing. The cast is lousy except for Janet Agren as the female lead who is excellent. Stay tuned for the scene where she is naked and covered with gold paint! My rating - 1 out of 10.
