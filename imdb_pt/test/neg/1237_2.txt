I must have lost a part of this movie ... I found myself wondering who this is? And when did that happen? It seemed to jump, but I kept watching for fear that something was missing and everything would be explained to me. I loved Lonesome Dove, but this movie did not make sense to me. I loved all the actors, but what about the rest of the movie? That made me go "what"? at the beginning of each part ... As for the scenario - I thought I was fine ... It made me feel like I was flipping through a book and leaving the pages out ... The ending made me a bit confused too, though I imagine The boy was waiting for his father and was made to leave you wondering if your father would finally go back to his son and be a father since his mother was gone ... I would like to read the book just to see what I lost in the movie ... I do not expect this to win any awards.
