The recent DVD release of Good Humor Man labels the film as a comedy. It's not a comedy, it's a tedious indie movie about a bunch of losers. Supposedly defined in the 1970s, there is little attention to the details of the period, with excessively quiet color correction taking its place. The monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the film's repeatability (perhaps that's the point, but does not increase the pleasure of the viewing experience). Overall, the group of losers just likes to stay in one place, the bleachers. It seems like the packaging of the movie as a comedy is to fool people to rent or buy this movie, which is a complete waste of time.
