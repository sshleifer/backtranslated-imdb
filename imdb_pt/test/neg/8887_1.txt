The chupacabra, according to this mockumentary, is a mysterious creature that has been killing and eating Hispanic goats in Latin America and Mexico for years. One crossed the border to the south of Texas, and a cute and intrepid cryptozoologist (no, I did not invent that word) goes to an isolated ranch to find one. Your uncle was killed by the creature, and some monster video footage exists. She catches a tough black guy with a gun and two cameras (for easy coverage to edit), and they will make a donation to chupacabras. Ten minutes into the movie, they find him. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film has the team of documentary filmmakers being attacked by the bloodthirsty monster, and dialogue flushed. At one point, the team finds a couple of hot witches who take them to the chupacabra's nest ... for $ 100. If only the FBI knew about as Tex-Mex witches could be cheap as informants. All decades of mythical animal accounts could be cleared up with a blank check. <br /> <br /> In the end, after the bloody character deaths you do not give a goat leg around, a chupacabra is captured, killed and autopsied. The only point of the autopsy scene is to highlight the efforts of the makeup department in such a cheap movie. <br /> <br /> The film is videotaped, as is the "BWP". the cameraman <br /> the characters never recharge their tapes or recharge their cameras <br /> <br /> batteries. The lead actress here is awful. The beauty of the average "BWP" was the use of improvisation during production. <br /> <br /> Here, all the lines are written, and delivered as evil <br /> We rehearsed the Christmas contest. <br /> <br /> The film also has racism. The only African-American here is a noisy mouth nut. At one point, when the crew breaks into an abandoned house, they encounter a trio of illegal immigrants who comically ask if they are from the INS. Chortle, chmodle. <br /> <br /> The monster itself is a rubber suit guy, and nothing more. For such an awkward and awkward animal, he is able to sneak into the cast very quietly, if they themselves have locked themselves idiotically. <br /> <br /> in a giant cage like bait, or it looks like he can not get his only vehicle. <br /> <br /> Blood is horrible, but when surrounded by that kind of stupidity, it loses all its effectiveness. I do not know if this was filmed before or after "BWP," but I can honestly say that this is the worst movie ever made in South Texas about a mythical beast. . Pray <br /> <br /> There are no sequels, I'm going to start a letter writing campaign to <br /> <br /> Troma. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, armed violence, and strong profanity. <br /> <br />
