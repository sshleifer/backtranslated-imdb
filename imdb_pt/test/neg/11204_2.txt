Gordon Scott did some good Tarzan movies, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> As I watched, shuddering with the bad sounds, obviously interiors and sounds of "cloning" of wood as they supposedly traversed dirt tracks, and shrinking into bad dialogue and acting worse between the cast I kept thinking, "Sheesh! This is the level of the TV show!" So I discovered that they were, in fact, three pilot episodes of TV shows intertwined into one. <br /> <br /> It's good to see Scott leave home (alone), far from the scenes, in some scenes; and the fights have some pretty cool moves ... but oh, ow and there like in the dialogue. And did I mention the performance? Heck, Cheetah (or "Cheta" in this version) was a better actor than most humans. <br /> <br /> And that's not saying much. <br /> <br /> It's kind of a point to see a young Sherman (ie, Scatman) Carothers acting like a native. But probably not worth the total investment time.
