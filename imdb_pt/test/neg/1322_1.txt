What a horrible movie. This is undoubtedly a low class B movie. The German elite StormTroopers assaults the Russian bunkers en masse as a former World War I battle. The acting is mediocre, the plot thin and filiform. Sometimes it's hard to follow where you're going. Action sequences are very useless (if any), except that they use authentic World War II equipment / vehicles. This is not the same as "Saving Pvt. Ryan" or "Platoon". Lots of pointless character development attempts that get you nowhere. Old good official / bad official theme that is highly predictable. Even the action sequences look like a 12-year-old boy. I could have driven better. Too bad this is the same guy who did "Das Boot (The Boat)" because that was a good movie. He must have celebrated long after this success because he certainly lost touch when it came to that movie. I bought it on DVD, better rent it instead.
