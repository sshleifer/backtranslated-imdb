This is truly one of the most terrible movies of all time. It is dull, heavy, misrepresented, and pretentious crawling teeth. <br /> <br /> I watched for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to unfold, before realizing there was none. Shooting on a shoe string budget was particularly painful. This has to be the worst day for night shots since the Nine Plan of the Outer Space. <br /> <br /> The only feature that can hardly be recovered is the ridiculous 'demons' wandering the field with a plastic cat basket. How scary is that? And I liked the moggys used as extras, I suppose they are less cheap. Although it seemed a bit obvious that they had been drawn to the camera by careful placement of some tuna. <br /> <br /> This movie is so terrible that it should have a public health warning. There was a queue at my local video store when I got it back from people demanding their money back. I'm not kidding with you!
