This is certainly not a comedy - I do not know what was marketed that way. Like a serious movie, it lacks any kind of substance. Unless you are just out of Sunday school or need your dose of Noah, you will be bored to tears. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast drew the little that remained of the film. Lauren Graham plays an empty housewife with no real depth. Your kids do not add anything to the movie. They seem to be around just to think of their absent father at first. Jonah Hill plays a scary internet junkie who does not look funny. <br /> <br /> I found the original to be a decent movie. Disappointed that this was not really anywhere.
