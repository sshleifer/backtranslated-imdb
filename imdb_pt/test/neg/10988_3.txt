I will praise it in just one respect .. it was groundbreaking. Innovative does not mean it's a good movie, it means it can give you an idea of ​​what you can do and implement in your own movies. <br /> <br /> The simple plot is ... well ... simple. I got to the point where I did not care if they destroyed the building or not. If I had to hear that annoying laugh from that girl again, I swear I'd throw the DVD out the window. And there is also the protagonist. They try to make you nice, but he's a damn pervert! Smelling the girls' bra, peering at her when she is naked, putting her bra over his eyes when he sleeps, putting his bra on a sexual doll (she takes off her panties while she is sleeping and puts it on his doll Umm) <br /> <br /> What irritates me even more is that low quality dyeing. In the photo gallery of the DVD, you can see what the movie looked like before putting it in a colorful shade (digitally too). The film got much better without the effect ... so they sacrificed being a good movie just to be artistic ... bah. I could understand using tricks like this if the quality of the movie sucked ... <br /> <br /> I think most people who liked this movie liked it because the girl was naked for a good 5 to 10 minutes. This does not compare to Delicatessen (as many are trying to do). Delicatessen has characters you can enter and how ... these people here just grunt and giggle. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would also like to say that this was also a German impressionist film. ancient silences. One of the problems with most foreign films, especially the artistic ones, is that the focus is to make an artistic composition and forget the "space" of the scene. This causes the public to not really understand what is happening because they do not perceive the space of the environment. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's crap. The short on the DVD, Surprise, was much better.
