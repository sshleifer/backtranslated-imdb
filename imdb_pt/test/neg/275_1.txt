What a waste of time and money ridiculous !!!! This movie was the biggest loser of the year. All the hype was a warning. I'm disappointed by Julia Roberts, by far she's the most talented cast member. I think his ability to really act took the film. Comrade buddy boys club was a little fake, and to add insult to injury, why bother to climb Catherine Zeta Jones? It only has the ability to spoil a movie. She does not have the ability to take on screen chemistry with anyone, not to mention she does not have the ability to act. She has no chemistry with the other characters: sort of reminiscent of "America's Sweetheart's". She made the terminal "The Terminal". This movie is not going anywhere, what a shame, please, please do not tell me that "13" is on the way!
