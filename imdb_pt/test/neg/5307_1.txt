Sometimes when I hear a cast of A-list will be grouped for 2 hours in a movie, I hope, and I pray for it to be good, not because of my 10 dollars or 2 hours, but for the sake of these actors careers. In the case of "Be Cool", everything was wasted. At the beginning of the film, John Travolta (aka Chili Palmer) and a music executive played by James Woods are driving in a car talking about movie sequels, and as most are not good. If you look past the fact that this scene was filmed in the same way Quentin Tarrantino filmed his car scene in "Pulp Fiction", and listen to the dialogue you can not help but reflect if this is 1) a notice to the public that this the film is going to suck, or 2) an attempt to make the audience laugh at the mood of two people talking about sequences in a sequence. Oh The irony! (In case you're wondering, choice 1 is correct.) The cool and smooth Chili Palmer from the first and good movie "Get Shorty" is revived to play a professional music mafioso. He steals a young sexy singer (Christina Milian) from his ghetto, who evicts the Jewish manager (Vince Vaughn), and turns her into a singing sensation. Of course, a movie about a former mobster can never be complete without new gangsters wreaking havoc. This time, the chosen mafiosi are Russians, played by American actors who can not perform in Russian if my whole family hits them on the head with their Russian bare hands. As a Russian I was not too offended by the way this movie portrayed the Russians, but instead as a writer I was more offended by the horrible dialogue. This film tried a lot to make the audience laugh. This has potentially transformed good lines into redundancy. The Russian, black, and gay jokes were the same, just rephrased a few hundred times. After calling the character of The Rock af ***** (he plays a gay bodyguard for Vince Vaughn), and character of Cedric the Entertainerer a whore (he played a black rapper with an entourage who threaten who does not play their bands with guns) I wanted to leave the movies, because it was painful to sit down. If this was "Get Shorty," none of this would need to be in the movie to create drama, or a really bad laugh. <br /> <br /> What lacked in this movie that did not happen in "Get Shorty" was Chili's spicy attitude. He's a completely different person in this sequel. On the one hand, old Chili would have more dialogue. John Travolta has no more than 20 lines of talk in "Be Cool" because he is out staged by the repetitive lines, and the one hundred and two appearances of the most random celebrities. I'm not going to spoil the shock, revealing all the appearances to those who really plan to see this movie (PLEASE NO!), But I'll say it will surprise me forever that these people agree to be in such a film of such inanity. <br /> <br /> What was even more stupid was the very lame dance sequence with Travolta and Uma Thurman (she plays the widower of James Woods, who, LUCKILY, is killed in the first 10 minutes of the movie). Tarrantino never made Pulp Fiction for an idiot as the director of "Be Cool". This dance number was boring, long and simply throbbing. The Black Eyed Peas playing in the club with a total of 10 people did not make the scene memorable. <br /> <br /> There were so many holes that I left the theater wondering WHY?! Everything about this movie was a big question mark. I just did not get the point for anything. I could not even explain why the Russians were after everyone, or why this movie was made, because I'm stumped. All I got out of this movie was that everyone in Los Angeles has a helper, and the only way this movie gets funded was probably through all ads from Diet Coke, Yahoo !, Honda Insight Hybrid, T-Mobile, Trimspa spokeswoman herself is in the movie) and the Guild of Bad Writers. Plot holes, stupid dialogues, many random appearances, horrible acting (even by the pros) and a not-so-fun-to-imitate "Pulp Fiction" make this movie the worst movie of 2005, and it's only the third month of the year.
