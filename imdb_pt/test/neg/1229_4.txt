This is a poor caricature of "Lonesome Dove" - ​​and Larry McMurtry. <br /> <br /> I love your books, with "Lonesome Dove" in the top three. I admired the way you see yourself, through your characters, with such uncompromising honesty, balanced by never taking it too seriously. I am therefore spoiled. <br /> <br /> Why did you come to this? <br /> <br /> "Comanche Moon" does not live up to its standards. I see you're credited with screen writing, but this is so different from you, I'd rather think it's written by someone else. <br /> <br /> The dialogue makes me claustrophobic, wishing someone could come out with a naturally stated phrase. The part about "genius" was distressing. McCrae was unrecognizable - mostly because of the empty words coming out of his mouth. <br /> <br /> Well, I miss Call too. <br /> <br /> The most important factors missing are Gus and Call and the men are: their practical courage; the underlying vein composed of ethics and honesty; his lack of self-deception. Hard men leading difficult lives with undeniable grace. <br /> <br /> Some guilt has to cling to the direction worked here and everywhere. The whole cast needed dialect and training dialogue. <br /> <br /> As I try to imagine Robert Duvall as McCrae, speaking this same dialogue, it comes out better - but not much. You try to sound shy but witty but you do not succeed ... <br /> <br /> How can you be so different from Lonesome Dove? Could the writer have forgotten his characters? You've fooled some people, Mr. McMurtry - but not this one.
