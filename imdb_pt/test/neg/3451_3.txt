I got to see this in what I think was the second exhibition in the world, a few days after its opening at the Dublin International Film Festival. While I was watching another movie two nights later at the same theater, I saw Brendan Gleeson, Paul Mercier and the rest of the cast and crew at another studs promotional screening. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was bitterly disappointed with the film, I was not expecting a masterpiece in any way, but what I was presented with, I believe, lacked all the crucial elements of the film. gender in which it was placed. Before continuing, two things, I accept that some filmmakers like to subvert generic expectations, here simply is not the case. Secondly, I know it was based on a play (which I did not read but was informed that it is not a brilliant piece of literature), but that does not justify the massive narrative problems that permeate the film. /> <br /> My main problem with the film is the script, forget it was based on a play, as a sports comedy it just does not work, the staff from down and out is trying to win a football, few of games are shown (when they are, it is very short) and we are not given any satisfaction due to any of their sporting achievements. Having read so far, you may assume that it is not a strictly sports movie, but a psychological study of the relationship between a "charlatan" of a manager and his desperate team. Surely you can not do that, I'm not even sure if I was meant to be. Any attempt to clarify the story of any character is banal and peripheral. Overall, I found the script devoid of all aspects. <br /> <br /> I think the performances and the music were good and technically, the movie was well done. But aside from these points, which should be expected of any Irish film at this stage, I left the theater very disappointed. <br /> <br /> My judgment may seem harsh, but I think there is some hope for a strong movie. national Irish cinema in the near future and this simply does not support this argument. As Studs has become a recommended movie from the Dublin Cineworld (I was part of the audience on this show), most people seem to disagree with me, so that means you should probably make your own judgment of the movie.
