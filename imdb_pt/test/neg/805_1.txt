Drab, sad and a total waste of my time. The plot is incomprehensible (so do not think too much about it). The acting is strange and wooden - I would have sworn they were all professional bodybuilders trying their luck at acting, but this can be an insult to bodybuilders. There are no special effects interesting to rescue this disaster, but many fires, explosions, a free sex scene, etc. The only thing that caught my attention was that this occurs after a war between the US and Iraq that somehow becomes nuclear. ..hmmm Roger Corman is paranormal? Let's hope that "Iraq" is just a lucky choice for Corman and that the rest of his scenario does not come true. <br /> <br />
