You know, I have no idea what teenage life was like for everyone else, but it does not reflect the people I knew and I was around, let alone with myself. And just in case if you are wondering..NOT..we were not clean / clean cut / Pat Boone type teenagers. (If there was something like that !!!!) <br /> <br /> Look, I'm not saying that being a teenager is easy. The best, well, actually, the best teen movie of the day is "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." Now those kids that I knew and were as realistic as back then (and maybe now). <br /> <br /> That sucked. This was a low version of Fast Times and even then it did not do much for me. It had a few moments, but not enough for me to recommend it, or even to say that "it was like that for teenagers in 1982". I could not relate. The main girl (girls) did nothing for me and please, if they really wanted to keep their virginity, they would have, in which case, this movie would not have been made. Pure shit and a bad staple to be left behind as a time capsule movie for teens / young adults in the early 80's.
