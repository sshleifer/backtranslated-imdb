I just saw this movie. I liked the soundtrack. I first saw the trailer and it was magnificent, like all Hollywood movies, they know how to sell. But the movie is almost horrible, the first 30 minutes are interesting, but then ... like almost every new movies they blow it up. I did not get the idea, why did that kid die? It's a clich√©, every hand-held film needs to have a child to be killed, and everyone should get well after their death. LOL. I do not understand what the connection to the film is ... And it's so predictable, you know the ending from the first minutes. Nothing new in this movie. I saw 'You were served' same idea, but also ... something new ... this is something like 'Honey', but it's not a small difference between them. If you do not have another option, watch this movie, but rest assured it's the last option you take. And the choreography is worse than anything before. This is not a must see for sure ...
