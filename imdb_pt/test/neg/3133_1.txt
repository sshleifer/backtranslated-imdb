Great. Another foreign film that you think is Fellini. In addition, we must have more propaganda about the murder of people with disabilities. <br /> <br /> I see no reason for us to be inundated by these disguised euthanasia advertisements. <br /> <br /> I did not find anything redeeming about this movie. What can be a redeeming man without the courage to continue, despite some adversity. It does not take courage to commit suicide. This is the action of a coward. Sharing this "desire" with his wife simply inflicts it with the same illness as him. If this had been a movie about a man's courage to continue, despite his troubles, similar to Jill Kinmont's story, that would make it a great movie. <br /> <br /> If you're interested in seeing the real guts, check out the films about Jill Kinmont, the ex-skier who was disabled after a bad skiing accident.
