If this is film noir, then the noir must be French to be glacially slow. Take a cast of completely unpleasant characters, give them nothing to say, score the whole thing with free ultra-violence, and you'll have the formula for an aggravated Dash. It could be subtitled "despicable Hollywood types try to make money from the robbery of Chinatown." The one-minute part of Bruce Dern is better than anything else in this movie. By the way, I did not like the movie.
