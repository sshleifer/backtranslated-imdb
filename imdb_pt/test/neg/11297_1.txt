Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is back ... for a farce from a movie! Now he's in Italy, enjoying our food (including people like Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini)), but back to the States for Clarice (Julianne Moore) and even to score the score with a former victim, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman ) <br /> <br /> Let me tell you, this movie does not deserve to be spoken along with Silence Of The Lambs and Manhunter because it's really, completely, absolutely, totally bad. <br /> <br /> I mean, the scene near the end with Ray Liotta's skull being opened and he forced to eat part of his saut√© brain? WTF So why the hell was everyone so boring (including Clarice)? And why did the story go nowhere? I suppose this is the "teenage" chapter of the Hannibal series; terrible, stupid, bloody for Gore's sake and totally embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Do not watch, especially if you love any other Hannibal movie (SOTL, Manhunter, Red Dragon, Hannibal Rising). <br /> <br /> Hannibal: 1/10.
