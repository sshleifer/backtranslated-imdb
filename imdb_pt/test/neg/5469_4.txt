While walking to buy cigarettes, professional dancer Daniel (Tom Long) is kidnapped and forced into perverted sex for many days by three hooded women. When he is released, the director of his company Isabel (Greta Scacchi) has already replaced him in the play and his girlfriend gives him a cold reception. The disturbed and humiliated Daniel leaves the dance company and travels obsessed to look for the hijackers. Daniel has sex with many women he suspects may be the hijackers. "The Book of Revelation" is a strange movie with a promising beginning that loses its initial power and becomes a kind of very long erotic or soft-porn novel. The production is elegant, the cover of the DVD is incredible, but the characters are not well developed and Daniel's trauma seems to be excessive, since most men would fantasize about the dream situation he was subjected to? to become the sexual object of three sensual women. The melodramatic development with Isabel's disease does not add any value to the plot; the open conclusion is very disappointing and there are no explanations for the women's motif or the title. It is very clear that the script about a man's feelings was written by a woman. It was nice to see the still beautiful Greta Scacchi again and her makeup at the end is amazing. There is a saying in Portuguese that can be translated into English as follows: "If rape is inevitable, relax and come." Daniel should have done this and spared me from watching almost two hours of a meaningless story. My vote is four. Title (Brazil): "The Book of Revelations"
