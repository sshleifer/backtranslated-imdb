I like gay-themed movies where the characters are not stereotypically gay and that's what attracted me in this movie, and the lead actor, which is the only reason I'm giving this movie more of a star than it deserves (though not because of your acting in the movie, let me tell you). A lot of people complain about cinematography, but the filmmaker's sense of the film added a certain "underground" quality to her and there are some scenes, usually around the sunset or sunrise and between trains that would make any movie screen flush. <br /> <br /> But the acting is cardboard, the music is repetitive (I came in the second half of the movie listening to a soundtrack from another movie), you have to wait almost 20 minutes for any dialogue and then you are clumsy and amateur. The graffiti theme could have made this movie great if it had been explored with grace and if the art itself was more intriguing, but it is not. <br /> <br /> The worst of all is that there is no climax; there was not really a plot to begin with. The movie just creeps back into its shell of silence and dies. A forgettable movie.
