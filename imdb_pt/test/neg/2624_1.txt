Lazy movie made by a lazy director. The characters are grotesque. Despite the tragedy of this war, there is no emotion in the film. The symbolism is artificial and inefficient (and the old Bosnian giving a picture of her son to Arbor will "bring about" her disposition, awaken the superwoman sleeping inside her, a corpse eaten by worms to show the horror of the genocide ... too often it is worse than enough. <br /> <br /> This movie is just an advertisement, an empty elegy for a woman who is not a heroine. <br /> <br /> She worked for the United Nations. <br /> <br /> Remember that the UN did not protect civilians a Canadian judge led a post-mortem trial for atrocities that happened mostly because his organization failed to stop them? Where is the criticism in this film?
