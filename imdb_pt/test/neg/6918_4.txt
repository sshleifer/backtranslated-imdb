"A scientist has developed a serum that grotesquely distorts the hands and heads of the victim. The scientist decides to use his serum on a pianist to extort money from him for the cure, as well as take the man's daughter for a wife," according to research . The synopsis of the DVD cover. J. Carrol Naish (as Dr. Igor Markoff) plays "The Creator of Monsters" in Bela Lugosi's low-budget mode. <br /> <br /> Naish's serum causes a real disorder, "acromegaly," which American Heritage defines as "a chronic adult disease marked by enlargement of the bones of the extremities, face, and jaw caused by hyperactivity pituitary gland. " Ralph Morgan (as Anthony Lawrence) plays the afflicted man with some dignity. Pretty blonde Wanda McKay (as Patricia "Pat" Lawrence) is the daughter desired by mad scientist Naish; In the first scenes, Ms. McKay and Naish play hilariously. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to Tala Birell (like Maxine) in a surprisingly good supporting performance; she plays Naish's assistant, somewhat like Garbo, and there is a lot of suffering. Birell definitely steals the movie; and you have to question Dr. Markoff's sanity in putting her aside. Glenn Strange (as Steve) and a crazed gorilla (Ray Corrigan) add to the fun. The makeup of the monster (Maurice Seiderman) is very good. The Creator of Monsters (1944) Sam Newfield ~ J. Carrol Naish, Ralph Morgan, Tala Birell
