I got this on Cinemax very late at night ... nothing else was turned on, so I pretty much had no choice. Bottom line, terrible plot, slow, waste of good movie and actors time. To summarize, do not bother with that. It's a shame that we can not give zeros as a rating; this one really is not worth even a consideration !!!
