In Chicago, four electricians led by Dean (Richard Grieco) arrive at an old building to disconnect power. They accidentally activate a portal and arrive in another dimension, where Chicago was destroyed by a Spider Queen and inhabited by mutants. The group finds survivors led by Crane (David Nerman) and Elena (Kate Greenhouse), and finds the portal's inventor, Dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox), who has lived in this dimension for thirty years. They join forces, trying to rebuild a portal to bring them back home. "Webs" is a plagiarism of "Sliders", only worse. Most dialogues seem to be written by a person who has not finished primary school, so they are imbeciles. In addition, the story is illogical and it seems that Chicago is the only city in the world. The scientist trying to start his sophisticated machine with broken wires as if he were stealing a car is very funny. Richard Grieco's face looks like a white version of Michael Jackson and it's horrible. If the viewer interrupts his brain, he or she may like this forgettable TV movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "In the Web of Terror" ("In the Web of Horror")
