My mother, my cousins ​​and I are big fans of Jane Austen. We all know the words of the Pride and Prejudice masterpiece of 1995 and saw Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma an embarrassing number of times. I have read all the books and even sat through Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion a few times. So my mom and I thought it would be cool to see the movie Northanger Abbey. <br /> <br /> Bad idea! This is just the worst movie I've ever seen. It's even worse than the 1998 version of Alice Through the Looking Glass, or the 1939 Nancy Drew movie I bought at Wal-Mart for $ 1 (my previous "bad movies"). The first wrong thing you notice in the opening scene is that the "heroine," Catherine, has a horrifying and strange imagination, inspired by useless novels that a Jane Austen heroine would never touch. Throughout the novel she has dreams (day and night) in which she is carried by a ghastly man with a greasy wig, dragged by a field to God knows-what-all-and suddenly rescued by a guy thrown into a White horse. <br /> <br /> The second thing any movie viewer will notice instantly is the lament and high-pitched saxophone music that is supposed to be the soundtrack. No delicate classical music or country English dance here! It is also evident, almost at first glance, that the actress (for lack of a better word) chosen to play Catherine is completely turned off. In the first place, it is quite uninteresting and is represented even more by its non-Austenian behavior. Your looks and movements are just crazy! In addition, they are completely affected and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> This sad lack of acting skills affects virtually every actor in the movie. Not even Mr. Tilney, the so-called "young, bold pretender" is decent. <br /> <br /> As more and more characters are introduced, a strange taste in the costumes on the part of the filmmakers becomes evident. Huge Marie Antoinette style hats clash with Empire dresses (for the most part) properly decorated. A French woman, apparently a friend of General Tilney, is made of black as a sort of Gothic nightmare - she bears a striking resemblance to Michael Jackson in a black dress. Her appearance is made even more foolish by a huge mark of half-moon beauty on her cheek. I also had to wonder about the historical accuracy of the brilliant red lipstick that almost every woman wore. <br /> <br /> Another anomaly that kept my mom and me howling with laughter for about ten minutes was the "bath" scene. The first thing we noticed was that men and women were bathing together in a large bathroom - probably not very likely in the early nineteenth century. Then we saw that all the women seemed to be using large porcelain or plastic dishes, worn around the neck with ropes. The plates floated horizontally in the water, containing some mysterious bits of ... something. We guessed it was soap, then aromatic herbs, and finally, when the mysterious substance began to disappear between the shots, we deduced that it was food. But I'm still not sure. <br /> <br /> And that's not even half of what's wrong with Northanger Abbey. My warning to anyone considering renting this movie: stay in your hand. And if anyone is thinking about buying it - well, I do not even know what to say about it. <br /> <br /> You'd think that when the actors and other people making this movie got about 1/4 of the way, they realized what monster they were creating and stopped. Unfortunately, they did not and the Northanger Abbey was left to the world.
