I have a question for the writers and producers of "Prozac Nation": What is the root cause and what is the solution to the pervasive problem of personal depression in America? In the poignant performance of Christina Ricci as Liz Wurtzel, the film portrays a young woman with unlimited potential as a Harvard student and as a writer. But this is not a success story, just a self-destruct one as we watch Liz bring misery to the lives of everyone who comes into contact with her. The film examines divorce, family dysfunction, drugs, alcohol and prescription drugs as possible reasons for Liz's misfortune. But none of these superficial explanations are satisfactory. <br /> <br /> At some point in the movie, it would have been helpful to suggest that Liz needs to take responsibility for her life and her problems. No light was shed on what the film claimed to be a major problem in "The United States of Depression." In the story, Liz had a careful therapist (Anne Heche), a roommate (Michele Williams), a caring boyfriend (Jason Biggs), and a troublesome but careful mother (Jessica Lange). In a key scene in the film, Liz is lying on a hospital bed watching the breakup of the Challenger space shuttle. Instead of equating Challenger with Liz's life, the film should have used the image as a starting point for its healing and recovery. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of a generic "victim" movie made by cable in the web of life. An excellent cast was wasted, especially in the serious performance of Christina Ricci. Real life Elizabeth Wurtzel obviously found within herself the resources to deal with her depression and become a successful author. It is unfortunate that the film could not give us a glimpse of his brave spirit.
