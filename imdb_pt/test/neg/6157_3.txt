The story and the characters really really needed work. The idea of ​​the world is pretty cool, but no one bothered to develop it, either by exposure or by plot. Despite the cheesy notes at the beginning of the film, it makes sense that you do not use exposure, since no one is new in this world. And yet, when Matt Owens (Bill Paxton) and Byron (Bob Peck) drift and get lost, and are introduced to the wind-worshipers and rich, lazy, rich folk of the museum, we get no response. idea of ​​who these people are, or why we should care about them. Smart movies have ways of developing it simply by making the characters live in the world. Simple things like asking for a drink in a bar, or talking about something in the past - these are the kinds of things that make the movie world memorable, not endless images of bad airplanes, and cheap computer graphics effects of someone trying make loops in an ultralight. <br /> <br /> If this is too hard for you, here's a little tip - find out the various locations. If everything is breaking up, because you're pulling up frequently, stay in one place for a while and have the characters talk a little. All superfluous crap must be removed. Get rid of the whole scene of the devotees of the wind. Get rid of the stuffy museum people. Get rid of all the flying crap unless you can make the wind relevant to the story. Put the whole thing in a big plane, or something. Just make people talk about something we like. <br /> <br /> Hey, get rid of Bill Paxton. Get the movie centered around Tasker's character and his relationship with the robot, Byron. <br /> <br /> In fact, the biggest problem with the movie is that we do not care about anyone because no one takes the time to either explain their motivations or deepen their characters. We do not like Matt (well, because he's played by Bill Paxton among other things). He is a scoundrel, who does not rescue himself enough, except let android Byron walk away. And this action has even less significance than most because of three key points: 1. Byron is a killer. 2. Byron is indestructible 3. Byron can leave anytime he wants. <br /> <br /> We try to like Byron, because there's a kind of pathetic there, but it's underdeveloped. All we have left is a sturdy, glassy-eyed guy who is acting like a subjugated and wooden one moment, and practically crazy in the other. We do not know why or how he develops emotions, but we know that he has murdered someone. We do not know why he murdered someone, or the circumstances of this horrible event, because it is not developed. We can not feel sorry for him if we do not know the story. All we know is that it kills people. And he likes Bill Paxton. <br /> <br /> We do not hate Tasker enough (in part because he's played by the good guy Mark Hamill), since, though rude and relentless, he does nothing out of the ordinary for his character - a peace officer post-apocalyptic. Of course he kills Montclaire (Robbie Coltrane) and his team, but they are drug traffickers, on their way to growing poppies for heroin. And they shoot him first. He does not kill anyone who does not interfere, or who does not try to hurt him physically first. This also applies to the final confrontation in the museum. He uses a bit of police brutality against a lazy dilettante (F. Murray Abraham is wasted in this role), and everyone else points a gun at him. <br /> <br /> I really do not understand what the problem is with this. Belitski (Kitty Aldridge), partner of Tasker. After only 10 minutes cumulated with Matt, she is ready to switch sides, despite her cries of loyalty, and despite Matt talking to her about the garbage, and punching her. If this is love then I will choose to hate any day. <br /> <br /> Really. Paxton's character is as kind as Simon in "True Lies," or Pvt. Hudson's "Aliens." Does anyone fall in love with him in these films? No, why? Because he's an idiot with a loud mouth and a loser. Why put him in charge of this movie?
