Time travel is theoretical, so I can give the script some room for maneuver. <br /> <br /> I also understand the concept that by changing only one variable, you can potentially change the way the story unfolded. <br /> <br /> What I can not understand, however, is the way the change in time unfolded. We are subject to a series of "timewaves" that progressively regressed planetary evolution. Although this is a convenient plotting device, since it allows our heroes enough time to solve the problem, it makes no sense at all. Of course, if you change a variable, and that variable has significantly changed, or even completely, planetary evolution, then when you return "to the future," has the evolutionary process been established and there would be no need for waves? After all, why did a change that happened 65 million years ago have to wait until now to be effective? The fact that the moth was projected in time may give some credibility, but the life of this moth 65 million years ago was significantly altered, so any change in evolutionary history would have begun then, and would not depend on a return to it. our current time. <br /> <br /> To solve the problem, the team goes back in time to prevent the change in the variable from happening. By doing this successfully, we see that changes in evolution have never happened and that no one remembers events! Of course, what works for the solution should work for the original change? I like a good science fiction adventure, but unless it's defined "in a galaxy far away," it needs to have at least some basis in the theoretical possibility to make it truly entertaining. <br /> <br /> Good premise, bad plot, reasonable acting and, in all fairness, just a turnaround at Jurassic Park. <br /> <br /> Not on my "watch again" list.
