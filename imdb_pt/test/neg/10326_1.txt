I love Sandra Bullock, she's one of my all time favorite actresses, but this is a movie she should have paid for a long time to be canned. I realize that they are almost 20 years old, but my dead grandmother can act better than these people. Beware - not even worth the $ 5.50 WalMart shelf ... You know that when acting stinks so badly that it's not even worth a couple of dollars - the sound quality is horrendous - there are no subtitles to hear the hideous dialogue, and it looks like it was filmed on a budget of $ 1.98. I thought I'd like to see Sandra in a starter role to see how she evolved as an actress, but YIKES is a very kind word to use ...
