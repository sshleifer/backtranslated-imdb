Saving some Norris too early, "Breaker, Breaker" has nothing to offer that can not be found ten times better on any broadcast channel. A pathetic attempt at making movies, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Despite this, I watched, pushing the forward button, because the acting was so horrible that it was comical. Of course the film should be an action / drama, but it turned out to be a treatise on how NOT to make a movie. All that could be wrong with the movie is on the screen in this "dog". If it does, take a peek. It's so bad, it's funny.
