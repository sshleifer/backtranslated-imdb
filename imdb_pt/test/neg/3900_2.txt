As I began to watch, I instantly realized that I could not understand what anyone was saying. I turned up the volume. With background noises now growing, I could hear the voices. Just what are the actors saying? Is not the movie nicknamed? Are they speaking Spanish? After some confusion, I realize that it was English. At least, I think so ... The Incredible Jess Franco put the microphones too far away from the actors. As a result, we can not completely hear what they are saying. He did it before. But perhaps this is Mr. Franco's intention? Because we do not know what people are saying, we are led to a mystery about what is happening and we are left with more visual clues ... Maybe it's just me, but I'd like to know what was happening! How about some tips? The basic premise (I refuse to call it "plot") concerns a young exotic American dancer named Paula (played by Amber Newman) who has a boyfriend who invites her to a small island owned by some rich and despicable . It's somewhere off the coast of Spain. For this visit, a large cash payment is promised to Paula, which the boyfriend receives. He then escapes from the island, only to return later. Because? Pay close attention to the scene where the boyfriend opens Paula's American passport. Although her hand has tried to cover up, you can see the real name of the actress, Amber Newman, printed below the photo at the bottom of the passport !! Anyway, let's go back to the "story": there are some other coarse, rich and beautiful characters visiting the island, all with ambiguous motives. We witness sadistic games (are they real or fake?) And nasty gastronomic scenes. But the food must be good, as a fake French chef has prepared! There is a young servant who runs naked and never speaks. Is she really dumb? And we care? Of course, all women are almost naked throughout the film ... Oh, well, at least we can thank that men (over 50 and overweight) are still dressed! In addition to the abysmal sound quality, what I have always admired in Jess Franco is her incredible ability to shoot beautiful naked women in such a way that leaves the viewer completely off. This movie is no exception ?? I needed fresh air after watching! <br /> <br /> In conclusion: I am happy to report that, regardless of what Mr. Franco may dream of, I am still attracted to women.
