This is an extremely technically competent film. The work and direction of the camera are excellent and the acting is also good - especially the good performance of Daniel Auteuil as the Marquis. I really thought there were no issues with these aspects of the movie. Instead, I was a little annoyed by how the Marquis was portrayed, as it did not seem so honest and seems to be a very revisionist view of the story. In fact, in recent years, the Marquis has undergone a minor transformation for a libertarian with great insight, not the fat, sadomasochistic rapist he really was. In a way, this is very reminiscent of the limping given in THE PEOPLE VERSUS LARRY FLINT - where these men are elevated to hero status. Even if you do not think the Marquis's perversions were not that bad (they included rape and extreme violence), your playing in this movie as a "sexual social worker" in this jail seems silly. Instead of the violent and selfish Sade, he spends a lot of time carefully caring for a young virgin and slowly helps him explore his own sensuality. What a nice and gentle man. In fact, now that I think about it, this performance reminds me of the man Maurice Chavalier played in GIGI (but without the chant) - an older, handsome man who loves women. I strongly doubt that the real-life Marquis de Sade would have recognized this character! <br /> <br /> The film, surprisingly, does not have much nudity, although what it shows is extremely explicit. Only a maniac would let his children see this, since this is a very adult drama. It is very well done and very fun - not so true. The director admits that the film is largely fictional in the interview among the special features of the DVD I watched. So go ahead and see the movie if you want - understanding this is not very good historically. During the eighteenth century, sexual libertines were widely accepted in France because they were quite liberal, so despite what the film suggests, it was not the SEX that was the issue, it was violence and rape that was (and still is) the problem.
