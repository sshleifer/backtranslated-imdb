Warning It could contain spoilers <br /> <br /> I just, unfortunately, spent $ 5 on this movie in amazon and I wish I never spent it. I've never seen sucking horrible special effects, or acting. I mean Jack-0 is just a laughable monster and your costume looks like something you could buy at a Halloween store or do it yourself. The acting is just awful, especially Sean Kelly, I mean, come on, he's so pathetic with his little lines "COme get me PUmpkinman" down, I laughed so hard that it's stupid. I mean the movie is so horrible that they had to put a few minutes of nudity just so people would not turn it off. I think the most laughable scene is when the woman puts a knife into the toaster and is electrocuted. I mean come on, it looked so fake and the mannequin I could buy this at any Halloween store or do it myself. Well, I recommend you not to watch this bad taste movie, because it will be time for you to never come back.
