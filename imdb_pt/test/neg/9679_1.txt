I saw some biblical rubbish. This is the best of everything. To make matters worse, it lasts about three hours. A horrible waste of time, unless you want to combine your son's biblical knowledge with innumerable aberrations. Do yourself a favor - take a ride in the Sahara. Since I am required to give you a ten line statement of why not watch this movie, let me tell you that there is absolutely no redeemable quality to it. God's conversations with Noah are ridiculous. The whole thing smells like, "Let's make the Bible story look retarded." The basic logic is that if they spend the money on a biblical movie, why is not it worth it? As the basic logic is not fulfilled, something is wrong. The film begins with a warning about the poetic licenses taken ... this is the understatement of the century. Poetic rape. But then, poetic would be an undeserved favor.
