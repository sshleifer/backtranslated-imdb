What begins as an acceptable film degenerates into one of the most incoherent, incompetent and incompetent attempts at horror films of recent years. <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible. It's such a derivative confusion ripping out all the decent thriller movies you can imagine without producing a single fright with success. Be copying the recent trend with frightening children or ghosts passing by the camera or the horror of the old school of the Gates of Hell of Fulci. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that not even a cat jumping out of a closet to make you jump. To be avoided.
