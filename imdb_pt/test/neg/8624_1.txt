This movie was so misunderstood. What was with Jeff Bridges' accent, horrible and unbelievable. Was it supposed to be French, Scandinavian? The script was lame. For the heroine to stumble into her boyfriend's grave while running the character Jeff Bridges ... are you kidding me? How convenient is that Jeff brings his dirty shovel into the house after he discards bodies on his lawn. Do not these people just believe in calling the cops? Okay ... I'm going to get in the car with you, why not? DUH! Why was Bridge's daughter obsessed with getting her father to have an affair, is her mother so bad or just plain dumb? I did not see the original, it would be difficult for me to do it after seeing this movie.
