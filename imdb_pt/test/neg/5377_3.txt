I'm a sucker for Ghost Hunter shows. From Cheesy mockumentaries like "The Haunting" from the Discovery Channel to Scooby Doo Reality shows like "Ghost Hunters". When I saw the A & E's "Paranormal State" promos, I knew I was going to watch. Especially when "Paranormal State" was juxtaposed against a poor game Monday Night Football. <br /> <br /> At the end of the pilot of "Paranormal State" when the main "character" in this macabre reality dance gives a Creepy Kid a bottle of Max Von Sydow Holy Water and reassures him by telling this boy that he also had a bad experience unspecified as a child with things that "came out of the closet" and the (Catholic) Church gave him a Holy Water to ward off things coming out of the closet. I knew I should have given Monday night football another shot. <br /> <br /> The shtick behind "Paranormal State" is a group of Penn State students all together and started their own Ghost Hunting Club. Or society. Or Super Adventure Club. And they race through Pennsylvania researching the most horrific haunts and the lost conspiracy for a M. Night Shymalan movie. <br /> <br /> The "They" is a kind of misunderstanding. Actually Paranormal State revolves around a Nittany Lion named Ryan Buell, who would probably be performing at Penn State's annual Anime Convention if it was not for this show. It is often accompanied by "inquiries" by group colleagues and some other people seen in the credits, but rarely captured by the camera. Hey, are they ghosts too? <br /> <br /> This is Ryan Buell's show. Paranormal State is your "vehicle", as we like to say in Biz. And, oh, what a monotonous ride in a vehicle it can be. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Ryan recounts the whole episode of Paranormal State in an undated "record director" stunt double? Almost immediately this becomes annoying because the obvious intention is to give Ryan's phantom hunt some seriousness, but his monotony filtered does nothing but provoke grunts and giggling. Seriously, all serious intonation sounds like the radio talk of a Call of Duty video game. <br /> <br /> "Inquiries" - the plot that each episode revolves around - are interesting on the surface. There are no inns or haunted restaurants in "Paranormal State". This is a show about fearing the unknown as a good Catholic boy and by God they give things to you to fear. <br /> <br /> Little children are harassed, things arise in the dark, voices stimulate the living to kill, and Aleister Boldly rubs me in my hands. Of the two episodes, I watched each turn around violent and unpleasant haunts, tied to violent and unpleasant deaths. <br /> <br /> Maybe. <br /> <br /> Maybe not. <br /> <br /> Everything in "Paranormal State" is short-handed in half an hour, "Dog the Bounty - er, Ghost Hunter". Whenever there is an interesting and verifiable fragment of evidence - the murder of a family in a farmhouse in the 1800s - the evidence is waved in front of the viewer as a con man trying to convince him of a pile of papers that are under his nose is the proof that ten million come from Nigeria and then are plucked before you can get a good look. At least with the Sci-Fi Channel's "Ghost Hunters", there is a rather over-exhaustive need to display every shred of evidence possible and present it to the viewer. EVPs that could be a farting rat, cold spots in a dashing house, and "orbs" that even Ghost Hunters discard as dust. It's sort of like Scooby Doo's approach that makes "Ghost Hunters" ... almost believable. <br /> <br /> Whereas "Paranormal State" claims to have EVPs, but gives the viewer a ten second clip of a wave file in the Garage Band without audio. Yeah, see, an EVP, right? People are claiming to see dark figures in the basement ... Well, let's just see this ... as we leave the night vision camera in a picture of the living room. Ryan, the intrepid leader of this group of Penn State graduates, is claiming to have "visions" of the name of a demon he knows and who may be involved in a paranormal haunt ... But he can not tell us, the audience, or his team of undergraduates, because ... He can not. You never say the name of a demon out loud, Ryan informs the wide-eyed Co-Ed he dares to ask. <br /> <br /> Well, as it is very convenient for you. Especially since this is a television show where the public can not read your mind. <br /> <br /> "Paranormal State" is all flip and no prestige. The public is informed of what is supposed to be happening, but you never see an ounce of proof that the scary kid is seeing Dead People. Not even a grainy video of a moving chair, or a black stain running through the jail cells. Anything. You just know what happened to Ryan in yet another mechanical voice. <br /> <br /> If you're going to try to scare me, dress up a little. If you're trying to influence me, show me an orb or a bubble and have the fat girl working on Hot Topic tell me why this black sphere is really the spirit of a murderous ax. And if you want to make me watch a ghost hunting show, give me something besides hanging out with Lorraine Warren in the second episode. <br /> <br /> "Paranormal State" is a weak sauce. It really is not worth watching, unless you are hard for the TV time, or just have that fine DVD collection. Or unless you want to know what really happened in that closet with Holy Water.
