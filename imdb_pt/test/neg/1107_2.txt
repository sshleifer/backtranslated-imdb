One of the few reasons to do these films is to give some actors a chance to star in better movies if they are acting in some way. The only good thing about this movie is the acting, the three female protagonists are better than most horror movies like this. There are 2 scenes that can cause an unexpected jump. <br /> <br /> Young little children are used to crawl through holes and put dynamite to blow up mines. When a collapse causing a cave in all children die, becoming zombies. The adults of the mine are still dead, there is no reason for children to become carnivorous. When they are still alive, they seem to be terrified before the entrance of the cave, innocent, so they must be enraged at any adult exploiting them in the mines (just a reason that comes to mind). <br /> <br /> A mother and her two daughters move to a house near the mine, along with a land devolador who wants to build a resort and one of those scary people who seem to know exactly what is going on but no one believes in him. <br /> <br /> Nothing new here you are usual clich√©s, predictable, many negatives for this film, very few good points.
