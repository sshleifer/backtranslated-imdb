This movie is about a depressed and emotionally constricted man who has a distant relative with him in his apartment in Istanbul. Over time, the relationship becomes increasingly tense until at last he begins to yell at the house guest - who is unemployed and does not seem so eager to find work. That's the bulk of the film indeed. The problem is that while emotionally constricted and depressed people are VERY withdrawn and noncommunicative, they do not contribute to a very satisfying film. That's because most of the time he (and his roommate) just look into space and say nothing. I think all those flat moments could have been shortened to make a 30 minute movie - I certainly would not have minded.
