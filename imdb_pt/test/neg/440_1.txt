This DVD is missing his call as a Heineken roller coaster .... This is a great example of why no one should ever go see a sequel with a director / writer other than the original. Two hours of that turkey left me begging for Exorcist 2 reruns. <br /> <br /> NO legitimate laughing. NOT A decent scare. The script was just a mess and I felt bad for the actors who had to perform it (they must have had sick relatives at home or Coca-Cola habits monsters or something). <br /> <br /> The original was a milestone of makeup effects. So of course, the sequel producers thought it would be a great idea to undo makeup FX and CG werewolves. These CG werewolves made me laugh a lot more than any "comedy." It was just a total lack. If you want an evening of entertainment, go rent the original again. Or go to a movie class and make your own horror movie. You're bound to do better than these fools did.
