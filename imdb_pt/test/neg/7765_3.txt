All my friends and several other co-workers think this show is soooo great. First I hate this show !!!!!!! I think I can be the only woman alive !!! I just watched because my best friend loves her and imagines herself as the character of Charlotte! <br /> <br /> First, the whole plot (if you can call it that) is about four women Superslut Samantha (Kim Cattrall) who probably has all MGS available and genitalia mossy, brown and green, considering that she is tri (she'll try anything). <br /> <br /> Samantha is not like most of the 40 women anything, even in NY, but the show would not have some entertainment since Samantha (along with some good NY scenery) is the only reason for watch and those that are not reason enough. <br /> <br /> Charlotte (Kristen Davis) is a well-dressed, high-class idiot from NY who still believes in the myth of Pince Charming! As sweet and beautiful as she is, she does not let you fool her, she spreads quite often. <br /> <br /> Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) now this woman is stereotyped with rage, butch feminist. I think in one episode she is considered a lesbian, but apparently she is not ... What a shame she is almost interesting. <br /> <br /> Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), the most annoying character. I swear I thought I was watching the front man of Twisted Sister, Dee Snider, manly, cross dressing, pussy, brother! This is a girl looking can not live without you love .... Heard of a puppy? <br /> <br /> This show is stupid and I love making fun of it because I've heard about how it's some kind of new awakening for women. This is simply sad if you are looking to watch filthy, pathetic, addictive people in overpriced drinking cosmopolitan clothes and sounding like a 15 year old nuisance with cocaine than there is a show for you ........... .just use protection.
