A horrible movie; badly written, misinterpreted, clich√©, banal, scum. The premise is so good and a chance to educate about black cowboys, but the movie is really terrible. It's a curious mix of a bad 1950's movie, Randolph Scott B, and a bad 1970s spaghetti western. Villains are cardboard, flashbacks are laughable, excruciating dialogue. <br /> <br /> Deliberate anachronisms (such as "Victorian" rap singers and modern-day sweeps like "motherf **** er") are extremely annoying. <br /> <br /> A Frankenstein monster who died at the lab table.
