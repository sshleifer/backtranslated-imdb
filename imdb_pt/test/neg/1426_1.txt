Did you just see which way forward? in TCM (UK) is a truly horrible movie. If I paid the pictures, I would have left. <br /> <br /> A terrible movie mess. Byers (Lewis) and his companions parade around uniforms from an Italian science fiction movie of the 1960s. Were the CND / Peace emblems on the uniforms ironic? The sets were pure in 1970, I'm sure a Hollywood TV back-lot could have provided a more realistic setting. <br /> <br /> The film is full of racism. The movie takes the mickey from the veterans. <br /> <br /> It's not funny how Lewis has to make another movie besides me.
