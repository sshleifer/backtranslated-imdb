I can not understand how this photo was allowed. It is mostly, if not completely, inaccurate so much that the main character does not even look like the story that he looks physically. This movie made me go on the internet and read my books to make sure that I remember Nero's personality correctly. For God's sake, I have a book that lists Nero as one of the meanest people in the world and the movie made me feel bad for him. I must say that the character of Aggrapina seemed close to my understanding of her, both physically and psychologically. Although, all the actors did a good job, the film was terrible and I'm sure I will not see any other feat for this team.
