Frank Falenczyk: It's not that I'm sorry I killed them; is that I'm sorry for having killed them badly. <br /> <br /> Wow! Talk about a swing and a fault. You have a great cast and a great plot with endless possibilities ... how are you going to do that ?! Well, apparently John Dahl has found a way. With an atrocious script with jokes as funny as a malaria epidemic and a dialogue so painfully dry that none of the characters please, 'You Kill Me' may be the biggest film failure of 2007. On a positive note, Ben Kinglsey provides another great performance as the Polish alcoholic trying to stay clean, but the stuff he has to work sucks. Tea Leoni is as good as Luke Wilson, Dennis Farina, Bill Pullman, Philip Baker Hall and the rest of the cast. I think the best way to describe 'You Kill Me' is a terrible movie with good acting.
