I can not believe I really went through the whole movie! It was absolutely horrible, and totally worthy of pity, and yet I sat through it thinking I had to improve. No, and I've lost 2 hours of my life. Will Smith is a lot better at action movies - I loved him in Me, Robot, State Enemy and Independence Day - and I do not think he can really be expected to take an entire movie as romantic lead the way Cary Grant could. Then again, the script was unbearably horrible, and the dialogue was so extravagant. <br /> <br /> I did not like everyone except Albert's character, and even what I found was done with a heavy hand. If you want to watch a modern romantic comedy and feel good, watch something like "How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days" or "When Harry Met Sally". The 40 Year Old Virgin left me with a smile on my face. I even preferred Music and Lyrics above it - and yes, I know it's cheesy, but at least it was not taken seriously, and it was sweet. I also did not like the main female protagonist - and I was not convinced of the chemistry between her and Will Smith's character. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think there were two scenes I liked (and definitely not the ending, which was nauseating and unconvincing!) - Hitch calling Sarah when she did not give him her number was very sweet and - No, sorry, that's the only thing I enjoyed throughout the movie. Do not waste your time.
