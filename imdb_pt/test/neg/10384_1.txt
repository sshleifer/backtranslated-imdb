While watching BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM, I found scenarios and dialogues so incredibly bad that I was convinced that this should be a comedy. Some dialogue bits of choice worthy of a laugh: "I ate a rabbit." "I told you she was possessed!" "Are you telling me the Devil is in my daughter?!" <br /> <br /> There are many, many more, but you must find this out for yourself - if you have the guts. <br /> <br /> History spreads in all sorts of directions and things happen that probably should not and everyone seems to be a pervert or psychopath of some sort (even the Priest). And I did not even get into bad acting. The most notable in this area is the subject who plays Isabelle's father. The director must have just told him to act like he had a dick on his @ $$, because that's the general impression one has. <br /> <br /> I really do not want to alienate anyone from the BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM because there is entertainment value to be had ... for all the wrong reasons but if you are looking for a decent horror movie that makes sense and It's really scary ... well, run, do not walk.
