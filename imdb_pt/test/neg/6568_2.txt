Even though I'm not a fan of the "Star Trek" movies or universe of shows and books and such, I still find some pleasure in some of the films that characterize the old cast and in the case of "First Contact" even the new cast one little . This was a bit sad to watch ... seemed to want to be a lot, but failed on so many levels to be one of the worst Star Trek movies. The plot is very improbable, seeming to combine three or four stories into a final Trek adventure, but it ends up bland when you try to be, not tense when you want to be and not full of action as if trying to be a mess of inconsistencies. The whole movie to pick up a Spock phrase is illogical. The effects are nothing special, since I've seen Next Generation episodes that are as good as, say, for a television show, but not for a big movie. The plot is laughable when the gang first attempts to stop Spock's brother then joins him in his quest to find God, yes you have read it correctly. The Klingons do a tacked on appearance, which will actually set the very best Undiscovered Country movie. All in all you know it's bad when the best part of the movie is Kirk, Bones and Spock singing their boat, well Spock was not really singing but questioning the lyrics.
