A bit confusing and horrible from South of the Border. I've watched it twice and I still do not know what was going on. It had something to do with a stupid Aztec mummy, a "human robot" who is the dumbest robot I've ever seen, and a woman who is the reincarnation of an ancient Aztec girl. Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and monotonous way by an incredibly annoying scientist. This guy is a wonderful sleep aid. His enemy is a plump fat man named The Bat, which is a rather unimaginative name for an evil scientist. <br /> <br /> I think the boring scientist and his wicked assistant dug the mummy, and how shocking the scientist. The wife has just HAPPENED to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend. They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I think so the bad guy can steal it. It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy or attack it, or whatever. He is behind some treasure that the mummy has, so he can be rich. But excuse me, if the guy had such a big intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why did not he just patronize some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /> Well, I suppose that would make a lot of sense. Instead, there is a ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is more impostor or more tacky. To tell you the truth, I watched this because I thought a movie with a name like The Robot Vs. the Aztec mom just had to be fabulously tacky. Instead, she was simply awful and confused.
