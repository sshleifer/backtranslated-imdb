Bad movie Bad! Go stay in a discount box. Top carrot should really stick with low light comedy clubs. It's movies like this that make the old Jerry Lewis movies look like Shakespeare and John Agar like John Barrymore. Coutney Thorne-Smith (an excellent talent) is utterly wasted. Its purpose seems mainly to look beautiful and oblivious. <br /> <br /> The only nice thing about the movie is seeing Raquel Welch playing a role of Alexis Carrington, and Estelle Harris as a prostitute of a landlady. The only way to imagine someone thinking it would be a good idea to make this film (beyond the second) is if the fourth-grader's child could choose the script. Well, maybe the third grade student. What this movie really needs is to be wiped on the nose of its creators.
