"The Next Karate Kid" is a completely predictable film, just like its predecessors. Its predictability often results in a sense of impatience on the part of the viewer, who often wants the story to move a little faster. Despite his calms and his extreme familiarity, however, this fourth entry in the series is painless, almost exclusively because of Morita's presence. He does not seem tired of his role, and inject some life and humor into the movie, making it the best reason for you to see him. It's not awful, but it's not much either.
