The Toxic Avenger ... <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this movie is that a person who the general population would call that person loose and after being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste, transformed into a superhero which is completely disfigured sounded good even for 1985. This movie is listed as a horror ... I still read of a following cult with this series .... Now this movie still given when it was was so bad that I could not stop watching ... the acting is horrible even for an independent movie that I think would be the horror part of this movie ... <br /> <br /> drug trafficking, sumo, Godzilla entry .... I am everything for films that promote anti-drugs ... hell I even like Godzilla and well sumo ... I'm not in this, but anyway I think sumo heights would love to give this film the slap of 1000 hands and the salt ground in the eyes of the people who made this movie ... Personally, I'm almost ready to crever for the producer who did this and ask them 87mins or more of my life back. <br /> <br /> For me, 1 out of 10 is too loud, it's too bad that there are not 0 (zero) or even negative integers to put in a movie here. In other words, this movie is rubbish ...... prefer to watch dry paint and deal with explosive diarrhea then have to watch this movie ever again ... I would be the first person which would use not only the packaging of this film as kindling, but I would be ready for a good movie and burning script.
