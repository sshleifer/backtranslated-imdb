Impressive sight indeed, and some hot with swords flying around, oh and those hypnotic Chinese violins too ... Let me think, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"? <br /> <br /> I kind of liked CTHD, with its realistic simplicity and well-developed characters, which still leave enough space for you to enjoy the view without having to think about the DEEEPAA Meaning of it. <br /> <br /> "Hero", on the other hand, is painfully pretentious and demanding visually and conceptually. Morale greater than life was horrible. That is, sacrifice your life, sacrifice your beliefs, sacrifice your love so that your powerful nation can succeed? WTF ?? <br /> <br /> No thanks. <br /> <br /> But, hay, Mao and G.W.B. would be proud! <br /> <br /> Live
