I'm afraid I did not like this adaptation. When I started watching it, I had a weird feeling of watching a TV series from the 70's because of the filter and the music score. I did not like the final scene. Mr. Tilney appears dressed only in his vest. Jane Austen would never make a gentleman leave without a frock coat. It seems that the producers have made a modern misunderstanding of the dream of a romantic girl. I much appreciate the more modern adaptations of JA, which show an eye for these details, which makes the BBC series worth it. Sorry, I'm looking forward to the 2007 adaptation. I hope it's better and show the benefits of Jane Austen's 20-year adaptation.
