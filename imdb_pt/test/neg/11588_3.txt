I just found out before writing this review that "Komodo vs. Cobra" and another movie called "Curse of the Komodo" were both directed by the same guy, Jim Wynorski. This may explain why they are almost identical movie premisses. Both have an island governed by military, a colonel who cares more about covering their tracks than the lives of their employees, people rushing to get to a helicopter that is conveniently in a field somewhere on the island and gigantic komodo dragons raised through furious genetic experiments. What differences are there? Well, intruders on the island are now capitalists who want to expose the government's secret and there is also a giant snake on the island, hence the title "Komodo vs. Snake", although the conflict between the two monsters is unimportant to the story. ' "Komodo vs. Cobra" is more or less what you would expect given the title and source of the channel: the Sci-Fi Channel. Although from time to time you find one that for one reason or another may appeal to you (I liked a movie called "Komodo") I hardly doubt that this someone will go. <br /> <br /> "Komodo vs. Snake" is not just a boring movie, but it's also one of the less enthusiastic science fiction films I've seen in a long time. In some of these films, there is an air for them that indicates that the filmmakers were giving at least a certain level of effort, but I see very little here. This is indicated again as a repetition of "Komodo Curse". The CGI for the monsters seems straight out of a second-rate video game, the movie scene and misc en is poor, the acting varies from passable to bad, the action scenes are dull and then there are some parts that are frankly , inexcusably bad. I see many movies where a person fires a gun many times without reloading and I can handle it. But in this movie, where Michael Paré picks up a single thirty-eight pistol and shoots about fifty times without stopping without reloading once - well, at first I laughed, but it nevertheless became tiresome. That would be "action." A monster appears, people shout, Paré shoots without stopping without recharging his weapon once throughout the whole picture, and someone is eaten. <br /> <br /> "Komodo vs. Cobra" is a very bad movie. The only thing in the movie worth mentioning in a charitable way is an actress named Michelle Borth, who is not only very beautiful, but a surprisingly strong performer. Even with the trash dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the screenplay she received, Michelle Borth did a surprisingly good performance and amazes me that an actress as good as she can get stuck in such a bad movie. She obviously accepted the payment, but it will not boost her career, I'm afraid.
