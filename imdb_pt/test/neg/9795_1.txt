Terrible! A friend of mine (who obviously thought I had an abysmal sense of humor) recommended this. <br /> <br /> It's coils. I almost hung up. It's just my anal desire not to leave the unfinished things that kept me from doing it. <br /> <br /> This was of course a British attempt to make a movie with a lot of also ran TV actors using some lame script from his business partner. I struggle to think of anything, even approaching the scarcity of this film. Less funny than global warming. <br /> <br /> I'm not usually so vehement, but I've watched it for over ten years and found that I lost an hour or more of my life being destructive. <BR> Puerile, less mess, tosh useless. <br /> <br /> I'd rather eat my feet than watch it again.
