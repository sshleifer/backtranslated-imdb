All this is show, it's the same plot. Kuszko (spelling?) Is in danger of failing in school, he must pass to become emperor. He needs to learn something, which he thinks is stupid, he then uses / learns more about it and realizes that he is not so stupid. Eezma, posing as a director, tries to turn Kuszko into some animal to stop him. Each episode. <br /> <br /> The jokes of the film are copied (Eezma's incredibly complicated plans, Kuszko constantly breaks the 4th wall, squirrels.) They should try to hire some writers. <br /> <br /> 2/10
