Kevin Spacey is undoubtedly one of the best actors of the 90s. After his performances in The Usual Suspect, Se7en and American Beauty, you expect more and more of him. That's why Ordinary Decent Criminal is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Michael Lynch is the most cunning criminal in Dublin who is never in a bad mood. His next robbery becomes an obsession when his partners begin to question Michael's ability to plan everything perfectly, though that's the only thing he does when he's not playing like a good father at home. <br /> <br /> I think it's partly my fault for not paying enough attention to the details of a thousand plot, which unfortunately prove to be the "essence" of the film. I gave the movie a chance, calling it a parody and ... well, parodies are always funny, no matter what they imitate or how they do it. So it was not after all a complete parody of purpose. It's just a different movie that desperately tries to be funny and fails. Unlike some of his "colleagues", the Decent Ordinary Criminal relies heavily on the development of history and logical continuity, forgetting what is the main reason, the viewer chose this type of film - to be to amuse This is definitely not entertainment. Includes one of the most ridiculous scenes ever - the introduction of Michael's TWO Wives. I do not know if it's some kind of stupid metaphor or strange and somber humor, but the girls are sisters. Remember, Spacey's character has kids. <br /> <br /> The Decent Ordinary Criminal is complex and confusing. You are not waiting for a funny scene. Instead, you carefully follow the dialogue because there is a great possibility of getting lost in the boring and pale universe that the movie has inhabited. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to Spacey. I wonder what conditions he was in, signing for that movie. It is not miscellaneous, but something much worse. An insult to his work at American Beauty, released a year before Ordinary Decent Criminal. The character Michael is eccentric and talkative. Spacey is almost pathetic at times. The only cure for this is to think of Lester Burnham and Roger Kint. Writer, Gerrard Stembridge should definitely reconsider his writing skills on screen and be more objective this time around. Because, the dialogue is very weak and the scenes are often meaningless. And we're still talking about a comedy. <br /> <br /> The Decent Ordinary Criminal is a very bad crime comedy that does not deserve your attention.
