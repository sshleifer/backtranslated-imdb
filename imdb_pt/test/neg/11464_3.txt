This movie is called "Solomon Kane". What is not. The main character wears a hat, but that's all he has in common with Robert Howard's character, Solomon Kane, known since the first pulp magazines and many publications since those days. It's a fantasy film, not so bad and could easily have gone through a good review - had it not been called Solomon Kane. The hero is a newly invented character who is definitely not SK. The story is not Robert Howard, neither. As a fantasy film, it's more of a film following the traditions of the genre: simple story, poor CGI, poor actors, bad direction. However, it can be fun, you know: 'the cheaper they are, the better they are'. But as your name is Solomon Kane, I can not accept it. Imagine a movie of The Lord of the Rings with a hero Bilbo who fights against the black sorcerer Saugalf with the help of his dwarf friend Aragorn and the beautiful heroine Shadowfax. And with a final fight, where the three use a magic ring to kill the evil sorcerer who has turned into the Gondorian dragon. Imagine that. This is exactly what this movie did with the character of Robert Howard, Solomon Kane. <br /> <br /> I would give a 4 star review if it was just another horror movie, but as it's called Solomon Kane, I can only rate 3 stars.
