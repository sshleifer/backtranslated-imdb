It's strange what fate does to some people. While looking at the discounted box at a DVD retailer, I came across a copy of Deadly Instincts. Being a collector of any movie that is science fiction, horror or featuring alien monsters, I decided to buy it (not to mention the fact that it cost five dollars a bargain, believe me). After visualizing it, I came to the opinion that it was nothing special. But after doing some research on the Internet, I discovered that the movie was actually called Breeders & was a remake of Tim Kincaid's horror film that threatened video stores in the mid-1980s. I've seen it. My appreciation of "Deadly Instincts" grew after this discovery. <br /> <br /> A meteorite falls on the lawn next to a private girls' college. The only teacher there, Ashley (played by Todd Jensen, is the guy who became a cyborg in the cult movie CYBORG COP four years earlier), realizes that some of the students are starting to disappear as they stumble across a black man. red-haired woman with a scarred face and wearing a kinky leather outfit. His investigation reveals that an alien creature had taken a ride on the meteorite and had come to Earth to breed using the local women. Along with a local detective who believes he is responsible for the disappearances, Ashley tries to stop the monster. The original CREATORS, directed by Tim Kincaid (who would leave the genre to make gay porn), was a science fiction / horror film that was actually a covert soft-cult porn movie, designed to take skin movies to fans of the genre. It's, in my opinion, one of the worst films made in the 80's. Why anyone would want to redo this is a mystery. <br /> <br /> This remake is really a better effort than your low budget source. The film, which takes the basic concept of an alien monster trying to cross with human women, eliminates any pornographic element. In fact, the movie is really very tame. There are no sex scenes, no nudity (even during shower scene), swearing and violence are kept to a minimum and there is no gore (which can fool the gorehounds). This makes the remake a safe movie for the whole family, that is, if children are not frightened by alien monsters (which leads me to the M 15+ rating of the movie, which seems a little too much). <br /> <br /> <br /> Tameness of the matter aside, the film has some flaws. The script, although presenting some good characterizations, has several holes so large that you can knock down a meteor. <br /> <br /> What? Are you mad at me for it? Come on, this review needed a bad pun, so it will still be interesting. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the setup of the movie is a problem that the script did not solve ?? the film is set in Boston, but the buildings do not seem to belong to Boston. Something about the architecture is not right. Another thing is the school itself, with a fairly large building housing about twenty students (all female, of course) and having only one class? art. The only teacher there has a relationship with a student (and the janitor too!), Which somehow escapes the attention of the principal. Not to mention the cops, who are so one-dimensional (and stupid) that the real Boston cop would have a good argument if they ever decided to sue. Oh, what about the meteor? Well, the chance that a meteor sent from Saturn (check opening credits) to Earth without propulsion on board is astronomical. That does not include the chances that any meteor passenger will survive the landing. Todd Jensen gives a dependable performance as the heroic teacher, while the late Kadamba Simmons (who was murdered by his boyfriend shortly before the movie leaves) cuts a striking figure in that suit. leather, as well as proof that it can act. Visual effects are common, with credits due to filmmakers for bringing us a cool-looking monster.
