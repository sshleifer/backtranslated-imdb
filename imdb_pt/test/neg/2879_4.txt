I rented the video for "The Piano Teacher" without knowing anything about it other than what was written in the video box. I did this with some apprehension because films that win prizes at Cannes are usually very good or very bad. Unfortunately, this falls into the latter category. About a quarter of the way I found myself saying out loud, "This movie is boring." Halfway down, I was saying to myself, "Where did I see this before?" At the mark of the three rooms I had discovered this. <br /> <br /> Despite its literary origins, this film is essentially a remake of Robert Altman much earlier (1969), and rather, "That Cold Day in the Park." Although the details obviously are different and Altman's work was more plot driven and less character study, the two films are thematically identical. There is nothing "new" to be seen in this production. Every aspect of this has been done before: a character getting out of control with an increasingly self-destructive behavior ("Bad Lieutenant" by Abel Ferrara, 1992); a perverse and condemned "love", culminating in an operatic scene of death ("M. Butterfly" by David Cronenberg, 1993); extraordinarily brutal sex scenes ("Blue Velvet" by David Lynch, 1986); and so on. So I am confused by the fact that so many find the film "shocking", "destructive", etc. This highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers uncomfortable, and clearly had success with some movies. . However, I broadly attribute such a reaction to the lack of movie viewing experience. Watch enough movies and you will actually have eventually seen everything. And while it's true that I saw the 'R-rated' version purged, I doubt the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of 'The Piano Teacher'. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is not without merit. There are some very good camera jobs and the lighting is great. Isabelle Huppert's meritorious performance also helps prevent it from being a waste of time. This is the first of the Haneke films I've seen, and if I were to see more I would expect that I would have the same opinion of him as I do of Ferrara: an interesting director, but not nearly the genius that others make him be. Rating: 4/10.
