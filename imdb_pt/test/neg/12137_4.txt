It is a story of a neurotic woman struggling with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement, the romantic nature of a night, and uncertainty and uncertainty. traps of true love. <br /> <br /> Many of the motifs of the story are reminiscent of other recent KST films (for example, the English Patient), but have far less appeal. <br /> <br /> After the first half-hour. <br /> <br /> I started checking my watch, wondering if I would get home when I got Leno on the tv. <br /> <br /> I passed "Gladiator" to see this!?!
