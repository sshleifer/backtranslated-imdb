I really tried to give this movie a chance, but when I realized that most of the movie was being told by a bunch of boring employees walking around and talking on phones, I knew it was over. Much of this movie also looked like filming. That's just lame. <br /> <br /> The person in the camera kept making these short, fast zooms for NO REASON! It bothered me a lot, but I was wondering why the hell they thought it was a good idea. It adds nothing to a static scene of two people talking. This is not NYPD Blue or some police show or something. <br /> <br /> How can they not have realized that telling this kind of story from conversations of people in conference rooms and what not, is boring? !! Did not they watch this mess? Anyway, this was just a very annoying movie and makes it seem like whoever did this does not understand the good narrative on film. Images of Darn ... this is wrong.
