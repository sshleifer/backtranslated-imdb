You're going to have to take a deep breath ... <br /> <br /> Terrible special effects that tried to go beyond budget limitations. Sassy and shameless plagiarism from other science fiction films (like Pitch Black). Terrible acting. Endless slow-motion scenes of characters walking aimlessly through sand dunes. Sinuous dialogues that do nothing to deepen the story. Characters wearing turtle neck sweaters on a desert planet with two suns. A "cargo" ship with a team of armed camouflage soldiers (why exactly would you need a forest camouflage in space?). Some of the worst cast choices in the history of budget-driven filmmaking - a steroid-filled "captain" who comes across more like a muscular beach athlete than a trusted commander, and a "convict" who looks and acts as dangerous as A rabbit. 70 minutes in length, 35 of which could have been trimmed if the director had any concept of "time compression through editing" ... <br /> <br /> I will not continue. Suffice it to say that while some components of this horrible movie may (and should) be forgiven because of its low budget; bad design, laughable plot holes and snore-inducing script are unforgivable on any budget. The end result is a tedious and monotonous waste of time. Sorry, I hate being so hard on an amateur movie, but you have no excuse to do that kind of work.
