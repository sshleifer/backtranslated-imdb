I'm not even willing to vote for a single star for this crap, but the IMDb does not have zero as a rating option ... the worst movie I've ever seen .. Movie Story 1. Predator Ship Hangs On Earth 2. An alien and some guys are released and start killing humans. 3. A predator comes to Earth and it begins to kill aliens and humans. 4. Then a human jet drops a bomb and kills humans, aliens and predators. 5. Some humans find the canon of the predator's shoulder. 6. Final Directors should consider reimbursement of money to viewers. If you still want to watch this movie, download it from some torrent site and say thank you for saving me money .. the whole movie was filmed in some dark corner of the earth, you see only dark shadows, even in action scenes .. lots violence ... I did not expect this from a fox movie
