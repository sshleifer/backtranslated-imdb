This film examines the now infamous Wannsee Conference, where leading Nazis met to discuss the organization and implementation of the "Final Solution". First, I was impressed to see Kenneth Branagh play a Nazi. With his blond hair combed back, he certainly looked like the paper, but he did not act well. There was no threat and cruelty and in the end he came out looking like a smiling cheerleader keeping the meeting going. The real Heydrich would not have let the conference get out of control like it did in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best performance of all was undoubtedly Colin Firth, who played Dr. William Stuckart, the man who wrote the film in 1935. Nuremberg race laws and that gave "legal respectability" to everything the Nazis did. Firth's performance was impressive, the main vocal opponent Heydrich was proposing. The best part of all was when he was verbally wearing one of the Nazi bandits. The bandit murmured "I'll remember you" and Firth replies "you should! I'm very well known !!" The film is historically accurate, but let's reduce it to what it really is - 90 minutes of a group of men around a table arguing, yelling and bragging. There is no excitement, no real conflicts (except the brief argument). It's only 90 minutes of conversation! Same room, same table, same people. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the DVD is worth the money. I at least felt little changed.
