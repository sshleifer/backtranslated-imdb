I saw this movie last night at the Berlinale as part of the competition. It was announced as "world premiere" of the film by the host (although it seems that people here have seen it previously). I have to say, I still do not know what to do with the movie. I'm not familiar with the book, I bought the ticket just two hours earlier and only had limited knowledge of the plot. Not enough, as it seems, because I had trouble getting into the movie. The movie is sometimes narrated by Jones' character, but somehow that perspective did not fit me. And I really can not tell if some of the film's laughter was calculated or not. The cuts were abrupt and disturbing, the scenes somehow glued together and the narrative did not always make sense immediately (even leaving out the supernatural parts) - the actors were really good, but they could not save the movie in any way. It was fun, but sometimes just in the sense that I sat there thinking about technical details of making movies and what went wrong with that one. I still do not know what kind of mood the director intended the film to have. It was a strange mixture of light, dark and supernatural. Unfortunately, that did not appeal to me and I watched it with a technical look. But thinking about what's wrong with a movie while watching is the best sign that a movie has failed in any way. I would definitely have expected something more with these actors involved ... too bad!
