As an indie filmmaker, I try to at least make a decent movie. This piece of ____ went beyond the low budget. It was shot on video and not 24P mini-DV at least. The appearance of this was just baaaad. I met the director a few years ago at the ShowBiz Expo in Los Angeles and he was talking about that book, filming for the dolls he was riding. I thought this little video would be something, but I think it was wrong. He could have increased his value a little by recording a 16mm film instead of that horrible video. The plot was stupid, just like the acting and all the fake green screen and sound and the whole nine meters. I had a choice tonight to rent any movie and made the wrong choice. Damn it!!!!! I bought JoyRide, which was a hell of a movie. Maybe the director should read real movie books about movie making and not try to cut costs by trying to make a low-budget movie. Maybe he should learn from the masters they created: The Night of the Living Dead and The Evil Dead and Chain saw the massacre. Just to name a few of the big low budget hits. This is a video that should have been dead. I can not call this movie because he did not use film.
