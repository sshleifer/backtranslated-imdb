We sit in this movie wondering why it's this or that scene in the movie, what does this have to do with the plot? We hoped that in the end everything would be a little clearer. It was not meant to be. <br /> <br /> I think the director in a pike attack threw the script into the air, and then some minor (and vengeful) underlings reassembled it randomly, regardless of the scene being filmed. (possibly with scissors and glue). <br /> <br /> The motives of the film include: Bad communism? Bad Nihilism? Bad parenting bad? Is Troy a bad thing? Bad TV? Poor coherent script? Is deconstruction good? It is not clear. <br /> <br /> Finally, no German water taxi would have a ladder that would allow passengers to fall into the water. The abundant amount of "achtung" signs everywhere is a testament to this fact.
