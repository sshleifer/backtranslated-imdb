All in all, this is a kid's movie. We saw it tonight and my son loved it. At one point, my son's excitement was so great that sitting down was impossible. However, I am a big fan of A.A. Milne's books are very subtle and hide an ironic intelligence behind the childish quality of their main characters. This movie was not subtle. It seems a shame that Disney can not see the benefit of making movies from more stories contained in these pages, although, perhaps, it is not allowed to use them. I found myself wishing the theater was repeating "Winnie-the-Pooh and Tigger too." The voices of the characters were very good. I was just really annoyed by Kanga. The music, however, was twice as loud as the dialogue, and incongruous with the film. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it was a little boring and militant. Overall, I was disappointed, but I would go again just to see the same emotion on my son's face. <br /> I liked Lumpy's laughter ....
