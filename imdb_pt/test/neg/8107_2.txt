I was not sure where this was going until the end. when it was discovered that all this was a liberal conspiracy to deliver the world to the weak Europeans and the United Nations. What a load of right crud! By the way, the fact that Canada joined the US did not have much to do with the plot and the idea was never developed. The only point of this seems to be that he made the main character eligible to run for president (but they could have made him American and discharged). In any case, this was a bull charge and not worth your time. If you do not want to see this kind of thing well, check out the brilliant BBC political thriller "State of Play."
