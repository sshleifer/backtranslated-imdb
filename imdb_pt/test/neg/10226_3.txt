Nothing more than a football imitation of The Mighty Ducks, this movie proved to be annoying in most respects. This was one of those times when parents ask you to take your younger siblings so they do not have to deal with them for a few hours. To say the least, my younger sisters liked it, but it proved to be much like the Mighty Ducks far superior. Well, at least Olivia d'Abo was excited and Steve Guttenberg still had a job right now.
