After which, the complimented update goes and shoots through the head. Quite appropriate, considering the sorry state of this film, a continuation of a film that clearly did not need one. <br /> <br /> What really irritates Robocop 2 is that the creators obviously did not understand why the original was so good in the first place. Robocop (7) was a witty and vibrant satire of bad action movies. Robocop 2 is just a bad action movie. Fine in dialogue, particularly for the tedious end of the shooting, attracts little interest and has none of the energy or spirit of the original. The fake ads, now a little tasteless ("Warning: continued use will cause skin cancer") seem to be there only as a belated reflection. And calling a new drug designer "Nuke" is nowhere near as subtle or as funny as the original family's board game, "Nuke's in!" <br /> <br /> The stop-motion animation ?? the weaker element of the original? is used more extensively, while this humorless sequel does not include a sequence of credits, which makes it look even cheaper and hurried. Oh, no humor? You can say. But what about the funny mayor, or how Robo is reprogrammed to spit platitudes? Yes, these are attempts to lighten, just as Robo is squeezing himself with a screwdriver ("we are only humans") by the end of the film, but none of them can induce laughter. Like the rest of the film, they are serious and idiotic attempts at entertainment. <br /> <br /> The third and final film in the series (imaginatively titled Robocop 3; 5) saw Peter Weller leave, to be replaced by Robert John Burke, who does well in a less demanding role. With attenuated language and violence, it was an obvious appeal to the children's market, a closely-knit Robo action figure. With his much-exaggerated social conscience, and Robocop's newly discovered arm attachments and the jetpack getting very foolish, the final film was never meant to be a masterpiece. However, Fred Dekker's fluid direction and fast pace make this vision enjoyable and disposable. <br /> <br /> Robocop, then, is the movie itself. Robocop 3 is the sequel you could watch if there was nothing better. Which leaves the second movie hanging in the middle, an undefined corner of a photo. A franchise vehicle that has nothing to say except for the pound signs they called. Irvin Kershner is not Paul Verhoven, just as comic book writer Frank Miller and partner Walon Green are not the writers Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner were. A tragic waste of a good concept, albeit limited. 4/10
