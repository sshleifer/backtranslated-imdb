This is a candidate for the worst movies I've ever seen. He wanted to be as shocking as "Silence of the Lambs," but he has neither the style nor the wit of the above mentioned. The makeup is great, the acting is very good, but the story seems to drag on for years and the murders are so terrible they are more upsetting than fun.
