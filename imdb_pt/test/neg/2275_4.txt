Okay, if you discount the value of the production, the ugly clothes and the big hair, that adaptation is still much lower than the 90's version. First Ann Firbank (playing Anne Elliot) is literally ten years older to play this role and his performance leaves much to be desired. Amanda Root (playing the same role in the 90's version) can express more in her big brown eyes than Firbank can with her entire face in a four hour production. Anne is transformed into a boring, boring and boring character (and what about the scene during the "long walk" where she stops to do poetry?). Henrietta and Louisa were so similar that the only time I could distinguish them was when they were close to each other (Henrietta was taller). And Louisa! There has never been a more unpleasant character! It was ridiculous to think Wentworth should be interested in her. She should be tall witty and pretty and charming, not stupid and silly with her ridiculous laugh that's like nails on a blackboard. As she begins to sing, to Lyme, to Lyme, to Lyme, I began to scream, shut up, shut up, shut up! The best part of the movie was when Louisa fell all three feet on cobb because I knew I would not have to see her in the movie anymore. Speaking of the fall in the cobb scene; was the scene of the misrepresented, misdirected and edited mose of the entire film. How does a person fall three feet down, land on their feet and still remain unconscious? <br /> <br /> In positive size, Elizabeth's character was much closer to the book than in the 1990s. They also put many other scenes with Anne and Frederick at the end. I admit, I bought this movie, even knowing how sub-par it was, but I'm a huge Austen fan, so I'll buy any movie adapted from one of his novels. Watch this play if you are morbidly curious, or enjoy the 90's version even more. <br /> <br /> The end result is that this version may follow the lyrics of the novel, but the 90's version follows the spirit.
