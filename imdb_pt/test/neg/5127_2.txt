Flashdance is one of those horrible, stupid movies that you really like, just because they're so bad. I just watched on TV and my friend and I were amazed at how dopey it was. It's true that Don Simpson and the other producers have come up with the idea of ​​a cheap movie, with lots of hard-bodied bodies to help sell a pop soundtrack (admirably catchy), so Flashdance is a weird kind of pioneer: the first MTV movie. Adrian Lyne started in advertising and shows why Flashdance is almost a commercial to itself. You've already decided to watch it, but the film has a strange and panicked undercurrent, as if you were afraid that you could change your mind at any time. He keeps selling to you over and over again, using a stylish editing of commercial style and bright close-ups of bustling breasts. The story is very thin (I honestly can not think of another movie I've seen with less plot) and this never makes much sense, but it's a well-planned and calculating film, so it seems consistent. People say it's dated, but Flashdance has always been crap. In the early 1980s, viewers knew it was just an extravagant thing, T & A, but it worked silly. There is a romance for the crowd of boys and piles of oily and wriggling female bodies squirming for the encounters, all set for a pumping puck. How could this fail? This helps that dialogue is useless so you can pick up a popcorn without losing anything important and if that kind of thing is not your cup of tea, you can always laugh at the 'interpretive dance' on display. The scene in which a Jennifer Beals surrogate convulses / 'dance' onstage in front of a TV with a fan and a face full of white clown makeup left us in stitches. A genuine guilty pleasure.
