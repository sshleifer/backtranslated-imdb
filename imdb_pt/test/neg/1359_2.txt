For those of you who have never heard of the movie so far (of whom I presume there are many lucky people who have not), I will summarize it for you. Ryan Gosling plays the titular character of Leland, who also serves as the narrator of the film (Kevin Spacey at American Beauty, but without the intelligent observations about life). Leland goes to jail for stabbing a retarded boy to death, and the movie tries to find out why he did it. He seems to be a good kid (if not mentally absent), and is portrayed by Gosling with a complete lack of violence, anger or agenda (and if you're waiting for him to reveal his sinister side later in the movie, dont miss his time - it's not that kind of movie). Once in juvenile prison, Leland attends classes taught by Pearl Madison, expertly portrayed by Don Cheadle (who is incapable of anything but quality, even when in bad movies). Pearl tries to unravel the mystery of Leland in an attempt to figure out how such a boy could do such a thing, and so he could write a book about it later (besides being a juvenile prison teacher, Pearl is also an aspiring writer). The relationship between Leland and Pearl is the narrative behind the film, as his lectures reveal Leland's past to the public. However, calling it a central focus would imply that this winding movie had one. Not that. The United States of Leland has an impressive cast, which seems to be to the detriment of the film. It seems that writer / director Matthew Ryan Hodge (do not worry that you've never heard of him, he's never done anything) had to give ALL the characters an arc of personal history and a personality flaw so the actors could touch them . Most of these traits and stories are clich√©s, and most are underdeveloped and unresolved. <br /> <br /> I'll try to break them here: Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson are the parents of the retarded and dead boy (I love how the movie kept calling the kid a "retarded", never "mentally disabled." part made me laugh inside), they apparently have a cold relationship because all suburban weddings in contemporary cinema should be cold. Her other two children are Michelle Williams, who is apparently an aspiring actress about to go to college, and Jena Malone, who plays the same problematic teenage archetypical she always plays, this time with a heroin addiction. Malone was also Leland's girlfriend, who gives him the link to his victim. Williams' boyfriend, who was orphaned and came to live with his family, and is a baseball player wanting to go to the same college as his girlfriend, is played by Chris Klein. He ends up doing more with his character than any other player, managing to steal the movie sometimes. Lena Olin is Leland's mother, who seems to be perpetually sad for some reason. Kevin Spacey (also executive producer) is the cold and absent father of Leland, who is a famous novelist. Eventually, Sherilyn Fenn will appear to put a wrinkle in Leland's story - if you care at that point. Oh yeah, and there's an ex-boyfriend drug dealer, a couple of juvees and a co-worker of Pearl with whom he has a case on his long-distance girlfriend (played by Kerry Washington). <br /> Sorry if all this synopsis and character discrimination took so long. If it sounded pointless and annoying, then you just experienced a bit of what I did during the 108 minutes I spent watching the movie. But the cast of undisciplined support for overly forged cliches is the least of the crimes in this film. The biggest of them is that the whole exercise is totally useless. We are not given a fascinating insight into a disturbed mind, we are not given an effective explanation, not much is given to us. Given that it was a drug, I go ahead and ruin the ending for you, so you never have to see: Leland stabbed the retard because everything Leland could see in the world was sad, and he wanted to save Corky (or whatever. name of the victim) the sadness in his eyes. It's like the world's worst emo band made an album, and it titled "The world is sad, so I killed a retard." Oh, and Leland dies at the end, in such an unbelievable sequence of unbelievable coincidences that it would have ruined the movie if the movie was not bad enough. Of course he dies in the end, because that made the film so deep. <br /> <br /> I'm giving the movie 2 stars, because the actors themselves did a great job with the garbage they received. The scenes with Cheadle and Gosling together were interesting on some levels. But to paraphrase the film itself, you have to believe that movies are more than the sum of their parts, boy.
