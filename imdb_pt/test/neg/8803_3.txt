This movie was not the best ... but it had some good actors in it. Isiaiah Washington was very good as a homeless man, Guy Torrey was good as his disabled brother, Ice-T was as humorous as the landlord and surprisingly ... actress Tami Roman was good as the judge of the film. I did not even know it was her and I'm a fan of the real world. She was totally believable. I hope this film does not disturb the development of these actors. I know that Isiaiah left this movie behind with the success of Gray's Anatomy, Ice-T with her regular role on NYPD Special Unit and Tami Roman got a recurring role in Sex Love and Secrets (UPN's new novel). I wish the same for the other actors because a bad movie is NOT a bad actor.
