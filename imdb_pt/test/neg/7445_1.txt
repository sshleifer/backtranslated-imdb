I really do not understand who this movie is. Just for the absurdity of that, not to mention the ridiculously bad acting, the tacky dialogue and the fact that the villain is a child, I would say that this movie should be a children's movie ... but I think there may be more swear words than Pulp Fiction, not to mention constant references to drugs and general clutter and killing-so demographic are trying to tickle? This movie is very schizophrenic, like trying to combine country music with heavy metal in the end, no one will like it because it is a bloody paradox. I would recommend this movie because it is so funny (in a bad way) except that the actors are so patently unbearable that I do not like to suggest otherwise. <br /> <br /> I'm serious when I say I could not watch more than 15 minutes of it. Terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiible
