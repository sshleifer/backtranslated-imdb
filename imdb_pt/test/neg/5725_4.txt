This film was released shortly after the films of Conan, a sort of female Conan, Red Sonja played by Sylvester Stallones' ex-wife Brigitte Nielsen. She's not a good actress, unfortunately, as proven in Rocky IV and Cobra. The whole movie seems cheap, but strangely Arnold Swarzenegger appears in this movie, but not as Conan, although he does seem, act and fight like Conan with the two Conan films, I do not know what it is. Anyway, it shows up only every twenty minutes and does not stay for long. Maybe Arnold filmed this in his free time filming Conan the Destroyer, or something? Anyway, the movie is a slow and tedious way of an action movie, skip it and watch Conan the Barbarian.
