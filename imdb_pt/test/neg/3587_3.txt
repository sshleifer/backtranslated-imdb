We have already seen a story like this: a wife in marital problems (played by Nastassja Kinski) engages in sex with a stranger (William Baldwin) and then wants to return to life with husband and girl. When she returns home, she discovers that her husband has finally found a job. Everything looks bright. However, Kinski discovers that the new boss of her husband is actually the stranger who still shows an interest in her and seems to do anything to get what she wants. What to do? Do not say anything? <br /> <br /> I did not really like the movie. Although not just bad, he clearly lacked "something." Maybe he should have focused more on what's going on inside Kinski's head. Nothing to say about the actors themselves (I think Baldwin was a good choice for the role of the obsessed boss), but the characters looked a bit stereotypical, acting just as you would see characters playing in their everyday TV movies. Finally, the ending totally ruined what could have been an interesting plot. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the film tried to look cool, it had a bit of unstable camerawork here and there, some photos, quick cuts and glamor. , but in the end I think it fits much better in Spelling productions. The same goes for music. Otherwise it does not look too bad. <br /> <br /> Some might like this, but it was definitely not my cup of tea. To be fair, I do not usually watch this type of thrillers very much. This one seemed too long, even if it was only an hour and a half, I think it might have worked better as an episode of an hour in some TV series. There was absolutely no need for some of the scenes, especially the shower scene. <br /> <br /> My advice: try before you buy!
