Although I have seen Sal√≤, I do not know if the excrement is sour. If this happens, this "movie" is exactly titled. Both bulky, so little substance, this is the celluloid equivalent of celery - only that does not clean the palate. It leaves the taste of time wasted in the mouth of the mind, and if I could vomit this film and get that extension / expense again I would. The arrest was more exciting. The director should be forced to wear a donkey cap, and the Spirit of Ed Wood Jr. could not save this semiprofessional projection from some failure. A waste of time, a waste of mind. ** Do not be fooled by Dominique Swain: good-looking than she was in Lolita's remake, less tragic and smarter than Sue Lyon, though by no means any better. However, once previously competent the screw does not make it a skilled person. You need crafts for that, no crap, that's what this movie is. The reels belong to the ladies' room, until the pipes burst, while director / director Christina Wayne should do 5 to 10 in the study room. Watch anything else and pass this class, by (bye), forever!
