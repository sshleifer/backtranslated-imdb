Wow this is really stereotyped, terrible rubbish. I'm sorry for anyone who may have wasted their money to see this. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I did not laugh once throughout this movie, I just can not believe they would make such a terrible movie. Now I'll be more cautious when I watch late-night movies. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I'm not saying it's the worst movie out there (although it may be), but I do not think I've seen something so stupid and bland in my life. makes the Scary Movie series look smart. <br /> <br /> 1/10 I'd give a 0 if they let me
