The brief existence of The Sex Pistols and the production of this film after the controversial and innovative break-up of the English punk band took place before I was born. However, I began to listen to his only album, "Never Mind the B * and% @ # & s, Here's the Sex Pistols", in 2003 when I was a teenager, and quickly became a big fan. I did not see "The Great Rock'n'Roll Swindle" until 2006, but I saw it a few times that year, and thought it was very good (certainly not great but very good), even though I could only remember bits and did not see how it all connected. Seeing for the third time, almost three years after the second, I did not care much about it. I'm not even sure what I found so good about most of it in the first place (I do not remember now). <br /> <br /> This film is a mockumentary, in which the businessman Malcolm McLaren of Sex Pistols tells his side of the history of the band and its members; guitarist Steve Jones, credited here as "The Crook"; drummer Paul Cook, credited as "The Tea-Maker"; bassist Sid Vicious, credited as "The Gimmick"; and John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten) credited as "The Contributor". McLaren claims that he created the band (and even the punk rock genre) as a scam to make money. He tells much of the story to Helen Wellington-Lloyd (also known as Helen of Troy), in several places where they go together. It's basically a talking McLaren miscellany, Pistols songs, live band scenes, fictional (often silly, weird) scenes, various cartoon sequences, etc., all put together in a movie, to tell the side of the story of the manager of Pistols. In a bizarre way! <br /> <br /> It is proven that McLaren is a liar, I know that many have already pointed this out, including the band members themselves. He was not the driving force of the band, he did not create them (nor invented punk rock, and The Sex Pistols was not even the first punk band, although they were unique). The band members were the only ones who made the band what it was. "The Filth and the Fury", a much more convincing film about Julien Temple's band that made this film, is told from the band members' point of view, which contradict McLaren's allegations. However, the dishonesty of "The Great Rock" and Roll Swindle "is not my biggest problem. If it was really fun (which I used to think it was to some extent), I would be able to ignore it, as I obviously used to be able to do. During my third performance, in addition to the Sex Pistols songs, some live scenes, and at least a slightly fun cartoon sequence, it was pretty boring! I found the song "Who Killed Bambi" slightly fun at first, but it got tiresome very quickly. <br /> <br /> Is it a mockumentary that is worth watching for the Sex Pistols fans? It seems like a good number of fans would say that it is not to learn about the true history of the punk band from the 70s, but innovative, but for entertainment. That was my opinion on "The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle". After the first time I watched, I could not remember anything McLaren said, and when I saw the second time, I realized what the Pistols manager used to suggest this movie, but I could barely remember anything. I heard you say it! Obviously, other aspects of the film were what I found impressive. Now, after my third performance, I can definitely remember some of the things McLaren says, but it was still not 100% clear. Like most of the film, I find their words not so memorable, probably because of the way they are presented. If you're a fan of Pistols, I think it would not hurt to try "Swindle", but for me, for the most part, it's just an incoherent, boring mess that tries to be funny, but fails.
