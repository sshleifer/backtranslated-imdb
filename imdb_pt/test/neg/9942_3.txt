This is one of many US attempts to redo an old classic British TV show, which is more famous than this one. From what I see, neither of you mentioned or even acknowledged that you knew there was a TV from the '50s and' 60s called "Secret Agent Man". The original secret agent starred the great Patrick McGoohan (the Prisoner, Braveheart, Ice Station Zebra, The Phantom, etc.) a man who was called to be the first James Bond, but he refused because McGoohan was a very devout man and he considered the James Bond bed and violent ways of being against his values. <br /> This show was done in black and white, and it's a shame for those who have not seen it, you're missing out a lot. The character McGoohan played in "Secret Agent Man" was called Drake, and after he finished with this show, he went on to make the very popular, though sometimes bizarre, and controversial TV series called "The Prisoner." The character he played in "The Prisoner" was that of an agent whose identity is not revealed, is kidnapped and transported to an island where he does not know where he is or who was responsible for his abduction. What he knows is that his captors want to know the reasons behind his resignation from the British Secret Service, and on this island the population has no names but they are referred to by numbers and the character Patricks gets a number that is "6" Was arguing that his Prisoner character was actually the same character he played in Secret Agent Man, but McGoohan himself contested that. <br /> <br /> There is an unmistakable famous theme song that the original Secret Agent Man has generated. . It was written by Johnny Rivers, famous pop musician of the 50s and 60s, and from what I read, some of you really think the song comes from this version of the show. You are very wrong about this. It was from Johnny and comes from the original TV series, so let me help clarify the facts. For those of you who complained about the name of the show being stupid, well in England, it was actually called "Danger Man" and in the US was renamed "Secret Agent Man" by a supposedly stupid name that the show did well enough. to air for the first time. <br /> <br /> Granted this current show has little to do with the original, no such main character named Drake on this one, and I think they did their best to make this show their version of "Secret Agent Man ". But he uses the remade version of the original theme song, so he says that this show was actually meant to be a remade, albeit inferior, version of the original series.
