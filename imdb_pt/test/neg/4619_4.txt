This is not great movie. The film is clichéd and in many places is a copy of the original Carrie. The parallels with the original film are impressive, but with an increased improbability over the telekinetic powers being congenital. <br /> <br /> I can not say I did not like the movie because at least it's been a couple of hours ... but these were passed on as if reading a fussy book on a long train ride. That book would not be a great literature, but it would absorb one for a time and be forgotten soon after, as it would mingle with the numerous other mounted cliché books. Likewise, the movie was good while it lasted, but it is perhaps forgettable. At least I think it is. I can not remember much about it now !!
