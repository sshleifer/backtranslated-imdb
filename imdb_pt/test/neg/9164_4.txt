As cute and adorable as they are, the story of three singing squirrels does not seem to have enough flesh to sustain her for an hour and a half. I thought the first half hour or so of this movie was worth watching. It was fun, had a few laughs, was full of energy. So, somehow, you just missed it. I would not even say it disappeared, because it seemed quite abrupt to me. The fun was gone; the laughter disappeared. My daughter noticed that too. She's 4 years old - she laughed loudly several times in that first part of the movie, then her laughter stopped. Maybe it took a very serious tone - the evil movie producer working the squirrels to the death. Something happened, anyway, and it was not for the better. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is trying to tell the story of how the squirrels (Alvin, Simon and Theodore) started. Everyone knows the Christmas song. Here we discover how they met Dave and started. The film is updated to the present day, although its actual origin is noted by Dave's address in 1958, which was the year that animated corner rodents were first created. Jason Lee did a great job, since Dave and the squirrel voices were also very good. David Cross as evil Ian irritated me to be blunt, and I could not figure out the point of Claire's character, played by Cameron Richardson. She added little to the film. It's a movie you can watch with kids - it's probably a movie you just want to watch with kids, actually. You get a 4/10 of me.
