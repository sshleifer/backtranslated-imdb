Steven Segal's film career is a tribute to horrible cinema. I have been tragically bored with each one of them so I realized they were even more unrealistic than those of Jean Claude VanDamme. Has anyone else noticed that he is never hit?! I mean, give me something to cheer on ... a hard battle with a bad guy that's scary. TWENTY YEARS and he's still filming the same fight scenes. The fight scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero can not act. The boring choreography of a Segal movie puts his painful lack of skill into acutely relieved. Even worse, he's out of shape. Just what we need, a tough fat man THINK he's a man of leadership. There is not a shred of cinematic redeeming value in every ninety-minute movie. DO NOT watch unless you feel like throwing away an hour and a half of your life.
