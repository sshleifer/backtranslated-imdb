As an old movie fan, I had heard a lot about the controversial film CALIGULA ambiguously rated as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies of others. I decided to see him across the uncut version to evaluate him alone in hopes of finding something positive that would do justice to the many accusations regarding the film. I sat in my chair one autumn night and began to watch. The initial quotation from the New Testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in me ... why imply a sentence of the Gospel of Mark in the movie about pagan Rome? But the prelude to the pastoral scene with a young semi-married couple (Caligula and Drusila) running desperately through the meadows seemed quite sentimental. The music that sounded memorable while the credits also provoked me in the positive direction. However, the negative feelings came to me very soon, particularly with the death of Tiberius. The cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated. However, it was not so horrible for the middle. During the second half of the movie, I felt as if I had not seen any historical epic but an extremely disgusting pornography. In the end, I said to myself, "This is one of the movies that you can really hate" ... I'm aware that a movie may be controversial, but I never expected CALIGULA to go so far as to remove all limits of taste. I hate this movie because of many reasons, but particularly one. <br /> <br /> CALIGULA does not serve a purpose for an old epic (which he claims to be), but Bob Guccione, the director and founder of Penthouse. pornographic magazine, aims to combine cinematographic art with pornography. This is, I think, the most serious subject from which the film can be accused. Cinema is an art that must be reigned by taste, by message, by some sense of epic grandeur, while this film kills all the limits of good taste. CALIGULA shows the most bestial side of the human being in the most perverse and decadent way. Some scenes are so disgusting that I do not think there are people whose psyches will not be affected by them. Some say that Rome under Caligula's reign was so brutal. Yes it's true. Corruption flourished at that time, several sexual deviations were preferable to Roman citizens. However, I do not think it is right to approach such deviations so strictly and make them an emphasis on an ancient epic. I believe this proves the bizarre psyche of the producers and their strange tendencies ... <br /> <br /> HUGE HISTORICAL ERRORS: Gore Vidal's script is notorious for inaccuracies. It is notable, for example, with the figure of Proculus (Donato Placido), a historical Roman senator. However, the film shows him as a simple soldier in whom Caligula forces his most decadent forms of torture and rape. In addition, Livia was not the wife of Proculus raped by Caesar at his marriage. What is behind changing the stories of historical characters in stories full of unbelievable vulgarity and vulgarity? Another example of historical farce is the figure of Caesonia portrayed by Helen Mirren. She is presented as Caligula's wife along with Drusilla, her sister. In fact, Caligula married Caesonia long after her sister's death. Sexual abuse in his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical basis. I also hated the moment with the killing machine - a pure imagination of the director who has nothing to do with historical facts. <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL ASPECT AND BROWN: From the technical point of view, the film is nothing special. Cinematography can not boast of being exceptionally good and the sets, along with costumes, are also nothing exceptional. However, the only strong point of the film are the performances, particularly that of Malcolm McDowall as Caligula. He does a perfect job in the lead role portraying the madness and cruelty of the emperor. McDowall increases the value of the movie. If everything bothers you at CALIGULA, you can at least admire its performance. I also liked Helen Mirren as Caesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla (however, the film is based on a Suetonius gossip that Caligula made love to her sister). Sir John Gielgud as Nerva and Peter O'Toole as the old Tiberius are also memorable. O'Toole makes his best play in the sequence of the Grotto of Capri, depicting the decadence and exhaustion of the ancient emperor. Yes, I admit that the only thing I like about CALIGULA are the performances. So I do not rate the film 1/10. <br /> <br /> LAME CONTINUITY: The film's historical inaccuracy also occurs in pairs with little continuity. Let's look only at the beginning: Caligula arrives at the Grotto of Capri, where he sees the terrible pleasures of old Tiberius. Then, after about 15 minutes, the action moves to Rome, where a black bird near the bed of Drusilla and Caligula is a bad omen. And immediately the characters are back in Capri, where Nerva (John Gielgud) is dying ...? <br /> <br /> On the whole, I would not recommend seeing CALIGULA for anyone. If you want to know the story, read the wonderful novel by Robert Graves, I, CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD, or watch Herbert Wise's miniseries with the magnificent performance of Derek Jacobi. CALIGULA is a sick film whose most serious crime is the destruction of art. It is, for the most part, a porn movie that should never be called an epic. <br /> <br /> There are films that are truly artistic and sharpen people's taste for beauty, <br /> <br /> they are movies that are average entertainment; but they have something to offer, there are movies that show extreme violence; but they still convey some morals, there are, however, films that show disease and decay by themselves and consequently harm the minds of people, CALIGULA unfortunately belongs to the later group
