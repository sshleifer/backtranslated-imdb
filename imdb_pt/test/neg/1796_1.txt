After completing the lackluster romance Heart of Darkness, I went to watch the movie, which was a complete and utter disappointment. At first, I hoped the film would help put together the puzzle of a book. However, although I read the novel, the film still did not make any sense, so I can not imagine how it would have been lost if I'd skipped the book altogether. It seemed writers chose their favorite parts and put them in the film, leaving out anything that could help viewers understand the meaningless plot. This hideous movie made no sense, and I would strongly recommend that he not be seen, for he will do nothing more than leave him completely baffled and perplexed.
