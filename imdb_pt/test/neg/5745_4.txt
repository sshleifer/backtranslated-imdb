Slayer is an irrational vampire movie with some twists in an old plot. The special operations team is sent to South America to hunt blood-sucking natives. Your leader is a real man who has aged well. There is an environmental turnaround as vampires attack the villages because their rainforest and their old wild animal diet are disappearing because of the greedy corporations and farmers. Lost to fight and lots of blood, they never bothered to wash the cast throughout the movie. It looks as if they slept in their bloody clothes and filled themselves with blood. Although each member of the cast has brought in their own talents, not all really click like a movie. The effects were OK except for the vampires hanging from the buildings on the strings. If you are looking for a lot of blood and violence, this is for you.
