Franco Zeffirelli's third attempt to transfer Shakespeare to the screen works very well with the cast of Mel Gibson ("Mad Max," " "" Lethal Weapon "and" The Passion of the Christ "notoriety) in the role previously held by Sir Laurence Olivier (and rightly so; see my commentary on his" Hamlet ", undoubtedly the best interpretation of one of the timeless of the Bard (and most cited) tragedies) and redone 5 years later by Kenneth Branagh as a pure-blooded treatment, explaining his running time of 3 hours and 22 minutes, combined with a cast of dreams (and many small additions, which were well chosen and skillfully done by William Shakespeare's contemporary master Kenneth Branagh, the director of "Henry V" and "Dead Again." Joining the star "Lethal Weapon" are Glenn Close ("The Big Chill"), Paul Scofield ("A Man For All Seasons"), Alan Bates, Ian Holm and Michael Maloney (who winged as Roderigo alongside Kenneth Branag and Laurence Fishburne in Oliver Parker's "Othello" (see my review of Olivier's "theatrical" version of the tragedy, though he only starred) and whom Branagh would launch as Laertes in his version of 3 hours of "Hamlet" (a fitting tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier and his classic version of the play; (5 years later), Nathaniel Parker (who would be cast as Cassio in his brother's version of "Othello" 4 years later) and Helena Bonham-Carter, who would be cast in "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein." "4 years later. <br /> <br /> Zeffirelli intended this film as a tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier (who had died two years before this movie) and works very well most of the time.What I was one I was a little bit uncomfortable with Zeffirelli, and I was losing a lot of lines and in one scene, he gave one of Hamlet's speeches to Ghost, and Helena Bonham-Carter did not convince me as Ophelia, she was very monotonous and unreal, while Jean Simmons (who immortalized the role in Olivier's version) and Kate Winslet (who did an acceptable job in Kenneth Branagh's uncut review of Hamlet) were good on paper, with Jean Simmons being the BEST Ophelia of all time, that's why she was nominated for Best Actress in 1948 (she did not win - what a pity). Ian Holm said his lines too quickly, not slow as I expected, in a scene with him, Laertes and Ophelia. But again, I'm more accustomed to the interpretations of Felix Aylmer and Richard Briers on the role and I think they did better than Holm in their respective versions of "Hamlet" (both made by great directors, actors, editors) . , producers and stars of all their versions of the work of the Bardo) like Polonius. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, however, was excellent. The scene in which Hamlet confronts his mother was very well done, but Olivier and Branagh increased the scene as much as possible to create even more emotional and suspenseful intensity that the scene demanded. <br /> <br /> I recommend this version just to pass the time, but it is ideal as a teaching tool for 12th grade English teachers (I recommend showing the Olivier version first, then the Branagh version and finally this version). Despite the "PG" rating of the film, there was really nothing objectionable in the film. Just what the play asked for. <br /> <br /> The best versions of "Hamlet" are: <br /> <br /> Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh. Both were so good that I can not decide which one was the best. See my comments on these versions for more information. <br /> <br /> Franco Zeffirelli. This one was fine. It started well with a scene that was not in the play, but should have progressed to the beginning of the play, where a guard shouts "Who's there?" "No, answer me. Stand up and unfold!" This scene scares the hell out of you because you're sitting still and then bam !!, you almost jump from your skin. In short, this scene sets the tone for the rest of the game. Great mistake on Zeffirelli's part in omitting that scene. He also misplaced many lines (and cut others that I think should have been put), like the line where Hamlet tells Ophelia: "Go to a convent, why would you be a sinner's maker?"; this line should have occurred in that scene, NOT where it was placed in the film (after the soliloquy "Being or Not Being"). This version struggles between cutting out too much or too little from an excellent literature. Kenneth Branagh would remedy this five years later with his uncut version of the tragedy, making HIS version a more appropriate tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier, since several actors (besides him) had performed "Hamlet" on stage / or in many films. , Zeffirelli's approach to "Hamlet" is true to the game and that's what I was looking for. The setup for the final duel was the same as for the versions of Olivier and Branagh, only that the outcome in Branagh's version was more violent than (more in line with the piece, Olivier slowed down ... and worked equally well) and got closer to the play, with Branagh releasing some harmless touches of his own ... to very good effect . <br /> <br /> This version is not reviewed.
