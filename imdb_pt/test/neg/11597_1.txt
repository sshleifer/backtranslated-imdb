A group of environmentalists travel to an island to discover a secret laboratory that is experimenting with animals. When they arrive, they find out they are late. Apparently, the government made a scientist test his experiment in a komodo and, yes, you guessed it, a snake that made them grow a lot. I'm not sure if this movie really needed or deserved to be explained, since it is almost identical to Curse of the Komodo, which is also a drug. The effects of the computer are as caricatured as ever the Komodo roars like a dinosaur that really got on my nerves. As Good as Python, this movie is not worth seeing and is as fun to watch as it is to nail your hand to a table. Avoid!
