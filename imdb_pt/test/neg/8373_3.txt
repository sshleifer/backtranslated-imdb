Maybe we Australians have a totally different sense of humor, and then my lie is the only problem here. I have a database of all the DVDs I own (including those received as gifts - that was) and so, upon entering a new one, I always refer to IMDb for information such as Genre, Runtime, Director, Leads etc. . that, I noticed it was a comedy and so I decided to watch it at a time when I wanted something light and a good laugh. Well, it was not even! There was absolutely no laughter at all and an inordinate amount of gratuitous swearing (are there REALLY radio announcers allowed to convey the kind of dirt that Steve Jones serves? What if a decent kid happened to tune in to his station?). <BR> Instead of enjoying a good laugh (or even a giggle), I found the whole thing depressing. I gave it 3 out of 10 but, to be honest, I do not know what those 3 are for! I suppose the basics of lighting and sound was not so bad! <br /> <br /> We have a ostensibly bankrupt loser (Giovanni Ribisi) who still seems to be able to drive a reasonable car (who pays for the fuel?) and live in what could be a good apartment (who pays his rent?) Given the opportunity to form what could have been some kind of meaningful relationship with what turned out to be a good girl, he even blew it up! Maybe it was her (Lynn Collins) who won this movie the 3 points! The fact that she works as a stripper instead of a hairdresser is one of the few aspects of this film that makes sense ("I do as much on a night doing this as I do in two weeks of hairdressing"). <br /> <br /> Unless you want to be depressed and bored to the teeth, forget it!
