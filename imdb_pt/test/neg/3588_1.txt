The only reason FC De Kampioenen exists is its local popularity. This made this sitcom spin for over 15 years (and still counting). It deals with an amateur soccer team with an emphasis on "amateur". Each plot deals with the same subject: some misunderstanding that takes ridiculous (and predictable) proportions, to be resolved at the end. <br /> <br /> The show has been on display for over 15 years, and production has probably decided not to change a winning team. Which means the program has had small changes over the years (plus some actors being replaced (they were almost all left alone instead of being expelled from the program)). The mood has not changed a bit over the years and was already outdated when it first aired. <br /> <br /> I think you have to be Flemish to achieve this, and over 60 years of age to enjoy an old-fashioned TV show like this.
