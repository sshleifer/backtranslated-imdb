This is such a bad movie that I have no idea how it got on the shelves, they must have paid the movie store to get them put there, seriously! The story makes absolutely no sense, unless you're on some heavy drugs, you definitely would have to be on something to watch that total piece of junk, so much that you would not care what was on TV because you're almost in a coma . The writing looks like it was made by a 5 year old and the acting is worse than the primary school. The heinous special effects they were trying to make seem so stupid, which they spent a total of $ 5 to make the whole movie, it seems so! Oh my, that scene with the old woman with the 80's hairstyle and the ugly rubber suits, my friends and I both laughed so much. Did anyone really think it was a good idea to turn this into a movie? I find this hard to believe!
