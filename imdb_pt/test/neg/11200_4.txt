I got out of my way to get this movie, and I was lucky enough to get it on VHS. Being a big fan of Gloria Grahame, it was a great addition to my collection. Other than that, I really can not say much to recommend this photo. The plot is predictable (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching Sterling Hayden get into deeper issues with his own department. Ms. Grahame is always fun to watch (if you like her, like me), but the dubbing of your corner really hurts that image. She works on a dive, so let her use her own voice. It can only lend to the atmosphere. I must agree with a previous reviewer; the end borrows heavily from the GREAT HEAT. To the point of diminishing the end. I've seen worse movies with Ms. Grahame (MACAO), but I'll never get a chance to see her on screen. If you are having a movie night and looking for a second feature film, this is your movie. Enjoy the image.
