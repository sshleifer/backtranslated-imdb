Following the movie that represents the apex of the Ninja genre of the 1980s, "vindictive fans of the Ninja" were "treated" with this bizarre offering that mixes Ninja antics with spiritual possession ... the end result is no different in its nature to that experience a bit terrifying when you spy a human boob nugget floating threateningly in a public swimming pool. <br /> <br /> Take for example the supposed introduction of "packed action" that is set up everywhere on a golf course. Of course! (!) Here we witness an evil green-clad ninja killing a group of golfers seemingly for no apparent reason (although I must admit that the superficial elitist attitude adopted by many participants of this particular sport irritates me a little ... hmmmm maybe it is why did he murder them? ... yes, I can relate to that after all). In fact, later in the film, we are told that one of the golfers was a leading scientist, but this story has never been elaborated or referred to anymore! <br /> <br /> Anyway, back to the introduction, the police continued. to surround the golf course and basically shoot the absolute hell of the killer .... and they have to keep throwing at him because he just will not stay down !!! Yes literally hundreds of rounds are pumped to him and yet he stands up to kill more and more law enforcement numbers. <br /> <br /> Finally (after what looks like an eternity) our malicious man detonates a smoke bomb and disappears .. .. or so it seems, because, in fact, he is just hiding under the ground and our decidedly impassive cops leaving the scene to search for his body, he comes out of hiding and staggers away. <br /> <br /> Next, we see the lovely Lucinda Dickey, a truly beautiful and physically fit actress, here playing a phone repair operator. From her high point of view, she sees the death ninja (NOT FINAL !!!!!). However, after a more detailed investigation, the man, supposedly on his last legs, suddenly jumps on her and holds her to the ground. After a little struggle our resolute heroine is able to free herself by luck, but she does not count on the ninjas possessing hypnotic powers and she inevitably succumbs to them. It is at this point that the dying ninja really projects his soul into our heroine! His intention is to use his bodily form to kill those cops who killed him (the few he could not eradicate initially!) From this point on, throughout the film, whenever our heroine sees one of the officers mentioned above, she is subjected to some overwhelmingly gruesome cinematic scenes of flashing lights, smoke effects and the sword that the ninja bequeathed to her levitating towards her in a very hesitant way! To make things more complex, a particularly irritating police officer (who sports enough back and shoulders to embarrass an average yak!) persists in trying to win his affection (in a very annoying way !!!) is of course it does not take the gift of prejudice to find out that in a "shock" (or less) very weak at the end of the film, HE is revealed as one of the cops she must kill! <br /> <br /> But hope there is still hope! <br /> <br /> Take a step forward, the first and only Sho Kosugi! <br /> <br /> Yes, the ninja and looking here as cool as ever! The news about the golf club obviously travels fast and knowing about the events that took place there, it flies to Japan to solve the situation (suspect the worst!) In a brief sub-story (this is equivalent to a few seconds! Sho in this particular ninja is shown as personal after the said villain assassinated the father / teacher of Sho (?) And blinded one of Sho's eyes (thus necessitating Sho to wear a really decorative sword shield!) <br /> < After stealing the body of his dead nemesis from the morgue and tracing our heroine that provides an abode for the evil soul, mind the climax in an oriental temple (seemingly in the middle of nowhere) where our Sho man manages to reunite the two disconnected aspects. <br /> <br /> Now reanimated from the dead, the evil ninja and Sho face each other in the traditional ninja style with swords with the winner being ........ well yes you can probably guess. <br /> <br /> Really this movie has s only two things, ie the always excellent Kosugi (who looks absolutely fantastic on paper as always) and the lovely Miss Dickey. How embarrassing that the material in which they met here is such a horrible pile of punishment. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, to be fair, I've seen much worse than that in my time, although I certainly still can not recommend this other than those desperate to complete their collections of films Sho Kosugi / Ninja .
