I do not honestly know what legal or illegal substance they - the writers - were when they wrote this horrible stretch of gut! The cast - it sucks The plot - it sucks The edit - it's a drug The whole premise of the movie is that a girl with psychic / telekinetic powers comes across a brotherhood of lesbian vampires, you only have to be totally out of it to watch even a minute of it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I had to watch - was here! network as part of a purchase of two photos and the movie that came after it was the real I wanted to see. I quickly went through it all and was impressed by how stupid this movie was at double speed! <br /> <br /> Do not rent, buy or watch this movie ... the movie's vampires do not suck as much as the movie in general and production does! <br /> <br /> If you want a good lesbian vampire movie - The Hunger with David Bowie, Susan Sarandon and Katharine Deneuve - great movie to watch / own / rent in place of this piece of pure sh * t
