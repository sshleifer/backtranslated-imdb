This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen Nielson. This movie does not have what it needs to be funny. I think the reasons that Naked Gun and similar movies are that they did not require Nielson to be funny. He just played the roles as direct as he could, while all the comedy that went on was mostly visual. But when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny, he is not. The film had only a good part, and this can be considered a spoiler by some, and that the initial credits were animated. If the whole movie had been animated, it might have been good. I had no intention of seeing this movie when I saw the ads, and the only reason I saw it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest. This is the first and probably the only movie I've ever seen. On a scale of 1-10, I give this movie a score of -100.
