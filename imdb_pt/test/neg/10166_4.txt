This review is for the set of UK three-disc DVD boxes. Disc One is called Caught in the Act and contains Model Behavior, Jamie Chasing and Fast and Curious. Disc Two is called Room Fantasies and contains Blue Plate Special, Falling in Lust Again and Love Potion No. 10. The final disc is called Anything Goes and contains Chatroom, it is the boss and legally yours. Why the other four episodes of the series are not included is a mystery, because there is certainly enough space on the discs for much more material. <br /> <br /> Each episode begins with hotel manager Chloe (Lauren Hayes) reading a letter from a satisfied customer. Then we see the story unfolding as the guests enter the hotel. Blue Plate Special is the exception because this story is from a waitress. Writers should receive credit for presenting a good variety of story lines. For example, Model Behavior is about two models disputing the attention of the photography team; Falling in Lust Again is about a man and a woman who separated and rekindled their love when they met again at the hotel; She is the boss is about a male secretary / pet dog that shows that he is more man than his female boss realized - to his great pleasure. All episodes lead to much nudity and sex. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful and handsome women. Even the nerd secretaries are transformed when they take off their glasses and let their hair loose. Sexual action is plentiful, but to me it seems very frantic and false. The camera work could also have been done with a bit of moderation, spending a lot of time up close and thus moving to capture everything, and as usual, we hear loud music during sexual action. Finally, the final credits mention the Palm Canopy Hotel, on Singer Island, Florida, although my map of Florida does not show the island of Singer. The setting certainly looks more like Florida than Utah or Las Vegas that some people have mentioned. This is a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still awaiting a DVD release in the UK. 4 stars.
