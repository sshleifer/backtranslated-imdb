Robert Downey Jr. in a wig and 17th century dress was enough to make me shudder, but I could not believe that a great actor like Sam Neill has participated in this movie. The whole thing was unbelievable. I especially like Merivel's "cure" for the crazy. They dance ... and hey, that's it! everyone is happy and they are all better! I think I did not really like the character Merivel. So watching an entire movie about your supposed transition from a whoring clown to a big doctor was tiring. <br /> <br /> Besides, I'm not sure, but I do not think the plague, like the famous London fire, happened simultaneously.
