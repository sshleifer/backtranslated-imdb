There are many other comments here about how poor this movie is. What I wanted to point out is how this movie took the biggest science project in history and made it look small. The Manhattan project was an incredible achievement and it was huge. Virtually all of the country's silver started making wire for electromagnetic separators. If there was a choice between two alternative ways of doing things, they just did both. The first sustained nuclear reactor was fired under the bleachers of the University of Chicago football stadium, with graduate students wielding axes as a scram mechanism. It's a fascinating story involving hundreds of locations and thousands of people that this movie seems to reduce to a small group of eccentrics in New Mexico. <br /> <br /> The other thing I really did not like was the huge moral debate about whether we should continue the project after Germany surrenders. Okay, we have thousands of (mostly) men who have worked for years to make a really big boom. Anyone think I did not want it to work? There was some controversy at the time about whether we should use the device, but it was not that serious, it's clearly not the big debate that this movie makes it look like.
