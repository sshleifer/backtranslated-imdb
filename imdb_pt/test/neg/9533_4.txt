This film was so unfocused, disconnected and uneven that it was an effort to watch the whole thing. (I actually thought some interesting plot elements might develop.) This was nothing more than a "coming of age" film for the generation of thirty-something. Total crap and I have no idea what Julianne Moore was doing in this since that was the only reason I got on the shelf of the rental store.
