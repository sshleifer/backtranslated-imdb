Shamballa Conquistador shows what happens when animators can not understand what their fans want. I, as a fan, did not want a Nazi evil film of the 1920s. What I would like to see is a real final confrontation between Ed and Dante, since we do not really know what happened to her. I would also like to have Ed back to his world much earlier and have him stay there, to finally get a chance to be normal. You know, raise a family with a certain blond mechanic, that sort of thing. No, instead, I have a complicated plot involving mystical Nazis, Fritz Lang and about ten minutes from Al, a joke from Roy Mustang's Cameo and just a joke from Armstrong, a short joke and no Winry hitting Ed with a key. Above all, I just did not feel like the Fullmetal Alchemist to me.
