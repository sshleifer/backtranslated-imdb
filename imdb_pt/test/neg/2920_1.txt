Me and my friend read the summer and watched the trailer and we were very interested and enthusiastic about renting this movie. BAD IDEA. We thought a movie with influential actors would have been a success, but our expectations were extremely short. First of all, the trailer and the summer are deceptive to the point of lying. The movie started slowly for the first 1 1/2 hours (reminder, about two hours long) and when it finally began to gain strength, it sucked. In addition, the plots were very difficult to follow. This confused us because it kept jumping from one story to another in random order. The characters were not very realistic when it came to reality. Of course the mother and the son could be real people in reality, but all the others seemed to be one extreme or another. If you are a person who likes strange, twisted movies, then go ahead. But we advise not to waste two hours of your life that you can not go back. Unfortunately no one told us this ...
