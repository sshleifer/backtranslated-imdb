I just bought this movie because I love donating to Operation Smile, the charity on which the film was based ... but I found the writing of the film very strange. It does not focus much on Operation Smile or similar organizations, such as the Smile Train, and its herculean efforts to alleviate the suffering of children born with facial deformities in third world countries. No, it focuses on a volunteer American teenager, Katie, whose "overprivileged" life in Malibu, California, includes a mother who takes her to a doctor for her to have birth control pills on her before bedtime with her boyfriend. . What should this absurdity of birth control do, excite the public? It is 2005. I would be more surprised if in 2005 a Malibu teenager was not in birth control, and even if she is, then what and who cares? Contrasting Katie is Lin's character in China, a girl with a facial deformity who missed last year's chance of getting an operation and this year does not want to have one. No character is written in such a way that the audience can actually identify, let alone understand the motivations of any of the girls. On the other hand, the actors do a proper job of trying to play the bad hand that were treated by those who wrote this ridiculous script. The best performance was the gentleman who played Lin's father, although many of his dialogues are in Chinese and with subtitles. Operation Smile deserved to be honored for a much better movie than that!
