If you've seen this movie, then you'll know it's one of the worst Bollywood movies ever made. Bollywood is known for copying Hollywood movies. Who would know that they will copy The Terminator 2. The difference between the two movie industries is that Hollywood spends millions and Bollywood spends 100,000 (average). That's the problem with this movie, if you want to make a T2-style movie, then do it properly. The director added a fake fantasy story about a reincarnated snake that finds its missing girl (in the previous birth) killed by two guys, but the blame is 10 people. She suddenly reincarnates in a ghost and together they want to kill the 10 people they blame for her death. Not to mention, the guy or villain of the reincarnated snake has some kind of superpowers. It can turn into anything, it can fly, disappear, fire power, wind power, you name it, it has it. It still gets bazookered and survives the T1000 style. You're probably wondering how he survives. It's best not to ask, and you'd better not waste time and money on this movie. Its Best just to forget this movie until it came out. I find it a shame to use a great film for this scandalous movie with a meaningless plot.
