This movie is ... awful and wonderful at the same time. I first saw it when I was about 13 or 14 years old, so it has a great nostalgic value to me. In this film, Cesar Romero actually plays the character of Octavio, the man who "discovered" Santana. There are also two other actors, Mark Markham (who plays Sam, who is trying to save his daughter) and Peter Mark Richman (who plays the priest), who have great filmographies, and these are the only performances that are fine. The rest of the acting and the film itself has all the qualities of the B movie that some of us appreciate. <br /> <br /> I recently spent 2 years trying to get a copy of this movie, and it's almost non-existent. . I assume it was discontinued very shortly after its release. But I ended up finding a copy and paid a penny to get it. If you happen to come on Judgment Day at a video store (unmistakable with a verdant "satan" on the cover), count yourself among the blessed who live near one of the few still-owned movie companies that still have a working copy. A must see for those of you who like to laugh at cheese attempts at a horror movie.
