Wow!! That James Purefoy looks exactly like Thomas Jane! <br /> <br /> This is the deeper thought I took with me after seeing the uninteresting George And The Dragon. For a fantasy comedy, the story was very monotonous and the effects were nothing spectacular. <br /> <br /> The problem was not acting. James Purefoy makes a good knight, and his various side kicks are not bad characters. I even thought Patrick Swayze in that role was a good idea as well. Piper Perabo's flat chest also had good potential. I even liked the child. <br /> <br /> But the story and everything that happens, and the way it happens, was just "huh." It's not interesting. Compared to another recent fantasy comedy, Ella Enchanted, which was actually funny, this movie was terribly short. I'm sorry for the decent actors who were in this indecisive betrayal. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
