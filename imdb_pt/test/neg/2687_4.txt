I'm new to Argento's work, and if that and Suspiria are any indication, then Argento is much more of an experience filmmaker than a filmmaker. In his films, the characters are placed in horrifying and hypnotizing horror contexts that literally saturate the logic of the world around them. The camera literally flows gracefully through the sets as the characters run, stumble and choke the way to a gruesome conclusion. It worked, REALLY well, in Suspiria. For some reason, it did not work here. The problem I see with this film is that although the protagonist "gets help" through contact with the police and ask for help from his friends, he still feels as if he refuses to "get help "in terms of actually trying to find a solution to your problem. The trap in this movie is that she's stuck on the killer's game, one she could easily get out of ... not position herself so easily? In a strange way, it seems that the character wants the torture that the killer gives him, which in a way is the point and could have worked, except that all his psychology is thrown mainly because of anything Argento wants to do. As a loving homage to "The Phantom of the Opera," it is certainly an interesting and unique sight. For all its value, Argento delights with the operatic movements, which shows the action well. It just does not make much sense, especially as it delves into a completely useless ending (yes, I know it's a reference to Harris's novel "Red Dragon." No, it did not work). Why the character must go from a horrifying experience of trap to a willing person with the director is beyond me. It seemed almost selfish on Argento's part. <br /> <br /> Overall, a fun experience, and between that and Suspiria I am more than willing to follow more Argento productions. But this is not a movie that I would like to come back or remember. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
