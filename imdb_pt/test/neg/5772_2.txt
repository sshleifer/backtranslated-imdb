A group of friends receive a message from a friend who found gold in an ancient well of the mind, near an old abandoned city of Suttersville. Despite the warnings of local sheriff Murphy (John Phillip Law), old man Prichard (Richard Lynch), a muddy hick-boy who fools tourists into alleged collection posters, and superstitious Aunt Nelly (Karen Black) to stay out of the mine is a notorious legend (that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to the devil and murdered the daughter of a priest (Jeff Conaway) will return from the dead to kill those who take gold from his axis), these people only see the green, not the red blood that could leak from their dead bodies. Finding Jeremiah Stone's gold intact, they line their pockets and stocks, prepared for the bright futures that are supposed to be ahead. But when you do not pay attention to the warnings of those who you consider the hardships of the wilderness, the obvious result will be the horrible death. Jeremiah Stone, as we see, is lying just like a skeleton near an altar containing skulls lined up side by side as the candles light up, the pick is waiting for him, with dust particles returning him to a grotesque corpse with demonic. exposure, his eyes shining with anger. This unfortunate group, waiting for fun around the bonfire with gold, providing them good prospects of life ahead, will fall victim to the vengeful ghoul and his average pick. Another victim will find the nasty end of a paddle thrown across the windshield of his vehicle, directing the path straight to her neck. Another failed attempt to retreat has Stone causing a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree, his body engulfed in flames as he can not escape without damage. Another, a local girl looking for her new friends, worried about her well-being, gets the pickaxe buried in her stomach. Aunt Nelly informs those still alive about the Forty-Niner and the curse on those who attack her eternal hideout ... and pays the price for relating such information. Is anyone going to survive? Or, the whole group is bound to perish in the hands of the zombie miner? <br /> <br /> Make-up effects artist and creator of monsters, John Carl Buechler directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or the strong story. , opting instead for allowing his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone standing in his way. It provides only enough back story, and this is weak at best for the star-killer who allows special star Karen Black (.. oh how his career sank in the abyss) to explain to the viewer about it. The story given to us is held hostage by the priest's daughter, threatening to execute her when the Suttersville authorities warn against such action. Surprising enough, Stone picks up that pickaxe on his back, with the opposition unloading his weapons with little effect because he sold his soul to Satan. Retreating to his domain, the pit of the mine, Stone sends a warning against anyone who is trying to take what is his, the sack. Typical of most slashers in general, this bunch of twentysomethings are victims of garden varieties, with little development in addition to jokes and word-exchangers as filler until the undead maniac steps in to shoot them down . They are the usual group of the city, invading unknown territories, resurrecting an evil that must remain dormant. Like many of the last thieves of the 1980s, much of the violence is off screen. What's on the screen, the minimum gore, is quite mundane and happens quickly. The make-up of the ghoul for the killer is only occasionally shown, it is mostly shrouded in darkness, the horrified faces of the victims when he catches them or chases receive more credit than the method of destruction. One thing is certain, stuntmen have been burned many times. At least three times, a character is burned alive by a flashlight or a burning vehicle. Martin Cove has a small appearance as Black's ex-husband Caleb, who now lives with a much younger and denser honey. Vernon Wells (.. of The Road Warrior and Commando) plays the role of Jeremiah Stone as a human, still capturing the same kind of threat he is a specialist in. John Phillip Law seems to be enjoying himself as being quite polite and hospitable. Sheriff, welcoming people outside to the neck of the forest. Buechler has a rather attractive cast of actresses, all wearing tight tights and small shirts, displaying their sleek, athletic figures, especially Elina Madison as Roxann, always willing to take off the clothes for greedy idiot Hayden (Rick Majeske). Stephen Wastell (The Ghosts of Edendale) is Axl, a rather clumsy role, used as a target for many jokes, including his "dump in the woods" scene and current unemployment status.
