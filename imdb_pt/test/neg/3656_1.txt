From reading the back of the box, my first thought was that this is probably a blow from Saw 2. I could not be further from the truth. It struck me that they gave someone with a camera phone and $ 10.00 and told them to make a movie. The plot did not exist and neither did the acting. It was almost as if I were watching a silent movie about growing grass. It did not surprise me in any way to find out afterwards that the whole movie was "improvised". By the end of this "movie" I had lost the will to live and I may have contracted AIDS just by seeing this piece of cinematic crap. It was about 70 minutes that I could have spent doing something that was less painful. How to jump from a building.
