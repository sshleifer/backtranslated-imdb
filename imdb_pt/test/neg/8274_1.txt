Ok .. at the time of writing, 65 people voted for this movie, bringing it to a rating of 5 out of 10. My guess is that only the film crew voted for it. So I'm here to bring some justice to all this. <br /> <br /> Never has a movie provoked the intelligence of the audience more than this. Given, I laughed out loud a bit - but the movie / story absolutely did not want me. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of bad movies. VERY. But man, this one takes them away. <br /> <br /> Speaking of 96-year-old computers with ridiculous performance and wheelchair harassment - and we have young Tarantinos who can not fund their ideas. Yes, life is a cruel joke.
