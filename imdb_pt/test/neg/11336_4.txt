This series, made for Televisión Española (TVE) is basically a series of chapters in the life of a common family in 1968, mainly as seen through the eyes of the younger son. <br /> <br /> Based on a background of historical events such as the May 1968 student revolt in France, Franco's decadent regime, the Vietnam War, the rise of imperialism, and others specifically related to Spanish life at that particular moment, one can consider this series as a simple compilation of characteristic weaknesses that become so apparent in this type of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Generally treated in a light vein, although not lacking at certain times that can be termed dramatic, the series seems to be geared towards people of about fifty people who can remember these moments, as, should any young person chooses to ignore such events or is busy busy with other things. The best thing that can be said of this series is the role of Ana Duato as the mother of three children: she plays the role of the total housewife of the times, manifesting that peculiar Spanish attraction, especially notorious among women, to let all their thinking and their deeds be carried forward by the impetus of their heart, without resorting to the use of the brain. As we say in Spain, common sense is one of the less common senses. Imanol Arias offers very little in addition to not being his usual stereotypical tough cop as in other television series. In fact, as an actor, he should not be trusted in anything other than a TV series. Their resources are very limited; however, his part as the father of the working-class family is not all bad. <br /> <br /> It is not really recommendable for other audiences, even for Spanish speakers in Latin America: the themes are very parochially related to a specific point in contemporary Spanish history, such that if the viewer were not living here at the time, he would lose most of the references. It is likely that certain situations that cause some Spanish smiles would mean nothing to other viewers.
