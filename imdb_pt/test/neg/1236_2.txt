Agustus and Call really did nothing? Why are they of the hero? They did nothing but reach places after the bandits died. What was the purpose of this show? I was very disappointed. I expected more action, more story and see the birth of Heros and Great deeds. Instead, I saw very little, looked like Agustus and Call where only the side story to the great Indian chief. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure the story is very close. They did very little to show why the Texans and the Comanches fought against each other. <br /> <br /> The only good part about this movie was Zhan, who played Gus very well and is a great actor. Lots of good story that could have been missed. It was sad and I wish I had not seen it.
