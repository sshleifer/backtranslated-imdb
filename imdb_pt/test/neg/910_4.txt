"Julia Kerbridge (Catherine Mary Stewart) is working hard to become a doctor." Julia suddenly finds herself the guardian of her young niece, Amanda, after her parents are found murdered.Julia has a new neighbor, the mysterious Kevin Finney (Rob Lowe) His agitated life collapses when it becomes apparent that young Amanda holds the key to a terrible secret, as she is also the target of the killers, and Julia needs to find out if Kevin is a friend or foe and unravel the sinister mystery. the murderer attacks again, "according to the synopsis of the DVD cover. <br /> <br /> This thriller collapses silently into the seams, but is interesting most of the time. <br /> <br /> The background phone scene of Stalker Sean Devine (outside the police station) and Lowe's violin (restaurant) are played tense.But in the beginning, it's hard not to miss the fact that one of the supposedly sophisticated assassins intentionally twists his foot in some pin at the crime scene. Unfortunately, this is not an intricate point of the plot; and there are worse stories going on. Overall, "Dead Silent" is not a bad way to spend some time, if there is nothing better, or you are in Lowe and your co-stars. <br /> <br /> **** Dead Silent (1999) Roger Cardinal Catherine Mary Stewart, Rob Lowe, Arlen Aguayo-Stewart, Larry Day
