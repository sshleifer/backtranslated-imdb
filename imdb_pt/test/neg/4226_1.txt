L'Humanité is a murder mystery. These movies tend to be popular, and the rating of 6.9 she currently suggests has also been popular. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie has no redeeming qualities. Some non-spoilers, for example, include a 5-minute scene in which the main character eats an apple. And 3 more minutes <br /> <br /> where he breathes. <br /> <br /> If you're wondering, this is not really art. Nor is it a commentary on humanity, which the title seems to be trying to be. It's actually boring. There are countless attempts in this film to say something about humanity. One might think to himself, "How would I comment on humanity?" And the most obvious and boring answers will, of course, be sex, love, and death. <br /> <br /> Not that these options are uninteresting when well done - only that <br /> <br /> they are the canonical options. For sex, this movie does its best to make it unattractive and disgusting. In your first five minutes - so this is not a spoiler - you'll see the bloody vagina of a murdered 11-year-old girl; It's a murder mystery, remember? Later, some people throw themselves against each other and have what the director would like us to believe was "raw" sex, but in reality it is invented and overly symbolic - but even worse, uninterestingly . <br /> <br /> I like to be disturbed by movies. This film showed me why: <br /> <br /> Disturbing movies often show something inside someone, <br /> <br /> their humanity, they did not know existed and are a little <br /> < br /> scared of. L'Humanité tried to do just that and failed, and I left the theater undisturbed, but disgusted, thinking that I had wasted my time in the theater. , despite having seen the movie to <br /> <br /> free.
