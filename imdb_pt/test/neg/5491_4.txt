It is partly bad luck for "Illuminata" that comes out after "Shakespeare in Love", since it addresses practically the same themes of life as art, art as the life and magic of theater and the same archetypal Foibles of Theater Folk, but much more heavily. <br /> <br /> There are scenes that come to life as a play unfolds and is reinterpreted by the life of a writer, but there is a lot of ego of Orson Welles in that produced by / led by / lead acted by John Torturro as a vehicle for his wife Katharine Borowitz (with a lovely appearance of his son). <br /> <br /> Each actor gets their momentum literally in the spotlight, but there are so many "masques" or sets that look like 19th century ballroom games. Bill Irwin speaks. Susan Sarandon becomes a diva. Christopher Walken becomes a different type of villain - a gay critic. Women have to undress unnecessarily because this is an Art Film. <br /> <br /> The art and the direction set are wonderful, though rather bleak. This should receive a prize as the best use of a Jersey City theater as a set in a movie. (originally written on 8/21/99)
