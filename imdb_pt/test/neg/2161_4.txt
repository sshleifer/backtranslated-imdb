In the early '90s, "Step-by-Step" came as a tedious combination of "Full House" and the classic "The Brady Bunch." The differences between "Step-by-Step" and the two above-mentioned shows were naturally better written, excellent comedic timing of almost all the actors, and far more fun situations that were not as sugar-filled as is extremely popular predecessors. It is true that even with the great impulses in the basic dynamics of the show and everything that was not exactly spectacular yet, nor was it even so memorable in the long line of programming of the brega family! It was just a much better passer time, you could say, compared to the graceful inducing migraine "Full House" which coincidentally ran neck-to-neck with "step by step" over that period of time in terms of overall popularity. The show, now in syndication obviously, is certainly suitable for the family, but make sure you do not expect too much beyond that when you watch it.
