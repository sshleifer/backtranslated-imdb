This is the kind of movie that is loved by 50-year-old teachers and people who consider themselves social conscious - but really do not have a clue. The actors - I think they are all amateurs - do their best, but the script is so full of cliches and stupid that they can not save it. <br /> <br /> Worst of all is the scool cabaret that kids are working on - it brings back all their worst memories of theater classes at school. The lyrics to one of the songs are more or less like this in a quick translation at 2:30 in the morning: "I am the dwarf of society, an emotionally disabled individual." <br /> <br /> Please!
