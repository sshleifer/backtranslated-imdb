This movie was praised to the point of ridicule. "American Movie" is a boring documentary about a boring person so common that you'll find equivalents in almost every corner of America. It takes a long hard look at a guy who has failed almost everything, in the interest of making an independent movie ... or two. If their failures were not their own selfish interests or if they were in the name of true art, the film might have had a chance. America has an abundance of better stories to tell. This must be liberated and many critics have good reasons to be ashamed. Two thumbs up indeed!
