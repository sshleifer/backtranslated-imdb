Christopher Tookey of the Daily Mail had some things to say about this movie, including "watching all your unfortunate 82 minutes," and I guarantee you'll shake your head and ask, "Did we really come down to that?" 'Yes, we do, because if a film has witnessed the total cynicism, bad taste and moral corruption of those who commission and make British films, it is this abomination. "Tookey continues" focused on imbeciles with dirty underwear, dirty minds and we of fingers that graze on the sidewalk when they walk, this sex comedy is so sordid, dull and smelly that it's enough to have sex and actually movies for life. "before concluding" Potato Men's Sex Lives do not is just a truly vile movie, it is symptomatic of a new national culture of instant self-gratification, yobbishness and sadism that is now being celebrated onscreen. "Usually I do not hear critics very closely, but in this case Tookey was very good. film goes beyond evil, in fact it goes beyond being simply bland and enters some bizarre parallel universe where every painful minute drags on for an hour and where the definition of "hilarious" seems to be "saying tw2t in an accent Brummie." It's depressing for anyone with half the brain who grew up with Goodies, Monty Python, Spitting Image, Not the Nine O'Clock News and Fawlty Towers. <br /> <br /> Ideally, Sex Lives Of The Potato Men would have quietly disappeared after its movie release and joined the equally somber spin-off of The Fat Slags (2004) and the ill-starred All Saints Honest (2000) at the Celluloid Cemetery, but as it seems destined for an endless night endless exhibits and misleading "Best Movie EVER!" Raves of people who should know better, so I must apologize in advance for trying to correct a mistake that the British film industry has, in all its wisdom, inflicted on an unworthy world. Yes, I'm really sorry for bringing this back from the dead celluloid, but I do remember thinking, "It can not be as bad as the critics said it was" ... but, as God is my witness, it was Worst Acting - terrible from start to finish, special mention to Mackenzie's legs 'Albert Steptoe in the body of a young' Crook. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack - cut and paste 'ladrock', mostly a slut-lager-lout-friendly jukebox based on ska that brought back horrible memories of seeing that merry cockernee doing the Lambeth Walk a a delicate imitation of the Specials knob-shiners Madness in every comedy / variety show in the eighties ... and Motorhead's 'Ace of Spades' as a music title? What the hell ... trying to evoke memories of one of the most genuinely exciting scenes ever offered by the Young, in fact, ever offered by ANY comedy? Cheap shot, far below the belt. <br /> <br /> Script - written by a 12 year old who has just read each issue of Smut and Zit in a long session of Red Bull ... SURELY? Come on, no real, proper, mundane, and grown-up person could put that kind of retarded nonsense on paper? And Mark Gatiss was in it ... Mark Gatiss ... the least annoying member of the League of Gentlemen's Fan participating in such a large pile of cinematic excrement? "One of the brighter stars of British comedy"? No more he is not! On the subject of the League Of Gentlemen, someone gives me a pair of leaded scuba boots and Steve's face as a straight 'Pemberton and collected a long weekend in a soundproof room before I die ... PLEASE ... <br /> <br /> Cinema, British or not, it just does not come much worse than that. The Headless Eyes (1971), by Kent Bateman, is a masterpiece of the new wave compared to this disgusting obscenity.
