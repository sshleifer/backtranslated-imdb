When at the beginning of the film the paleontologist Donald Sutherland arrives at the Argyle family home and leaves, he is the undeniable alibi for one of the members executed for murdering his mother two years ago his feeling is that you are about to watch a top thriller; an innocent man has been convicted and a murderer is still around. But as the film progresses, its disappointment inevitably increases. <br /> <br /> "Ordeal by Innocence" is a boring and sometimes boring movie that does not show up at any time. Nothing interesting happens all the time and even the ultimate revelation of the facts lacks surprise and intensity (whether you guessed it or not). Donald Sutherland, Christopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway and Sarah Miles (far from their good performance in "Ryan's Daughter") just go through their roles and not very enthusiastically either. <br /> <br /> You will not lose much if you skip this one.
