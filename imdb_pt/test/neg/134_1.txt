Fran√ßois Traffaut's "Mississippi Siren," had an unconvincing plot. The script required a lot of elasticity in suspension of disbelief. The plot was in an icy rhythm. It began in an interesting setting, but soon plunged into the schools of melodrama that lacked logic or intelligence. What were the critics thinking? This is overrated, even to be described as a loser. Even Catherine Deneuvue, who charmed in "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" and "Belle Doe Jour", managed to be simply annoying. <br /> <br /> We rented this movie while renting another Traffaut movie. We watch this first one, and we think it's so bad we sent the other back invisible at the same time.
