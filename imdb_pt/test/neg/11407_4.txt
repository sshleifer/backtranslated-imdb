I swear I did not want to! I chose this just since it looked good in the back! This movie was not scary at all and actually was very confusing. The demonic wind was only really used a few times and people were killed with great pleasure. The main bright spot was to see Sherri Bendorf from the Slaughterhouse play with him. Seeing what happened to her, however, I decided on this little turkey from a movie. A 3 out of 10. NEXT!
