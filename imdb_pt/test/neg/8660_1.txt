What a fucking movie! The main character of this movie should have been born and raised in Canada, but he had an Indian accent thicker than his parents! Is it just me or does Uday seem gay in this movie? Also, do all the cubs in Canada dress like sluts? At least that's how it is in this movie. All females are dressed as strippers. Do not waste your time with this! The only good thing about this movie is the setting in beautiful Vancouver. Wonder why Bollywood is going through a downfall? It's because of movies like that. I miss the good old days when Hindu movies were really fun! I could not even finish this movie because it was so bad. I think Bollywood needs to stop trying to replicate the Hollywood style because it's not working. They need to keep their roots because that's what makes Indian movies fun.
