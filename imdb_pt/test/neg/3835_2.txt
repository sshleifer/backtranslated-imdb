I'll admit it now. This is one of the worst movies ever made. But in Mr. Sjogrens' defense, the "Not really" scene was not all bad! <br /> <br /> And you have to love the effort to go all the way to Sweden just to find a Swedish sweet fifteen-year-old, have her speaking Swedish posing as Henry's Jewish mother (dennis hopper) . <br /> <br /> What makes this scene so perfect is that Henrys' father responds to the blonde Swedish (Jewish?) blond in German ... <br /> <br /> The best actress / actress of all movie must be the nun who takes care of Henrique's mother, this is a woman who has had no experience of acting but still presents the most convincing performance of all! <br /> <br /> Everything and everyone, this movie is nostalgic for me personally, it is after all what gave me a post in the IMDb database. : D <br /> <br /> // Feeling like a movie star *
