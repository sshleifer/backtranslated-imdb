Many people in the movies liked this movie, but that only made me feel misanthropic. If smug "intellectuals" play about your annoying sex life, it sounds good to you, notice. I felt bored, but happy to meet such people. The premise of the film was that, as in all societies or great civilizations, they are doomed to failure. According to the female historian character, who annoys us with this fact, America is showing signs of decline (surely it goes into greater detail than I do). The next part of the film is about the empty, stupid, asinine behavior of his friends and colleagues, and the various miseries caused by his libidinous behavior with a vague attempt at humor. A lot of people liked this movie where I watched it. I could not relate to that.
