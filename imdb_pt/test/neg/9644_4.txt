... at least during the first semester. If it had started with the three navy friends and focused on the naval action scenes, it would have been a much better and tighter film. The second half of the movie is worth it, especially for the action sequences and close-ups of the early 20th century ships, but it's like a boring toothache to get there. Also, do not watch this movie just because Ginger Rogers is in it. She has an important role, but it is small. <br /> <br /> The film begins by showing three New York friends working in the tourist trade and also in a humorous competition by the hand of Sally (Ginger Rogers). , a candy seller singing along the avenue. World War I erupts, the three comrades seem completely indifferent to the fight, but enlist in the Navy anyway. One of three with less civilian experience (Bill Boyd as Baltimore) ends the commander for the other two (Robert Armstrong as Dutchman and James Gleason as Skeets). To make things more complex, Sally fell in love with one of the three, but does not have the chance to tell him before the three of them go to war. <br /> <br /> The film is a little more interesting. on board the ship, mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself, and also because the chemistry between the three friends is believable. However, James Gleason, at age 49, seems a little too long to be a fat man, especially when the signup board says you have to be between the ages of 17 and 35 to be eligible. <br /> <br /> An obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped with minimal care is the costumes, or, I would say, the lack of it. In the scenes in New York, shortly before World War I, we all dressed in the 1931 clothes and all driving the 1931 cars - no effort was made to put this film in the period. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you watch the few scenes with Ginger Rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission, you've seen everything here worth seeing. The rest is padding.
