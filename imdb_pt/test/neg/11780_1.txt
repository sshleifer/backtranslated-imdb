I saw this movie when it was first released in 1986. At the time, I was young and liked all the normal comedy available, namely Monty Python, Jim Belushi and SNL, Steve Martin, Cheech and Chong, so I believe the my judgment represents most "healthy" people. <br /> <br /> The best absolute part of this movie was the trailer played at the beginning. from the movie to the new movie "My Little Pony" that was coming out. <br /> <br /> This movie was so atrocious that it was actually ripped out of most theaters before the opening week was completed. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that anyone would waste corporate money to duplicate this steaming pile of human waste. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money to rent or watch this "movie".
