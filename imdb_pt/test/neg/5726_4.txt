This, in my opinion, is a very poor film that announces Arnold Schwarzenegger as starring (although he is the co-star) just to sell more copies. Obviously, taking influence of the films of "Conan" with similar themes, this film does not appear so pleasant and eventually fails to entertain. Bridgette Neilsen plays Sonja, a beautiful woman who received unbelievable strength for a ghostly figure after her village was ransacked, her family dead and herself raped by the soldiers of Queen Gedran (Sandahl Bergman). Gedran is a tyrannical queen who wants control over the barbarian world and looks for a talisman protected by Sonja's sister to do so. After discovering what happened, Sonja goes out in search of revenge and, at the same time, must save the world from the wrath of Gedran. Kalidor (Schwarzenegger), the master of the talisman, decides to protect her whether she wants him there or not. <br /> <br /> The first big problem with this movie is the beginning. The events that led to the point where Sonja gets her powers could easily have made ten to fifteen minutes of nice movie. However, the beginnings are rushed to what appears to be a quick minute "earlier in". segment of a television program. If they had actually made these events part of the story and cut off part of the fill later on, they might have been able to start rescuing this movie, but unfortunately they did not succeed (I wonder why director Richard Fleischer has currently directed two films since Red Sonja). <br /> <br /> This film also features some of the most annoying characters in the story as Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.), who is a stupid character and just adds an abundance of camp to the movie, which sometimes works, but in this case fails miserably. It was obviously written in the film for some comic relief, but with the general absurdity of the film, anyway, that was another costly mistake for Red Sonja. <br /> <br /> For all the problems, there have been a good fight scenes involving Neilsen and Arnie that are noteworthy, but these are nothing enough to save this turkey. The performance is as good as that of the films of this quality and even Arnie did not seem too bothered by his performance. I would not recommend this movie at all; for me it's a waste of an hour and a half. My rating for ?? Red Sonja '? 3/10
