I have little or no interest in seeing another horrible movie, which totally has nothing new creative or funny, abusing the National Lampoon brand. As always something caught my eye in the cast of this movie. I see the name of Danielle Fishel, I'm a big fan of the boy and knows the world! But the movies she's in are terrible. What's more, as a fan, I'm not rewarded for seeing your terrible movies with the bare chest treasure. So that's where my question comes in. <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen this movie? And if so, does Danielle Fishel get naked in this? It would save me the 2 hours of my life I would never see this terrible movie again. Thank you very much
