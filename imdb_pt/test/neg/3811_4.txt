I first heard about this movie in the "Flashback Weekend" in Chicago 2007 for "Nightmare on Elm Street". Robert Englund was actually talking about the movie and he was terrific in his "Hatchet" part. The same can be said of Tony Todd. Knowing that this is a low budget director / writer for the first time, he offers as much as the big budget, in addition to using "Holloween" (2007) as remake / re-imagination. <br /> <br /> Technically, it falls short of the expected. some places. The alligator attack seen was filmed very dark. When it happened, the alligator's dark head against the swamp tightening his black pants was almost invisible. The mood music in the marsh scenes was very loud in volume and canned, like a bad sitcom. And just like "Holloween" (2007) someone is smart enough to have a gun, but of course shooting the killer is just a pause button for the killer. The end, well, as soon as I saw where I was going I knew what was going to happen, not very original. <br /> <br /> The highlights of the film are the characters and their interactions. Unlike "Holloween" (2007), we get to know people and care about what happened to them. Ben (Joel Moore, who is also the protagonist of "Spiral"), the bad mood and Marcus ("Not Another Teen Movie") as the best friend and funny man to cheer during the film. Shapiro (Joel Murry "Dharma & Greg"), Jenna (Joleigh Fioreavanti) and Misty (Mercedes McNab from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Series", "Angel: The Series" and "The Addams Family") give a complicated reason for topless women. Mr. and Mrs. Permatteo played by television goers (Richard Riehle "Grounded for Life", Patrika Darbo "Step by Step") as the eldest couple you know has no chance, even the tour guide Shawn (Parry Shen) is a developed character. I hope to see more of everyone involved in this movie, but I think it will play better in home video than in the theater, sorry.
