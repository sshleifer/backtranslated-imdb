I wish I had something more positive to say about Devil Fish, but I honestly can not think of much. I can not even think of many of those "bad times, it's good" moments. The fish of the devil is simply bad old. The plot is completely derivative (Jaws, anyone?), The acting is wooden, the characters are uninteresting, the special effects are beyond evil and the punctuation is annoying. Add to that the seemingly inept direction of Lamberto Bava and you have a stinking movie. I think, however, that the biggest sin of the movie is the lack of budget. It does not seem that Bava had much to work with. In 1984, was the Italian film industry in total decline? especially with regard to genre films. The funding available for the Bava was probably very scarce. Movies like Devil Fish, which rely on special effects, have never had the chance to be good. It is not the only Italian film to suffer this fate. There are a number of Italian films made in the mid-1980s, whose ideas and concepts far surpassed what anyone could realistically have expected, given their budget constraints. <br /> <br /> However, having said all this and noting the many weaknesses of the film, I can not qualify for Devil Fish below 3/10. I even considered rating it higher, but I can not, because I realize how bad a movie is. Why do not I rate it below? Well, that's hard to explain. Despite the many problems encountered in the film, there is something about Devil Fish that I inexplicably like. It can be as simple as my love for low budget Italian films and cheese. Maybe my taste for movies is terribly distorted, but I like what I like. <br /> <br /> Devil Fish's Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment is actually very enjoyable. I rate Devil Fish 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale. The guys do a good job at mocking the film's many flaws. A very insightful remark arrives very early in the commentary when Tom Servo remarks: "Just because you can edit does not mean you should"? highlighting yet another of the many weaknesses to be found in Devil Fish.
