This is the result of the city of Milpitas, California, making a home movie and subjecting the rest of the world to it. Legendary in some circles as the greatest cinematic turkey, this movie is correctly considered a bad movie. Part comedy, part giant monster horror movie this movie is full of non actors not acting. the plot has something to do with a giant monster being created from the litter and pollution in the area and going into a tumult. The monster, which we do not see until the final 20 minutes, is pretty cool, but it's not cool enough to guarantee the previous hour of boredom. Frankly, even bad moviegoers will find it difficult to get to the end. That's a stinker.
