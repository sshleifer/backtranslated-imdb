Let me say that this new He-Man cartoon is not destroying childhood memories, as I did not like the old He-Man design either. I loved the action figures, but I found the cartoon hard-nosed and hated the plot (the He-Man I liked was the first pre-cartoons mini-comics included in the picture boxes, where He-Man was a barbarian, Sword of Power was divided into two parts, and there was no Prince Adam, no premise of Shazam-ripoff and no Orko). Anyway, let's leave old things alone. <br /> <br /> He-Man's new cartoon (or at least this pilot) is a disgrace in itself, it represents the worst word of the old program, and the worst trends of the day. I watched because I had heard that the morality of the old series (fortunately) was gone, and this one had more fencing and character development. But I found a horrible mix of the worst cliches of the genre, characters I could not help but hate, and the sadly inevitable visual style of the Matrix style. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good idea to give A bit of a background to the characters, as it was showing a Skeletor pre-peeling, but it's how far the character's development goes, in addition to the trash habitual for the age I see coming in the subsequent episodes, where this Adam will learn the responsibility of its newly acquired powers, blah blah. At least on the old show, Adam was not a spoiled brat! I found myself hating your guts. This is what we get when they launched an adolescent-oriented adventures program: cute faces and clothes that want to be cool and youthful in appearance. I should check out new episodes to see if N'Sync makes a special appearance. Man, this show reminds me of the Flash Gordon cartoon in 1996! <br /> <br /> Dialogue? There is! It follows absolutely every clich√© in the book, from the two Randor shoes in the opening scene to Skeletor's immortal "Oh, and He-Man ... I lied!" in the end. And Skeletor's voice is still the same high pitch as in the old series. 20 years, and nothing we learned. <br /> <br /> And sure, nowadays there can not be something remotely related to the action other than the Matrix style. Leave the anime to the Japanese people, think of new ideas. And seeing the character poses while fighting did not help either. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have our usual dose of PCness: Evil-Lyn (now I think about it, who the hell comes with these names?) has no yellow skin now, but gray-ish. Ah, then no Asian people will be offended. I bet Jitsu will not appear on the show either. Shadows of FG 1996 again, where Ming the Ruthless was a green alien and frog! <br /> <br /> People are complaining about Cringer's lack of speech. I do not think I would have liked it more or less if Cringer spoke, he's pretty tacky that way. And you have your extra cheese ration with Orko! The most shocking thing is that probably many of the people who (justly) hate Jar Jar Binks can be big fans of Orko ... <br /> <br /> I watched the feature film pilot, and I already had the enough. Leave the series alone. 2 out of 10.
