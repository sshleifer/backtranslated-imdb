First - nick-623, Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941, not in 1942. They did not have to predict the bombing. <br /> <br /> Second - has anyone noticed these six industrialists / lawyers / whatever was missing for a fairly long amount of time? They were killed * before * the surgery happened! Third - how the hell did Lugosi get out of taxis without being seen? Fourth - why did the Japanese not only kill him rather than put him in prison with a convenient companion and his surgical kit? Fifth - ah, what is the use of it? This movie has some interesting moments, but when they explain what is happening, you will probably have stopped watching. If not, you will not mind.
