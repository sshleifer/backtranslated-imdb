A lot of people who have seen this are confused, obviously. The original title of "Cottonmouth Joe" would have put things in better perspective for much of the target audience. I personally experienced the condition of cottonmouth (often accompanied by a very bad hangover after a weekend bender) and is in fact very much like the movie Skeleton Man - a dry and scummy film that provokes regret by recent choices and begs by a hot It's unfortunate that the choice of "Skeleton Man" for the title has been finalized by the distributor (probably the work of some Hollywood studio executives who do not interfere in anything they just did not understand) and not "Cottonmouth Joe." Those of us who have seen the film know that Skeleton Man is actually Cottonmouth Joe (a skeletal-manish apparition, not a true Skeleton Man). The mistake of the people who commercialize this movie is unforgivable, and for that reason alone, I can not give this movie a high note. Imagine this: when future filmmakers come together to create the true definitive Skeleton Man movie and need a title, they will be totally screwed up and we all, as serious fans of the genre, will slow down. Cottonmouth Joe could have become a horror movie icon right alongside Madman Marz, Black Claw, Mansquito, Humongous, the "Nature Boy" Billy Conners, Morty the wooden doll, the Boogen , Eegah, The Beast of the Moon, Bloody Bill, The Driller Killer, Mickey Rooney, and so on, but he will always be remembered as a maniac skull face wielding the sword wielding a horse helmet. <br /> <br /> This is too bad. .
