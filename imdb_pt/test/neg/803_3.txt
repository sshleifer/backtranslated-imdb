Without being really the worst science fiction ever made, or the worst I've ever seen, 'Time Under Fire' is still far below average. The premises and the first 10 to 15 minutes are not so bad, it starts as an X-story, combining the mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle with time travel. Very soon elements of other genres (many) mingle, but the story never takes off beyond the level of interest of a TV series. Soon, 'Time Under Fire' quickly degenerates into a series of clich√©s, not only mixing too many genres, but also being unable to create something memorable in suspense or special effects that would help viewers remember the movie until tomorrow. Acting is bad, and the rhetorical lines of the script do not help at all.
