Scott's collection of 80's icons can not save this teenage disaster. But then I suppose that's why it was just a TV movie and not a great movie. William A. Schwartz (writer) comes up with something closer to "Stewardess School" except that this movie is more annoying. This movie is not really stupid, just boring and completely without plot. The only reason to see this may be to see Tina Yothers in a real role after Family Ties. After that movie and the equally bizarre "Class Cruise", I think Mr. Scott got ready and went back to directing the sit-coms, best of all. 4 out of 10
