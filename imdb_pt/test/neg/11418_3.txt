My mother made me watch this movie with her. She's apparently going to watch anything with a vampire advice. I was bored everywhere. <br /> <br /> At different points, Underworld: Rise Of The Lycans is reminiscent of Spartacus, Battle for the Planet of the Apes, The Passion of Christ and Mandingo! What reminds me the most is the pictures of 60s (not good) Italian swords and sandals that spend an excessive amount of time showing Greek or Roman despots in suits talking and conspiring incessantly while you wait impatiently for the muscular man. hero and his lover, usually the despot daughter, to do something. <br /> <br /> This movie desperately needed some color and suspense. The characters were very two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Scenarios seemed to have been made entirely of tin! I wonder how many Civil War Chess Sets were melted down to make this movie. <br /> <br /> All those who wear fishnet stockings on their arms and black lipstick, feel free to click NO.
