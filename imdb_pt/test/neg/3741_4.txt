Much praise was given to Farscape, but I do not think it's that good. It certainly has a distinct appearance, but it lacks almost everything else: history, purpose, direction, excitement; You name it. I'm a big fan of science fiction and I make sure I watch all the science fiction shows I can. I have almost finished all four seasons of Farscape, and at the moment I am not very satisfied. The show has some good things - most notably Claudia Black (who is unfortunately missing from the first episodes of season four) - but they are very few and far between. As a whole, the show is marked by a lot of very silly things (like Fantasy elements rather than SF ditto), and many episodes, esp. in the fourth season, are unspeakably confused and very poorly structured. And you just feel like you're not going anywhere. Most of the time they are just non-directional adventures with thin, long-lived plot lines that develop meticulously slowly. Well, sometimes it's a bit tighter, but it only lasts a few episodes at a time. <br /> <br /> In terms of effects, there are some awesome things here and there (especially in space, occasionally), but the show seems stuck in the same style of effects, which frankly ages quickly. Foreign and unconvincing alien puppets mark the show a lot, and I've been preferring (by far) the episodes where regular human-looking characters are the focus. <br /> <br /> I think the Peacemakers are by far the most elegant and intriguing and interesting figures in the show; They manage to be a compelling and alien culture, despite their human appearance. There are some really nice episodes with them, esp. in the first season (IIRC), where Crichton disguises like a captain of the Peacekeeper, and invades and eventually destroys one of its secret bases. Such episodes can reach a rating of 8 out of 10, but I can not award the show as a whole more than a rating of "4". <br /> <br /> In addition to the Peacekeepers (who are a bit too na√Øve totalitarian and militaristic to be really nuanced), the show simply does not offer anything important or meaningful that you need to know or want to see. OTOH, contains some good ideas and is not a total loss. <br /> <br /> This is just my opinion, of course, but as an experienced science fiction fan, I think it counts for something, and it can be of help to others. There are not many good science fiction shows out there; but Star Trek (any series) and especially the new Battlestar Galactica are definitely better than Farscape. But if you're a big fan of mediocre science fiction shows, you might as well like Farscape as well. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4 out of 10.
