The only reason I rented the movie was to see Jeri Ryan in it! OMG that was the most boring and tasteless movie I've ever seen !!! HOW TO CALL !!! I mean, give me a break! After Voyager, I would expect her to be offered better roles !! <br /> <br /> If I were one of the last people on earth, I still would not be living in a travel trailer for dessert !! This is just such a bad movie !! The thing about the Indian tribe and how it compared it every 10 seconds really got old. Poor Jeri, best of luck next time!
