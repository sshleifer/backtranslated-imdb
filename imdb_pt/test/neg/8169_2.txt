Watching "Baghban" is the cinematic equivalent of trying to get out of a barrel of salt water for almost three hours. This Indian film is a sticky, sentimental novel that begins as "King Lear", passes to "Romeo and Juliet" in the middle section, and then returns to "King Lear" for its tear-drenched finale. Raj Malhotra is an accountant who seems to have everything a man could want out of life: a wife who loves him, a family who loves him and a job he's about to retire from. a lifetime of faithful service. Even though Raj and his wife, Pooja, have been married for 40 years and have four grown children, they still act like a couple of newlyweds boyfriends, cooing and sighing, squinting at each other and whispering sweet words in their ears one from the other. almost to the point of nausea. In fact, all bloody offspring are so happy, loving, and harmonious that it makes the Von Trapps look like a dysfunctional family by comparison. Parents and children play together, laugh together, even play "spontaneously" choreographed numbers (like many Bollywood productions, "Baghban" is a drama interspersed with a large number - in this case, a very large number - of musical sequences. <br /> <br /> Who knows anything about storytelling is aware that such unadulterated happiness can not go unpunished for a long time, and that all this joy is only the prelude to some terrible catastrophe destined to collapse over We know that we spend the first hour of the movie with a frightening expectation, wondering what form this disaster will take when it finally comes in. The thunder occurs about an hour in the film when Raj announces to his children that he and his mother decided to live with one of their families, leaving the choice of which of them will fit the children and their respective spouses. s vipers hidden in the family womb, Raj discovers that his children are not as loving, altruistic and eager to share their homes and lives with their parents as he originally thought. Understandably horrified at the prospect, children, in order to thwart their parents' plan, devise a scheme in which Raj will live with one of his sons while Pooja will live with another; then they will disconnect until eventually each child has had the chance to host both parents and then the cycle will repeat itself ad infinitum. To the chagrin of the children, the parents agree to the plan, although the two are deeply in love with each other and have never spent any separate time. So the second and most of the third hour are spent with the two old (though married) lovers languishing for each other, while their ungrateful and insensitive brats do all they can to make their parents understand how bad they are - coming. houses. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with "Baghban" is that it lacks subtlety in narrative and direction. The love that Ray and Pooja have for each other, as well as the near vertigo of family unity, is placed so densely in the first hour that the film almost collapses under the weight of sentimentality. Then, virtually without any warning, the script turns into a penny and turns the kids into insensitive, egocentric monsters and the parents into passive and tearful victims of this insensitivity. Raj and Pooja are a bit too tired and a little overconfident to be making some dreamy, unloved, unrequited love, more appropriate for school children than the parents of four adult children. The purple prose style, in which each emotion is underlined and highlighted, leads to intense overcoming and a strong reliance on tacky reaction shots and melodramatic music for punctuation. The musical numbers convey a certain liberating joy at first, but last so long and appear so often that they quickly lose their efficacy and serve only to fill the material to unbearable proportions. At least an entire hour could be excised from this swollen production with no perceptible damage being done - and a little good. There's really no reason for this movie to drag for three hours. The most notorious of all is the seemingly endless speech to which we are subject to the end, a discourse in which Raj (who somehow managed to turn his experiences into an award-winning bestseller) tells us about the truths of father / son relationships to ten minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> "Baghban" is a mellow saga, filled with more sugar and goo than a king size box of See chocolates.
