Sound bad environment. A lot of shuffling. Loooong nonsensical dinners. For example: guy looks interesting woman in the lobby. You can stand there and see her under the guise of waiting for the construction supervisor to get a package. Do not say anything. Looks scary. More scrambling and other annoying environmental noises. Wait. Wait. Wait. Guy says nothing. Woman seems frightened or at least a little disturbed about it and rightly so. The manager comes back with the package. The guy goes to the apartment with the package. <br /> <br /> Another example: the guy and his host sit around watching bad TV. More ambient noise and scrambling. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Guy waves to the bed. If you can watch this movie more, you can watch them watch TV again later. <br /> <br /> If you want a story, any dialogue, entertainment or a well-worked movie, look elsewhere.
