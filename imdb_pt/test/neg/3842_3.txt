Sometimes when I watch this movie, I start to think that the people who made this movie were drugged. What is wrong with this movie? I'll tell you Bad Plot, Bad Jokes.Bad Acting and ending with characters, everything is bad. The film is about Pest Vargas, a two-bit crook who has the chance to win $ 50,000 to survive for 24 hours by a German hunter who kills people to live. So now Pest must think of ways to think of this hunter before he is killed. <br /> <br /> I know what you're thinking "What The Hell is this?" another aspiring Ace Ventura trying to get money really this plot is just boring and confusing sometimes it changes the plot of the story and you get lost during the movie. <br /> <br /> As for the funny scenes in this movie I had a serious face, yes, I smiled a couple of times, but did not laugh much. Also, the jokes are cheesy and seen before, it's like watching Ace Ventura meet up with Dumb and Dumber but bad. <br /> <br /> As for character development, dry and flat.You do not learn much about the main character Pest all you know is that he is an annoying scam con man but that is what he does not change his image or be a little clever just corny.as for the German hunter all you are is that he is crazy and wants to go back to Germany. You really start to wonder why this guy lives on an island if he has the money to go to Germany. Hunter's son Himmel does better, but not much. He's really a coward and he's a snake. obsessed for reasons by the end He stands next to his father and sides with Plague. <br /> <br /> As for the performance in The Only There was some memorable performance, but exaggerated. For example, John Legizomo is so exaggerated with performance and does not fit into his role that he is out of place as Jeffery Jones, who does the same hunter, but gives a stereotypical performance. as well as for the rest or just not used enough or just over. <br /> <br /> Overall bad comedy that you will find for $ 2.00 at K-Mart.
