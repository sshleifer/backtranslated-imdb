radio is possibly one of the best movies I've ever seen, while at the same time one of the worst. It made me laugh in places where you should cry, and made me shudder at times when you should laugh. it lacked any kind of character development that is usually crucial to a sentimental movie. some questions, why the character Harris took radio under his wing, this was not properly explained, and I'm sure that their relationship (which is the main aspect of the film) is the most useless if seen. <br /> <that continues giving junior work to Cuba Gooding, he is a lousy actor and must be heavily insulted until he starts another line of work. <br /> <br /> How true stories happen, this is not so interesting. for the reason I said it's one of the best movies I've ever seen, it's because despite being full pap, I still liked it. laughing at the script, and most of the monologues that are really the work of an idiot or someone very clever trying to show how easy it is to cast a low quality movie about a retard that turns into everyone's favorite joke. The fact is that the character of Cuba is a comedy for people who watch football games.
