It's hard to compete against classical greatness, but when you make that choice and the decision is at stake, you need to find the best and brightest features to keep the top drawer of your product at the forefront of quality. If your intention is to aim for the second or third (or fourth) better, why try? That is why I wonder why this version of the Ten Commandments was written, produced, and transmitted. I would ask the producers, "What were you thinking? Were you struggling to create a projected deficit?" If perhaps the producers were thinking, "We want to look at this biblical story from another point of view ..." Then I would say, "OK, I watched the show, now what's the point of view?" The premise of this "theory of the possible point of view" eludes me. Generally, I can watch programs and (right or wrong) at least get an idea of ​​what the creators were trying to accomplish. Not so here. I recognize names like "Robert Halmi" (the producer) and I can associate his work with some attractive product; Tin Man, Earthsea, Flash Gordon, Jason and the Argonauts. Low budget entertainment based on myth, history, and comic book entertainment. A genre perfect for the Sci-Fi Channel. So I still have to ask Robert Halmi ... "What was the purpose of these ten commandments, what were you thinking?" ???????? FJS
