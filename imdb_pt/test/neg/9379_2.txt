I'll be honest and say that I gave up seeing it somewhere in the middle of the road and then moving on with some breaks. so I came back here and read a lot of the comments already made. Maybe it's just me, and I can not help it, but this cartoon for American society seems to have a purpose of "Let's save them from themselves "and Iraq comes to mind immediately. It seems to me that this is a justification, or part of, for another invasion with "good intentions". <br /> <br /> The lady to me seems like a self-indulgent person and I frankly got annoyed with her picture of trying to increase pen and "feel" for her. Well, in this case this could never happen because, just as a history teacher once mentioned here, I NEED to know how her family was so rich above average, she managed to keep this up (they were playing on both sides maybe?) And Send her to Paris !? now, if this were done after the biography of a poor girl, I could see myself having certain emotions. but as it is + its release time, this is just a pure propaganda film; worse yet, since his cartoon, he exaggerates the "soft" side of things very well for his own good in order to possibly be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are those clich√©s about gays. well, a woman struggling to gain her rights should she not have at least some sympathy for the oppressed in society like her? the message is obviously self-indulgent from the point of view of a member of the ruling class. <br /> <br /> I only give 2 stars because of its production and related material. An advertisement film obviously has vested interests in convincing me to manipulate my thoughts and therefore is usually well done by appealing to certain visual emotions that I can not deny that I might have as well.
