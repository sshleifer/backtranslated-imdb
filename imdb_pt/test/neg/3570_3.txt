I have to agree that the film is not the best I've ever seen, but I'd like to mention that the actors who played Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey were the Dorsey brothers. As actors, they were wonderful musicians. The film, based on its famous separation, would have been better if professional actors had played the role. Many movies made during this period of time have taken advantage of the popularity of Big Bands. Most of the time, the movies were not so good because the musicians are not actors in the trade. Most of the audience that watched the movies did not see Tommy or Jimmy Dorsey touching themselves; they went to the plot and the music. I've never been much of a fan of Dorsey, but the music is good until today. <br /> <br /> I have to comment on a previous post about the actors who played Mama and Pop Dorsey and that their accents would be considered extreme by a Dublin audience. Arthur Shields and Sara Allgood were actually Irish actors, both born in Dublin. You may remember Mr. Shields as the Reverend Mr. Playfair in The Quiet Man and Ms. Allgood as Mrs. Monahan in Cheaper By The Dozen.
