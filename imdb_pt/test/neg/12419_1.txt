I just got Wild Rebels from one of the compilations of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and this movie was so bad that even the crew of MST3K could not make it fun. There are a few MST3K "targets" whose films were so improvised that they could not possibly have been good films (like "The Green Slime"), and others whose basic premises could have been turned into genuinely entertaining films if their filmmakers had not coiled them in execution. "Wild Rebels" is a film whose basic premise made a good movie three years earlier, when Don Siegel directed his remake of "The Killers" at Universal. Both films are about a failed racing driver who is seduced by a femme fatale to drive the car in a theft planned by the woman's boyfriend - only in "The Killers" the driver was John Cassavetes, the woman was Angie Dickinson and the mind criminal (released wildly, but successfully against the guy in what turned out to be his last film) was Ronald Reagan. Steve Alaimo, Bobbie Byers and Willie Pastrano are a success! But what REALLY does "Wild Rebels" a horrible movie is the direction of William Grefe (note the accent of the "final", present in his credit on the screen) which has absolutely no sense of rhythm and seems to let every shot run at least half again, as long as he needs to make his point dramatic. It's a shame that someone has not made a mocking comment about this movie right now (in 2009); the comparison between Steve Alaimo's hairstyle and that of Rod Blagojevich would have been irresistible!
