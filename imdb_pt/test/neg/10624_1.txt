Okay, it's a kid's movie and it's not one of those movies that adults are going to like too. However, there are some unintentionally funny moments, most of them involving holes in the story. For example, the kid needs a piece of computer to bring the father back to normal and has no money. So he asks his father for the dough? No, he steals and gets caught. Children, if I become invisible, I will advance your allowance, okay? Also, while this kid is at the police station (no doubt about to be charged with criminal attitudes), his beautiful blonde teacher walks in, announces who she is and where she works, and then BUSKS THE CHILD OUT OF THE SLAM IN FRONT OF THE POLICE! To make things worse, instead of making a quick escape, they then sit in the police station parking lot and laugh about their accomplishment. You know, I hate choosing, but the kid stole something and should face the consequences, but maybe being in this movie is punishment enough. You avoid it!
