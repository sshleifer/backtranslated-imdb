It's almost embarrassing to say that I saw this movie. I mean, it does not take much to make a good zombie movie, plus good special effects, a lot of blood and blood, some scary moments and a decent storyline. Does the House of the Dead 2 do any of these things right? No, not one. Of course, it's not as bad as its predecessor, Uwe Bowle and it's the only thing about this movie that scares me. The dialogue in this movie is notorious, with lines like "What do you do to live?" in response "I kill zombies" and "I've never been a disc jockey, I was a soldier." The special effects are embarrassing even for a TV movie, I mean, zombies look like they have bloody lips. The base of the army in this movie, is a garage, with a table and an open room. This movie is so low budget that they could not even have co-ed locker rooms. In fact, it looks like this whole movie was shot in a school. <br /> <br /> Also, why are all the female soldiers in this movie models? And for that reason, because everyone in this movie is so ignorant about what's going on that they just stand up, letting the zombies kill them. Heck a guy up trys to give food to the zombie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie makes even the worst of the Scifi Channel movies look fantastic.
