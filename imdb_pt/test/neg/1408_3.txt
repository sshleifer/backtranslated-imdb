Combining serious drama with proper comedy is delicate at the best of times. SEEKING COMEDY IN THE MUSLIM WORLD did so thanks to a current subject and a fantastic script; not to mention the excellent broodish character portrayal of Albert Brooks. But MAN OF THE YEAR can not approach by comparison. It has a messy message folded with forced jokes and a distorted love story that is completely unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Initially, the premise seemed very promising. Put a Jon Stewart comedy presenter for the president of the United States and see what happens. This independent runner is Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams, RV), a successful TV personality who is pressured to run by his audience. Along with him comes his entrepreneur Jack (Christopher Walken, CLICK), and his writer Eddie (Lewis Black). Seeming to have little chance of success, Tom Dobbs won the election surprisingly. <br /> <br /> But did he? Eleanor Green (Laura Linney, THE EXORCIST OF EMILY ROSE) is a computer science specialist at the company who designed the new software for electronic voting at polling stations. She finds a flaw in the system that is quickly swept down the carpet by the company owner and her dark lawyer Alan (Jeff Goldblum, INDEPENDENCE DAY). Prepared to lose billions of dollars if the news is released, the company's evil men have decided to discredit and / or kill Eleanor to make sure she never tells anyone. But Eleanor is able to reach out to President-elect Dobbs and finally spill the beans (that's where the unbelievable love story begins to bloom as well). Dobbs goes to Saturday Night Live and explains everything to the world, removing himself as the newly elected president and ending the careers of those in the computer company ... oh, and saving Ms. Green's life. <br /> <br /> Does that sound funny? The comedy is forced into the story and is often weird. Robin Williams shines for a few moments during a debate, but is quickly steeped in the gravity of how he became president. <br /> <br /> The message of the film is also interesting and debatable: this special interest has presidential candidates. I'm sure there's substantial truth to this, and if you want to make a movie about it, you can. If you wanted to make a comedy about you could. But the man of the year is not that.
