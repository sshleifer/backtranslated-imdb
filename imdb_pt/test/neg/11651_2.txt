This movie was useless. I can not even call it science fiction, since it requires more of a movie than merely happening in space. "Max Q" is not even defined in space for the entire movie. The story / plot is unoriginal, the cast is nothing to write in, though it would be weird with a top cast in a mediocre movie ... Also, it's not particularly exciting or well told. At least it is balanced in a low quality way, in which nothing or no one stands out. Everything is equally bland. I usually find some quality in "space movies," even if it's only 90 minutes of bland entertainment that border on the pathetic low-budget, but "Max Q" did not even give me that satisfaction. All in all, a complete waste of time.
