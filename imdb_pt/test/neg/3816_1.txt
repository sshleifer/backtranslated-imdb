To say that this film is worse than suffocating in its own diarrhea is a generous euphemism. The only thing more pathetic than this reprehensible piece of junk from a movie is the shit that producers pay to register a bunch of bills to post a fake rating. If you watch a bad act, without suspense, a film about Goonies Sloth kills people in a way that completely ignores all the laws of physics (pulling a person's legs unrestrained, causing they are torn from the torso) is your idea of ​​a good movie, then <br /> <br /> No carbon-based life form with a functional occipital lobe would consider in a million ages that this movie is scary or funny.
