Boston Blackie's films have some strengths - mostly because the pace is fast and the hero does not bother even in the worst of circumstances. But the conspiracy is often atrocious, and the implacable comics often kill the rhythm (if the plot is atypically good) or are just plain bland and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> This involves Blackie chasing a runaway. asylum (Steve Cochran in a very bad performance) who has settled on beautiful Nina Foch (who does a good job of subtle acting). Inspector Farraday, of course, believes that Blackie was a homicidal maniac (at least he has some evidence of this), and is incompetently trying to arrest him when Blackie goes after the real killer. The plot has possibilities, but any time any real tension happens, we have a funny comedy routine. It does not appear that someone in Columbia has understood that in a film about the pursuit of a really dangerous maniac, small comedy scenes about hiding an inconvenient body of the inspector interrupt any voluntary suspension of disbelief. (One concludes that our clever hero is an idiot - deadly for a movie like this). <br /> <br /> This is not worth the time. For a well-planned episode of this series, see Alias ​​Boston Blackie.
