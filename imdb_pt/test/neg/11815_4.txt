Pam Grier is the super soul sister of the '70s, appearing in many blaxploitation films that were recently discovered and enjoyed by a new generation. I can safely say that BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA may be Pam Grier's worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Grier is Lee and Margaret Markov is Karen; they are two prisoners who escaped from prison after Karen's revolutionary friends attacked the rice wagon. Chained together, the movie becomes THE DEFIANT for women, but has three separate plots: a fat criminal (Vic Diaz) wants Lee to die, a bounty hunter (the great Sid Haig) looks for the two girls; and Karen's revolutionary friends are looking for her. The movie eventually becomes so complicated and not involved with the two women that the title should have been MEN'S WEDDING MEN. Grier, an action star, has no chance to take part in any of the many (long) action scenes. Markov is excellent because Karen and Grier are quite like Lee, but both end up forgotten in the many subplots. An interesting scene is that the bounty hunter forced a police officer and his boss to drop their pants so he could shoot one with the smallest penis (judged by his prostitute), but it is easily forgotten amidst all the chaos. <br /> <br /> BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA starts off as a women's movie in prison complete with lesbian guards and a shower scene, then changes completely to a chase movie. If director Eddie Romero (famed for directing Philippine horror movies) had just come up with the WIP theme, he would be fine. Instead, BMWM becomes real real and the surprise ending causes the public to wonder why they watched a 90-minute movie to end like this! Another problem: where should the movie be defined? While some of the accents are Hispanic and the cities have Spanish names (Los Robles, etc.), all the natives are obviously Asians! Hmmm ... Recommended only for fans of Grier, who will still be disappointed.
