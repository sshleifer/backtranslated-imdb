Director and playwright Richard Day adapted his own stage material to the screen, clearly inspired by Rock Hudson's real-life dilemma of the 1950s: what to do with a screen idol who is secretly homosexual? Marry him with an unsuspecting woman in order to end the gossip (and keep him working). Thin and thin idea, with some energy by the good cast and retro production design, which amusingly resembles a Shag card. The dialogue is not very clever, and there is some clown playing near the start that does not work (spitting food, etc.). Still, when a serious tone comes over the final act, it is treated with great taste - and it is much more welcome by the viewer than all the sloppy nonsense. Matt Letscher does a good job as the movie hero / male prostitute Guy Stone, but are his experiences here enough to strengthen his character, or would he be back at the bar the next night? The movie does not seem to know - or cares. Day wants to get rid of some simple sentences and a carefully written pro-gay speech - a request for tolerance - but he has no other agenda. For the audience that invests their time and interest in these people, the sentimental inclination in this thing may seem nothing more than a joke. * 1/2 of ****
