If you can get through this movie without laughing at the screen, you're better than me. <br /> <br /> Count on logical lapses, common sense jumps, and excerpts of credibility ... more than two hands! <br /> <br /> PS: If another movie uses a location that is clearly UCLA, and claims it's a different university (in the case of the movie: Berkeley), I'm going to miss it.
