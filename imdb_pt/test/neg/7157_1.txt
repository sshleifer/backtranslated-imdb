Contain spoilers! These guys are totally fraudulent, they did the scrolls of Judas, saying that Judas was a great friend of Jesus ... And now this? This is clearly a test to destroy a religion and should be illegal. They have no evidence, it can clearly be a setup. How can we know and trust these people? What if they carved the tomb and "said"? And in the end they seal the grave forever so that no one can go investigate? How stupid do they think we really are? Should we trust that they are trustworthy people? Who really found a tomb of Jesus? And how can you stab all Christians like that? I think this documentary should NEVER be done by a non-religious man. It can only be done by a Christian and I mean DIRECTION AND SCRIPT. It should be illegal for Jews to film a documentary related to Christians, especially if the documentary makes accusations that Jesus is not a "Son of God who has risen" (nothing against it, they could be Buddhists or atheists, anything but Catholics). <br /> For me this is a total farce, a pure documentary. They sealed the tomb so people would "not" think of checking things out. This documentary is a total failure, how stupid do they think the Christian people are? And about the lost pages of Judas ... this was also a total fraud, they said seriously at the end, something like: "We met some people who could make a fake parchment like this, and no one would know was a fake" ... Oh my god, they just said that. "Man we could have done it" ... This kind of documentary should be illegal, it's a stab in all Christians and Catholics that they should be behind bars !!! I'm not a fanatic, I'm an ex-Jew, now an atheist, but I have value and always respect the religion of other people. The part where Israel commands the tomb to be sealed forever was PRECIOUS !! PRECIOUS!!
