My expectations were high after seeing the trailer. They were even bigger when I saw that the movie had the same director of independence day and godzilla. The special effects on independence day were much better than in this movie. The whole movie was waiting for the spiders to appear. The rest of the plot was really annoying. And when the spiders came, they had a very amateurish look, like the special effects of a movie made in the 60's. I did not watch the whole movie. When it was played for about an hour, I turned off my DVD player. I watch three movies almost every night, and I never left a movie, even if it was boring. The only good thing about this movie was the cute sheriff :) That's why I voted for 2 instead of 1 :) So do not go see this, instead you should go out and rent stellar troops, it's like the same only 10,000 times best .
