A giant mutant squid with five tentacles, razor teeth and the ability to replicate its own cells terrifies a small Florida town. Several marine biologists, doctors and police plan to kill him. Meanwhile, a human monster called Miller offs people who discover the "Devilfish" is an artificial creation used for the greedy benefit of some evil doctors! Miller attacks a researcher, strangles her, drowns her in the tub, shoots the hair dryer, then rips the panties off her body! <br /> <br /> Many false alarms are triggered when our heroes Peter, Stella, Janet and Bob embarked on a high tech boat (high tech for 1984, anyway) to catch the creature, which is often seen in close-up or hilariously obvious that the fast-paced movie looks more threatening. And only the fire can destroy it, which leads to an armed possession of flamethrowers against the end of the aquatic beast. <br /> <br /> This money at JAWS is quite meek (plus a limp and decapitated corpse), but watchable and enjoys an excellent score by Antony Barrymore and a decent monsters design (again for 1984 ). Luigi Cozzi and Sergio Martino wrote the original story. <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
