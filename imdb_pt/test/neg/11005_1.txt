I got into this movie with an open mind. I was too lazy to go to the store to pick a movie, and my friend came back with that. I promised him I would not laugh at his choice, but in the first five minutes I told him that he would have to accept my promise. We kept watching, just hoping it would improve, but no; There followed a continual mental rape. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was probably one of the worst films committed, and certainly deserves a place in the IMDb Bottom 100. I really do not know how it happened. distributed. The lighting was dim. I have seen better acting in elementary school plays. There is nothing positive to say about it.
