Coming from 1988, Touch Of Death is probably the most frustrating film of Fulci I've ever seen so far, which has led me to join the chorus of horror fans who generalize that their films get worse as you get into your career. Considering the synopsis of the plot, I was expecting bloody fun with this, but despite all its bizarre flourishes, it seems tedious even at a run time of only 80 minutes, and suffers from nauseating production values ​​and cinematic output. (or lack thereof). <br /> <br /> El Story: A gambling addict, the widower lives and dines rich (and strange) women he encounters through lonely columns of hearts before taking them out in a horrible way - sometimes eating them or feed them animals - and steal their money to keep their debtors at bay. Of course, it is unlikely that only one man will be the host of so many pathologies at once (addicted, psycho / sociopathic, cannibal), but this is Fulci! <br /> <br /> The touch is really the cheapest and the most sparse looking Fulci movie I've seen. There is hardly anyone, even in the background of shots on the street, for example. A news reader who keeps appearing on the movie's TVs to warn the non-cast about the maniac's latest feats operates out of the most pathetic TV studio on the planet. He can not even look at the camera because he has to read all the headlines on misaligned sheets of paper. <br /> <br /> Some scenes continue and continue with the protagonist muttering to himself about what he did or what he is. about to do, but the performance is far from enough to support this kind of thing, so the main result is the boredom of the viewer. The film also looks tasteless and ugly in general. I read that if it was intended to be an Italian gizmo (it was already displayed there? With the amount of gore involved, it seems unlikely), and it does not appear to be a drug of old telemovie production values. <br /> <This is also Fulci's first foray into absolute black humor, but he is simply too dull a director to make it work. Sometimes a visibly cheerful or 'crazy' song is used to play against a horrible scene, for example, while the hero / villain is carving a dead body in their basement. The effect is not really creepy, funny or ironic, anything you'd like it to be - most of the time, it's just messy and bad. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, a few moments of gore (which you'll be waiting for while trying to stay awake), including the possible oven murder of a woman who simply will not give up on life, even after his face has been totally dismembered with a large bloody club, and a homeless man who gets a car running from side to side on him about five times. The most scandalous element of the Touch, however, is all the physical deformation of the wooed widows. Beards, hairy moles, messy sequins - it's not as if he'd sought out women with those traits, it's just the way all the widows in the lonely heart are, apparently. There are lots of pictures of Mr. Crazy secretly grimacing while he is kissing these women. The black humor of such gaudy misogyny might have some staying power or resonance if the film were not so poorly executed overall. In the end, Touch Of Death looks like a really sloppy mess and disjointed.
