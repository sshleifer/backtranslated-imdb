In 4 words, Captain Corelli's mandolin was "completely out of tune" with the book. The novel provided a sufficient basis for understanding the relationships and personal challenges that the characters needed to overcome; the screenwriter chose to ignore the details. By ignoring them (for example, the role of the priest initially as a clown, but then as a spiritual leader, the inability of the bride to read even taught by a socialist rebel, the advice of bomb experts to Corelli and his eventual ironic death ), the story and the characters fall flat. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I ever got out of the way. Interesting cinematography, great actors do not make a movie; history does.
