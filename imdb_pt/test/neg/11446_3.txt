This movie really left me thinking ... but not about the plot, the direction, the characters, an underlying message or a clever script. Far from it. I was wondering what on Sam Hill went wrong behind the scenes. Clearly, something was wrong from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by the positive comments of the film and the performance of Jodie Foster. From the beginning, it was clear that Foster had phoned for this interview. An earlier review even made a mention favorable to his facial expressions. I must have watched a different movie since Mrs. Foster (usually a personal favorite) seemed totally disinterested. In one of his first scenes with Foster, Fred Ward seems that he is also distracted by his lack of energy and he struggles to deliver his own lines with any enthusiasm. By the time he is called in to attend a supposedly desperate search for Foster, Ward also seems to have become embarrassingly discouraged by the project. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Dennis Hopper has always been a one-dimensional interpreter, so I was not expecting much from him ... and he delivered. <br /> <br /> Yes, this one left me thinking long after it was over. The fact that Joe Pesci and Charlie Sheen refused to have their names attached to the project suggests that this was a real obstacle for everyone involved. But then learn that the director preferred to hide behind a pseudonym who speaks volumes. <br /> <br /> But why listen to me? I always think Foster looks ridiculous in a dress, but she is sensational in lacy underwear.
