While not a big fan of the Coen brothers, I'm an admirer of their dark-haired comedy movies like 'Fargo' and 'Miller's Crossing'. I was much less impressed by your other comic mode, the goofy-camp (or is that Camp Goofy?) Unfortunately, 'The Brother, Where Are You?' falls into the last category and is not as good as 'The Big Lebowski' or 'The Hudsucker Proxy'. <br /> <br /> 'The Brother' is basically an episodic series of jokes without much sense, and not so much humor or cunning. As most reviewers have noted, the plot of the movie is very loosely ?? and, as far as I could tell, very arbitrarily? based on Odyssey. His main character, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), is an "adventurer" as Homeric namesake and aims to "return" home to prevent the marriage of his wife Penny with a suitor. Of course, we have not discovered that this is what the Clooney / Ulysses character really wants until long after we stop caring. And what does Homer have to do with "Cool Hand Luke" gang gangs, Ku Klux Klan encounters with "Indiana Jones" cults, lawyer's vocabulary, country singing talent, an association with Baby Face Nelson, a hairstyle identical to Clark Gable and other random and diverse features and encounters? I leave it to others to discern. <br /> <br /> The allusion to Preston Sturges' "Sullivan's Travels" in the title of "The Brother" is equally useless. Yes, viewers familiar with the classic comedy sturges minor may find it a bit rewarding to recognize the title of the socially conscious depression movie that Sullivan leaves Hollywood and comedy in the hope of doing. And they might even have a little fun with some filming / scene riffs (for example, riding a freight wagon, and the chain gang shuffling a movie). But so what? The Coen brothers seem to have nothing to add to art's critical debate about art against high moral seriousness about the function of art. They obviously fall into the old school, but this does not seem to motivate the reference at all. Is it a tribute? If so, why do that? I like postmodern pop culture reference and textual play as much as the next person, but is it much nicer when it comes to something at least tonally, if not thematically, consistent? and not just an arbitrary mix. <br /> <br /> This script is simply an idiot mess. The only consistent and consistently enjoyable element is the folk / country soundtrack. It does not have much to do with Homer or Preston Sturges, but considering the rest of the film, that's probably a good thing. On the other hand, I recommend using the price of admission on the CD of the soundtrack.
