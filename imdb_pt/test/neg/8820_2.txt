It's always interesting to watch a horror movie after hearing so many compliments from other fans. Experience has taught me that you should never generalize the taste of fans within a genre. My expectations regarding this movie were much higher than my opinion. <br /> <br /> Children should not play with dead things is a film with a good portion that often unfolds to carry it out. The whole idea of ​​a band of actors staging a reanimation of dead corpses intrigued me. However, everything has degenerated into cinematic chaos. The actors, who were mostly competent and incredibly expressive, received papers that could not maintain a consistent characterization. Some of these characters range from ambivalence over the whole act of desecrating a graveyard, to heartfelt criticism, back to ambivalence. One thing is that the characters change their minds throughout the film; another is to produce an overly dynamic and circular attitude that makes a loop every ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Another inconsistent element of this film is the premise. Does the main character want the ceremony to be a theatrical joke or does he really conspire with the spiritual forces of darkness to raise the dead? Even with the flaws mentioned above, I would recommend this movie to other horror fans as I believe only the true horror fans will appreciate the dark atmospheric components and will be able to ignore the plot's inconsistency. The scene in which the dead come out of the grave is extremely haunting (even for a veteran zombie enthusiast) for the excellent combined use of scenery and sound, and the great choice of skillful actors chosen to play the reanimated dead. Current filmmakers should learn from CSPWDT about using proper video and audio techniques in mood development. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are a zombie film critic like me, you should take the time to locate and watch this movie. It's a fun watch.
