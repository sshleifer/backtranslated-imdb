What a disappointment! I liked Jon Cleary's books on Scobie Malone, but there is little resemblance between him and Malone. In the books he is a city detective, who is dedicated to his wife and does not engage in fights. For the film the character has been tempered, in an outback copper that uses his fists and is not averse to jumping into bed with a beautiful girl, despite what she and the other sexual interest in the movie see in it, I do not know; Taylor was 39 at the time and her face was swollen. <br /> <br /> But your character's stamina is remarkable; he flies from Australia apparently goes directly to the commissary's house (somewhat recklessly trying to arrest him during a black tie reception), saves him from the murder (get into a fight in the process), goes to a casino with a girl, goes out with another and takes her to bed. So much for the jet lag! On the way back to the Commissioner's house (showing a good knowledge of the back streets of London), he is beaten by the bad guys, but he is still the first to go down for breakfast! It is also notable that the commissary's limo has its miraculously repaired windshield and headlights minutes after the assassination attempt and that a character has a poignant faith at the right time of a clock-activated bomb. <br /> <br /> The best thing is the contempt of Joseph, the butler, by the ill-mannered Malone. And at least the film avoids being a London travel diary, although some scenes occur during Wimbledon tennis week.
