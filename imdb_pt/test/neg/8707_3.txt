If you are a Christian or a Jew hoping to see an exact biblical (or Torah) portrait of the events in Exodus, you will be disappointed with this movie. In typical Hollywood fashion, people who are not even in the Bible were "created" to support characters and play an important role in the film. The role of Jethro is changed completely and he becomes nothing more than a suspicious father-in-law rather than a priest pastor who gave Moses excellent advice. God is largely removed from the film, and instead viewers have the impression that Moses had to figure things out for himself. Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> This film is a typical humanistic touch on biblical things and tries to put most of the responsibility on Moses for trying to understand what God wants and what he should do. Those who know the book of Exodus well will not only see inconsistencies in the film, but also clear changes in events. More importantly, they will see an almost total absence of God's dialogue with Moses, which determines all that Moses does after the burning bush. Far from being alone as portrayed in the film, Moses is guided by God with detailed and direct communication. Even Hallmark apparently can not recognize the direct role of God, and without his words spoken to Moses many events make no sense. To compensate, Hallmark has really changed a few things. For example, after the golden calf, God plagues the people and they should look at the symbol of a serpent to live. Hallmark creates a civil war and the Israelites choose sides, then kill themselves. Moses' side wins, of course. <br /> <br /> There may be a minimum value in this film for unbelievers, as this may prompt them to seek answers, but believers should stay away. Distorted events and changes make it a danger to those who do not know their Bible. Read Exodus for yourself, there is no substitute.
