Let me first say that I did not expect too much, and watching it at prime time on opening night should have helped. I believe it would have, if there were more than 20 people in the theater. <br /> <br /> It sucked so much. the acting was robotic at best and nothing was really explained until the last 30 minutes of the movie. I think that was their way of twisting the plot; keep everyone in the dark in crucial information to understand the direction of the cinema to the end and then explain things and hope you feel like a twist of the plot. Unknown to the end of the movie: -What Eff is a dark-ling? CG was cool but I want to understand! Why can not powers be desired? especially if mass murder is the ultimatum. "Why are you willing to dismiss such bad powers?" its just normal then, right? -who farted? <br /> <br /> About 50% of the minutes with only men onscreen were shots of them in wives' sprinters, sleeveless t-shirts and then a chilling scene of all teenagers in the smaller fair ride speedos knowing they were ever made. I swear you can see the beginning of the guys ... well, it was close to the soft-core. Of course there was a rain scene, and mixing it up was the DUDE. Cracks at the ends were plentiful, a sausage party in progress. But there was a single girl shower scene where nothing was seen and she paced the most beautiful dormitory for about 12 minutes. Then there was a PJ party for girls. the other thing I could not get over it was the amount of driving Caleb did on his Ford Mustang GT. was a ford commercial for about 1/4 of the film. <br /> <br /> I do not see it. or go see it with a friend who likes to make fun of bad movies. then it might be worth it. but do not expect anything to take your breath away.
