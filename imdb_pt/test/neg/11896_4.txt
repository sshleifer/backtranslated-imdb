In this sequel to the naked civil servant we see the final years of Quentin Crisp's life in New York. John Hurt is again Crisp (who else could play the role?) And it's a role he inhabits to the point of disappearing. For me, Hurt is Crisp and I've always found it very difficult to accept the man because Hurt was more of him than himself. His masterful performance. His equal is Denis O'Hare as Phillip Steele, long-time friend and confidante of Crisp. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately out of the presentations the film has little to recommend it. To be sure, the movie gets the right details. Filmed in New York and surrounding the movie, the film looks and feels like New York and its surroundings, but dramatically its kind of inert. It's Crisp talking to witty people, trying to come to terms with the world as he is (he ended up mourning some poorly chosen words about AIDS) and dealing with the sickness that the old man imposed on him. Quentin the man is always interesting, but his life as portrayed is not really. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed in the movie. I have always admired the man and his unique point of view. I just wanted him to be better served by this movie about his life.
