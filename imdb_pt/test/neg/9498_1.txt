Except for the bright look, this show had little to recommend it. The writing was paternalistic and complicated. Without exception, the characters were superficial and unfriendly. The female characters were the worst ... reduced to selfish, spoiled brats whose ambitious soul was to run in dresses and high heels, and try to pocket a man. This aspect of the series is even more curious, since the series was produced by two women! The acting was mostly bland and humorless, with the cast playing characters from one dimension attacking each scene on the same note. This is not totally the fault of the actors. If they had spent more time developing the characters and the plot, adding a little injection of style and humor, the MVP could have been a success. What we have left is something flat and vaguely unpleasant.
