My first warning should have been that this DVD was on sale for $ 5.00. But since she's had Sandra Bullock, which I usually like, I bought it. My disappointment at the film began almost immediately. The dialogues are slow and hard. The color is distorted. I kept adjusting the volume to hear the conversations. The acting is amateur. Even the murder scenes are a failure. Twice, dead people moved their legs. When my cash-poor daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie, I immediately and happily complied. This is an incredibly bad movie. Tomorrow I'm giving this dvd on the white elephant company's Christmas party.
