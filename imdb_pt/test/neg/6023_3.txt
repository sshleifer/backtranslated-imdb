"Clubbed" promotions project a movie that is based on the 1980s club scene. What we end up with is a film with identity issues. The subplots eventually assume what viewers would assume to be the main plot, so the focus on this movie being mostly about "clubbing" ends up being left in the gutter. <br /> <br /> Boxing, depression, self-loathing, gangsters, security guards, and drug dealing are all squeezed hastily in 90 odd minutes. In no less than 4 occasions I had to check the execution time of the film, because the concern was that this movie would disappoint. <br /> <br /> Which club scenes we see are bland and repetitive, featuring about 3 extras dancing in what is hardly recognizable as a "club", hardly capturing the vibrancy of the day. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie about the 80s club scene, something like what Human Traffic did in the late 1990s, forget about Clubbed.
