A mixed group of "experts" (explorers, divers and scientists) venture a mile underground and follow another 2.4 miles underwater to an even more remote location, where they find salamanders, giant albino moles and some large, sharp teeth. winged, computer generated creatures lurking about. The cave is closed by a landslide and then the monsters attack and start killing everyone when they search for a way out. And that's all she wrote with this low-end effort that still does not combine action, science fiction, and horror at the most elemental levels. Imagine if someone gave $ 30 million to Sci-Fi channel people to make a monster movie. This is exactly how THE CAVE is; almost surprising in its ineptitude at times, full of clichés and almost entirely dependent on the special effects to entertain. The only difference is that they had more money to build sets, more money to polish the monsters and more money to hire supposedly professional actors who give horrible performances anyway. Otherwise, it is business as usual. Some of these movies are still fun to watch. This is not and there are many reasons why: 1.) It takes very seriously and has no sense of humor. Then you get a completely non-original and predictable film that does not even recognize how unpredictable and original it is. <br /> <br /> 2.) The opening sequence serves no purpose other than killing a few minutes and increasing redundancy. <br /> <br /> 3.) Non-original-looking CGI creatures do not impress anyone. in this day and age. <br /> <br /> 4. Using shakycam and fast editing for your horror scenes is simply lazy, unimaginative. And why further blur the action by making things too dark and adding annoying distractions like fire and blast blast? This makes these scenes not only difficult to see but also impossible to enjoy, even at a simple action level. <br /> <br /> 5.) Even if you want to take it seriously, the script is full of clichés, the dialogue is horrible and there is no attempt at characterization. Launching 25-year-old models in roles as brilliant scientists and veteran explorers may provide some eyeshadows, but it completely kills the credibility of a film that otherwise would be completely upright. Sorry, you can not have both. <br /> <br /> 6. There are two exceptions to the rule of the model, since they decided to climb an older guy and a common-looking Joe. These were the first two dead characters. <br /> <br /> 7.) For a bit of diversity, they also shook a black guy and a Chinese guy. Strangely, not much voice is given in this film and it basically sits in the background, while Whitey discusses what will be the next step. Insulting <br /> <br /> 8.) Also, how many movies have to be done where a black character sacrifices his life at the end just to ensure that Hot White Female Lead and Hot White Male Lead end up together in the end? Ugh Give me some time already. <br /> <br /> 9.) Much of the acting was HORRIBLE. Cole Hauser's performance was completely laughable. The other male leader seemed to have just gotten off the set of a soap opera and gotten used to the patented, dim-witted technique that makes women faint, which is the PG-13 genre equivalent to big breasts technique, make them all -colored glasses, often worn by women in quality films. Either way, his performance was completely called. Daniel Dae Kim (from the TV series "Lost") and Piper Perabo also filled the room with their formal and monotonous delivery. <br /> <br /> 10.) The end of a joke? Absolutely terrible. Please God, we do not need a sequel to this crap. So, basically, I would not bother with this, unless you've never seen a monster movie before or if you're really desperate and the only other thing is "The Simple Life". The sets were good, the blue tint was good and some of the actors (Lena Headey, Marcel Iures ...) did the best they could, so I decided to raise the note to a "2".
