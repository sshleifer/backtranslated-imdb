Okay, he has a pretty joke and joke (when the dead are coming up from their graves, the names of the old "horror" directors like Jacques Tournier and Jean Yarborough are featured on the tombstones) and the crushing of reputable villains with moral rights bankrupt is on target: indecent skanks preaching morality etc. But why are these soldiers anti-Republican?

Why was this story made from a movie? Questions never answered ...
