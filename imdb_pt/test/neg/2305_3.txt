Jacqueline Susann has written several novels, all involving sex and melodrama, and some of them, in fact, have been turned into films, including that effort, and they all have the distinction of being some of the worst movies ever made. The story here is about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law) and his rise to the top of television for being relentless and calculating to everyone around him. He is a playboy of the worst kind using and then throwing away all the women he beds, including the wife of the president of the IBC network. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Greg Austin (Robert Ryan) is responsible for the IBC television network and when his younger wife, Judith, takes a look at Robin, she does not You waste time going to bed with him. Greg gets sick and has to take some time and that's when Robin comes in and starts trying to manage the network, but during all this, a model named Amanda (Jodi Wexler) who is in love with him kills himself. When Greg returns to his job, he tries to get rid of Robin using the moral clause in his contract as rumors begin to fly over his relationship with Jerry Nelson (David Hemmings), a gay fashion photographer. <br /> <br /> It was directed by Jack Haley Jr. who went on to be a very successful producer on both television channels and movies but this was only his second film as a director and the material he was forced to deal seems to be over his head! The script comes from Susann's novel and would probably be why this resembles a cross between "Alfie" and "The Doll's Valley" and I think the reason his books have never managed to translate well into film is because the filmmakers committed the terrible mistake of taking her stories seriously instead of the tongue on her cheek. With that, the laughs that come from that are not intentional, especially during that totally ridiculous fight at the end of the movie, which begins when Cannon refuses to return the slave bracelet to gay characters! Hemmings was a very good actor, but his role here is completely exaggerated and he has one of the worst beards in history and uses the term "chic" in all other phrases. Law was not the original choice for the protagonist, but another actor who was cast suffered a serious accident, and Law stepped in and made one of the more wooden presentations on this side of Miles O'Keeffe. The screenplay of the movie suffers in two different areas in which it is completely silly and terribly annoying and will test the patience of viewers if they choose to watch it. One wonders what would be the result if a director decides to film one of Susann's novels and not take it seriously, because the attempt here is ponderous and ridiculous.
