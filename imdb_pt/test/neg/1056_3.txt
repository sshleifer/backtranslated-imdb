Sorry to disagree with you, but I found the DKC series quite interesting. So much that I invested in the SNES system and my own copies of the games. That is, remember, almost ten years after the initial release of DKC 1. The graphics were groundbreaking for their time, the first vector graphics games for home systems. The music and the characters are memorable, and the games brought me and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment. It is true that the second game was better than the first, and the third might have missed the 'advantage' of the second installment. But all three offered different games and I appreciate them to this day. By the way, I'm old enough to remember when there were no video games (and TVs were black and white!).
