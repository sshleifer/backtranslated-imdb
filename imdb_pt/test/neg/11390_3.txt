Brainy, cross-dressing boy finds success in the Spelling Bee circuit, despite an unconventional and dysfunctional education. Shirley MacLaine directs and stars the child's grandmother, and it's always fascinating to see long-time actors having the chance to direct a film, the material they are drawn to, and the actors they choose to work with. Here, the only well-designed person in "Bruno" is MacLaine. The young actors seem to have been chosen for their brightness and cuteness, and Maclaine's soft heart holds its closes for excruciatingly long periods; nothing about these cherubim seems natural, not the lines that fall unaware of their mouths or the interaction they have with adults or even with each other. Like the boy's disgruntled father, poor Gary Sinise hangs on the edges, with false shame, always with an expression of pain on his face. At the end of the film, MacLaine transforms the whole thing into a passel of scenes of hugs, and even concludes with the boy embracing the Pope in Rome! Another treatise from a talented actress who became a director and who, like Sally Field and her movie "Beautiful", does not seem to stop blinking and poking the audience. Shirley uses ethnicity for shtick and childish innocence as a joke. The children in this cast roll their eyes, crack wisely at mature comments, use heavy words - but when a boy speaks hoarsely calls our giant "gay" hero, MacLaine's grandmother instructs him to punch the boy (at the front of the media!). How's that for progression? * in ****
