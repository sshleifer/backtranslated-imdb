Hey, remember when Hal Hartley was brilliant? What a time that was. I would say that the Book of Life was when things really began to decay, but I will say that at least it has risen from this. A film that seems to have been shot on someone's cell phone would not have to be a bad thing if it were distinguished by an interesting story and dialogue, but unfortunately those are missing along with Hartley's quirky and quirky dialogue. In its place is a tedious exposition on end-times Christian themes and a trite story of a modern Jesus in a dilemma, packed into a modern world trying-to-be-hip-modern where everyone looks like someone out of a Hal Hartley movie . While picking up a little on your second half, it's never nice, or especially wise. What the hell happened to you, Hartley?
