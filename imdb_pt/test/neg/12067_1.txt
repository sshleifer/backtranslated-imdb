The cover and the premise that writing there is so promising. As a maniac slasher I expect a lot from that. But what the hell is going on. The movie is horrible. The direction, the plot, the suspense and the act of the castles are so amateur. I even thought they are using a homemade video camera to shoot. Luck that it still manages to deliver some good moments for me that make me have to like it. Thanks for the bad package called "Camp Blood". <br /> <br /> 1/10
