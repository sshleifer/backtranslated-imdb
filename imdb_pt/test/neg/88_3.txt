Wow, what an overrated movie that ended up being! It was to be "an extremely suspenseful story of a crazed murderer who kept a woman hostage and terrified in her home." Well, I doubt it terrified the public in the early 1950s and I know that would put the audience asleep today. <br /> <br /> "It involves shivers in the spine," proclaims the New York Times. No, the only shiver I have is that someone is left on the planet and believes in anything the NY Times prints about anything. Well, it was about a demented man who kept a woman hostage for a short time. in his house, but the man. "Howard Wilton" (Robert Ryan) was really harmless and friendly. In fact, this was one of the best roles Ryan has ever played! Yes, "Wilton" was crazy, but he never harmed the woman and just wanted a friend to trust. <br /> <br /> The movie became boring after a while, with very little happening, but very chatty. <br /> <br /> Beware, my reader ..... this sucks.
