We gave this movie a lousy star, however, it really depends on how you look at it. At the moment, we're watching it on Channel 5 at 3:30 in the morning, and we do not stop laughing, so maybe we could give 10, just for the entertainment value. From the outset, with the "maniac" thoughts of the harasser being conveyed in a comic way, we were laughing. It's me or that girl from Knott's Landing looks like one of the Dark Crystal characters. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin everything for you, however, you'd have to be dumb enough to see it coming, I do not think it's clever enough for double bluffing. <br /> <br /> This has to be the worst / best movie we've ever seen, if we were playing the cliche 'drinking game, then we'll be wasted now.
