wow, this movie sucked. <br /> <br /> This movie was an embarrassment to the original sandlot. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie was horrible. <br /> <br /> The acting was horrendous. Every portion, except the manager's share of the "Mexican" sandwich, was terrible. <br /> <br /> Luke Perry, though only small parts were absolutely terrible. This was the worst role of all time. Even the kid actor playing him as a kid was someone you'd want to punch, even in the end, lol. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of those children's films that give an extra touch making a goofy part far beyond the funny stage. The mood was for 6 year olds. <br /> <br /> If you are over 12 and want something worth watching, skip this movie and watch a sitcom instead.
