There is a reason the world has forgotten these creatures: they are dull. This is a hammer production, which means that whoever made this film should be hit with a hammer several times if possible - and where it most hurts. Most people think more of giving a crap than these idiots put out to make this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously now? The movie begins with some cavemen hunting an antelope thing. Now, antelopes must have evolved a lot since prehistoric times because they actually attack and kill people here. After that, it was time to meet the rest of the tribe: more bearded men, some fashion models, and even some very old and gray grandmas and grandmothers. These old men, of course, have never heard of people in the caves who did not exceed the age of thirty; they refused to bow to the will of prehistoric logic and records, so that they remain alive. One of the cavemen is not bearded; he is shaved Not as shaven as Tarzan, The Lord of the Humanoid Beard to Make Rushing the Jungle since Childhood and Without a Razor, but there. <br /> <br /> What follows is the obligatory destruction of the earthquake / molten lava. a sequence that causes many of our not-so-furry friends to find their misfortune. It is interesting to note that before the earthquake fashion models showed more of her breasts. After that, they must have gotten shy or something, because they covered their breasts for a while (maybe they were covered with ashes, so I mistakenly thought they were covered). More action follows in the form of two fashion models fighting in the sand; the next best thing for female mud wrestling, I suppose. After a good part of the desert has been crossed, our black-haired tribe finds itself - otherwise it could be - a blond tribe. Yawn. <br /> <br /> More fascinating things follow. There's that redheaded fashion model who's bothered to see a cave teen kill a porcupine thing. There is also the scene of a woman dying in childbirth: the fashion models of the caves are so fragile. Eventually we managed to find an even darker, dark-skinned tribe, that is, an evil tribe. One of them becomes a WWF champion after he hits for real (!) A huge bear thing in a wrestling match. 1,2,3 ... and it is done: the bear is the loser. We also witnessed a jealous caveman miraculously recovering from two serious injuries: first he is stabbed with a large spear in the thigh, but he moves away from it as if it were just a scratch. So he is thrown off a cliff - on a big stone - by the blond-of-two-shoe cave man, but he walks away as if thrown on a giant sofa. It is unclear at the end whether he dies of falling off an even bigger cliff or if the voodoo doll is being crushed. Oh yes, voodoo was used in prehistoric times by white tribes who live in the desert and whose females were fashion models. It is always important to learn from the movies. The message of the film is as insightful as it is educational: cave people liked to fight for local power and also loved their fashion models. As if any respectable cave man struggled to be the leader of such an unhappy pack.
