Although Stephen Gyllenhaal is a good TV director with some good credits, "Homegrown" is just a mess in his script and direction. Despite the performances of Billy Bob Thorton, John Lithgow, Kelly Lynch, Jon Bon Jovi, Jamie Lee Curtis and Ted Danson, such a good cast could not save the film. <br /> <br /> Gyllenhaalics will know that Jake and Maggie are in the movie, but you do not see Jake very well and Maggie is only in it for 30 seconds as a nanny informing the character of Lithgow about a bust. It's not even a lowbrow marijuana comedy like the movie was meant to be. It just was not funny.
