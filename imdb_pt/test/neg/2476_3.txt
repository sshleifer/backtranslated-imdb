Nothing about this movie stands out as being grand or terrible. <br /> <br /> In the end, that's what kills him. The softness is simply not good. I can not say I expected better from Will Smith, but I definitely did Kevin James from "The King of Queens" - but hey, I'm getting used to saying this a lot lately. This movie tries to make its mark as a witty romantic comedy, but never reaches the target. In fact, it never reaches * anywhere * within the target. The allergy scene is disturbing; the fact that Kevin James can not dance is something that would not catch anyone off guard and so (in a movie like that) is not funny. This movie constantly tries to win your heart, but always with the wrong trick at the wrong time. Some parts are fine (but I'm looking in my brain for examples), but I really think this movie should be avoided.
