I watched this movie just because it was expected to be another David Dhawan artist. <br /> <br /> Bad Bad Comeback by David Dhawan.He made many funny movies in the past that did not make sense, but none of them was a fucking bag !! What waste of talent and beauty was it? Donno because the actors agree to make a movie like this. <br /> <br /> There was nothing practical about this movie. The film is below standard and does not justify standard and potential Bollywood has. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth watching in this movie was Katrina, but we do not need to watch a movie like this to see it! Being a remake of the Hollywood film Hitch its clear that Bollywood directors can not even make a proper remake. I think this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Awesome 1/10
