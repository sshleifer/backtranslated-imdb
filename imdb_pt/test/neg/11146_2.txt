this movie sucks big. so many holes in the plot. if the devil is invincible, why does he require the protection of bodyguards arnies? I could not understand why arnie did not show up for work for several days and then he suddenly shows up, picks up all his arsenal and disappears again !! Good job if you can. It is sad that the last half hour has resulted in the end of the series 'uzi 9mm'. Arnies's interpretation of a depressed cop is to lower his head and sniff. I thought he had a cold for most of the movie. Terribly scripted, Arnie is called 'friend', 'guy' etc by 95% of the movie and then all of a sudden we hear him being called by his real name Jericho Cane (where do they get those names from?). The end is so sweet that it is better to prepare the bargain bag. It's a shame that Gladiator has achieved the same end with 100% more class. <br /> <br />
