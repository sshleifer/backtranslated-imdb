I was so excited to finally watch "Pulse" after receiving it from Amazon, and I must say I was totally disappointed. I think maybe I'm too excited. I had expectations set by his fans that simply could not be met. After loving other Asian horrors, I thought I knew it would find a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The story was slow, painful. I am a diversified fan of horror. I love the brutal and bloody madness of "The Devil's Rejects" and I also love the steady and growing macabre "A Tale of Two Sisters". "Pulse" offered little of any spectrum, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Along with the slowness of the plot, it was also very confusing. I had no idea why the characters were doing what they were doing and how what they were doing would help their problem. It seemed that the director would leave the plot in a sentence or two and the rest would be improper for our actors. Unlike "A Tale of Two Sisters", which also has a rather difficult storyline to follow, "Pulse" clarifies very little at the end and left me feeling frustrated, confused and disinterested in the efforts of the characters. My final statement about the plot was its inconsistency. At first it seemed that the story was about the overflowing ghost world and its means of escape is the Internet. This is an original idea. I like it. But as the plot continues, unfolding plots and unexplained happenings, it seems the director has shifted to an apocalyptic tale (as is evident at the end) that simply was not clear enough to run. <br /> <br /> I realize the sadness of the shots and the scenery was intentional to make the viewer look gloomy and isolated, but the numbing of the film was only intensified by the gritty and gloomy environment. I admit there was a certain sense of surrealism with the film, but that may have just been my diminishing attention. <br /> <br /> The actions of some of the characters are a bit ridiculous too, and maybe if I was more fascinated by the story I would have been able to suspend more disbelief, but also being demotivated, as well as some of the characters. As I mentioned earlier, the logic behind what certain characters did was absent and contributed to the incoherence of the plot. Maybe it was the result of the incoherence of the plot that the characters do questionable things. To be honest, I do not care. <br /> <br /> The performance was decent. Certainly nothing exceptional but nothing terrible. No outlier to mention on either side of bright or sleazy horrible. <br /> <br /> Now I will stop sounding so sour and will mention that there were a handful of chilling moments. One in the end, especially if there was more like it all, I would have appreciated this movie (almost) altogether. I thought that whenever the site was displayed it would be quite disturbing, as would some of the ghostly encounters our two main characters face. The things that happened between these horrible misunderstandings were simply dull, bewildering and "WTF" for me to really appreciate. <br /> <br /> Now, for something related to the DVD itself ... the release of "Magnolia" Pulse "comes with subtitles, yes, but the subtitles are turned off.They are not quoted at the correct time of the speech of the I think this is the only North American release of the movie, so you have to deal with or watch the dubbing (NEVER WATCH DUBBING !!!) If you are looking for another scary Asian movie theater I can recommend you "Audition", "Shutter", " , "A Tale of Two Sisters", "Strange Circus" and "Marebito" - all of which are more my palette.
