This movie is an aborted, undead attempt to put together several bad movies and make some kind of extra-bad movie. He even fails in this, since there is a lot of "plot", and not nearly enough of goofy dolls and ridiculous blood. Seriously, the dolls are cute, and the suit guys do me a lot of good. The performances are at best C-grade and lame all over, with special props for the Spec-Ops guy who spoke some sort of bizarre East Coast / Venusian dialect that was almost impossible to decipher. Not that you really care what he says, because only the words of cursing are different. Cinematographically, it's not offensive, pretty much what you would expect from cheap cheap junk (like the script). The fact that New Concorde has used images from the films "Carnosaur" is offensive and rather confusing. To shame, New Concorde. For shame. "Carnosaur" is one of my favorite favorite movies, and they somehow spoiled everything and made it almost unattainable. Watch the movies "Carnosaur" if you want to see the dinosaur chaos. <br /> <br /> I give her a star because I like the movies so much that she steals so much, and also because the scale does not have zero.
