Oh, here it is! A movie, which is said by people to remind me of the epic "Trainspotting". OUCH, I was a fool to believe it, and OUCH, how my buttocks ached after having forced me to watch this c ** p from beginning to end. After the first 10-15 minutes, I just wanted it all to end, or at least they could put some nudity or cool acid house music or action on it to make it worth the time ... But no, when I broke up with him, I put it on the shelf of my CD and hope to never have to take it off again just to show it to some friend who is so eager to see that he does not want to hear my warnings.
