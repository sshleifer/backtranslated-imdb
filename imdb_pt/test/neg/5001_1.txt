I do not know what the appeal of this film is, but I could not find it. It's a very long conversation, hardly credible and hardly lucid among three guys on a set. <br /> <br /> He does not move anywhere, the characters are totally bizarre, the underlying plot equally the same. You're lost in me, definitely a movie out. <br /> <br /> The only thing that holds you back from going out is the never-realized possibility that it might have some kind of significant point or climax, and the fact that, All irritation aside from banal personalities, they they acted reasonably. But you have to prepare for an endless dialogue, wishing on many occasions that Teach will only close% * and * for a moment.
