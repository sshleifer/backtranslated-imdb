I am very surprised to see that this movie has gained lukewarm ratings, I find this film absolutely horrible. The plot flate around trying to decide whether it's a comedy or a thriller, so realize that it can not reach anyone. So he throws in the towel and continues with his absurd plot highlighted with an unintentional hilarious scene with Laura Linney, an injection, and poured coffee that leaves the public writhing awkwardly in their seats looking at each other as this is real? Basically, it's abysmal and really disappointing for Robin Williams fans, and that makes you think someone has blackmailed Laura Linney into adding this piece of crap to her respectable resume. I wanted to leave after 10 minutes and I would have, even seeing it for free, I wanted someone to pay me for my time lost. The computer crash in this movie was embarrassingly stupid and, in the end, you do not care who wins the election. I direct vote on DVD.
