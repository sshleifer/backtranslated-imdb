I can not imagine what Jon Voight POSSIBLY thought of when he got involved with this tenth, incoherent, pretentious, and numbing slop. He helped write the so-called "script," and he should be very well ashamed of it. The movie (I can not call it a "movie" because it barely moves) is rambling, embarrassingly pretentious - something like a very bad show of Oprah Winfrey, but even worse. He wanders senseless from a medieval period to that of Los Angeles, with Voight as a television producer who thinks he is the reincarnation of a medieval prince who must save the kingdom from the machinations of his evil brother and somehow it is transferred . to modern times, where Voight has to save the country from the evil machinations of an oil company executive. If the bizarre cast (Wilfrid Brimley, Frankie Valli (!), Kaye Ballard and Armand Assante, among others) is not enough to kill him, the stupidly inept direction, the faded photograph (it looks like it was filmed with a 16mm camera actually cheap), almost complete lack of editing (the scenes continue indefinitely or are cut off in the middle of a sentence), and Voight's embarrassing "flow" voice is enough to bury him. , which is exactly what should have been done with it. A jaw-dropping experience. Avoid this dog at all costs.
