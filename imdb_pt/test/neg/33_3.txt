Sorry, but Jacqueline Hyde has some of the worst interpretations on this side of hardcore porn, not to mention a script apparently written by a first-grader with non-learning disabilities diagnosed <br /> <br /> Jackie Hyde inherits an old mansion by a grandfather whom she never knew had. Guess who? Yes, an inventor of the special formula that slowly takes care of body and mind - yes, Mr. Hyde! <br /> <br /> Despite some enjoyable scenes, this movie does not record any feelings or emotions other than uncontrollable laughter. <br /> <br /> As much as Jackie tries, she can not get away from grandfather's special formula and the result is an hour and a half of wasted time.
