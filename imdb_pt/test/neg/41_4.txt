The film begins with a cult leader trying to resurrect a dead member with his followers singing for his rebirth as the sun hits them in the desert. Reanhauer (Bill Roy) sincerely believes in his power, and gets so excited that he collapses with what appears to be a heart attack. Unable to keep him alive, everyone involved, doctors and nurses, are sentenced to attack with Reanhauer's demonic spirit invading the curvaceous body of nurse Sherri (Jill Jacobson) looking at each one using it as a tool of revenge. Forced against her will, with no memory of inflicting such damage, Sherri's murders were selected. Fortunately, Sherri's coworker, nurse Tara (Marilyn Joi) begins a rather flourishing novel with a blind patient, Marcus Washington (Prentiss Moulden), once a star soccer player whose mother was a voodoo practitioner. Through the knowledge of Marcus, passed on by his mother, Tara discovers about possession and how to possibly save Sherri before she murderes all unknowingly. Meanwhile, Sherri's mistress, Dr. Peter Desmond (Geoffrey Land), worries about her current condition and well-being. <br /> <br /> Well, this was my first Al Adamson movie and I must agree with your detractors that, just with that. film alone, it seems he holds them together with paper clips and Elmer's glue. The animation with which we see the spirit take control of Sherri is beyond terrible and quite laughable. A little soft-core nonsense like stuffing, some demonic possession played in the mix (Sherri actually speaks in another voice when she's possessed), with disobedient nurse behavior (the three nurses focused on the movie are all sexually active and free - crazy) and a bit of violence / gore. The film is essentially filmed in tiny rooms with bland dialogues from a mundane cast. Sexual situations are not so hard, and Al often films them without revealing them all. The film looks embarrassingly cheap and there is an absence of emotions, although the chilling punctuation (which sounds like something from Dark Shadows) helps a bit. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass (.. like the nurse Beth who seems to be a nymphomaniac if she will even roll a nut, always complaining of diseases he does not really have, chest hair enough to declare him a Neanderthal) t bad look, and Adamson's story line, though fragile, is somewhat consistent (it seems he rarely directs movies that are). Overall, the film seems to cost $ 5 and Adamson just can not beat budget constraints (.. or, in my opinion, create an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a tedious and sometimes tedious narrative scenes that do little for the story) . John F Goff has the role of hospital psychiatrist who wants to commit Sherri, not believing the idea that she was possessed, he constantly quarrels with Peter for her. I watched the "missed" version without rating which I think is the real version to watch from nurse Sherri.
