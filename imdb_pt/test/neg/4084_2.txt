The only way for me to feel good about having spent those precious minutes of my life is to tell someone how horrible it was every day. And even if I say that once a day, every day for the rest of my life, I will not fully understand what I mean. Just dumb. <br /> <br /> There's a difference in movies like this and movies like Elephant or Fat Guy Goes Nutzoid, two of my other favorite movies. The last two were terrible, yes, but that was it. Evan Almighty takes a strong cast and tries to kill them all. Wanda Sykes, Jonah Hill, John Goodman and Steve Carrell ... WHY GOD WHY? All these people have a much better talent, now every time I see any of them, I'll think of this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this 2 instead of 1 was when I saw the movie. , there was an elderly woman with mental problems who thought the flurry of bird-poop and pickle-by-tool-while-building jokes was so funny she kept laughing all the time, almost caressing several times.
