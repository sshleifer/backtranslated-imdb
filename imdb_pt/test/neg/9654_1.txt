I bought this because it was $ 1.99 and Harry Carey was in it and a friend of mine was in it, and for $ 1.99, how bad could it be? So I read a few comments here in the movie and I started to get excited - maybe this really was a lost jewel, one of those fantastic B movies that everyone had forgotten but deserved to be resurrected. WRONG! I'm not sure how anyone else can give this thing the praise it received from some neighborhoods here, but I found one of the most tedious and full of hits I've ever seen. And I'm not talking about Richard Carlson's Texan accent (straight from Texas, I think). You're just an idiot. Nobody in the movie behaves like a real human being. Nobody. And nobody does anything believable or interesting. It's not even a clich√© fest. It's only 80 and a few minutes of passing frames. He even managed to make Harry Carey, Maria Ouspenskaya and C. Aubrey Smith boring. Now this is unbelievable.
