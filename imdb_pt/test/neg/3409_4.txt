First, just to say that I did not get the edition I thought I would do - I chose the Italian version of R2, but what really came was a UK release in 1998 - claiming to be a special edition - I never knew there was a release in DVD in the UK - but the biogas promised was not on the record - just a couple of trailers. Anyway - as for the movie itself - as I was recovering from "Night TRain Murders" my second genital mutilation thriller appears in the same month - this time in (an Italian) British Nubian girls are being offed and Professor Fabio Testi - (unhappy) married, but preaching one of his students - becomes the prime suspect. Joachim Fuchsberger is the case detective. Sorry to say that I was less than in a trance. It was watchable, but more than equally missible, and beyond the horrible nature of the crime, the "surprise" of killing Cristina Galbo, who was actually "spoiled" by the cover of the DVD telling me about it - Grrrrrr !!!! and a surprise twist that launched the "victims" in a new light - I thought this was very routine. However, I did not disappoint the two "strings". with Karin (Hannibal Brooks) Baal and Camille (I spit in his grave) Keaton.
