This film takes a look at the suffering a family experiences with the death of a child, and the healing that can finally reach them. <br /> <br /> The family learns about the death of their son on Christmas Eve 1991, ruining the Christmas season for them. They do not celebrate again for many years. There is an interesting comment from the daughter who will remind viewers to consider the needs of surviving children in such a situation. The character of Matthew makes a reference to Jesus, but I suspect that other comments he makes come from non-Christian sources. I wonder if some other viewer would recognize such comments. If so, it would be an interesting addition to the data on this movie.
