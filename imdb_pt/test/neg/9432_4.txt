A wonderful semi-humorous homage to the expressionist black-and-white films of people like FW Murnau, Fritz Lang, Carl Dreyer, Marcel Carn√© and others. Allen plays a character trapped in a Kafkaesque nightmare, at first thinking that he is part of a group of vigilantes trying to capture a killer and slowly realizing that he may be a suspect. The writing is a bit forced (after all, Woody Allen trying to be a timid Kafka), but the question is asked, and no harm was done. Cinematography is interesting, about 100 shades of gray, but be sure to watch in a very dark room with a good screen, or details will be swallowed by haze. This is a fun little movie with a few laughs that are actually a kind of "uh-huh". The acting is good considering the odd vehicle, and it's worth seeing if you're a big fan of Woody Allen. Also of interest to those connoisseurs of expressionist films. I would give this a 6.5 out of 10.
