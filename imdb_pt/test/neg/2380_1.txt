This movie almost gave me a nervous breakdown. When I was recovering from appendicitis a few years ago, I had just started teaching in high school. The whole teaching business was a bit stressful for a beginner, but to mentally prepare myself to go back to the classroom, I decided to watch some horrible movies. Flintstones was one of the films I chose, and then I put "King Of The Streets" (the British title for 'Alien Warrior'). Just before I finished, I was almost in tears for the sheer waste of everything ... my life, the movie stock, the two pounds I paid a few weeks ago in the rental section of Blockbuster, must have taken to print the cover of art, the effort of the editors and musicians involved in the soundtrack (as insignificant as their efforts were) ... the list goes on. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. Let me make that clear - I LOVE watching bad Blockbusters movies. Me and my partner Dan used to sit and watch the many, many horrors of the cheap and laugh at them. But this was a different kind of low-quality film. I do not think anything has come close to that, not even Tobe Hooper's "Death Trap" (which is probably my second worst movie in the world). The whole making a car from the abandoned parts section almost killed me; repeating music at any available opportunity regardless of on-screen events; the whole .... AAAGGGHHHHHHH !!!!! I can not even continue this "critical" dissection, since my reflex of vomiting has begun. The futility of this film, even now, three years after watching it for the first and last time, still leaves me speechless (but I can still type). The whole section "making a car from strange parts" made me contemplate horrible things. <br /> <br /> I beg you, if you're interested in watching this movie, just look at the cover of the video and imagine the worst possible version of the back story synopsis. I can almost guarantee it will not be half as bad as this movie really is. Do not, under any circumstances, consider actually observing it for any reason. Not if you are a Christian and want to see an allegory of Christ; not if you are a bad movie aficionado and want to try the true nadir of garbage; not even if you want your life to seem longer (and believe me, every second that this movie turns seems to take at least a minute). Make no mistake about it, this movie is profane. It is the antichrist in the form of video. As Bo Cattlett in Get Shorty said, "I've seen better movie in the teeth."
