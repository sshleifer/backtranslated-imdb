You have to start worrying when you see that Michael Madsen is leading the cast of any movie. I will not go through the list of shame that is your film career. <br /> <br /> I watched 45 minutes and still was not sure what was really going on. The film consisted of a love-hate relationship between Madsen and Argento, which was basically Madsen insulting her, threatening violence and generally treating her like dirt. She, on the other hand, loves him, so she does not, so she does, wants him, then loves him again ...... what's wrong with you woman !!!! <br /> <br /> The script is horrible, bad soundtrack and aggressive and crude nonsense sexuality, which, I believe, has been added to attract some viewers, since the film has little to offer. I would have given the movie 1, but it only got a 2 with a little excitement in the last 20 minutes. He actually answered a question in the closing minutes, but I'm not going to share it, I'm going to make you suffer all over the movie like I did.
