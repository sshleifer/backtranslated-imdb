I really wanted to like this movie. Great cast ?? Walter Pidgeon in a role that reminds us of his iconic "Forbidden Planet," Barbara Eden and Robert Sterling as young lovers, Frankie Avalon as a musically inclined sailor (is a guy in a submarine a sailor?), Even Peter Lorre as a scientist with a fondness for sharks. Maybe it's a good kid movie, but I had trouble staying awake. Lorre was severely underused. I think he was a red herring, like Pidgeon? you expect him to go crazy and try to play the hero or his girl in the shark tank. No such luck. By the way, why is there a tank of sharks in a submarine? It's typical of the film's lack of ambition. They explain why Lorre is coming and going from the shark (because we're seeing this), but we just hope we'll accept the fact that there's a shark in this sub for some reason. "Search?" Yes, scientists are always doing this research material, who can understand them? Of course, if there was not a shark, who would kill the evil psychologist (Joan Fontaine)? I'm sorry, but even the 1950s children's films are capable of being less predictable and downright stupid (not to mention exploitation). The first 10 or 15 minutes really boosted my hopes. Great theme song sung by Frankie Avalon. Pidgeon taking Floyd the Barber (Howard McNear really, sorry Howie loved you in "Blue Hawaii") and Joan Fontaine on a guided tour, careful to jump the room with the huge "WARNING" sign on the door, past Peter Lorre with sharks above mentioned, and then we see a full-screen image of Eden shaking her money maker for the passionate play of Avalon! The movie quickly descends from there. There is no real explanation for the storm threatening the Earth, so there is a clear lack of dramatic tension and no villain to get along. Instead, Pidgeon's character is transformed into an unconvincing red herring of the Ahab variety (I think "The Caine Riot" was still fresh in people's minds), and Fontaine's character suddenly turns ill for no reason at all. Last. Oh, I suppose the reason is that it's a surprise to the public. And it is kind of surprising, since the only negative thing she did was to speak ill of the captain's mental health and there is still no reason for her to have sabotaged after revealing that she is the villain. Very poorly done and unconvincing. The guy who was the pessimistic Bible nut was better? at least his character made sense. <br /> <br /> So, what else could go wrong? Infinite, endless dive pictures. I never understood the appeal of this kind of thing. A giant squid attacks the ship for a minute, just like this there is a monster for the theatrical trailer. Maybe this has fooled some people into thinking it would be an adventure and fantasy film instead of a half-suspense movie about military scientists who are never wrong. Yes ?? perhaps the worst of all, is just a fantasy film let alone a science fiction movie. This never did anything to my imagination, because the whole premise was nothing more than another disaster / apocalypse and these characters never experience any sense of admiration or discovery. I broke up with Irwin Allen. I never liked his movies later, but this made me pretend to be Jules Verne when in fact it's just another formula exercise in disaster escapism. The whole movie is just waiting to see which character will turn evil and die. He has always hired an actor / actress with a charming and presentable screen personality to play these roles and that is the only element of "surprise" to be found, since there is no logic to these characters anyway. What a waste of pathetic time for these actors. George Pal movies are 100 times better (the only one who was lame was "Atlantis", which, coincidentally, was the most Allen-esque), full of wonder and excitement and ?? think about it! ??? ideas! In addition to some effects scenes and Barbara Eden, there is nothing worth seeing here in my opinion. I think it's good fun for those who are in disaster movies, but I think they are a hollow and boring genre of movies.
