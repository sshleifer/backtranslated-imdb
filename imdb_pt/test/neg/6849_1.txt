To truly appreciate this movie you had to be there (acting?) Or have been a member of the team. <br /> <br /> Yes, I am "Selena", and at the ripe old age of 42, I have serious doubts about what we were doing / did. <br /> <br /> It all started as something like "John Waters," friends acting badly on bad movies. Somewhere along the line, the fun was interrupted, the people who were supposed to be friends no longer spoke, and the ADB got worse. <br /> <br /> I regret the bad image I could have projected. A size of gold spandex pants,) <br /> <br /> Other than that, the movie is so bad, I would not even make my mom watch it. <br /> <br /> For my director, cast and crew I say, <br /> <br /> "Why can not we get along?" <br /> <br /> It's been over twenty years , people !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!
