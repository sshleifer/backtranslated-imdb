This film is essentially a "how-to" about how to be a well-connected pedophile. I am surprised that so many people - especially other gay men - have watched this movie and read the book, and no one mentioned the fact that if Weber were not an influential photographer he would be in jail, making time for child abuse. Poor Peter Johnson. Weber led this poor, naive (albeit incredibly handsome) teenager he met at a training camp for high school wrestlers in the Midwest, brought him to live in his home and took thousands of homoerotic photos of him, many of them full-frontal. nude, throughout Johnson's adolescence. This is not art. It's child abuse. Worse, Weber made a lot of money on it, and poor Johnson will have serious "problems" for the rest of his life. Weber's lascivious love for the boy is frankly scary, as are his ramblings about famous (and not so famous) people he knows as he tries to complete Johnson's "education." Scary and then simply annoying. The only thing I can say about the movie is that it's a fascinating study of self-deception. But I can not help wondering why no one considered the effect this was having on "Chop Suey" (Weber's nickname for Johnson).
