I really like Myrna Loy's movies. This film was produced before the character's personality was developed. It would be a short film as well, but it seems to last forever in its full form. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy seems to be told what to do with her acting and does the job. That's all you can say about it. <br /> <br /> Your gypsy character is of poor quality and the film has many flaws, like the jewelery scene. <br /> <br /> This movie will probably be of interest to Myrna Loy's fans, but even so it's a disappointment.
