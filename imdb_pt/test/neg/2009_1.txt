Hmmm! is the worst movie of all time? Well, sort of, for some of the cast it's a shame to see them in such a movie, but hey if they pay the bills because they do not like the movie as well. OK cg effects not to bad for such a cheap film, music is just about OK again for a cheap movie, final credits are OK lol <br /> <br /> bad for many to list, but, cast, acting, sets , script, which turned out, Drac .......... worse Drac NEVER!, many more, but can not be bothered to put them all down. <br /> <br /> Idea was OK, but I needed ten times the budget and more thought and much better lighting and style and change all the negative points, I say however to see this movie so you can say "What the FU% $ was that all about "how the credits run. Also, kind of a must see just to see how bad it is.
