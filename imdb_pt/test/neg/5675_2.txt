Beat me how people can describe this teenage exercise as film noir. It is true that there is a gun and a bottle and a lady and the leadership is a private detective, but that is not what makes the genre personal. This thing works like a rehearsed TV cop show - lots of bloody beating and bad continuity - with a hint of Chinatown memories. Very difficult to watch beyond the first 10 minutes. You want to feel contemporary, watch anything from John Dahl.
