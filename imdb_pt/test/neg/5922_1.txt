I mistakenly thought that this neo-noir effort of the Buffalo-Niagara Falls area might be something different. Unfortunately I was incorrect. There are many problems with "The Falls" which really have nothing to do with your low budget video production. Immediately someone has to question why all the constant narration? My feeling is that if you have a decent script, the audience will follow, without having to be insulted by storytelling. The acting is very amateurish, which is not unexpected but simply adds to the problems. Finally, the whole thing is annoyingly filmed as an MTV music video, which I found totally unacceptable. Narration, bad acting and annoying video effects are good reasons for this to be avoided. - MERK
