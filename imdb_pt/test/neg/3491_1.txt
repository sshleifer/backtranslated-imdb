Crash is supposed to be a film about racism in Los Angeles. But, in fact, it's just a bunch of coincidences among several characters that connect during a day in one of the biggest cities in the world. Who the hell will believe that? There are unreal situations, one after another. On the other hand, this film pretends to show racism among Asians, Iranians, Latinos, blacks and whites. But the big mistake depends on a pre-established racism coming from the writer. Mainly because the White characters in this movie are generally portrayed as people with a better socio-economic status than the rest of the other races. Iranians are poor, as are Asians. And Latinos, as always, are portrayed as homeowners, police officers or with a very low profile job, like a locksmith. Jesus!!! Do not you think it's time to change those stereotypes? Even with the blacks, I portrayed them as gang members, with the exception of a Black TV director who was the only new character for me. This film is so difficult, it leaves me so disappointed with the kind of cinema that comes out of Hollywood these days. Always with stereotyped characters. No realism whatsoever. Nothing to identify. It is simply a huge waste because this could have been a great opportunity to show Latinos, Koreans, Iranians and blacks from a different perspective.
