This movie started off well enough, sticking to the book's mood very well, even if the acting was not top-notch. The soundtrack was excruciatingly bad. Saxophone and electric guitars? It was gracefully incongruous. The singer was positively sad! In the second half of the movie, the story takes a decidedly darker course. Too dark for Austen. Northanger Abbey is made a dark and frightening place while in the book it was discouragingly tame and modernized in Catherine's eyes. <br /> <br /> Who the hell is this marquise with the horrible makeup and wig? A totally strange and unnecessary character. <br /> <br /> One of the key elements of the book is that the General is not a gothic monster like the characters in Catherine's books. His monstrosity is far more complicated in his oppression of the spirit of his children and his treatment of Catherine based solely on financial concerns. He does not lock his wife or the bush, but he sends Miss Morland on a 70-mile journey alone in a rented carriage, without enough money to pay her way home. Only her friend Tilney's consideration of giving her some money on the way to the door prevents her from getting stuck. This whole point gets seriously confused in the movie. They make the General very dark from the start. <br /> <br /> Peter Firth should not have sung! This part was painful to watch. His portrayal of Tilney was not so bad, but it was somber in some places. Henry Tilney, from the book, toyed with Miss Morland's imagination on a trip to Northanger, but he was never in the dark. Firth would have benefited from a better direction. The young lady who played Isabella needed a better-performing coach. John Thorpe was appropriately hateful. The striped vest and combo coattails he wore were ghastly! Certainly it's up to your character. <br /> <br /> I think the film would have fared much better with a completely different soundtrack. He threw an oppressive shroud over the entire movie. If I watch it again, it will be with the sound off and subtitles. Maybe I gave the movie a 4 then. <br /> <br /> The sound quality of the DVD was pretty bad. The picture quality was not much better. This is noticeably visible on a digital television. <br /> <br /> When I think about what this movie might have been, I think of Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.
