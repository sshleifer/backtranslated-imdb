Michael Caine usually appears very well ("Blame It On Rio", "Sleuth", "Without a Clue", "Gambit", "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels") or really bad comedies ("Noises Off", "Death Becomes Her"). . <br /> <br /> TA is a comedy that can only do two things: get it to waste a cast that includes Caine, Gambon and Richardson, The main reason is the bad script, there was a lot of futile effort to write a useless and complicated story, which is simply very annoying to follow (considering it's just a comedy) that the writer (s) forgot to do the damn funny thing, which, as far as I remember, is what the whole purpose of a comedy should be. <br /> I've never seen this idiot before.A few people even say "if you're a fan of idiots you'll love this" blah blah blah.A fan of idiots.This person without description really has fans.A comedy so poorly written how does this require a mega-talent to d air a laugh or two, someone like Steve Coogan and not your average idiot. <br /> <br /> If you're going to make a comedy about the actors, at least make them the jerks they usually are. The characters of Caine and Moron are not at all dumb. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about this collection of scenes is the little girl. Only a really horrible writer would think that to spice up a bad script, it's wise to include a smart and super smart kid. Smart-a ** kids are no funniest for fans of Bill Cosby. In "Little Miss Sunshine" we had a totally normal boy and she was very funny. This stupid kid of the kid-is-more-smart-of-the-adult belongs to a centennial movie of the Marx Brothers.
