As bad as good - not just the script is obvious, but the performance is not only poor, but pathetic. Worst of all is the definition of the characters: unrealistic naivety, reactions affected, camera forcing to observe superficial aspects, which are introduced as keys to the plot. <br /> <br /> I can not help but laugh when, in the end, the main character says to give a second thing like "your daughter does not play soccer and does not know how to cook". Such an offense to female intelligence sets the level of this film. <br /> <br /> Is the film about the second character's psychological behavior, about his impact on the main character, or just a sequence of events defined in To warm up the obvious ending? <br /> <br /> Pls, make more of these - I had fun guessing what the next mistake would be ...
