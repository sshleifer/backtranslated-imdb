Though credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team, but a previous Mutt-and-Jeff scam showing them going to Africa and masking themselves with the stereotypical makeup of burnt cork to try to mix. Although the mood of the dialect is largely lame, there is a brief musical sequence involving "black skeletons" that was fun. I have to ask, however, how can Tom and Jerry still have their make-up even after being thrown in the water a couple of times? One of the many inscriptions produced by Van Beuren Corporation for distribution by RKO Radio Pictures before the RKO make a deal with Disney. It's only worth seeing if you are an animation enthusiast or interested in knowing how certain ethnicities were stereotyped as entertainment in the past.
