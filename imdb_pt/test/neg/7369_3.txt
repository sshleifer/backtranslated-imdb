Despite decades of tax incentives in terms of international visibility, the Canadian film industry still lags behind most African and Islamic countries (surprisingly few Canadian films are released outside their home lands) and Nouvelle-France also known as Battle of the Braves is another example because. More than any other country, commercial Canadian cinema seems incapable of developing its own identity and is stuck in the pale imitation of the failures of other countries. On paper, this historical drama might seem vaguely promising. There is certainly a rich vein of unexplored material in Canadian history when the French and English have fought and bought and sold the colony, though none of this makes the cut here unless you tell the strange blink and lose scene. of characters saying "Wolfe is dead" or "Nouvelle-France is not over" before returning to the novel. But while it's not a story lesson, it's not a drama or the epic adventure the new title promises: there's no battle in the movie unless you count 10 seconds of shelling for a half-dozen re-enactors and a collapsed shed. The town square that is everything we see in Quebec is a very obvious and well-lit studio interior, giving many scenes an old TV miniseries, as well as the reluctance of director Jean Beaudin to offer long or even outdoor films. What you get for your money is a simple Harlequin novel about damned lovers, constantly separated by events out of their control, where the biggest surprise is that Fabio does not appear in the cast. It's the kind of movie where whenever two characters are about to do the beast with two backs, the camera goes through a fireplace or cascade. <br /> <br /> An Anglo-Canadian-French co-production that does nothing. So uniting nations once rivaled any country with a decent tax break in the stew, this huge box office disaster was clearly meant to be the Titanic of Canada - although somebody stopped telling the producers they meant the movie, not the ship - but ends up being more like a Revolution made at low cost, without the battle scenes, crowds or the few moments that threaten to work briefly in the face of overwhelming adversities. The Montreal Mirror described it as "so bad that one can not find the strength to mock it." This is a bit unfair because while most of their movie viewing time looks like a miniseries below 80, the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny, with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps, cowards stating " You'll pay for it, both of us! And our heroine accused of murder and - sigh! - Witchcraft in a funny enough judgment to have been in Demi Moore's version of The Scarlet Letter.Turn on falling British rulers, dishonest slaves and Celine Dion singing at the end and you have something that at times almost looks like the kind of movie that Timbo Hines was aiming for (and still managed to lose madly) with his legally inept period. War of the Worlds, though without the impressive technical incompetence. <br /> <br /> Versatility of the leading man David La Haye seems limited to the number of other actors q ue he may appear throughout the film: he starts like Andy Garcia, briefly adopts the look of the Al Pacino Revolution, flirts with the Tch√©ky Karyo style before becoming a younger Ted Danson as his character ages. While his opening scene, where he reacts to the news of his father's death with an expression that looks like he's waiting for the director to say he can go home now promises a party of bad acting, in fact he gives the impression of a supporting mediocre actor who was lucky in a lead at the last minute, when who was originally chosen finally read the screenplay and gave up. He shows willingness and gives a chance, but the grace and charisma that the play needs are not there. Billie Piper similar to Noemie Godin-Vigneau, the protagonist, also does not light up the screen, despite taking center stage as the peasant who is the prey of the intendant and corrupt intendant Le Bigot (who is the name of the character) of Vincent Perez , corrupt and perverted. the dubious drunken caveman Sebastien Huberdeau and, sadder of all, Gerard Depardieu's old dirty, revolutionary priest in a gray-haired wig. It is a really pitiful sight to see an actor who once was great at the absolute rock bottom of his game while he shuffles the motions seeming that he has not only lost the will to act but the will to live along with it. He clearly could not bother staying around for dubbing sessions in English (or even some long shots in which he is notably duplicated). No wonder he talked about retiring at the time of the film's brief release. <br /> <br /> Some brief comic relief is provided by Jason Isaacs in his standard Patriot mode that exaggerates Wolfe of Quebec as an asthmatic Alf Garnett / Archie Bunker played by Timothy Dalton at high speed while Tim Roth's William Pitt , stands aside with an occasional confused smile from someone being accommodated in a very nice hotel with excellent room service and many days off, though as Benjamin Franklin, Colm Meaney. re both in the movie for less than three minutes. (Voltaire and Madame Pompadour lay their heads for a few minutes too, but they can not make any impression, comic or other.) The supporting actresses are usually better: Juliette Gosselin and Bianca Gervais as real and adopted daughters of heroin. a beautiful Irene Jacob, who looks around the world as a young Fanny Ardant, is pleasantly good and deserves much more.
