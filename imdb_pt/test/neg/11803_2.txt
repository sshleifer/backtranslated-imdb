I was surprised that the creators of this movie really came out saying that this movie was a true story. Most of the scenes seemed false to me. For example, when a girl was eating her sandwich and there was a cockroach in it. While she was eating the sandwich, the camera on the opposite side showed that there was a cockroach. It's funny how the camera was filming on the sandwich when the girl was eating. Another scene is when the gang was opening a clothes closet and a cat flew out of the closet or should I say it was thrown out to take effect. This movie was not realistic at all. It is highly doubtful that the events that took place were true that evening, when the "St. Francisville Experiment" took place. I believe the house can be haunted, but not the night this movie was filmed! The ending was amusing when Tim and the other girl were chained in some sort of basement. Paul and Madison found them and rescued them! I'd rather watch the Blair Witch Project again and then have to watch the St. Francisville Experiment movie again. As I said, if the creators of the film did not claim that this was a true story with actual events, I might have liked it more. You'd better get more entertainment from the Blair Witch Project (even if it's not a true story either!)
