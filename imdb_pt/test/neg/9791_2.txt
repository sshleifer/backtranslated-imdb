Apparently SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last film in which Julius Harris played a role. I have not seen all his movies, but Julius Harris was in many good movies, and I remember him better than "Live and Let Die" where he played Tee. Hee and that was full of Voodoo references, something that is common here in South Florida! I always thought that LIVE AND LET DIE was a great movie because it had a little atmosphere and mystique, unlike most of the 007 movies. In SHRUNKEN HEADS, Julius Harris is back in his Voodoo character! He has a great style of mystery and occultism, and his part in this film is excellent. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is a kind of comedy. SPOILERS: Three boys who seem to have been fired from THE LITTLE RASCALS cast are killed by a neighborhood villain who seems to have been fired from the cast of FAME! or as a dancer in AMERICAN BANDSTAND by DICK CLARK. In other words, these children give LOW BUDGET another dimension. Julius Harris goes to the Funeral Home mortuary, cuts off the heads of the three children (and no one notices) and then takes them to his Condominium Unit where he has a giant cauldron of boiling liquids. The three heads are thrown together with some herbs, spices and voodoo items. At some point Mr. Harris has the ugly little heads on a table and he spills his blood on them, and they come to life as talking heads! They can fly, make jokes, roll their eyes and take revenge on the evildoers. They usually look very funny flying around, but the effects are not bad. For some reason, one child always has a blade in his mouth and uses it to cut people's necks and cut holes in the tires. This movie is strange and funny, but only the first time you see it. Meg Foster is in this movie and she looks fatter than Rosie O'Donnell and Meg plays a male leader of the local gangsters. Weird movie.
