Final Draft - A screenwriter (James Van Der Beek) sneaks into his apartment and succumbs to psychosis in an attempt to write a horror script. It's not a terrible premise, but the execution is horrible. That sounds like a first year of direction and writing work, and it probably is. The director jumped from everything. It is bound to be disorienting. What is irritating. So much so that small pieces of film are incoherent. The writing is predictable and does not follow most of the ideas it offers (sack of oranges). It's like they run out of time and collide together at the Toronto Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This movie is not jaw-dropping "oh my god, it's so bad, it's good" bad. It's annoying and irritates you for a long time afterwards. James Van Der Beek is not a terrible actor and keeps the ship barely above the water. But it's too normal for the kind of psychosis the movie is trying to offer. He is just a guy who one day sees people and hallucinates things, and then decides to act slightly insane. Cause follows the effect. Maybe there's something in the water. Now Darryn Lucio, who plays his "friend", is a terrible actor. He shares the likeness of Chris O'Donald and is even more annoying, a superhuman achievement. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere that the film offers is good (gray and somber), but as it is the only thing that the film achieves does not mean anything. This movie wants to be Jacob's ladder or the machinist. It's not even the Secret Window. She is the preppy girl of the group that decides to turn Gothic. <br /> <br /> It is not irksomely terrible, but the sheer stupidity of it will diminish in you. I've put more thought into this criticism than the filmmakers have done for it. <br /> <br />
