Oh my God, the things that have been entertaining in this country ... This is not the "Tom and Jerry" you might have enjoyed on Saturday Mornings, featuring an unhappy cat and a smart mouse. This is a much older series of animations featuring a couple of Mutt-and-Jeff clones that get into several scratches that result in any of the typical dancing skeleton jokes that made up a lot of the initial animation. This particularly vile ride, apparently originally conceived as a vehicle for a pair of black stage comedians of the time, has the pair crashing into the ocean while flying to Africa, necessitating exaggerated black-face make-up dialect "black" and "Do not disappoint me now" situations. <br /> <br /> It only shows that in the 70 years between emancipation and this film, the American view of Africans has not progressed much. Then again, at least one of them apparently had a pilot's license.
