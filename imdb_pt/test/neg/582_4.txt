Lou Costello (sans Abbott) plays a small, autonomous "garbage collector" (and inventor of a time-keeping machine!) Who secretly courts the city's niece. After a fight, Lou's girl (Dorothy Provine) rushes into a misty cave - why it's hazy we've never learned - and emerges as a giant 30 feet. Provine is certainly a good sport, and she does not mind trying not to look ridiculous (anyway, it would be impossible), but the writer is really ruthless with this character, turning her not just into a giant but also into a harpy irritant good. Provincial Costello bosses around, creating havoc with Army troops who are called, but nothing funny is done with the transformation. Defeated by "Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman" the previous year, the film features Lou Costello in his last bow, but provides little else. The special effects are marginal, while the script needed funnier lines and faster direction. * 1/2 of ****
