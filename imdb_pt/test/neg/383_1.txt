What do you do with all the material that does not do the final editing of a movie? You can keep it aside in case a director's cut or extended version is released one day. You can sell it as a movie to be used in a part of another movie. You can simply binary it. Or you can collect it by accumulating more and more of each movie you make and then use it to make another movie, disregarding the coherence or any meaning. Throw a very primitive skeleton of a narrative into it and line up a number of opportunities (or rather, excuses) to fit your celluloid eliminations. Excuse the abjectionally absurd nature of the plot, framing it all in the mind of a horror film director and you have a horrible movie. This can all be done with just a few days of footage. And idiots like me will waste two hours of their life watching. And then come here and try to warn others. The whole chain of events is a great waste of time.
