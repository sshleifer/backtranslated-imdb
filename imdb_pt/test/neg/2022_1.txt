Space is a vacuum, right? So space is shit. Vampires suck too. A really bad vampire movie set in space would have double the suction power, right? <br /> <br /> It started with what could have been a fun premise. Recounting the story of Bram Stoker's Dracula in the future. There is a rescue team that is sent to investigate a cargo ship that is lost in space called Demeter. Fans of the original novel will unintentionally assume that this will be a direct re-reading of Dracula in the future ... unfortunately, the lack of sharing character names, this takes the route of low popularity and goes to the movie galaxy B 20 minutes later when Coolio becomes a vampire. Trust me when I tell you he's the best actor in the movie, and that's not saying much. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien should be selling his products on television during the day. Erika Eleniak should have given up after she left Baywatch and poor Udo Kier is having trouble reading the suggestion cards. The guy who plays Dracula is more ridiculous than Frank Langella in the 1970 version. If you can watch the whole movie, you'll be rewarded with the worst end imaginable. The ending makes us wonder if the actors and staff realized what piece of crap they were making and left the set. <br /> <br /> Be careful, vampire fans. This one is twice as difficult.
