Laura Fraser creates her ideal man in a virtual reality machine and he is suddenly brought to life, of course. Oh, what a jovial Japanese do not happen on a Britcom flop, so the brilliant but sombre Day-Glo manages to make the deprecating 1980s American movie Weird Science look almost decent. The sex-obsessed screenplay is by The Sun film critic Nick Fisher, an ex-uncle of agony who obviously never watched an episode of Smack The Pony in his life; shame, because then he could at least have been with a cry to write female characters who were admittedly members of the human race. This whole bunch of things pretty much came from the virtual brain of someone who thinks it's fun. Suddenly, the thinking of Iranian new-wave cinema is somehow attractive.
