I saw a show from 12:45 last night, and I would have left 20 min. in, but there was nowhere to go! Blazing product placement, youthful script, both wasted talent, gay aggressions ... what did not they do? The movie is also insanely long (we left at 3). As a person who rarely pays the full price at the movies, imagine my disappointment distributing $ 22 for this self-indulgent, stingy nightmare (plus $ 2 parking). I woke up today still feeling depressed, and I have not been able to shake all day. I love Vince Vaughn, and he seemed lost in this thing, just like me. When Cedric, the Artist, is the watermark (a man so uninteresting that he has to call himself "the Artist", so you understand what he thinks he's doing), you have a serious problem. In addition, the appearance of Robert Pastorelli is scary, since he died almost a year ago (March 10). That should give you an idea of ​​how long they are polishing this crap. This movie is for the bitter end. We stayed just to make sure they did not give Robert an "In Remembrance", which they did not do. Save yourself! Save your money! Save your soul!
