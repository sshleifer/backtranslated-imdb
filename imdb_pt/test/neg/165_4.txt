After I saw this, I concluded that it was more likely to be a girl's movie; Then I discovered that Keira's mother wrote the script so that she pretty much confirmed it. However, a girl's movie may have some appeal to men; this does not seem and really does not seem to appeal so well to women (looking at the sad receipts from the box office). One item I believe both genders agree on is the stupidity of the scene in the film where an analogy is made between the pain of childbirth and the pain of a limb being amputated without anesthesia. Although men do not suffer the pain of childbirth, we understand that it is a painful process; however, it is a natural pain, while an amputation certainly is not! Women understand this even better. I suspect that some woman was trying to make a feminist statement that is in bad taste. In fact, many things in this movie are in bad taste. Although the films nowadays are known to taste bad, they really are "excellent" in this department. This could have been a good movie showing the struggles of Dylan Thomas during World War II; and how strong was the sentiment against the men who somehow managed to avoid serving in the military then. The mother who writes Keira's screen tries to show how this feeling was used against Dylan, but it really messes it up. Instead, we received a movie about how two young mothers come together; kind of. Somehow. Possibly. Somehow. It is noteworthy that a soldier (the husband of Dylan's wife's friend) is sent home after serving in combat; it's still not clear if the war is over !! Many things about this film are equally unclear; and though I have said that I will do it again, for it seems to be the central theme of this mess.
