I sat for all 2 hours. I do not know what was worse, the horrible plot, the idiot characters or the Hawaiian taste that Eddie's 11-year-old boy and 80-year-old grandfather made sexual advances. The money spent on it was only lowered by the throne. Matty Simmons should be ashamed. The original idea for this movie was "The Swiss Family Griswold" and somehow it turned into that mess. The only bright spot is that the ratings were so bad we would never see it on TV again. AVOID ALL COSTS ... RENT ERNEST SAVE XMAS or anything else.
