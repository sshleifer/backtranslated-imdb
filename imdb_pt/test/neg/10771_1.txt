Before beginning to rip this movie, check it - I LOVE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. This story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written. The film with Jane Gray is very good and the musical on Broadway is the hottest thing there. So when I heard the movie was coming out, I thought it would be great, since it was a BBC movie. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, it was a weak and totally stupid story that UTTERLY failed to capture the gorgeous tale. <br /> <br /> There were no exciting escapes with daring disguises. There was no deep love that made her heart throb when Percy left the room and Marguerite sighed when her husband left her again. <br /> <br /> All she had was a confused plot and a lot of out-of-the-blue sex and violence. <br /> <br /> Sink me! What a horrible movie! <br /> <br />
