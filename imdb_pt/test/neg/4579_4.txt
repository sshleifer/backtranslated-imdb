Enough talent and sincerity was to make this movie I wish it were better. Everyone is clearly doing their best to be true to an intriguing premise, but it is a very deep sight, a very involved attempt to unravel the mental disillusionment to survive a transition to the screen. It is an attempt to capture the dimensionality of gossamer patterns in the celluloid - the result is confusing and slow. I give a 10 for the effort, but a total of 5.
