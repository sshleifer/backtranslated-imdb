My first question, it's not about horrible acting, nor about horrendous writing, is the direction. The choices that have been made about cinematography are some of the worst decisions I have ever seen. Why do all bad guys have to die in slow motion? I was about to hit myself with a rubber hose. The photos on the camera make it impossible for you to see what's happening. I was about to turn off the movie because of Jalal Merhi's accent, when he came on the sex scene, so I thought it could improve, well, it did not happen. If you evaluate special effects on a scale of A, B, C, I would have to put it around a W or more, and did I mention the acting? Wow, it was bad !!! And the WORST part of the whole "Wait to Die" experience is the blatant misuse of the phrase on the cover, which is: "THE MOTHER IS ONLY DEAD." Comparing this movie with the Matrix is ​​easily the worst comparison I have ever seen. If you have not seen this movie, no, unless you're looking for a good reason to hit your head against the wall.
