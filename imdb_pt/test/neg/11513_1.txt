With actors like Depardieu and Richard, it's really a difficult task to make a boring movie. But Weber is a master at setting a slow pace and making supposedly funny scenes without any judgment and depth. This film is rich in history, but of low character. You never know any of the characters except a superficial slapstick. Unfortunately, Weber has no idea what the slapstick is. His style can be described in hit and miss. Of course, some people laugh when they see someone slipping on a banana peel. Weber directs his humor on this lot. It's a pity he uses good talents. Many good French comedians have been wasted by mediocre directors.
