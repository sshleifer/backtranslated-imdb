Thursday, June 9, 6:45 pm Broadway Performance Hall and Saturday, June 11, 1:45 pm Broadway Performance Hall Bless the independent filmmaker. Without them, we would see nothing but Spielberg, the Farrelly brothers and films based on old comedies. They are the risk takers. They reap the rewards of success and suffer failures. Max and Grace are definitely a failure. The credit is deserved by Michael Parness for going out and making his first feature, which he says has led to bankruptcy. Maybe it's better to stand on stage if this movie is an indication of what to expect in the future. Though everyone had warned me, I went to see Max and Grace anyway, hoping to discover something they did not know. It starts well enough, a party for Max at his parents' house, filmed in warm light, the camera floating at interesting angles. As soon as we see Max hang himself, an obvious stealing of Harold and Maude, the whole thing goes straight into the tank. How could he do this without being noticed in the middle of a birthday party? By the way, how could two mentally ill psychiatric patients decide to marry and do so with the blessings of all parties involved? In the Q & A after the film, David Krumholtz suggested that the whole story was the surrealistic dream of his character Max. This story is so poorly written that the comment sounded more like an excuse. The film does not seem to have been made with little money, another reason to be so disappointed with the results. What is intended as funny is not, but it is offensively bad. The continuity is sloppy, the lighting is terrible and the effects seem cheap and forced. BPH had less than three hundred seats and was surprisingly crowded, but I saw at least thirty or forty strikes in the first half hour. At one point, Grace, played by Natasha Lyonne, regrets her inability to die. I've seen myself thinking the same thing since I never go out before the credits. If Krumholtz really thinks this is "one of the best scripts" he has ever read, it seems that he needs to keep up with his reading. A terrible waste of talent and resources, this is the worst independent I have seen since Bubba-Ho-tep.
