SPOILER CAUTION: At the end of the movie, it is announced that the bridge collapsed only a few days after it was captured. The impression is that the attack was all for nothing. In fact, taking the bridge at Remagen was the last important victory of the Western Allies. It was the Rhine crossing that the Allies were trying to accomplish for six months. As the Remagen Bridge was taken, the war ended in just a few weeks. <br /> <br /> The bridge only needs to last a day after being captured. This was long enough for the Americans to send combat engineers and a large protective force to the other side, and they could then begin building a series of floating bridges. The taking of the bridge was a complete success, and meant that the end of the war was near, and would not last during the summer. Contrary to the cynical nature of the film, the victory was announced with enthusiasm by the troops who did so. They knew how vital the battle was. <br /> <br /> This movie has little to do with the real story. It was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time it was produced.
