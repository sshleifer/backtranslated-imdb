It is difficult to decide who or what the target audience of this film is. Jean-Pierre Limousin presumably had a chance to explore the problems of amnesia on a serious level and chose to use it as an excuse to make a soft porn movie. Having seen, loved, admired and respected If Souvenir des belles choses explores memory loss - albeit as a result of Alzheimer's disease - in a profound and moving, no less important way in the luminous performance of Isabelle Carr√©, I think New is an insult to memory. I have no problem with soft porn itself - and even if I did, I would practically have to give up going to the movies so prevalent today - but I have a problem with writers / directors who try to respect it by hiding it like here, under the guise of medical research. The sad thing is that beautiful actresses like Julie Gayet - so wonderful at Clara et Moi - and Anna Mouglalis - who seems to have made a double play after Le Deluge last week and now this - are wasting time with this kind of scum.
