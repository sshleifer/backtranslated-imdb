I do not care much about the factors that others here opposed - acting, lighting, and so on. For the most part, these things were executed well enough to take the film and put their views. It's just a horror movie, after all. <br /> <br /> What bothered me were the points themselves. Because this is a deeply moralistic film, and its morality is deeply tacky. In fact, it's actually a fundamentalist Christian morality, and this is a fundamentalist Christian movie. Look at the 'sins': Sutherland's character chose a child in school when he was a pre-teen, leading to his accidental death. Baldwin's character wore masculine masks, persuasion, and good looks to have sex with some women, some of whom he filmed. Ooh, the pig! How unlucky for him that women are so passive, shameless creatures who have had no complicity in the subject. <br /> <br /> * Roberts' character's father came back from Vietnam as an addict, so embarrassed to be caught shooting that he kills himself. Yes, what a terrible sin! Why could not he just have become an alcoholic like everyone else? <br /> <br /> * and Bacon's character chose another student. How awful! The fact that he was a child, apparently, counts for nothing. Children, it seems, are judged by adult criteria. <br /> <br /> Well, many people may support this level of moral absolutism. It certainly does not seem to have been noticed in the comments of this movie. Everyone just bought these things? At least human laws treat children differently from adults, recognizing that their ethical sense is partially formed. This movie has no scruples, and I find this very unpleasant. Same as the notion that women are helpless creatures and cute before the evil desires of young men. Or that a Vietnam veteran put on drug addiction is so shameful that suicide is a valid option. Pathetic.
