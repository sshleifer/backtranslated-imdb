I do not understand jokes. I believe this is my problem with modern cinema, or those films that are made with millions of dollars in the hope that it will become the next great sensation. Is not strange ?? people just do not laugh anymore, and I believe that one of the diseases for this problem is the movie "Showtime." There was absolutely nothing from the beginning to the end of the credits, with all the joke between Murphy and De Niro, with Russo as an eyeshadow, even with standardized clichés that made the general population faint with pre-programmed laughter. Nothing in this movie that made me laugh. There were no authoritative physical jokes or mental jokes calculated throughout this movie disaster. From the beginning, I did not buy the match-up of De Niro and Murphy as anything more than the excitement of Hollywood, over the comment the director speaks vividly about the hijinks and laughs going on during the filming ?? Where was the movie? Does this fall into two problems? the director really has no sense of comedy or the editor did not understand the value of the movie. Either way, they both sentenced the entire hour and a half spent on the Hollywood nightmare "Showtime." <br /> <br /> Out of finding no reason to laugh, there was no reason to follow these characters anytime in the movie. movie. There was a glimpse of humor with De Niro's desire to take pottery as a hobby (but the director had to write KILN on the machine for the audience to understand? WHO DOES?), But that was discarded and never developed. There was the idea that Murphy was an actor, but outside of that opening monologue, no one would have understood that. Does he rent a room at a producer's house where he can pay a police officer's salary? That simply did not count to even Hollywood standards. There was a bad guy who wanted a big gun, but the weapon was never developed, nor was there any real test of weapons capability? even in the end. It became more of a joke to laugh at an accent than to remember the guns. Where was the television show? Russo had to get permission from this random guy at first, but there were no consequences. There was nothing in the middle of this movie out of other issues and meaningless dribbles. Random characters were introduced, forgotten, reintroduced and forgotten again. The director and producer laughed at this, while we, the thin spectator, must suffer through inner jokes and clichéd stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Was there any love interest in this movie? Was there a truly sinister bad guy who broke away from the comic book duo to bring the real evil to the screen? Was there any reference to pop culture that did not go back to Robert De Niro? Was there random chaos throughout this movie? If you need answers to these, of course, you will not find them on "Showtime". The fact that I'm asking this question with questioning only means that this sub-par (actually, well below the sub-sub-sub-par) did not fill any quota or resemble anything of value to the film world. Of course, it had big names and a really clean explosion, but there was nothing substantial about it. Was it almost as if the director had said before the filming that he wanted cliches, but not regular cliches? Go with the bad guys. The plot had no linear structure. The jokes were boring. The characters were monotonous and underdeveloped. This is below the best of the "buddy-cop" movies. I like to give the movies the benefit of the doubt, but nothing worked in that movie. Not even Shatner could save this movie, and he even tried hard. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not, and I will not, suggest this movie to anyone who has a pulse. The comment only confirms the pathetic nature of the film with obvious flaws, horrible jokes and creators questioning the validity of their work. If creators can not stay behind "Showtime", why should we? I did not want a "Lethal Weapon" when I saw it, but I wanted something like that. I understand there was some form of criticism of "reality tv" and the corrupt nature of the media, but that message did not leave the page. In fact, I believe I saw the "media" leave the theater when I watched it. Shame carries your heavy hand with this movie and I can not blame it. Murphy used to be a big star, comedy was his middle name (see "Coming to America"), but lately he seems to have lost his edge. De Niro obviously wants to stay away from an image that haunts him, but making that kind of movie will only put him back further. One of these movies is like a Scorsese photo. <br /> Ignore this. I promise, this will make your last movie days worth it. Oh, what if you laughed at some joke in that movie? I'm really sorry! <br /> <br /> Grade: * out of *****
