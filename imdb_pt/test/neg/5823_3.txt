Close but no cigar! - this is my opinion on this movie! TAG PURVIS wrote and directed this script that should have been rewritten before filming. Sometimes laughable because or a tacky, bright star script of this film is Dan Mongomery Jr and the director of photography. Both talents are to be observed in the future. My recommendation is to wait until he reaches his local cable station and use the rented money in a classic!
