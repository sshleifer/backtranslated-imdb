This is definitely the worst vampire movie of all time. I started watching this right after the interview with the vampire and I was completely disappointed. Not only does the screenplay of this film have craters as large as the grand canyon, the film seemed to jump from one scene to another leaving viewers completely intrigued. The vampire Lestat played by Stuart Townsend was terrible - having a good body does not make you an actor! The end of the queen was very easy and sudden, insulting the intelligence of the viewers. I'm going to give a star because Aaliyah really tried her best in this movie and the soundtrack is very good. Also, I would advise Anne Rice to take an ax and start hacking those who have destroyed her brilliant story.
