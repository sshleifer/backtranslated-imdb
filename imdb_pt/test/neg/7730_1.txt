This movie is up there with Oscars and Moment by Moment as one of the unintentionally funny movies of all time. <br /> <br /> It's worth the rent for some crazy laughs. <br /> <br /> The story is absolutely ridiculous. Nothing in life would happen like this. It's so completely unbelievable. the way James Woods tries and pushes heavy batters, than they give that supposedly two-bit prostitute a job 3,000 miles away in Los Angeles, what a joke. <br /> <br /> I love VW's old batuque to indicate how low they 'have ever come to life because of all the' tootski '. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is as incredibly evil as the "I will love you forever, no matter what, wife" you will see. It was not so funny you puke at how sweet and sweet Young tries to project. And as badly acting as you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> James Wood outlasts the whole movie and he's so damn funny and it's far, far over the edge, you can not believe, Woods looks like a parody of a Saturday Night Live cocaine addict. But watching Woods in 'Ludens' is worth the rent. <br /> <br /> I love it when Woods tells the guy who wants to give him more 'ludes' that he does not do these things anymore, right before that, Woods just made three giant lines of cocaine. <br /> This is a very funny thing. <br /> <br /> The ending is so comical, but equal to the rest of the movie.
