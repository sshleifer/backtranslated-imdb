When I went to see this I thought, I liked the first two and thought they were very suspenseful, so this should be good too. WRONG! There was no suspense and they did not explain about the new dinosaurs! When I finished watching this, I lost all respect for Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton, but eventually discovered that it was not directed by Spielberg or written by Michael Crichton! This movie was going through "the motions." I thought this movie had absolutely no plot and I thought no one should waste their money to see this.
