this movie is what happens when people see in this blair witch project and they say that people run around with cameras, acting with slash documentary without theme, I can do that and start with a stupid idea to make a terrible script and get a group of actors without talent and start filming a movie. The plot is that in Africa there is a halfcaste a race of man like animals that hunts and kill humans, the villagers think it is a demon or an evil spirit, but our wild pack is in Africa to get some proof of it himself. There is no need for more words about the plot that this movie will get a 1 out of 10 and I am trying to find something good to say about this movie but after a long time thinking nothing null anything zero.
