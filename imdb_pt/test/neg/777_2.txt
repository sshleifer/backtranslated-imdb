I was very disappointed with the quality of this documentary. The content is poorly produced, it's a very poor quality video and especially a horrible audio. There is very little about how Bruce Haack produced his music and virtually no example of direct connection to later and contemporary electronic music. Interviews of people who knew Bruce Haack are mostly inarticulate. Very yak and not quite Haack. Although I have a serious personal interest in electronic music and have a higher than average attention, even for slow and / or difficult subjects, I fell asleep while watching this documentary and had to revise it to see the parts that I passed. If you watch this, make sure that you are set up, before viewing, as Alex in The Mechanical Orange. Bruce Haack deserves much better than that. What a shame for the producer and director.
