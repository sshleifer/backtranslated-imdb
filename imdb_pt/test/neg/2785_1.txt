This is a piece of garbage that is lazily tedious, unimaginative, lazy. By watching a choice of direct slasher for video, it is fair to expect the film to be useless on some level, but that goes beyond bad looks. It's horrible on all levels, with a cliche script that manages to be incredibly stupid and incredibly annoying at the same time, an unnamed cast about the actors and some of the worst special effects I've ever seen. Even horror movie fans will not be able to find anything here that makes this movie a useful utility for an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on his usual group of young people who decide to spend the weekend at a remote farm in West Virginia that a member of the group inherited recently. Unfortunately for the teens, the inherited land once belonged to a farmer who made sacrifices to help his crops grow, or something stupid in that sense, and now some evil scarecrows are out to kill everyone. I do not know anything about screenwriter Paul Moore, but I'm assuming he's over ten years old and therefore he should be able to come up with something more original than murderous scarecrows. Honestly. <br /> <br /> The special effects that bring the scarecrows to life are ridiculously poor. They often seem little more than Haloween's fantasies on sticks. Special effects like these would have been considered somewhat bad 20 years ago, but by today's standards, they are not at all embarrassing. <br /> <br /> This is a total waste of time for all viewers, whether or not they are in horror films. If you need to watch a horror movie, rent any of the "Friday the 13th" or "Halloween" movies. Most of them are not very good, but they certainly suck the crap like that.
