Films on U.F.O.'s are always a good way to kill some time, so on a rainy Sunday night I caught this movie, expecting what can be expected from a DVD direct to the DVD. mystery. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong! About halfway through the film, it becomes very apparent that the UF.O. The theme is just a misleading way of attracting unsuspecting viewers to this Christian propaganda. And this is not just a Christan movie of an ordinary Christian. No, this is extremist fundamentalist Christianity. The scary guy. At the end of this film, non-believing lead is deceived by his colleagues using a practical joke in thinking that the rapture began (which is believed by Christians to be the end-time event, the real ones believers are going to heaven and unbelievers are left behind. When the joke is explained, it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer. "Just in case we Christians are right "Now, that's an excuse to become a Christian if you ask me!" This movie still tries to convert non-believers by using intimidation tactics. "Believe in God or you will go to hell "This is the message here, simple, but quite offensive indeed, especially because this movie is being sold as something completely different. Now, let's assume that you are a Christian fundamentalist and probably do not you will be offended by the themes of this film, i This is good movie? I'm afraid it's not. No, actually I'm lying: I'm happy, is not it! The acting is horrible, the pace is horrible, the plot is horrible, especially the ending is ridiculously bad. As soon as the movie starts, you immediately realize that this is going to be worse than you expected, and you will be right. <br /> <br /> In the first half hour, it seems at least try to set up a UFO passable mystery, but all of a sudden they bring this similar Count Dracula who begins to chatter about the devil. At first, you think this guy is just a crazy maniac, but in fact he represents the real views of the creators of this movie. As you begin to realize this, you know how this will end. But it actually turns out worse. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
