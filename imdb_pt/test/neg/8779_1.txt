I remember that bomb coming out in the early '80s. At first it seemed like a great idea. A re-reading of an American classic with the help of modern day cinematographic techniques. There was a bit of a whip on his back on the original "Lone Ranger" treatment, Clayton Moore. The film studio had threatened legal action if Moore continued to portray himself as the real lone ranger. (Moore was performing in children's hospitals like the Lone Ranger for sick children.) For many Americans, Clayton Moore was just that; the first and only solitary. I always thought the studio could have done justice to both the fans and the legacy of the lonely guard if Moore had been treated better. Maybe even a special participation in the new movie. As always this did not happen, and many of the viewers were left in droves. Also history and acting were weak. All this added to a big box-office bomb, and rightly so. Personally, I'm glad the studio has lost a lot of money after the treatment of the real Lone Ranger. You do not treat an American icon like that.
