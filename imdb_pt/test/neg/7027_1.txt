"Mame" is a disgrace for many things - for Lucille Ball, for a story that was told better many times, and for the musical genre completely. Mrs. Ball does not understand her character and seems to be heavily sedated. Bea Arthur is good, but not enough. The production is very cheap and cheap, the songs are insignificant and almost all the jokes do not work well. Besides, Lucy could not dance well, so the music had to be slowed to a funeral rhythm. Avoid at all costs, but watch the delicious "Aunt Mame".
