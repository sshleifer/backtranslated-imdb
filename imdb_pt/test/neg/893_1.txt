I've never seen the first three, but I know they're all better than this ... crap. It's about a child having a party. Wow. It seems incredible (sarcasm). It is? NOOO! It starts with a child lying in bed and he is waking up with his mother. So the kid pretends to be sick so he does not have to go to school. He goes to his uncle's house, gathers some people and has a party. I did not laugh at all while watching this garbage. I can not imagine anyone sitting and writing this dialogue thinking "Dude, dis! @ # $ Will be great, yo!" It makes me wonder if they still had a screenplay for this movie. I watched this knowing it would be bad, but generally watching a bad movie makes me feel good because it gives me something to make fun of. This made me angry. TWO THUMBS DOWN!
