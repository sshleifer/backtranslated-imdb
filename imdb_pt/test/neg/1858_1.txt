Jerry Angell, who owns the finest mullet of zombie terror, returns for more action from the undead in the sequel to director Todd Sheets' cruel party, Zombie Bloodbath. This time Jerry plays a despicable villain who, along with his equally despicable partner in crime, some convicted fugitives, several teenagers and a bunch of screaming girls, are faced with a horde of Obviously having learned to improve their craft in the two years since Zombie Bloodbath, Sheets offers another shoddy mess of a movie that somehow manages to be even worse than the original? a feat I found almost impossible to attain. The acting is consistently crappy, the effects are amateurish and cheap (most of the blood seems to be nothing more than a selection of leftovers, guts and blood from the local butcher), the incomprehensible story (as far as I could tell, zombies resurrect from the dead because a scarecrow commands them !!!), and the frustratingly loaded direction of inexpensive-looking video effects and completely nonsensical black-and-white cuts. <br /> <br /> And as if that was not true. Enough to convince you of the complete lack of redemptive features of this movie, the simply amazing and stupid end should do the trick: the few remaining survivors stumble across an abandoned truck that conveniently happens to have a stock of meat eaters just the thing to dissolve the undead (but, incredible as it may seem, it does not harm the living).
