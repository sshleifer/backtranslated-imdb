First, let me take this from my chest I hate Octopussy with an absolute passion. What is so frustrating is that it had a lot of potential and had a very good opening sequence, unfortunately, after the opening sequence everything goes down. First of all, there was absolutely no plot to begin with, just an excuse for Moore to tell his cheeky jokes. Then there are several sequences that make a Bond fan shrink, for example, the sequence in which Bond appears to spread a clown-bomb. The villains are very poor, Louis Jordon does not make an impact as Kamal Khan and Bollywood veteran Kabir Bedi is equally poor as his henchman. It's funny that when people debate about what Bond's worst film is and Octopussy gets overlooked when he can easily give them a run for their money.
