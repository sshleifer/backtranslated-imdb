Okul "The School" is the result of a new trend in Turkish cinema. Having used the same stories over and over, the new generation directors finally come up with different ideas. Of course, that does not mean they are all grandiose. I think Okul is one of them. It's supposed to be a horror movie, but it's not. Nor is it successful in being scary. So what is it? Actors are so average, especially Deniz Akkaya is very annoying with the role of teacher. I'm sure it could have been better if it were more difficult. Maybe focusing on a topic, how to make it scary or vice versa. But directors lost their target this time. ** outside of *****
