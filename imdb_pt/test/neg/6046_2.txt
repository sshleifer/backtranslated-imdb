An original Sci-Fi network. Not the best. Not far from the worst. An electrician (Richard Grieco) stumbles on a "key" that can open a portal to a parallel Earth that was taken over by mutant spiders. The mutations were controlled by an oversized alien queen in the last thirty years. It has already devoured the population of this parallel world that resembles Chicago's lesser inhabitants. Guess what? Now she must find another world to feed herself. The electrician leads a team of four men who reluctantly see themselves with the task of saving the world. The final showdown is probably the best part of the whole movie. The cast also features: Richard Yearwood, Colin Fox, Kate Greenhouse, Jason Jones and David Newman. One would think that the Science Fiction Network could have spent more money on special effects.
