This is a comedy version of "Strangers on a Train". This works very well. I am a hard grader, so the 3 rating mainly reflects on the characters and plot. The performances are extremely good, all of them. Of course, the two stars, DeVito and Crystal, shine brighter. Each artist acts well enough to play outside. The comedy works at a level slightly below the slapstick. DeVito characters work best when depraved. His character, portrayed as a writing hack, would probably be more real if he were published and praised as much as most of the hacks are. Your character would have, in real life, a great agent and multiple requests. The characters are one-dimensional, which is good in comedy. But the character of Crystals is not written very well. His desire to kill the "moma" suddenly makes no sense at all. It sounds like an unfortunate attempt at humor. The pitiful attempts are not very frequent and the film flows reasonably well.
