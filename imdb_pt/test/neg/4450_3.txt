I watched this movie and was quite disappointed. I did not expect much to begin with, since the premise of the movie does not suggest greatness anyway. Unfortunately, he can not even afford such stupid entertainment. The main problem is probably the acting. Although I have seen much worse actors in much worse films, the story would require that some people act like violent maniacs, others, like people, have taken on a really stressful situation, and they can not do that. Although I've watched the German version, I watched it with the original audio, so it's definitely not just a bad voice or something. Added to that, the release of the DVD in German seems to be cut, the deaths are virtually left out, which means that except for some semi-gory scenes closer to the end, the German version does not deliver like a movie to " gore- dogs ". I can not comment on this for other releases, of course. The plot has a few stupid moments played here and there and the beginning is simply hilarious (have you ever heard of a devil visiting a psychiatrist?). Too bad the movie takes itself too seriously, if it was filmed as a horror comedy and changed a bit here and there, according to that, it could have worked better. The ending is just a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> If you really do not have anything better to do and can not take the tedium anymore, you can (and really is a weak "can") consider this movie. If there is anything else available to watch or do: choose this alternative.
