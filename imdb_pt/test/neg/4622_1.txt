This is the only film that represents all that is bad in the film industry. The actors are pathetic and the script is horrible. The special effects, if any, are so poorly made that it would be better to do it with cartoons. Plus, it's great! I think the creators of the film wanted to have humor, but the only time I was laughing was when I saw Patrick S. with long hair and the colorful costumes they all had. The scenes at the end were good, but they were not part of the movie. In the end, you will wonder "why I wasted my time and money on this crap when I could have watched the plants growing or the clouds moving." I do not think I'm some critic or anything else, but this is a truly lame movie! DO NOT WATCH! STUPIDITY OVERLOAD HAZARD!
