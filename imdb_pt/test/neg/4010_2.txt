This meaningless movie was a complete disappointment. Neither character is pleasant at the very least, so you watch what happens without really caring. The worst thing was renting this movie at a gay-owned establishment only to find that this story of male traffickers was full of homophobic youths engaged in many straight sex scenes and not in a single gay sex scene.
