"Imperium Nero" is the second film in the series of six productions called "Imperium". I have already said unfavorably the first one: "Imperium Augustus". This second TV movie produced and broadcast last weekend by the Italian state network has the same flaws. In addition, it contains a considerable number of historical errors. Some examples: Nero is a child and Agrippina calls him "Nero, Nero". At that time, the name was Claudius. He was named Nero after his adoption. Nero did not meet Acte when he was young as in the movie, but after his marriage to Octavia and his appointment to the Emperor. When becoming emperor his children where not adults: Britannicus is a month old and Octavia a year old. And many more. If you like ancient Roman history, you can find other examples. "Imperium" series will continue with four more films: "Titus", "Marcus Aurelius", "Costantinus" and "The Fall of the Roman Empire." Finally!
