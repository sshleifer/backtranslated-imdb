This movie was a bad movie. The plot was poor and the comedy they "tried" to deliver went awry. Accidents seem planned and predictable. I thought the actors tried to some extent, but with this movie, it was so dumb that it can only go so far. One of the worst movies I've ever seen and would not recommend it to anyone. The only accident with Mr. Accident was the launch.
