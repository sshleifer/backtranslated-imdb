Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a wealthy Chilean who is about to inherit a fortune and gets into the affairs of bandits and falls in love with a beautiful lawyer (Vargas). It looks a lot like a TV movie, not very exciting. The only reason I bothered to see this was because Valentina Vargas was there. There are no real surprises here, although it is good to see Vargas. Great Chilean landscapes on display, but the part of Malcolm McDowell is very small and does not add much to the film. Michael Ironside plays normally as a bad guy, but this is not one of his most memorable parts. Chase scenes are standard.
