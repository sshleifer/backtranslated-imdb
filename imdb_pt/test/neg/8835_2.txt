I have no idea how commentators might consider this as a decent Western B. Or as one commentator said the plot was more cohesive than most. Nothing could be further from the truth! This movie is a huge non-sequitur! It's an affront to the noblest Western B movies of the 1930's. I've seen many of the earliest Lone Star and Wayne Republics, and this is easily the worst. <br /> <br /> The villain is known as The Shadow - for crying aloud! Initially, The Shadow scheme is holding open stage coaches. Simultaneously, his gang steals all the cattle in the territory. So they decide to move on to bank robbery. To do this, they need to shoot the city with a machine gun - there is no explanation as to why this is needed or how he got that born toy! <br /> <br /> No single scheme is revealed in enough detail to suggest a plot here. The Shadow is obviously just a bad guy with all sorts of generally evil schemes. <br /> <br /> He transmits his instructions to his gang through a fake wall safe. (Bat, who's there?) He's apparently clairvoyant, because whenever his henchmen need to talk to him, they hit the wall, the vault opens and - PRESTO - he's there. (I can only imagine that he met them face to face and says, "I have some secret and dire instructions to give you about the next evil act - find me in the wall safe and I will give them The reason why the Shadow requires that the safe communicate with his army of lawlessness is, like most elements of this mess, never explained. <br /> <br /> He has a nice tunnel to the old hollow. he also has a hidden panel NOT in his secret hiding place behind the fake safe but in the main room. <br /> <br /> When he is not behind the vault, he finds himself on his ranch without cows, disguised as a farmer.Matlock We learn that he murdered the real owners of the farm - two brothers - and assumed the identity of one of them.The daughter of the dead brother arrived recently 1930 (judging by his guardian, clothes), and apparently she's never met her uncle for he deceives her also! <br /> <br /> If you thought bandits always wore black hats and white hats, you need to see this movie. Here, the good guys dispense their hats in favor of white bands that make them look like they all suffered head injuries before any shots were fired! It's like a basketball game in pick-up - only Wayne has to tie the bandanas around their heads instead of just taking off their shirts. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the strangest of all is the end. Immediately after subduing the Shadow and his gang, we skipped far enough into the future to see Wayne and his wife (the oldest niece) on the front porch of his house. (No matter that there has been little romance.) There, Yak is playing with Wayne's 3-4 year old son, dressed in Injun's clothes! (Hiyoo, fun skookum!) <br /> <br /> No thanks to this nonsense, Wayne went on to become a legend of the screen. Only a superstar (packer or not!) Could overcome this entry in the resume of a movie. Long live the duke!
