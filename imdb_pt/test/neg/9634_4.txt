RIPPER'S HANDS Ratio: 1.85: 1 Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> An Edwardian physician (Eric Porter) uses a new Freudian analysis on a young girl (Angharad Rees) who turns out to be the daughter of Jack the Ripper, and equally deadly ... <br /> <br /> Unlikely Horror horror, in which a respectable figure of society takes care of a beautiful young woman abandoned without attracting so much as a rush of scandal, even when it leads to murdering everyone with a variety of lethal instruments (broken mirrors, hat pins, etc.)! L.W. Davidson's script wanders aimlessly from one murder to another, sacrificing the inherent subtext of the material (the obvious attraction of Porter to Rees) in favor of commercial melodrama, and the tone remains overwhelmed everywhere. Some of the bloody scenes are surprisingly vivid, even for the Hammer, and these were taken from the original US release (despite a MPAA R rating), although the full version is now available in home video. Porter and Rees give great performances, and the climax in St. Paul's Cathedral is a definite highlight, but the rest of the film is strangely hollow and ineffective. Directed by Peter Sasdy.
