This is one of the most ridiculously bad movies I've ever seen. I can not believe whoever wrote the above review was serious. Maybe he was connected to it. There's nothing for it. There is no suspense, the acting is terrible, the direction hopeless. The soundtrack (?) It is composed of three banal notes, played ad nauseam. The plot (?) It must have taken five minutes to write. Dialogue is what a 10-year-old would do if asked to do a homework project. The only (slightly) redeeming feature is the actor who plays the psychopath himself, who grimaces, shakes and shakes magnificently, and therefore is fun at times. The only reason you would be on the edge of your seat would be if you were suffering from a weak bladder. Do not waste your time.
