A shabby horror outlet has an innocent teenager (Meg Tilly, appealing as usual) trying to get in touch with the popular clique at school (despite the fact that they seem to hate it openly) and to be subjected to her initiation as a fellowship: to spend the night in a creepy mausoleum. Despite the complete absence of originality, this low-budget thriller is able to present some decent special effects and has several good performances (particularly by Robin Evans, exposing campy cruelty as the girl's leader). The script is not clear, but has enough quirks to make the process bearable. ** in ****
