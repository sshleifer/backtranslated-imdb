Well I went out with some friends to see this movie, we went an hour before the show started to have good seats. So, as you can probably imagine, we went out to see this movie :). But that enthusiasm soon turned into horror, this movie is a complete failure, just to try is difficult to be funny that is sad, the script is poorly written and depends on weighing the actors to make up for it ... The only good acting in the whole film was Stefan C. Schaefer who was great, the plot was weak and even the "funny" scenes seemed forced and unnatural, considering that the main actors are some of the best comedians in Iceland . is very special ... <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone because it is difficult and never delivers.
