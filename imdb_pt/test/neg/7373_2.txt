This is the biggest problem with this film, along with a good part of the biggest films of the Quakers: made pretentiously by pretentious people. <br /> <br /> It's really sad, but the producers of "big shot" movies (driving Dodge Stratus ...) of this province believe they have the truth, they know what people like little. <br /> <br /> We are not a rich province, every time a great movie like this (30 million? !!?) is made, it is cutting many others that will not see their movie because of the lack of government aid. That is why it generates mediocrity; only "family friends" movies will be made. <br /> <br /> I look angry and I am. I went to see Nouvelle-France waiting for a trip in the life of my ancestors, but I found myself trapped in a set of inconsistencies: French accent (we have to please our cousins, then f *** our language of Qu√©becois) and lack of historical research is only some. Add an extravagant love story and the same repeated musical score again, and the dumb quebecois viewer will open and ask for more. I'm glad that this pretentious bit of blood has not done what it planned with the great shots of the Dodge Stratus ... It will help the filmmakers who are not in the very restricted "film business" of Quebec. <Br /> <br /> Rent the Cruising Bar and enjoy yourself. <br /> <br /> PS: I will never forgive them for ruining such an incredible title.
