In this film, we are invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone who is not nice to begin with. What was the purpose of making the movie? To show that it would have been better not to have had IN COLD BLOOD - a book I admire, incidentally - to keep intact the integrity of our hero? Difficultly. He behaves at the party at the beginning of the movie in exactly the same way that behaves after his triumphant reading of the book, so its degradation is a matter of degree. Should we care enough about Capote to take seriously his claim that he and the killer Perry Smith are kindred spirits, with the first having had all the breaks while the latter had none? Mr. Capote's situation did not touch me, I'm afraid, so if that was the central idea, it was wasted on me. But even if I could understand why the filmmakers visited this useless project on us, the awkward story would still bore me. Hoffman gives a brave performance with no emotional effect, while Keener and Cooper are so warm and interesting that I craved more of them. Dreary beyond belief.
