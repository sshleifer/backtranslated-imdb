This "movie" will give me nightmares, I will wake up drenched in sweat, shouting "I did not make this movie, please do not blame me!" I honestly think it would have been more fun to see a fat guy eating lard in his mother's basement for an hour or two, than watching that crap. I understand the money was tight, but what the hell they were thinking that there was no thought, plot or effort put into it. This movie needs a warning. "Please, for God's sake, do not fund the local JC's theater department." On another note, these are the least friendly characters I've ever seen, and I've seen movies with Hitler on them. So, finally, take my advice the next time you think of renting this, just put a few hundred of Adivl and let the sleep come.
