Bela Lugosi is a true enigma. In the early 1930s, he was at the top of the world after appearing in Dracula. However, once again, he made lousy decisions regarding his career. Maybe he had a bad agent, maybe his drink and drug use had a part or maybe he was just crazy. Regardless, he ruined his reputation by appearing in almost every movie - from excellent horror films (such as THE RAVEN) to big-budget movies (like NINOTCHKA) to first-class movies for the cheaper and more silly studios. Interestingly, although he agreed to make this film terrible, he actually turned down the role that later went to Boris Karloff in FRANKENSTEIN! As for this movie, it's a very silly and horribly produced World War II propaganda film, with a stupid plot and an unfortunate issue. Lugosi spends a lot of the film sabotaging murderers - not bad. But in the end, we discovered that he is a Nazi plastic surgeon and all the American-looking men he killed were really Japanese !!!! The funniest part of this is during a flashback. You see Lugosi talking to a group of Japanese men before turning them into American men. When the camera scans them, the men are clearly Asian. But in all other non-close-up, they are all very western looking - many with bald heads !! They looked absolutely NOTHING like the Japanese. I suspect the plot must have been rewritten and this may explain the obvious mistake. Or, it could just be poor quality production and editing values. In fact, at the beginning of the film, they show a street scene in the city and all the cars (around 1942) are old T Fords models - obviously filming !!! The bottom line is that the film is bad, but also very annoying. Unlike PLANE 9 OF THE OUTER SPACE, it is difficult to laugh at ineptitude - just fall asleep with it.
