What a bad movie, it took me 3 times to finish. The thing I did not like any more was the child's sense of humor. jokes made by a 10 year old. it's not funny. very annoying, actually, for example, when the detective does not get a seat at the bar, he yells "she's taking everything" and then they all run "fast forward" kinda 'rush antics. So stupid. and also a guy sitting at the bar breaking fruit to discover his post-traumatic stress disorder. at the bar! and the bartender is providing more and more fresh fruit. Is this supposed to be funny? and I mean ... I love gore exploration movies, and I've seen so many terrible movies, but yours is just plain bad. and also the "gore" is not so exciting. Do not bother yourself. I would not recommend this.
