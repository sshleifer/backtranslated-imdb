Although Casper van Dien and Michael Rooker are generally relegated to B movies, even they are above that movie. It fails to convey even the slightest sense of excitement, fear or dread - unless you count the dread of sitting through the rest of that garbage. The direction is amateur with annoying cuts and abrupt movement that hides the fact that the killer is not near the victims when it attacks. And what a killer he is: a cheap skull mask and a black hood. I liked him better when he fought with He-Man. This is one of the laziest character design jobs I've ever seen. I mean, it's Skeletor! And he's on horseback! Should this be a frightening and supernatural creature? How should we take this seriously? All we have are footage of this guy walking through the forest on his horse - which he can barely keep - interspersed with scenes of soldiers shooting randomly into the woods, thinking they can shoot a ghost. Occasionally, Skeletor will shoot someone with an arrow or pass and stab someone, revealing how much the effects really are painful. I generally appreciate the Sci Fi channel fare on a basic level of cheese, but this movie is very unfit for any level of fun. Where is Dolph Lundgren when you need it ???
