Ugh Pretty awful. <br /> <br /> Linnea Quigley gets the highest billing, but her character does not have a big role. Who is your character should be like that, the little boy's aunt? Another reviewer commented on her being nude in a shower scene. While there was a bath scene in the movie, it was a photo of head and shoulders. Maybe there are some alternative versions of this movie. <br /> <br /> Quigley has a larger role than John Carradine, Cameron Mitchell and Brinke Stevens. Carradine appears briefly in a mantle of monks reciting a vague dialogue. No other character is on the scene with him, although he is kind of composed, or else there are shots on the shoulder unquestionably belonging to another person. There is also a very bad photo of him in a medallion (looks like a bad photocopy), and a decent photo of him in a family bible. He invented Jack-O originally, or something. <br /> <br /> Cameron Mitchell briefly appears on a TV as a TV horror presenter. Brinke Stevens is in the film he is showing "The Coven", in which she runs around a graveyard in a cloak. Of course, there are more Brinke scenes as a bonus in the feature film Retromedia DVD, Mark of the Witch / The Brides Wore Blood. <br /> <br /> Jack-O: What is it about? Damn if I know. A boy is told a story about a pumpkin-headed demon killer, and he and a few other kids are scared of a woman they think is a witch for some reason. She follows him home and offers to help her family with her haunted garage for Halloween (put your hand in a hole and feel the eyes that are really grapes, etc.). The pumpkin-headed killer appears several times to hold branches while observing people, or holds the scythe in front of the camera and poses with it for a while. Sometimes he can do more than just hold onto things, and actually kills people. <br /> <br /> There are also some flashbacks from a Western family or prairie, with the little boy playing with the boy in that family as well. : his ancestors, I think. I think they figured in Jack-O's past, but I'm not sure how. <br /> <br /> The little boy is ostensibly the main character, but we really did not learn anything about him except that he wears glasses. , has nightmares and will fight with bullies, even if he is beaten in the process. More time should have been spent establishing his character. I could not have cared less if he died. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, not even for Halloween.
