Produced by Nott Entertainment, this movie is nott very good at all. I sat for the first 15 minutes of the film before judging that the acting is bad, the cast is bad and the camera work is bad. As I hear there is a download of this movie circulating on the internet, it is "nott" nor worth the band. <br /> <br /> By the time I wrote this review, the average vote for this movie was an 8.5, which led me to see it and there was a large majority of 10 for this, obviously voted for by liars and shills. This movie is "nott" for everyone. Or parents, if you want to punish your children with this horrible movie, ask them to attend Halloween.
