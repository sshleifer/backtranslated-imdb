I was very excited to see this movie when it came out. The commercials looked peculiar and I usually like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, and the combination of the two seemed like an interesting idea. Unfortunately, I was terribly disappointed with Nurse Betty. <br /> <br /> Personally, I've often found that graphic violence and comedy do not fit so well together, and the only directors who have successfully combined the two, in my opinion, are Tarantino and the Coens. There is not much violence in Nurse Betty, but what is violence made me feel kind of weird when I should laugh. Of course, for me, part of the problem was also that there did not seem to be many places where they asked me to. <br /> <br /> The film also does not work much like drama. Betty, by Renee Zellweger, the protagonist of the story, is clinically insane and impossible to relate in any real way. I will say that Zellweger acts very well, and Freeman, Rock and Greg Kinnear also do good work. The problem is in writing; Freeman is the only person who can play an interesting character. Is very bad. 3/10
