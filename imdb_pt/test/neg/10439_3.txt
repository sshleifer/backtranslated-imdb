In the mid-1800s, the Irishman Dennis Hopper (as Daniel Morgan) migrated to Australia, seeking a slice of the continent's gold. Instead, Mr. Hopper is tagged and thrown into a torture prison; there he is raped by gangs. After the release, Hopper takes the Aborigine David Gulpilil (as Billy), with whom he seeks revenge against the sadistic Bill Hunter (as Sergeant Smith), Jack Thompson (as Detective Mainwaring) and others. Eventually, revenge becomes heroism; Hopper is admired and assisted by ordinary people, and hunted by corrupt and powerful authorities. Hopper's "little human" performance certainly fits the film's disjointed feel. Mr. Gulpilil leads a strong cast of support. The staff involved in "Mad Dog Morgan" is not only worth looking at, but also a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Mad Dog Morgan (1976) Philippe Mora ~ Dennis Hopper, David Gulpilil, Bill Hunter
