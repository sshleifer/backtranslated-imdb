Okay, I think I'm pretty much a fan of Stephen King's stories abused, mutilated, and destroyed (when they reach 'Screen') like any of us, sad masochists around here. I know very well that most of them are poorly made. I hope so. I plan this. I humbly accept this ... <br /> <br /> But, this time ... GEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ ... Ok, so I guess I saw this a few years ago ... okay. I thought I remembered it was very good ... WRONG ... As I'm saying (granted in a boring, irritating, indirect way): I really was not trying to be snobby or expect too much, but what was that? thing, a mini-series? I have only one thing to say: D ...... R ..... A ..... W ...... NO ..... U ..... T How can you can justifiably drag the thing out minute by minute, scene by scene of damn 'ENDLESS, completely pointless, and mind numb SLOW dialogue? I mean, ALL the scenes are two people 'DISCUSSING' how they feel and from one side to another and D ... R ... A ... G I ... T ... I'm ok ... O ... U ... T After about an hour and a half, what I think is about half the race time (I did not check, sorry :) I finally got totally tired! After an hour and a half, what happened beyond the original accident ...? They were running away while the 'Shop' guy was killing ophthalmologists, news photographers, and LOTS & LOTS and MANY of meandering dialogues. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I promise that it is not that I have irrational action without stopping; I love MANY movies in which not much happens, but in them at least when they speak and such SIGNIFICANT things are being said and the characters are being deepened, the thoughts are being transmitted ... SOMETHING !!! Okay, I admit the actors themselves were not that bad (except Stephen King, of course :) I liked the guy from the store, I thought the "older" people were fine. I liked the general and the main woman. It's just if they could have cut every FILLING HOUR, that's all I'm saying. I mean, it's supposed to be a Sci Fi Thriller, sort of ... right? You know what really took the prize when the guy from the store was unnecessarily making one of his many-time phone calls, this time he's talking to God knows who's getting all emotional (for him anyway) and acting like he does not can handle it. WTF !!! ??? The guy has clearly proven himself to be an efficient, cold-blooded killer. What the hell was that so ??? So, just multiply that by about 500 and that's basically why I finally hung up in the middle of the way; was that or hang me, I swear! I mean, there are other adaptations of the king that are thighs, but at least they move ...! Oh, well, I think maybe if you can be in the 'story' itself and do not mind crawling and having the SUPREME & DIVINE patience to wait until the end, it might be worth it. <br /> <br /> But, I honestly and humbly doubt ... <br /> <br /> I do not write these things very often, but this time I only had or could not sleep at night (like me I did it during the show! :)
