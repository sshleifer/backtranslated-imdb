Audio: <br /> <br /> Seriously, I've never seen a movie with worse audio. There are scenes where people are walking through the grass and you can barely hear them on your footsteps. They must be moving their feet. <br /> <br /> You know how in some movies they forget a line, so they have to dub in a photo of the back of someone's head. Here the editors were not so smart. In fact, there is a scene where the character of Shannon Tweed says his line without moving his lips! <br /> <br /> I'm sure your background sound played effects during shooting because in many scenes the sound effects will be different or will be absent whenever the camera changes angle. <br /> <br /> I could write a lot more about how bad the audio is in this movie. <br /> <br /> Other Nuggets: In this film, they probably consider opening credits as special effects because they seemed so difficult to produce. The main title and first names in the opening credits are in white text on a white sky, and they oscillate as if they were carefully hand-painted in each frame. <br /> <br /> The reuse of extras in this movie is incredible. There are about 15 rebels in the cast, and yet in any battle, thirty or more of them will be killed. If only the film were of high enough quality to distinguish which were dying again and again. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to note that rebels are often killed by explosions that are always between 30 and 200 feet away. There is a scene in which a scene, when some of the rebels are coming out of their huts at the rebel base, and a hut trembles when the rebel goes out the door. This makes you wonder if the cabin will last long enough to find the inevitable blast. <br /> <br /> There's a blue helicopter that looks as ominous as a pair of racing shorts, but it's somehow equipped with an endless supply of missiles. When they show the missiles being fired from the missile compartments of the helicopter, they often fire them in unpredictable directions, much resembling the big bottle rockets. They still manage to reach their targets easily, which, as mentioned above, is always a very safe distance from the rebels they kill. Watch the pilot's recycled footage by pressing the LIVE button to fire the missiles (because it is printed vertically, the first few times we read it, we read like the "EVIL" button). <br /> Notice how the grenade launcher they use produces explosions identical to those created by helicopter missiles. It is also fun in many scenes as the foreground actor is shooting in a completely different direction than the group of enemy soldiers he is killing. And often, the characters shoot a disproportionate number of bullets at the soldiers who are killed (like when a small fire blows up a large group of enemies). <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is very, very bad. The plot was thought almost as well as a 5-year-old football game, and the edition is the worst I've ever seen. But honestly, sometimes it's fun to spend 90 minutes laughing at a group of adults who honestly participated in such a terrible movie.
