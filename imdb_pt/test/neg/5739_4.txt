This proved to be a rare case of a poliziottesco made with British funding; unfortunately, the result is indistinguishable (except for its extremely unpleasant approach and frontier encampment) despite the stars and the director. The first is led by a wooden Nero Franco and a Telly Savalas ultra-hammy as a pair of potential thieves (if one is able to believe in any actor who usually exudes cool like a duo of bumbling crooks, he is more naive than I am!). <br /> <br /> Their 'work' goes wrong (ending up in murder and sealed with cutlery cases instead of jewels!) ?? however, misguided criminals see an opening to their dilemma when they inadvertently "kidnap" the son of a British diplomat (a miscast Lester, who even kicks the Savalas, which is a happy trigger, where it hurts at a certain point). Still, they never really rescued him and his only intention is to cross the border into France; tag along with them is Nero's girlfriend (a wasted Ely Galleani): soon, however, she has had enough and decides to run away while the others are asleep; the mad Savalas realizes this and, following the girl, kills her. Meanwhile, Nero and Lester woke up ?? the first thinks his accomplices may have cheated him, so he runs off with the boy in tow; after a brief period in the rural estate of a wealthy old lady (who has Nero's and Lester's completely free nude backs), Savalas catches up with them. They continue their journey, where the trio comes across a family of German campers: does the situation degenerate to the point where Savalas closes them inside his trailer and throws the lot in the river? although he is seriously injured in the process; typically, everything ends with the 'heavy' being killed as soon as they are about to arrive at the border. <br /> <br /> Does the film therefore contain most of the typical elements of the genre? sordidness, sadism, violence, persecution (the consequences of the opening assault, when the escape car wreaks havoc in the narrow secondary streets of the city and even disrupts a funeral procession, are frankly farcical), etc .; A slightly interesting aspect is that, in the end, Lester himself is seen as definitely (irrevocably?) Marked by experience? even feeling excited when an act of violence is committed.
