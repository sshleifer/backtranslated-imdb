"The Thomas Crown Affair" is a terrible remake of a not-so-good movie that can be redeemed only by the topless photos of former supermodel Renee Russo. <br /> <br /> That's it. The plot is insignificant, Pierce Brosnan phoned on his part, and Dennis Leary (as always) plays an irritating Irish cop, but I could not take my eyes off the beautiful Miss. Russian. There is a good lovemaking scene on a ladder, an incredibly sexy ballroom dance, a topless beach scene and a roll in the bag. Oh, and there is a painting stolen from a museum and a catamaran is sunk. <br /> <br /> But let's hope that other directors recognize Mrs. Russo's cheerful attributes and put her in more visible roles.
