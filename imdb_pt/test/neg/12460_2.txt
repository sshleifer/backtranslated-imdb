SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 2 out of 10 for 2 scenes that I will never forget ..... by the way, my husband rented this amazing no-bump them almost chick watching flick ... but I I guessed because when I saw the hood .... girls in school uniforms .... duh .... lol .... ah well, men if you can not beat them join them. .... ;-) <br/> <br/> Bijou Philips, one of my favorite indie screen ... very cute ...... not only goes into bestiality (your toy dog ​​is the best lesbian in the city according to her scandalous bubbly character) .. that would be the first scene worthwhile .. <br /> <br /> Then she enters a bathroom in a beautiful dress and enters a tent .... after a little she gets up, goes out to the party where she and the pathetically sad character 'Cat' stand, and deliver a bucket of shiny silver ice to the party host ... the host looks in his precious ice bucket silver and says, "Oh my god it's poo." <br /> <br /> I love Bijou Phillips myself for his creativity and unusual movie choices, this one would definitely be one of them .... and um, I would go rent it to the poop scene if I were you ..... I'm not a big fan of jokes but it definitely puts the party people in their place (they do not look like they were having a good time anyway ..... lol) ... You will never forget these two scenes ... hmm, but is this what we want in our databases? .... Maybe you should not follow my advice at all .... lol <br /> <br /> Dominique Swain is kind of weird and sad in her absurd confusing role in 'Tart'. I do not know, I can not decide if I like her because she's so into indie movies ?? Indie movies are amazing and all but she could not pick some good ones? I'll take a look at some more of his films and book trial ... but this was, (sorry the reference to the animals) a dog ...
