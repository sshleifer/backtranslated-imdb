It hurts me to say that about an Australian movie, but Mr. Accident is the worst of the worst movies I've ever seen. What's even more tragic is that it does not fit into the category 'it's so bad it's good'. What bothers me the most about this movie is the relatively large amount of money that was wasted on a meaningless, bland, underdeveloped and unfit script. Dumb performances (What does Garry McDonald and Elisabeth Gore, Elle McFeast doing in this junk?), Unsuitable direction, no plot and a general sense of evil totally take away the interesting production design and leave you with a truly horrible taste in your mouth. Comedy! There is! Do yourself a favor and stay away!
