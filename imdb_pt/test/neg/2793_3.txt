Ok, I'm sorry for the cast and crew for this review, but this movie is by far the worst I've ever seen ... First, the acting was cool. Could have been better (especially in some parts), but it was "ok". Then there was the cheaper video camera (which they used). The violence was very good. If it was faster, it would be awesome, but they would not (* sigh *) ... Scares. The scares were well written (in the script), but not well made. For example ... (SPOILER HERE!) In the attic, one girl is halfway there and the other half is in the dark, in the lower area of ​​the barn house, so she can. The monster pulls you down and then you hear someone bored being ripped off. The scares could have been better if the music had not been ripped from a cheap CD of sounds of terror. The blood effects were very good, but the blood was like "Kill Bill". K.B. took it because it was intended to resemble old kung-fu movies, but when the team can not tell the difference between red and pink ... it's sad. The ripped bodies in the movie were fine, but the scarecrow costumes were something you'd see for $ 25 in a Halloween shop. Do not let the cover fool you, the costumes suck! My overall rating is a 3/10. If you are interested in independent films, you are easily satisfied, or you only have $ 3 burning a hole in your pocket, go to Blockbuster and see the horror of failure.
