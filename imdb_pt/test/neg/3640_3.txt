This show makes me (and many others) hate their lives. Let's face it, Zoey is perfect; she is beautiful and beautiful, takes good grades, everyone looks for advice, she is popular, attends an incredible school with incredible rooms. Reasons why I gave this show a 3: 1. The acting is horrible. Sometimes I just want to hurt people who put these untalented actresses (especially victoria justice) on television. 2. The characters are unbelievable and incompatible. You have your typical popular girl. An energetic, superficial, stupid, stereotyped girl portrayed by a horrible actress. So you have a typical type of athlete who is a bit normal and really cool. So the stereotypical smart girl who is a freak and obviously does not fit with her perfect folksy friends. Then a handsome rich boy trapped who would be happier looking in a mirror all day long. So she wants to be an actress who is played by another stinking actress. And last a normal nerdy guy. 3. The plot is boring and lame. 4. I hate how much these characters are spoiled. Can not they be normal? 5. Everything is perfect for them, and we are all reminded of how much our lives smell bad.
