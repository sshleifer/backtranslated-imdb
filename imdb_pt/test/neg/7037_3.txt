Although I've rarely flown, I'm very interested in aviation ... and this movie has contributed to the precious joke of aviation movies. <br /> <br /> 1. Why is the captain doing the ground checks? Why does it even measure the oil levels in the engines? With response times as low as 15 minutes in commercial aviation, this is not a typical pre-flight test. <br /> <br /> 2. Why is Captain KICK against the tire of the aircraft? Strange type of pressure check. Or anger management :-) 3. The cockpit has a crew of 3. All the large, western, two-engine jets built since the 80's have a crew of 2 people. Now try to guess how old the movie script is. <br /> <br /> 4. A helicopter manages to fly next to the failed aircraft. Must be quick ... and the captain's words to explain the "maneuver" to the passengers are really hilarious! <br /> <br /> 5. With elevator ruts attached it is always possible to lower the nose of the aircraft. It happens, for example, when any aircraft moves slower than stall speed. <br /> <br /> 6. The elevator rudder has hydraulic actuators. After the collision with the business plan, it would most likely have cut off the hydraulic lines and thus make them useless for steering but would NOT pin them in a certain position. <br /> <br /> 7. The fire in the stern kitchen was a stupid idea. It was designed to show that only gentlemen ask for the fire extinguisher and fight against the fire regardless of who was actually trained to do this ?? the steward. <br /> 8. At the time of the collision, the aircraft lifts would have been in a neutral position. The movie could have ended here ... <br /> <br /> 9. The flight engineer (the third person in the cockpit) has three bars in his uniform. Actually, flight engineers have two. <br /> <br /> 10. Why does the captain cut the carcass of the cabin with an ax to examine the damage from behind? I thought it would have been the duty of the flight engineer, since he was supposed to perform technical checks before and after the flight. <br /> <br /> 11. In any aircraft, there is no unused space. At least commercial airplanes can not afford a compartment that can be filled with tons of water. <br /> <br /> I could go on ... but finally laughed hysterically about how writers imagine plane crashes. ! Woooohooo! Most aircraft disasters happen in such a short time that you simply can not do 90 minute movements with them. But you can always fill 90 minutes with an insane and insane crap, regardless of gender.
