Usually for movie reviews, I try to be constructive and objective, but there's only one word for it, uh, "film": SUCKS !!!!!!! The dialogue, the acting, the special effects, the plot, the scenery and the characters all look as if they were made of, well, my potted plants. Do not see this, because of all that is good and right in this world! :)
