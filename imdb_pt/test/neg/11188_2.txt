The Man (Gaston Modot) and the Young (Lya Lys) go through the film consumed by the passion for each other. They want to be together, but their moments together are constantly interrupted. The movie is full of images and stops after an hour ......... lovers find happiness ....? The film starts off interestingly with filming scorpions, but you soon realize it's all pretentious nonsense. It is made like a silent movie with occasional dialogues and has an uninterrupted soundtrack that at some point is so annoying that you will turn the sound off and want to watch it as a silent movie. Continuous drum rolls must have fooled the movie audience. There are some genuinely funny moments, for example, when Man kicks a dog and when he knocks over a blind man. Unfortunately, this humor is carried out in the name of art, so it's just a pseudo nonsense. The movie sucks.
