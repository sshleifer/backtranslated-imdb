The plot is very basic, but acceptable: A young American soldier, having studied Asian martial arts, puts this in good use in defense of the general's daughter and falls in love with her. Unfortunately, the three main groups of actors (soldier, girl, rebels) combined IQ are 3: One point for the soldier, one for the girl, a large number of Ninja fighters have to divide the third point between them to be able to lose against the first two.
