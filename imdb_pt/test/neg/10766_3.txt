As someone who has read all of Barnesa Orczy's books and watched most of the films based on them, I must say that the 1980 version with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour was better than that. It was better written and stuck more to the spirit of the story than this one, which seemed to go out of its way to involve people to be shot. This new adaptation is less light, but also not very deep. Although there is a good performance, the actors do not have much to work with. Nice outfits, though.
