"Nero" as the title of the film is in Germany, is another attempt to show one of the most interesting Roman emperors, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, better known as Nero. Although this attempt at least tried to show a more accurate Nero historical Nero Peter Ustinov fun, but completely fictitious played in "Vadis Quo! it is still a great failure. And for those IMDb commentators who still believe that the Sueton and Tacitus ads are true, please read a book about Nero that was published less than 20 years ago. Nero did not burn Rome, this is proven! He did not murder Britannicus. He did not torture, kill, and mutilate for pleasure; he was the first emperor to ban gladiatorial fights. The film still shows many mistakes, mistakes and is, by the way, done in a really cheap style, especially the scenarios were cheap and unconvincing, the palace looked like a village, the city looked ... as well as a cheap scenery. The acting was between good and low quality, the music almost insignificant and the film soon deteriorated after Nero became emperor for a hurried and poorly edited mess without any clear narrative structure. So there is still the potential for an epic biography of Nero that shows the true Nero, who was one of the best emperors who ruled Rome, despite the lies of Sueton et al.
