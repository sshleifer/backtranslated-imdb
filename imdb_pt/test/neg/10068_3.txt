Although coming after three Star Wars, Krull and countless others, this movie would seem outdated in the 1950s ... 1 SFX consists mainly of 70's video game effects such as screws etc; irritant after a short time. You also get an SFX creature that looks like a poor version of some level IV Harryhausen monsters. <br /> <br /> 2 sets are mostly ruins in the countryside, with papier mach√© temples and miniature towns or residences that make Japanese movies from the 50s look like flawless perfection. <br /> <br /> 3 The plot is extra-fine paper ... Hercules must find the seven golden rays of Zeus stolen by conspiring gods and zombie tyrants. <br /> <br /> 4 action consists mostly of delayed, muscled-up Hercules (check out the variety of facial expressions) cheap wrestling effects of 1970 video games. <br /> <br /> 5 acting award goes to Milly Carlucci (third sister Carlucci show-biz with Anna & Gabriella), which says it all. <br /> <br /> 6 SFX makes other Italian salad movies like L'UMANOIDE & STAR CRASH look like masterpieces. Well, considering that Ferrigno's main skill consisted in passing a retarded green monster, wearing a green-and-white longline, we should be tolerant. <br /> <br /> Watch and forget.
