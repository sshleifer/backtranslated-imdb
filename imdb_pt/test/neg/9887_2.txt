I read the book after seeing the movie and I do not care about it, finding it a bit useless; but useless books often make good movies, and this certainly could have. The story of the exploration of a teen girl of her attractive power over the boys, whom she finds irresistibly stimulating as it is doubtfully controllable, and who has an even greater grip on her than she would in a normal girl, because it affects her through her werewolf . this story would have an obvious appeal to the young audience by which the films are made: a one-of-a-kind appeal to girls and other guys to boys: and I do not understand how filmmakers could be blind to this and in turn. To begin with, take the title (which is the best thing about the book): it was taken from a quote from Hesse, also used as an epigraph, about a person running in fear and savoring blood and chocolate in his mouth , one taste as bad as the other. This is a wonderful metaphor for the state of the heroine: divided between its human and wolf sides, savoring each, but equally fearful of both. The movie dispenses the epigraph and instead introduces the character who works in your aunt's chocolate shop! I can understand how the title of the book might have suggested to filmmakers the erotically-loaded chocolates of "Like Water for Chocolate," and led them to want to attach the same symbol to werewolves. But they did not; so why are you in the movie? In the book, the characters are in high school - or in and out, as in the case of the Five, a teenage gang who prefers jeans and black T-shirts, and fall somewhere between being the heroine's enemies and their taunts. In the movie, they became decadent goers in their twenties. In the book, the heroine is 16, it's just an age to discover how her sexuality operates in the boy she wants, as well as in herself; it is she who initiates contact, then retreats, restarts, and so on. In the film she is no longer a girl, but a woman, and the guy is no longer a high school poet on the fringe of campus life, but a fugitive from the law (and a comic book artist to begin with) comes to her, in a manner as unattractive as that of her wormy cousin. She initially puts it away, but then relents, as he is confident that she will: hey, you know you want to. I would have thought that an executive director would have taken advantage of the opportunity the book offered to show a female protagonist in an uncomplicated and proactive role; but not. <br /> <br /> In the book, the heroine's clan is expelled from their home because of the delinquent behavior of the Five; in the movie is because she was running (!). She is a good runner, prone to give up building walls, and she and her clanmates climb buildings in an instant; much like heroes of martial arts movies and very different from wolves, or anything like them. In the book they do not become true wolves, but things greater than wolves; in the movie they are just ordinary wolves. In the book they metamorphosed in the "howling" style, with the mastication of thorns; This is one of the things that makes the heroine aware of the pain that her body brings, as well as pleasure. In the movie, werewolves became magical acrobats, doing great swan dives and turning into air, bright yellow like Tinker-Bell; looks cool, does not mean anything. <br /> <br /> In the book, the clan is a slightly white family that moved from West Virginia to Maryland. In the film they live in Bucharest, but they all speak in different accents, no Romanian. In the book, almost all the pack wants to lead a normal life and agrees that to ensure that - and indeed, their survival - a necessity is to keep their true nature secret from humans. And so the characters keep saying in the movie; however, the clan chief is some sort of clandestine chief - but apparently he is not a crime boss, since he despises criminals - and has a permanent agreement with the police, which provides him with "flesh" for the pack. This seems a great exception to the rule of preventing humans from knowing; but perhaps the police are considered safe because of their known tolerance for eccentricity and cult murder. At the end of the book the heroine discovers that she can not be something that is not when, in her effort to live a divided life, she gets stuck between human and animal states, unable to be a thing or another. Her boyfriend is not sure or strong enough to accept her for what she is, the pack can not risk having him around, and the two are forced to separate. In the film she rescues him as Lassie, and they go to Paris (why Paris?), In an end that is smiling but not very happy, since the conflicts between their natures - among their natures - remain unsolved. But the difference in the movie that most disturbs pleasure is that while the characters in the book behave conventionally within the realm of novels for young adults, those in the movie for some reason are as irritating as possible. All other lines are a threat or some other kind of control: you'll regret it; you do not belong here; You're not going to get rid of me; I gave you your chance; I'd rather avoid people who deal with it. There were good vampire movies, never a good werewolf movie. If it had stayed in the book, it could have been the first. <br /> <br /> But no.
