If this movie won the Lumi√®re Award for Best French Film, then what kind of garbage is coming out of France today? <br /> <br /> The issue is important - how African economies are held hostage by the international organizations that should help them, namely the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. About 40% of the government budgets of several African nations go to pay Western debt while their people suffer from sickness, dehydration and illiteracy. <br /> <br /> ... but the subject was treated in the driest way. form that could be conceived by man - dryer than the Sahara that surrounds the country of Mali in which this film is realized. More monotonous and devoid of action than any documentary I've ever seen (and I'm a fan of the genre), one "witness" after another appears in that "judgment" that is "captured" in the movie that condemns the world. Bank and IMF. Some critics may locate the colored visual parts inside the film, but they were out of place and had no complementary soundtrack when they were on the screen. They belonged better in a coffee table book than in this movie. <br /> <br /> Even the characters in the movie say something like "This judgment is boring" and "When will this end?" Everyone in the theater laughed. People on the screen reading our minds? <br /> <br /> Danny Glover had a brief appearance in this film. It is a film televised in "Bamako" and was set in Morocco or Mali. It was also more ridiculous than any western-spaghetti I've ever tried to avoid. The only redeeming part of these five wasted minutes was when a Caucasian villain accidentally shoots an African woman carrying a baby and shows no remorse. Perhaps it was to symbolize the insensitivity of the World Bank and how it is, unintentionally, killing the Africans. <br /> <br /> And one last stroke of farewell technique, the captions were hard to read with so much light on the screen and not enough black outline for the captions themselves. <br /> <br /> I've already summarized the film for you. Do not be fooled by hype. No need to see this movie. You will never have those two hours back in your life.
