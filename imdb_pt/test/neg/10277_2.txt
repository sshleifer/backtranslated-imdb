it is difficult to make a negative statement here after all this delusion about how great the research is, how wonderful the actors did and so on. I did not like the movie. sucks! <br /> <br /> There are orgies, they have taboo sex (gay sex, bi sex, oral sex, rape, anal sex, masturbation, brother-sister-sex, brother- drugs, sex, sex, sex seems to dominate their world.I think the director is desperately in need of a fuck.) The story is just dirty and shameful. I wonder what made these people stand up with this story. and above all: who cares? <br /> <br /> The technical material also did not satisfy me. the sound is poor, just as editing and "direction" are absent. the actors are admittedly good, but guess what! It's their job! Your job is to act! There is no need to jump out of your seats if an actor did a decent job. Do you applaud when a bus driver takes you home safely? to see? <br /> <br /> I gave 2/10 because after all it had something I can not put into words. b movie charm? Fun camp? nudity? I do not know.
