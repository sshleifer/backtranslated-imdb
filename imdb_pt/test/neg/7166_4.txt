I saw a few bits of it on the TV once, and when a friend recommended it, I started looking for it, although it seemed like no place nearby had it. I finally got into an antique shop, and could not wait to watch ... Oh, I had seen it a few years before and could have really enjoyed it. I was surprised that this movie had only 80 minutes or more, and I think that's what made the plot and story so lacking. The plot really sounds like a good one, both in the trailer and in the comments of the film: a teenager, Angus (Jesse Bradford) and his newly discovered Yellow Lab are isolated on an island during a storm on a boat trip with his father (Bruce Davison ). Together, they manage to survive in the desert and wait to be found and rescued. Still, what is never mentioned is that everything is shortened and the events of the plot are very rushed. There is a possible love interest between Angus and Sara, but they are never shown together for more than a moment. Yellow is a mischievous dog that parents are reluctant to keep, but in a few days it seems to be appreciated enough to take part in a boat trip. The scene of the mother (Mimi Rogers) vaguely mentioning as it is the death for the youngest boy (Joel Palmer) is going nowhere. Before long, we learned that 9 days were spent on the island, and suddenly they are 14, then 19. Of all the animals a shipwreck can be exposed in nature, only one type - a wolf - attacks them. Why else could it have been a problem instead of having the same kind of animal - maybe even the same - attack twice? There are few visions of how Angus prepares food except when he discovers fruits and roots, and when he bakes a trapped mouse. If he knows a lot about survival skills, why were not more scenes shown? The only thing that left me blank was because the dog did not have much participation alone. When he is rescued and the dog is left behind on the island, there are no scenes showing how he survives without the help of a human. I wish I was more open to it when I saw it, but I took some advantage of it. The performance was good and the score was pleasant. However, I wondered why the father seemed much older than his family and why he and the principal search and rescue regent shared names. This is a good movie for kids, but although the protagonist is 14, no one over 10 would be interested in it.
