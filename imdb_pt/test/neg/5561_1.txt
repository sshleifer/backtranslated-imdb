Another attempt, another lack. France may be doomed for failing to produce a good horror film. I mean ... the least they could do was shoot the movie in the Broc√©liande forest, but even the forest is fake! It was filmed near Paris! The subject is useless, the actors are really insignificant and the text makes you want to be deaf. Nothing could save him. Bad to the bone. I was not warned. I want my money back.
