From time to time, a movie happens by chance, which makes you doubt your sanity. We have just studied the novel "Northanger Abbey" at school and decided to refresh our memory of this uninteresting piece of junk without humor with the BBC's adaptation. <br /> <br /> The funny thing about Northanger Abbey is that it actually makes you want to kill yourself. The film is nothing like the book, for example, subtly evil characters seem to have turned into transparent stereotypes. John Thorpe looks like a leprechaun in acid while Isabella plays the whore. Catherine, the main character, is the most depreciative and stupid actress of God's land (she looks like a coffee addict, her eyes are like basketball balls) while Mr. Tilney looks and acts like a retired stunt double. The plot goes completely off the rails at certain points in the film, I do not know what the hell the director was thinking when, for no reason, a 7-year-old black boy we've never met before takes the main character out of the abbey and starts spinning in front of her. Yeah, that's right, starring. Nonsense of this kind is occasionally interrupted by Catherines' "fantasies," in which she is being carried around a cathedral by an ogre. <br /> <br /> Northanger Abbey is basically a visual euthanasia, so if you want to kill your boss or something like that, basically the BBC has discovered a new way of killing someone. Northanger is a ridiculously bad movie. Do not watch unless you are in a padded cell.
