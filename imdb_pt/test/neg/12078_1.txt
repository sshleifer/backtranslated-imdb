The 80s were the best and worst moments of James Karin, he starred in one of the best cult horror comedies with "Return of the Living Dead" and a year later, he acts in this piece of .... bad movie. A sequel to Hardbodies (but not really) has a rather improbable group of characters trying to make a movie in Greece. Through design or sheer laziness, the line between the movie and the movie within a movie is not only obscure, but completely non-existent from scene to scene (which would be confusing if I was only interested in anything that was happening in movie in the movie). Unfunny would be a very generous term. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nana, Fabiana Udenio and many other extras go topless; Brenda Bakke shows some T & A <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Only trailers for "Hardbodies", "American High School", "Strike", "Virgin Territory "(comes on a DVD with the first film, for the masochist)
