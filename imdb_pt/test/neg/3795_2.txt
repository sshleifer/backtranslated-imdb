I was totally disgusted with this unnecessary sequel to "The Poseidon Adventure," a movie I've been giving a great comment on. <br /> <br /> This movie is unbelievable from the word GO! I agree, because there were no other rescue boats around and helicopters? The one who rescued the original survivors had just flown over the boat on which Michael Caine and Sally Field were. WHAT WAS THE ONLY RESCUE TEAM? Hard to believe. <br /> <br /> The acting is usually bad and the program seems cheap. I really hated the waste of talent from some good actors. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie unless you have to get Sally and Michael as lovers. <br /> <br />
