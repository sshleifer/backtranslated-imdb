To begin with, I did not bother to see The Grudge. The previews for that movie did not make me jump, they did not scare me and they did not amuse me. But when a group of friends asked me to go see The Grudge 2, I accepted the invitation, a bit curious about how this movie would be. I was mainly because of my friends. Not even 5 minutes after this movie, I realized I threw away $ 7.50. The acting from the start is horrible. The girls at first seem to have never acted in their entire lives. So the plot of the film assumes. Let me tell you, I could not help but laugh at this whole movie. It's so stupid. I'm sure they tried not to scare you. They do nothing to jump or anything. Show the children and show them "attacking". It accumulates, it is not a thing "suddenly". And even in the middle of the movie, the core of the film, the acting is still horrible. Lets a lot of time between the dialogue for someone to add in their own comments. This movie is honestly one of the funniest horror movies I have ever seen. Badly written, horrible writing, horrible script, horrible "unable to act" cast and a horrible concept. The movie erases and changes the situation more often than you can count. Each part ends up unraveling and then binds at the end of the movie. I would never pay to see this movie again. I did not even watch the cable, for free. This movie is a joke. Please do not waste your money on this movie !!
