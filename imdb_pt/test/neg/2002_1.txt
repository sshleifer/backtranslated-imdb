Please do not waste your money on this sorry excuse for a movie. The only way I could see someone watching this is if they are Erika Elaniak fans, but it would be better for you to browse the internet than watch this crap. I'd rather watch the paint dry than go through that watching. <br /> <br /> They attract you to Casper and Erika and lead you to believe that it is a science fiction film of Dracula, but it quickly becomes a farce about the great-great of Van Helsing (you understand the net point , here ironically for a last show-down between him and Dracula. <br /> <br /> The film also tries to make a political statement, I believe, when it seems that none of the characters in the future knows who God is that they were not taught about him and do not understand when they see a cross.I could have done a lot more with that idea.It's a pity that it turned out the way it happened.
