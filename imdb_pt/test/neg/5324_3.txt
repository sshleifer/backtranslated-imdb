I actually saw the movie before reading the book. When I saw the movie, I was upset because I wondered why Dean Koontz made such a bad book / movie. The movie was confusing and did not have a stream, it was busy and made me want to throw a rock on the TV. I could not connect with the characters so I did not care what happened to them (usually I love the characters because I can relate to their personality or problems). So I read the book and I loved it. I reread the book and the movie is collecting dust. I wish someone would make a Koontz movie that would follow the plot of their books, so the movies would not be so bad. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU NEED TO WIPE MONEY!
