Was this a movie based on the novel written by the modern literary god who is Koontz? I refuse to believe that the studio bought the rights to this movie for anything using the name Koontz from Genius. Since my vision became bad enough to require Large Print, I could not read this book as I had it at least twice a year since the first time I read it. I missed the book and could not find it in large print. <br /> <br /> I hoped that by renting this movie, I would at least receive the pleasures of my Vicar, but this movie was a farce. Because of subtle plot points, it is my belief that none of Mr. Koontz's authors, or more decent ones for that matter, can be piled up in 1-2 hours of film. <br /> <br /> It will be the smart network, cable or other wise, who buys the rights to this novel and makes a television movie in several parts, ie mini-series, of this book in the right way! <br /> <br /> A star of five - would it be that I could go lower ...
