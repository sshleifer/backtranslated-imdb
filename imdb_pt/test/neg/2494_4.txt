It's easier to watch this movie if someone sees you as a scenario created by Lieutenant Reginald Barclay during his holodeck addiction. (Barclay is a recurring Star Trek character, played by Dwight Schultz.) Dwight Schultz is seen as Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer's character is poorly written, so we never see the depth and breadth of his knowledge. Instead, we see a superficial, two-dimensional figure of a novel. Paul Newman is also misfiled as General Leslie Groves, but the problems of this film go beyond having the wrong actors in the wrong roles. <br /> <br /> The factual errors and great freedoms taken (with the chronology of events) to the political agenda of the advanced writer Bruce Robinson makes this movie embarrassing to watch. This is probably why this movie found a home on the so-called History Channel. <br /> <br /> "Fat Man and Little Boy" combine bad science, bad story, bad script and mediocre acting to produce a movie that should not be seen by striking high school students or college students who know nothing about Manhattan Project.
