This show is like watching someone in training to someday host a show. There are some good comedy ideas and tons of mediocre ones. It does not appear that writers know the difference between what is funny and what is strange or gross. <br /> <br /> There are moments. When Spike struck down a neighbor who had let his dog dirty the lawn repeatedly, it reached its peak. But the hilarious moments are very few, and there are many experimental comedies that miss the mark. <br /> <br /> The show is better than, say, watch a pattern or the QVC network, but it needs some better writers. Reading the comments from the cast that glowed positively about this show, I am convinced that most of them were written by show officials and by Spike's personal friends and relatives. <br /> <br /> It's not very good most of the time.
