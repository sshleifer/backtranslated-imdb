... Or is that another way down from the masterpiece under the barrel? Preferably both! Somewhere between 1969 and 1972 came a series of several horrible horror movies that are all lost again. Nothing else needs to be explained, asked, or shouted aloud. If you've followed my writings about CARNIVAL OF BLOOD or GURU THE MAD MONK, then you know what's coming with the SCREAM BABY SCREAM. The title looks cool; it's just the weak script that should have gone elsewhere! Even so, this is the most edible work of cinematic mastery ever worked on in the movies! <br /> <br /> If you thought this was an initial failure (which benefits the average IMDb user writing another comment), better luck next time! The truth behind the script has nothing to do with the film, which allegedly speaks of a blue-faced psychopath to "kill" and make some ugly facial sculptures on its victims. It sounds like you're watching another episode "SCOOBY-DOO". My favorite scene is the monkey cage, where the four young hippie teens play. And owns an actress with the name "Eugenie Wingate" for giving us the worst facial makeup ever! 1969 has never been so bad, but it is! <br /> <br /> Try to find this 30-year rarity in a bargain basement for five bucks; makes the perfect novelty item to go back to those psychedelic days of flower power, bad fashions and useless music! Interesting note: SCREAM BABY SCREAM is also listed in the Troma movie archives on the company's website. Only time will tell when it reaches the top of the bottom 100, along with a few more advanced bucks of the '70s; God knows they need it !!! PLANE 9 is history !!!
