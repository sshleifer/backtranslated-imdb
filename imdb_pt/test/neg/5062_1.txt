This is a really nasty show. In fact, it is an example of how television has dropped since "reality" came in grand style. Tanya is beautiful, but she is also extremely rude and has a horrible taste. Is a house the place of sex appeal? Apparently some males like the show because they find Tanya attractive. The other boss is not handsome, but he is totally rude and also has a horrible taste. It is unfortunate that so many homes have to be shown while someone else still lives in them. Most people who are supposed to be seeing these houses before the changes are made should be moving to new or totally empty homes so they do not insult anyone. Most of them ... like the "crew" ... need to learn ways. I can imagine how horrible the British show is, since British reality shows tend to be even worse when it comes to good manners and good taste. <br /> <br /> What happened to the Arts and Entertainment channel? When it started (and for a few years later) it was filled with treats. Now it's a big garbage machine.
