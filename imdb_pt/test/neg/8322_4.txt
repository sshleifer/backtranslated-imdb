This movie is terrible, and I do not blame Jesus Franco, because it's not his fault. <br /> <br /> This movie was silent for many years by Welles as he got the money to bring a team and the actors together to make some shots. How much film actually shot Welles is unclear, although not all the movie or all the sequences are here from several "key" sequences, like Quixote in a movie theater, are in the hands of collectors or supporters that would not make him give up on them. The movie here is just under two hours and I would be hard-pressed to imagine it actually working in any size. I am of the opinion, based on several comments that Welles made before his death, that he never intended to release the film but was putting it as a personal toy. <br /> <br /> What exists here is most beautifully filmed, but dramatically dead. Very little happens during the first hour, besides Quixote and Sancho wandering around the country. Chest would be a kind description of the material. In the second hour, Quixote ends up in modern Spain and in a series of not very good sequences deals with daily life. This is not to say that there are some nice moments, the windmill and the chicken sequences are very good, but for the most part it is a great waste of film and time. "Completed" by Jesus Franco, who was Welles' director's assistant in the hugely superior Chimes at Midnight, we have a bunch of snippets of movies that have been put together to the best of our ability. Many people have crucified Franco as having been the reason the film stinks, but frankly you can not make a good movie out of crap material. One critic was recorded as having seen a different cut of the film in the 1970s, which means that Franco made that version on his own and ruined it. While this is true, I have found Welles stories cutting and cropping the film many, many times over the years since he could never get it right. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible, no matter how you Ultimately, I wonder how good the filmmaker Welles was. In addition to Citizen Kane, almost all of his films were plagued by a lack of budget or interfered with, so we got the excuse that many of his films "would have been better if only ...". How do we know? How can we know? Maybe Welles was a man with less talent than we thought, and many of his limit movies are not so good, and they never would have been. Although this is not the place to discuss Welles's place in film history, Don Quixote's surviving material, supposing it is close to what Welles intended (I think so), is a good argument for rethinking the way we see the man and his work. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 for the good sequences (although 2 out of 10 is probably closer to reality)
