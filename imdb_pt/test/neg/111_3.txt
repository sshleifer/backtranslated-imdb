This cheap Italian movie, shot with grainy, is about a pair of heirs from a mansion in the interior of Italy who head to the house to stay, and then find themselves being killed by ghosts of dead people in that house. <br /> <br /> I was not impressed with that. It was not really that scary, especially the way an inexpensive Italian movie should be. A girl, her two cousins ​​and a cousin's girlfriend go to this huge house for some reason (I could not figure out why) and stay there, cleaning and checking the place. The characters come in and out of the movie, and it's pretty annoying at some points, and most of the killings are fairly rushed. The girlfriend gets hit by a car when she runs away from the house after having dreamed of her death, and the scene is very good, but then things slow down again, to a confusing end, when the male cousins ​​are killed together in some strange way . and this weird guy (I could not figure out who he was during the movie, or maybe I do not remember) goes after this girl, attacking her, until finally that other girl kills him. I hate giving the ending, but that's okay. The female cousin decides to stay in the house and watch over him, and they show scenes of his life there years later. The end. You really are not missing out on anything, and anyway, you probably will not find this anywhere, so you're lucky.
