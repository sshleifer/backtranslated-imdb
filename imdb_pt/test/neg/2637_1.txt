Stay away from this movie at all costs. I was harassed to watch this movie on a bet to see which of us knew the "worst movie of all time". Needless to say, this one has won hands down. It is long and drawn out, and has no purpose or plot than I can muster. A movie about a killer kid raised from a fetus that grew out of the womb simply has no place inside your VCR. If you are extremely bored and have no life, watch this movie. But if you'd rather keep your sanity, stay away.
