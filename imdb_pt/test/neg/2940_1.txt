Stay well away from it ... No, I mean it - I know you may think this is a fun, flamboyant and extravagant B-action movie in Hong Kong. I did, but trust me, it's not. In fact, the only exact thing about this description would be the words Hong Kong, and then used only in a strictly geographical sense. <br /> <br /> Yes, Donnie Yen co-directed. Jackie Chan has a special participation. Ekin Cheng, from Storm Riders, leads. There are vampires. It must be good - or at least fun, charming and full of action. Again - it is not. <br /> <br /> I could ramble on about why this movie sucks - I could dissect it, cut it into tiny, chilling pieces. But where to start? There is so much to hate ... <br /> <br /> To make this easier, and to give credence to this hate festival, let me say that I am usually a big fan of Hogwarts cinema. The heavier material of the drama as well as the lighter action and / or comedy. The really good movies as well as the really extravagant ones. I can sit through hours of poor subtitling, jokes thigh enough to make the first grade students roll their eyes. I can deal with lovers as chaste and bachelor as a convention of nuns, which is pretty much anything else that the average movie goer would do against their metaphorical fingers on their way between action sequences. Also, Hong Kong or any other source - I love it when a movie goes from bad to bad enough to be good. <br /> <br /> But this - Arrgh! It's just awful garbage, STUPID and countless. So far from being funny or charming is really painful. So derivative of action that makes a Bergman movie look like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. <br /> <br /> Why?! Why waste this opportunity?! This could have been so much fun!
