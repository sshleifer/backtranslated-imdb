This movie has one of the worst main characters of all time. I say this because he is made to be the hero when, in my opinion, everything he does in the whole movie messes people up and causes problems. He can not do anything right, but the movie makes him look like the cool guy everyone should be admiring. He has tantrums at all the wrong times, he has all the wrong postures about things that end up making people mad at him and killing people, he's very nosy, very aggressive, very macho, assuming, making all the wrong decisions. and has no common sense. <br /> <br /> This is a private detective hired by a successful painter to find the woman and son he abandoned years ago. The detective finds the woman and what he thinks is her son. However, all kinds of things happen to make this story full of crime, drama and twists. It's made for TV, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> Either way, the movie is quite entertaining. Johnny Depp is very young in this and has a horrible haircut from the 80's. He chews chewing gum and throws a soccer ball for about 5 minutes and that's all we can see from him. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the out-of-print VHS version sells for $ 40 at online auctions. . Must be for Johnny Depp collectors only. It could not be because of the plot. Could not be. <br /> <br />
