Evil is about a great house where an evil spirit is unleashed to torture everything inside. What a movie washout! There is not a scary scene. None! Richard Crenna exaggerated a role nothing. There are some animated ghosts, a disfigurement by the electric saw and a phantom rape. After nothing special happens during almost the entire film, Evil personifies in ... Victor Buono. Great! Where did the filmmakers get the idea that Buono is scary? He looks like he was in the hobo for a starring guest salary to pay his drinks bill. So it's too late to turn it off because the damn thing is over. I felt like throwing the VCR out the window. Please, avoid this rubbish! I hope you never see the light of the DVD and disappear into obscurity.
