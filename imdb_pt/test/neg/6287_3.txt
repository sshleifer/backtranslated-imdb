Poor Robert Taylor. In addition to the FEDS, nothing went well in its way - this near shock is a waste of ninety minutes and not much more. It's one of those brutal detective crime films with the main character's narrative all the time - usually this is reserved for comedies these days, but this movie takes itself very seriously! A feather; Australian films, particularly in the periods 2000-01, have been of exceptional quality in general - but I suppose there have been some mistakes. Why even make a film like that obviously not good?
