Horrid! I'm a teenager and I do not mind teen movies, but this is awful! Aaron Carter plays this pop star named JD McQueen and to keep his grades or something, he works together with the nerd, Jane, whatever his name. But "bad girls" are too predictable and they are. The clothes most girls wear on the film are not realistic. Like any of those girls would not wear bra, tops and shirts that expose the belly? IN HIGH SCHOOL? At my school, we'd be sent home for something like that. <br /> <br /> And a part of the movie where JD sends Jane, she says, "Sleep well? He must think I'm an idiot! I did not know the text messages were so stressful! How text messages are stressful? And how Jane is obsessed with JD and how he falls in love with her is very stupid. The dialogue is tacky and stupid, the acting is terrible. the music is a bit pleasant and the plot is little or no. <br /> <br /> For tweeny-boppers who still love Aaron Carter, you'll love it. If you are a casual observer like me, this is not the movie for you
