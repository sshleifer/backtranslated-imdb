Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I'm happy to see any of their movies. Ollie is recovering from a broken leg at the hospital, and with nothing else to do, Stan decides to visit him, and get him some boiled eggs and nuts instead of candy. The chaos begins with Stan, curiously pulling Ollie's rope from his leg, and manages to push the doctor (Billy Gilbert) out the window, clinging to her, placing Ollie on the ceiling. When the situation calms down, Stan takes Ollie's clothes, as the doctor wants them both to leave, and he can also sit in a syringe accidentally left by the nurse, full of a sleeping drug, which goes into effect while he is driving. (which you can say is done with a car in front of a big screen. Filled with some nice comedy and not too bad (though repetitive and somewhat predictable) classic comedy, it's not great but it's a black and white movie Worth the worth looking at Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, number 7 in Comedians Comedians.
