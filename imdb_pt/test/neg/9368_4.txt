Or has anyone noticed the fact that the first set of episodes is too inspired by the movies of the 1990s? <br /> <br /> I mean seriously the wife who is trying to get someone to murder her rich husband so he can claim his assets. Medical students who are temporarily stopping their hearts to reach memories that are lost; Flatliners. A lot of college bodies coming together to reminisce about the old days, but are not totally comfortable because they've done something in the past, very bad things? Groundhog Day is one of my favorite movies of all time. Unfortunately, the writing staff behind their bullshit is a bunch of lazy bastards who fail to create their original scripts. <br /> <br /> Noble idea totally fubarred in its execution.
