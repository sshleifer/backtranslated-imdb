What really caught my attention about this movie was how little the plot made sense. So many characters were randomly introduced, it was like I imagine that "THE ROOM" by Tommy Wiseau would be re-imagined for the Disney Channel set. We had a wise elderly couple who kept walking where "Jane" worked, telling the same story about how "soda" joined them, or the mother of Jane / Madrasta / woman who cried randomly and who appeared at random. The acting of Aaron Carter is definitely the highlight of this film: I actually waited for all the scenes in which he appeared. The issue is painfully bad, with cutscenes that do not make sense. The character "Jane" is really annoying, going crazy and depressed about "J.D. McQueen". The scenes with the Music Awards are more depressing than anything else. And the end of this movie is surreal.
