Horror movies are a curious thing, sometimes they manage to stumble into a formula that works great, sometimes they valiantly try to tell a decent story despite the problems of time and budget, sometimes they are so bad that they are really fun. .. and sometimes they are "The Cavern". <br /> <br /> A good suspense / suspense movie should contain whims that keep you guessing; they should allow you to be interested in the characters and their motivations so that you actually have some kind of reaction when they die. However, The Cavern chooses to introduce elements that work at the beginning, only to be denied by their own dull storytelling. <br /> <br /> All characters are completely forgettable and any real story that can make any of them remotely interesting is revealed within a 30-second monologue, making it impossible to do anything more than laugh as the characters are captured almost at random and on more than one occasion, in the possibly less frightening manner. <br /> <br /> (To spoil a scene a bit, a victim is taken during a complete blackout that may have been a little daunting if the sound effect used to signal his death was not reminiscent of stirring a jar of Macaroni The camera that works makes me think the director saw an excessive number of videos of the Nine Inch Nails and an ending that in the attempt to be shocking serves almost no purpose but to annoy and confuse the viewer and you have a almost completely uncontested horror movie that fails at all levels. <br /> <br /> I will be honest with you, if you want a claustrophobic espionage horror movie, go watch "The Descent", and I feel strange saying that's because I do not particularly enjoy this movie either.
