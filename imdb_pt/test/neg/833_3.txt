This is a classic example of what happens when a participant is on TV for a long time. Everything gets tired and the jokes start to run over and over again. OK, from the beginning, the first series were very good. You had an entertainment manager (Simon Cadel) being chased by his deputy, played by Ruth Madoc, a cleaning lady who wanted to become a yellow jacket, a Punch man and Judy who hates alcoholic kids, a folded Jockey and a standing comedian. As said before, it started well, but lasted a long time. As soon as Simon Cadel left, everything started to get worse, you were having a terrible story, and a new entertainment manager that Ruth Madoc (again) played. When a comedy is all filmed in one place, there is a limit to the number of jokes that can be broken. Unfortunately this lasted so long that every joke was cracked 3 or 4 times. If this comedy had been interrupted after 2 series, it would have fallen like a classic of all time. As it is, it will be largely remembered for the terrible last series.
