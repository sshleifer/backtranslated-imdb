Excerpt from TV GUIDE: <br /> <br /> This week in THE LOVE BOAT, Captain Stubing is busy when a cryptozoologist embarks on an unexpected charge! Join the captain, Isaac, Gopher and Julie in a fun Halloween special. Guest starring a guy in a very bad lizard suit like the Chupacabra. <br /> <br /> That's typical, cut-rate rate of the lame Sci-Fi channel. The captain of a cruise ship, played by formerly respectable John Rhys-Davies, is in charge of a Carnival cruise along the coast of Mexico. Her daughter is together for the ride, and she is earning livelihood for being the ship's kickboxing instructor. Watch everyone that kickboxing will be useful later! It should be noted that the captain's daughter is quite uncoordinated and painful to watch. It would have been nice if she could have participated in some kickboxing classes before trying to play an instructor in a movie. Captain Stupid and his daughter join Mrs. Thurston Howell of Gilligan's Island, an eccentric cryptozoologist. and a mysterious and shadowy stranger on this 90-minute ride in boredom. <br /> <br /> That's right, I said cryptozoologist. He goes on to mention that he brought some precious cargo on board that he needs to check. Needless to say, the box contains a Chupacabra that someone decides to let go. From this point on, a man in a rubber Chupacabra suit runs around the ship, killing people. Captain Stupid is powerless to stop you. He decides to call the Marines, but telling them that there is a bunch of terrorists on his ship. <br /> <br /> The Marines respond. They say everything that speaks the marine language like "Hooya" and "Get Some". But these foolish Marines are no match for a Chupacabra. They do not really tell anyone where they are going, so there is no help in sight. I do not think anyone will miss a battalion of missing marines. But do not forget ... Captain Stupid's daughter is, fortunately, a Kickboxing instructor. Yay for Little Stupid! She arrives well at the right time, she hits the bloodthirsty Goat Sucker and saves the day. Chupacabra means goat sucker. So Chupacabras suck. But there is no way the Chupacabras suck as much as this movie.
