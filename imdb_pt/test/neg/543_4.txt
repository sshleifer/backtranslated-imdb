I struggle to see the point of this movie. It's supposed to be a comedy, but I did not laugh once. The plot is one that might have been interesting in a well-made movie, but since this is comedian acting, the result is totally unbelievable (as comedies should be). The comic book series was very messed up, even with the episodes, and it's fair to say that everyone involved started doing bigger things. One to avoid. I also discovered that the comments need to have 10 lines. The main point of these comments is to give an indication that it is worth watching the movie: do not write a essay about it or disassemble it. If you like: Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, Young, Alan Partridge, Arrested Development, Kerb, Red Dwarf, then you may like to pass this. On the other hand, if you like boring jokes, as can be found in Friends and Dodgeball, enjoy watching!
