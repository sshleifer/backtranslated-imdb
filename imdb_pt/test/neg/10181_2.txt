The only reason I gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 was because for some reason I felt compelled to end it! Basically, I wanted to see if there were any aliens, any UFOs, anything suggested by the movie title, the movie cover, and the beginning of the movie! I was very disappointed to see the religion being thrown into the mix the way it was. This could have been used to the advantage of the movie, but I felt, instead, that the movie was trying to send subliminal messages to me! Finally, how big was the wardrobe of this cast! I was so distracted by the number of different and extremely bright shirts that each character had in each new scene that I began to wonder if this movie should not be classified as "bad comedy." <br /> <p> Thumbs down!
