Lame B-horror that takes itself very seriously considering its subject concerns an aging old man who was turned into a creature of the night by a tenant who came to rent a room from her. When the tenant is killed, the mother has to leave to feed herself and this causes some tension in the family and also attracts some attention from the authorities. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is that this movie should have brought The FUNNY. Failed to do so despite having some makeup effects from monstrosity and gore to keep the B movie crowd happy. I saw worse, but I would not give this a rec - 4.5 / 10.
