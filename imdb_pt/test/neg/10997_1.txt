I saw it on the cable. Someone had to lose their job by signaling this to the air. Just because a movie is made does not mean it has to be shown! Savage Instinct should be shown in ALL movie classes. It's the perfect model not to make a movie. The issue alone is so confusing that you think it was mounted by a team of trained (evil) monkeys, traveling down an unpaved canyon road in the back of a jeep, blindfolded and drunk. The audio is usually not readable. Acting I can not call anything I've seen here acting. Reciting? Hmmm I can not call that either. Failing? It works. All that has been said ... IT IS HILARIOUS! I can not emphasize enough that there is no redeemable factor in this "movie" beyond the hilarity derived from its own incredible ineptitude. Fun, in a strictly masochistic way. Watch ... if you dare.
