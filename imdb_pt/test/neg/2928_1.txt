Can this "movie" be regarded as a movie? Imagine the situation: someone places a camera on a tripod and in front of a promenade and films people walking or running along it. Then he puts the camera on a beach, buys some ducks in a pet shop, opens his cages and lets them run in front of the camera. Later, he just films the surface of the water and the sound of birds and insects in an absolute darkness. Is it an experience or just an insult to the public's intelligence? What would happen if some unknown director made a movie like that? Would we score his work with 10? I always disappoint the directors who believe they can do whatever they want once they become famous.
