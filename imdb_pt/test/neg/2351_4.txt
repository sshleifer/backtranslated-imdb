The subspecies is established in Romania, where two American university students, Michele (Laura Mae Tate) and Lillian (Michelle McBride) arrive to study local folklore with the help of local friend Mara (Irina Movila). There they rent rooms in a hotel and are curious about the mysterious ruins of a nearby castle, and a powerful and evil vampire named Radu (Anders Hove) lives there, who stole Bloodstone from his father, King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm). . Radu takes a fancy to the three girls and begins drinking the blood of Mara & Lillian, meanwhile, Michele falls in love with a guy named Stefan (Michael Watson) who happens to be Radu's brother. Michele and Stefan decide to unite and rid the world of the evil Radu ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Ted Nicolaou, this movie seems to be very considerate among fans of the genre and, although not terrible, I certainly do not I would do it. I do not call him very well and I do not really see anything much to excite me. Subspecies is a somewhat slow movie, not much that actually happens and as it tries to stay close to certain classical Vampire knowledge, there is all this nonsense about a Bloodstone and some small monsters that grow from Radu's severed fingertips for some reason. Subspecies could have been a decent movie if it were not for the fact that it's annoying, I really can not remember much of it, good or bad. The character is fine but sometimes the dialogue is silly and there is a scene that bothered me near the start when the girls are in the ruins of the castle and one of them says that it has to go because it is getting dark but it is still clearly in the middle of the very bright day. There's also a scene where one of the American girls finds a coffin in the attic of the hotel and does not seem really bothered by it, I'm not being funny, but it's a guy whose house I was staying in had a coffin in his attic too , very worried if you know what I mean. I do not think I would want to watch it again, there is no real threat, the plot is weak, it mixes classic Vampire themes with silly subplots and I was distinctly indifferent to it all. It's not the worst movie of all time, but it's hardly the best. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be well on nice locations and some local sights, although you feel that the looks are under budget, rather than the producers trying authenticity. There is not much blood besides a decapitation and a few broken fingertips. For no apparent reason, the manufacturers release some monsters that look like stop motion animation that actually do nothing or have much meaning to the story. <br /> <br /> Filmed at low cost by Full Moon Entertainment's production of the Charles Band. company in Bucharest, Romania, production figures are good and better than many later Band Productions. The acting is not good, with many of the cast performing below normal performances, while Angus Scrimm has a small appearance at the beginning. There is a bit of style here from time to time with a scene strongly reminiscent of the original Nosferatu (1922) in particular the part showing the shadow of Radu coming down the ladder with his long claw like nails standing out. <br /> <br /> Subspecies is a movie that many seem to like for reasons I do not see well, I thought it was completely average at best and generally quite boring. Followed by Bloodstone: Subspecies II (1993), Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994), Subspecies 4: Bloodstorm (1998) and the spinoff film of Vampire Journals (1997).
