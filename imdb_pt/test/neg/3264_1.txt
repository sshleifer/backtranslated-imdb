Why has this movie been made? They spotted the original Caddyshack with that crap. I was only able to watch half and I did not laugh once. At least I did not pay to see it because it was on tv but I'm not going back that hour of my life that I spent watching this terrible mess. There was an original star of the first except for Chevy Chase and he probably regrets having Jackie Mason was supposed to be the outrageous, funny clown as Rodney Dangerfield was at first, but Jackie Mason was not funny at all. Jackie Mason is not Rodney Dangerfield. If you want to laugh, watch the first Caddyshack. If you like terrible movie then this is the movie. This movie stinks like a barn in July. Avoid at all costs.
