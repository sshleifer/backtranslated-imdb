Two teenagers in northeastern England are desperate to raise money and buy season tickets for their favorite football team. They go through a series of "comic misadventures", but end up smiling in the end. <br /> <br /> The trailer for this movie sells it as a comedy and includes most of its joyous moments. However, the tone is increasingly somber and the end result is a depressingly populated story of familiar stereotypes. The two "heroes" have no problem lying, cheating and stealing. His opponents are an insensitive teacher, a villainous pantomime villain, a psychotic skinhead, and a well-meaning but incompetent social worker. The other female characters are a teenage drug addict, a pregnant student and a battered wife who seems to be smoking to death. There are no friendly characters, and the public can only feel pity or contempt. Local actors Tim Healy and Kevin Whateley play against the guy as villains, but the writing and direction of their characters are so one-dimensional that they have nothing but novelty value. <br /> <br /> Chris Beattie and Greg McLane give good performance in both young leads. However, they are miscast because they have the wrong accent. For anyone from the northeast, it is obvious that they both come from the Sunderland / Durham area, and yet we are expected to believe they are natives of Newcastle. Like Geordie, I can assure you that the accents are by no means the same. Take the phrase "Let the poor boy speak." We say "Let the boy speak" while they say "piwer lad spiyk," with two distinctly different vowel sounds. This discrepancy creates a ridiculous double irony in a scene at the Sunderland football ground where the two boys try to disguise the Newcastle accents they do not have and pretend they come from Sunderland - which they clearly do. In a gentle comedy, this kind of criticism can be viewed as an uncertain choice. However, the somber tone of the film makes it clear that screenwriter / director Mark Herman is wanting realism: it means that "close enough" is really far away. <br /> <br /> I expected humor and optimism from this movie. and instead found old tired cliches. Tyneside is not a gray earth populated only by losers, and telling us it is, Herman should have known he would offend. It is interesting to compare the film with the director's "Vozzinha" - also largely pessimistic and populated by one-dimensional characters, "Little Voice" at least has a talented heroine and does not sink into misery to the same extent. I heard "Belter" next to "Billy Elliot" this year, but this movie is a much more enjoyable and life-affirming experience. <br /> <br /> By the way, I may be very old, but having lived in Tyneside for 42 years, I've never heard anyone outside of this movie use the expression "Purely Belter".
