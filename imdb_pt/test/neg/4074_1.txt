This film was embarrassing in its clich√©s, poor acting and generally low production values. It starts badly with the long-haired 3-star general calling the hero, Masters, "major" when he is obviously wearing the lieutenant colonel's silver oak leaves. But the most unpleasant was the crew of soldiers at Neptune's Atoll. How out of touch with any kind of reality can you? They were all experts at piloting a 747 and the scenes of the soldiers digging the ditch were beyond comic. <br /> <br /> WARNING: THIS MOVIE IS DANGEROUS FOR YOUR INTELLECTUAL HEALTH! WATCH YOUR OWN PERIL!
