It was praised for being a fast and fun comedy and the best German film of the year, so I tried it, although I've seen a few Dani Levy films - or at least parts of them. <br /> <br /> I got what I expected: no comedy, unless you think heart attacks are funny. It is a good example of sloppy screen writing, with a plot and implausible characters, loaded with cliches that may be true, but certainly not funny either. <br /> <br /> The most annoying character is Zucker's wife, by Hannelore Elsner. She has to behave incredibly strange to keep the plot moving. For example, she knows nothing about Judaism, but for reasons probably unfamiliar even to herself, she has the idea of ​​playing the charade that she and her family are Jewish laws that obey the Jews for their husband's family, and the variety very orthodox and hypocritical. To make it a little more complicated, she invites the four of them to stay in their apartment in the city because they arrive from Frankfurt in Berlin without having booked their hotels in advance, something that is not a business man of 60 years, not really is German. would ever do. This gives the viewer a lot to swallow, but still can not make a joke. Zucker and his brother Samuel have not seen each other for forty years, but it turns out that their daughter - now a lesbian - and Samuel's son - now a militant orthodox - have long been lovers, and he is the father of your daughter. Samuel's daughter - a nymphomaniac - goes after Zucker's gay son. Is this supposed to be a somewhat humorous parody of Jewish incestuous tendencies? It's probably just a thoughtless way of adding a little "love action turmoil" to every crazy comedy. And of course, it does not make jokes either. <br /> <br /> The praise for this film is purely political. So only people who enjoy watching movies that are supposed to be "politically important" will like this movie - even though "Alles auf Zucker!" clearly of no importance of any kind. <br /> <br /> For everything else: Do not watch without a "Fast Forward" option. I really missed that.
