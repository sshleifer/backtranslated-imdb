There are many different versions of this one, so make sure you can locate one of the unclassified copies, otherwise you may be missing some injury and a nudity scene. Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there. The cut I saw was the title of the screen WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by the Shriek Show, which retains the original US release title, WITCHERY, for the DVD release. It is a beautiful print and seems to have all the pictures, but it has some cut / proportion problems. In Italy, it was released as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT). The first two releases of LA CASA were actually the first two films of EVIL DEAD (with title) and the third LA CASA was another film from the same producer (Filmirage), which is better known here in the United States as GHOSTHOUSE. To make things even more confusing, WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2. Except in Germany, where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OREU: DEMONS 3. Okay, I'd better shut up now. I'm starting to get confused! <br /> <br /> Regardless of the title, this is a very successful terror effort. Some of them are good, others are not. In fact, I was in this movie in the first half, but in the end, it became a meaningless mess. A large, unoccupied hotel located on an island about 80 miles from Boston is the setting as several people are picked up one by one by a German-speaking witch (Hildegard Knef). Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff), who wants to capture "Witch Light", and his virginal girlfriend girlfriend (Leslie Cumming), who is studying witchcraft, are staying at the hotel without permission. Next comes real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who is showing property to potential buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks. Also tagging together are your kids; pregnant daughter grown Jane (Linda Blair) and very young son Tommy (Michael Manchester) as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - wife of Hasselhoff at the time). Once everyone is inside, their boat driver is dead (suspended) and the boat disappears, so they are trapped and basically at the mercy of the "Lady in Black". <br /> <br /> So, what can you expect? find here? Plenty of nasty! One of the characters has his lips sewn together and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally roasted slowly by the rest of the cast. There is also a crucifixion, witches eating a dead baby, a swordfish in the head, someone burned, a possession, a recorder of the Sesame Street, the virgin being raped by some devil, veins jumping and exploding thanks to voodoo doll jokes. and some other things. From the technical point of view, it is a good-looking film with excellent cinematography, decent punctuation and good bloody effects. The hotel / island is also pretty nice. Blair (particularly in the end) and Ross seem to be having fun and Knef is great as the bad witch. Even if people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days, he's not bad in his role either. <br /> <br /> On the downside, despite all the blood, the movie seems a little monotonous and monotonous after about an hour. . Supernatural themes are confusing and confusing as well. As the characters are being swept into the witch's den to be tortured and killed, the filmmakers have improperly decided to overrule the bawdy actors about a spiral vortex effect that seems extremely tacky. And the witches' lair itself is unoccupied and cheap, designed with unfinished wood. And while most of the cast is at least decent, some of the performances (particularly the "actress" who portrays Hasselhoff's girlfriend and boy) are so bad they are constantly distracting.
