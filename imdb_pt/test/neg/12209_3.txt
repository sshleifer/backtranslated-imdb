As much as I love the story of David Copperfield, I can not claim to have liked this film. It was probably the second worst movie I've ever seen. One problem I see is that the magnitude of the novel calls for a mini-series of several hours, rather than a normal movie. It is simply impossible to capture a significant amount of the events that happen in the story in two hours. I do not like the litter flashback format. It was disjointed and it would be impossible for someone who did not know the story to fully understand. Also, I do not think the filmmakers have interpreted Copperfield's personality correctly. The idea of ​​him wandering on a beach moaning about his life seems inconsistent with the proactive and innovative nature that Dickens gave him in the novel. Agnes also bothered me. She came across a familiar decor rather than a strong woman. Dora was perfect, though. This movie was full of problems, and I look forward to someone to make a decent screen version.
