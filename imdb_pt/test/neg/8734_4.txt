Although the embryo might have been a potentially provocative examination of bioethics, it degenerated into a stereotyped parable of Frankenstein, showing the monotonous lesson that there were some realms that man should not enter or study. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is experimenting with ways to prevent aborted babies from dying. After success with a dog, he immediately leaps into the medical ethics that violates human beings and any sense of plausibility - with the equally unrealistic help of a hospital administrator. Your experience works great, with some decidedly unpleasant side effects. <br /> <br /> Although Barbara Carrera is reasonably good in her role, and part of the training with animals is spectacular, the film suffers from being too fantastic. Although a message in the prologue assures viewers that this represents contemporary technology, the scientific work portrayed seems to be much sought after even in the twenty-first century, not to mention the mid-1970s. In addition, the scene in which Carrera is able to find a cure for the side effects of bioengineering simply by typing a question on a computer is laughable.
