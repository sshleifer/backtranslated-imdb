Bette Midler is the best thing about this movie. It is a POOR second to the 1962 original with Natalie Wood as a gypsy. The songs were much better in the original and the costumes were better. Bette's voice was great and she looked better on most clothes compared to Cynthia Gibb. Only someone who did not see the original would think this is a good movie. <br /> <br /> There was not enough change between the ugly duckling and the pretty girl. When Natalie Wood was a gypsy, she was only seen as beautiful when she entered the dress with her gloves for the first time to perform in the burlesque show. When she has her hair down and magically everything is done beautifully and she looks so elegant, it's an important aspect to the film, because it's also the first time that Gypsy sees herself as something special and that she can really be a star. , not just a poor substitute for his sister. And the scenes in which she slowly becomes more famous were rushed. It was an important part of the movie and they massacred it. It is crucial to show him being more comfortable with his future as a stripper and the facts are amazing in these scenes in the original. It was a huge disappointment to watch him unfold in this movie. I was completely disappointed and if it was not for Bette Midler I would have closed the film.
