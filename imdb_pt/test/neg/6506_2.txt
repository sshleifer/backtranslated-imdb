Despite a well-produced film for the television movie, Dying to Love You smacks of low-grade melodramatic splendor. The movie opens for Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson, looking much older than I remember him), who is a struggling business man who leads an empty, lonely life after his wife Ruthie (which looks suspiciously like Roseanne Arnold) leaves him with the speed. Now all Roger has is his cats ... and his ad in the paper. <br /> <br /> When your ad is answered, it will call Johnnie-Elaine-Lisa-oh, it does not matter if I am who you want me to be - Lawrence. So ... they have sex on the phone. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure where you are or when you were born but I remember that phone sex was played in the late 80's. I'm sorry but that was useless. <br /> <br /> Soon, Roger and the couple bond and have a vertiginous romance. They fall in love, visit the zoo to see the gorillas and then have perverse sex with Roger's son in the other room. She ties him to the bed and seduces him. <br /> <br /> Roger is so stupid that he does not realize that Johnnie-Eliane is just a bitch who likes to sleep around. God forbid that women sleep with only one man. Soon, strange phone calls begin to occur, Johnny Girl wants Roger to marry her with absolute speed, and she keeps complaining and raving about the ex-husband who used to beat her. It's funny to see Roger believing her through all these things. That's until a sloppy co-worker tells you to snoop around your belongings as a nosy housewife. He takes his shit advice and behold, he finds a suitcase full of fake ID badges and wigs and guns and a beast. He immediately takes the suitcase to the police and she is arrested. Despite all this jazz, he still loves the broad mute. She tells a lot of lies, it seems like her tongue will catch fire if she tells the truth once. Roger continues with his life and meets an ugly woman named Angela, who looks like something from Gremlins. She also has a son and Roger loves her very much. But something inside Roger's subconscious keeps him connected to Lisa Rohn (if that's his real name) and he keeps coming back to see her. <br /> <br /> Now Lisa is the "ex not going away" as she "wins" herself a free jail card and appears at the door of Roger and her son Matt is so busy trying to see her, Pour juice all over the floor. IL 'Rog is so stupid, he throws Lisa out and does not even change the locks. Boy, if all people were idiots, I would not even be writing that comment. The end of this movie is so cheesy, you will not believe it. <br /> <br /> Tim Matheson is a king made for TV. he just looks like a mummy of this kind in this movie. It is a bit wood and hard. The dazzling Tracy Pollan works well with her role and her trumpeting touch is true. She is extremely beautiful and I see what Michael J. Fox sees in her. <br /> <br /> This movie is great to watch when you're on this hint of dawn, but then again, you can fall asleep, considering how monotonous and bland it is.
