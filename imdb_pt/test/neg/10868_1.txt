That's what I kept wondering while watching this movie. I mean, the amount of nudity and sex was one thing, but another part of the movie that gave its genre to the adult industry was the lack of history. I really just wanted to get up and leave the whole movie, but I persisted. I persisted in the hope that perhaps the plot would improve, that there might be a good turnaround in the end. However, I could not be more wrong. In the end, I persisted because I realized I could write a bad review for anything after watching it. <br /> <br /> I mean, do not get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with beautiful, sexy and vibrant women, but when the director only shows this along with a shitty story thinking that's what the viewer wants see, insult us all. To think that we are all so superficial that we only want to see burlesque of great actors of the cinematographic industry is absurd. My advice: hire a different movie.
