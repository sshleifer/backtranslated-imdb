This movie must be renamed: Sex in the 70s In a part of New York City called Greenwich Village and Chelsea. <br /> <br /> This movie does little to talk about sex in the 1970s, except focusing on hypersexual public environments. and private sex spaces in New York City. I doubt the Manhole bar was symbolic of the real sex in the 70's and that this type of sex is much more prevalent in the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the time period seems like a blast. And it is very important to document the scene to which the film refers. But as far as calling this movie Sex in the 70's, the title is a bit misleading. Technically, he's not nominated for an Oscar, but the crudity of that seems appropriate. <br /> <br /> In general, an "eh".
