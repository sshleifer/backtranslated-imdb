First of all, just let me say this ... Ghost Story .... Hello?! <br /> <br /> If any of the other people who destroyed this film from beginning to end realized this fact, their reviews would have been very different. The fact that the characters continue to disappear whenever the protagonist returns to look, should have been a revelation inoperative. This movie was not advertised as a ghost story when you went to rent it at the video store, not even a tip, and that is the biggest mistake made by the studio that marketed it. It was deliberate on their part not to market it as a ghost story in order to confuse it as if the main character was confused while trying to understand the subject. The problem with this is that they have lost many viewers; the ghosts looked "too real and human" without any of the usual signs, images or special effects that Hollywood used to show that you're seeing a ghost ... and that's what they were trying to do. The main character does not know she's seeing ghosts or the viewer. Now you understand? As long as you understand that the main character is seeing ghosts then you will understand the movie and will not be so annoyed with what is perceived as gross oversights in continuity or plotting failures. <br /> <br /> I admit, that Having said that, it was still not a good movie, but it was not as bad as everyone already knew. Just understand, if you plan to watch this movie, whatever you see, "is not" always what you think it is. 4 out of 10 for acting, 3 for originality, 5 for plot and 5 for scare factor, although there were some bloody and scary moments. Still not a good movie, just misunderstood.
