I was subjected to this terrible excuse for a TV movie. I just watched because I do not have cable and my only other options were golf, college basketball or local news. The plot is very generic and has no substance that I could see, not to mention I had a big flaw in my eyes. The main character, Dr. Sorensen, is an astronomer who believes that an asteroid called "Nemesis" will attack the Earth, causing it to cease all life. He bases his belief in his discovery of cave paintings by an Aboriginal (I'm sure I spelled it wrong). The paintings show an apparent timeline, showing significant events throughout history, such as the construction of the Great Wall of China. All events are shown in perfect chronological order, and the last image on the timeline is the Earth being destroyed. Now for me, if the painting showed things that really happened, why would the great doctor believe that he could somehow change what would happen? All this aside, the film followed with extreme stereotyped precision. There was nothing in the movie that surprised me at all. The actors were not very good, and on some occasions I just felt that they did not even take the movie seriously to make enough effort to try to convince me that the characters were worth worrying about. The whole movie was clich√© and a waste of time and money. I would recommend Armageddon on this piece of crap any day. At least Armageddon performs well (compared to that), not to mention Liv Tyler's eye candy. Now that I think about it, Golf is not that bad .......
