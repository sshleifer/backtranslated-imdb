This show demonstrates the depths to which the drama of the UK TV pre-basin has sunk. With these tedious scripts, mediocre acting, mediocre plotting, terrible dialogue, we are forced to watch a DVD of any old-fashioned episode of emergency room to see an excellent hospital drama. <br /> <br /> None of the actors employed in this program seems to be able to really take action! <br /> <br /> If you want low quality but easy to absorb TV style soap opera, this is the show for you. Personally, I like something with more flesh on the bone. Unfortunately, as with all other UK license contributors, I am funding this scum.
