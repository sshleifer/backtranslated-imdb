Bay area residents probably remember Paul from the Diamond Center, an unctuous hawker who flipped easy credit and cheap rock on late-night television during the '80s and' 90s. I mention it only because there is an actor in Machines of Death who looks as if he owns an Italian restaurant. He appears in the best scene in this extremely untouchable and almost unreachable criminal drama about a Dragon Lady (Mari Honjo, who wisely turned off his spurs after finishing this movie) who controls the local syndicate. Our hero (let's call him Paul from the Diamond Center) plays the restaurant owner with all the subtlety of Simpson's Luigi ("do you like spaghetti?") And does not seem impressed when one of his customers complains about the food. No, there is no fly in the soup or the hair of the sauce: there is a Red Buddha in the mass, the visiting card of the killer crime boss, who sends a statuette to each of his possible victims. Death Machines is bad by any measure, and very annoying, which is a crime even worse.
