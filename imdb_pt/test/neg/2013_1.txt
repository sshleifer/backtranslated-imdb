Imagine the worst thing that could ever be conceived by human intellect. Now imagine something infinitely darker - I mean, worse than that. Then multiply this by the amount of suckiness possessed by Star Wars Holiday Special. This movie is much worse than that. "Dracula 3000: Infinite Darkness," starring renowned and respected actors such as Coolio and Langley Kirkwood (as the film's "horrifying antagonist," Count ORLOCK) is "It is possible to eat the feces themselves exclusively by whole life, condensed in about an hour and twenty minutes. To be frank, there is no way to approach a review of this cinematic tragedy - replete with communist propaganda, drug use promotion, futuristic anachronisms, and possibly the worst special effects since the (original) "War of the Worlds." The hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union can be viewed with pride in all the dark scenarios they dare call a spaceship. Lenin can be seen on various posters throughout the "movie". And, of course, religion was abolished for two centuries until then. So they do not know who this "God" is, even though they have no reservations in using His name in vain. But it is clear that, in the Socialist Republic of Space (presided over by President Interstellar Baker), drugs similar to death are legalized and quite common. However, poor mobility seems even worse than it is today (they do not even have a wheelchair ramp). Racial tension still spreads throughout the galaxy in a familiar / predictable way. We get great comments about ethnic division through phrases such as "Dracula is a brotha", "we brethren, we have to unite," and "when you are black, you will not return." Speaking of the symbolic black characters, one is played by Coolio. Playing a stereotyped stoner, Coolio becomes possibly the most annoying and ridiculous vampire ever. Oh wait, SECOND vampire most ridiculous of all. This valuable title goes to our friend COUNT ORLOCK, from PLANET TRANSYLVANIA, in the CARPATHIAN SYSTEM. These two make a good pair, between Coolio's attempts to cripple a paraplegic, strange attempts to make high-frequency animal noises, a hairdo of 1004 years, and gigantic stretches of utterly worthless dialogs; and the generic twenty-dollar Halloween vampire costume of Earl Orlock, exploding coffins or a confusing and indecent story. <br /> <br /> One can imagine if they did not give Coolio the opportunity to stay "as tall as a kite in space". without gravity, "let him interact with the other" actors ", and it was only there. The motives of Count Orlock are also a bit in question. or "infinite darkness", as the movie's subtitle wants you to believe? Does he want to eat the crew? Or does he want * Coolio * to "kill them all"? Or does he want to give people with disabilities a chance in such an inept future <br /> <br /> This does not really matter, because no plot of this movie makes sense anyway. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this movie has to be the end.More for the fact that it means that the movie is over, and for any merit of the abrupt train of a climax, they call ahead of the credits.Instead of facing Count Orlock in some kind of duel (the closest we can get is a shot of Orlock striking at breakneck speed in front of our protagonist, who dies little later), our heroes beat him by severing his arm in a normal way. Then Orlock begins to collapse, screaming in pain at a wholly mundane injury, though understandably painful. This is by far the most fun you will get from this movie. Watching the contorted face of a vampire as he cries in pain will leave him on the edge of the chair - with laughter. Almost worth the four dollars for it alone. Of course, right after that, we're treated to one of the worst stories in the film, the all-encompassing allusion to sex, and perhaps the most humble challenge to a FINAL * ALWAYS *. They are heading for the sun, and their ship literally explodes before it even remotely comes near the impact. I think they just outdid the Wachowski brothers. for the worst end ever. <br /> <br /> I can only sleep at night because we know that a sequence is impossible. Sure in this fact, we can safely say that this is the WORST FILM CREATED, and that will never be surpassed in low quality, lower budget and less talent in acting.
