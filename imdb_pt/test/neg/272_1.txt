Like most people, I could not wait to see this sequel to Ocean 11, but it really stinks, I must say. It stinks because there simply is not a good script, it was cheap. I hope the producers will squeeze all the money that this movie made (or will make) to the tsunami victims in Asia, so this movie will have at least one good reason to exist. It's so bad I can not even write a decent review about it, but ... I still advise the creators of this thing to do "Ocean's 13". Ocean's 13 will be about the same thieves who are trying to steal a screenplay well hidden somewhere in Hollywood. The 13th member will be a foreign (perhaps Russian) screenwriter who knows all the tricks to write a well-hidden copy of this script so they can replace the original they will have to steal. Or they need to find at least 13 people to write a decent script for a movie in which not only Julia Roberts plays herself, but even all the other star members of the Ocean films. 13 People because it's the lucky number of Andy Garcia's character.
