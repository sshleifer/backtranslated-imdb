This is what used to be called a "women's portrait" and later a "girl movie," when times and movies became more youthful. The plot is just a novel for women and will only appeal to these guys. The only appeal to most guys is if they want to see a very lean Mary Tyler Moore in knits. (If you're a certain age like me, that might be enough to take a look.) Otherwise, MTM gives another of her typical numbers presentations she's given since the early 1970's when she picked it up. to the heart that she was the beloved of America. Christine Lathi gives another of those abrasive and nasty performances that seem like a real part of her as a person and probably only appeal to those of that kind. (Sorry, but it seems to be true.) Ted Danson is very young as an MTM husband and usually gives a rather scary call unless he has an active partner who can ease him. And it does not happen here. Allan Burns wrote and directed and probably got everything because she worked with Mary before, wrote as a project for her, and she had the juice at this point to do that. There seems to be no other purpose for this.
