when I first read about "berlin am meer" I did not expect much. but I thought with the right people, the right venues, the right music and fashion that you could at least make a trivial movie about hip berlin everyone seems to be talking about. but the eissler failed, it's so ridiculously not authentic. It is a complete misrepresentation of what is happening on the Berlin scene. Of course it's not all about hippie, but you should expect more from a movie being sold as "the definitive Berlin movie." <br /> <br /> And beyond all things of credibility, it really is a bad movie. mediocre acting and a rather annoying storyline. Interestingly enough some of the actors have proven in other films that they are actually very talented. so it must be a bad driving skill. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about watching "berlin am meer" unless you're 17, come from a small town in western Germany and want to move to the big city after you've finished school. then you may actually find it enjoyable and totally legal.
