The original GRUDGE (the original American remake) surprisingly took away almost everything you could do right with a ghost movie. There was suspense, a somber, moody atmosphere, some good jolts and some genuinely scary images. THE GRUDGE 2 tries all these techniques but ends up failing by just showing us the same old things we saw in the first film as well as a messy plot that constantly changes from Tokyo to California. It begins in Tokyo with some students entering the house, now heavily blocked by a strip of police tape. One of them comes face to face with a similarly wide-eyed ghost girl while stuck in a closet. She leaves, screaming frantically, and everyone runs from there. Then we cut to America, where Karen's sister is sent by her mother to Japan to find her and take her back home. We finally found ourselves following a very familiar concept involving a curious boy and girl investigating the story of a mysterious house. We cut the girls from the beginning, they are disappearing one by one, as well as a boy listening to strange noises in the apartment next door, all leading to a very unsatisfactory end. The "scare" scenes are monotonous and ineffective. Like The Ring 2, avoid this awful sequel ...
