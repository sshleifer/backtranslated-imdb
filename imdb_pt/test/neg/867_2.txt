Mother begins the night in the middle of nowhere, in what looks like a wooden building in the desert. A pickup truck pulls up and an angry father sends his naughty daughter Virginia Monroe away and leaves her, but she is not alone as the shadowy figure of Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) watches her from a short distance. Virginia tries to talk, but as she cuts a cigarette under the leopard print, high and high boots, Nestor grabs her by the neck and drags her into the darkness. Nestor then opens his open top, turns into a monster and begins to eat his bowels. Virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer that has Lieutenant Carlo Hendrix (Art Evans) and the Los Angeles police puzzled, or at least that's the message that a local TV reporter named Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) is telling the viewers. Clay is happily living with his pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough) and therefore his mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) has a vacant room, which decides to rent for the dark "blind" sunglasses using Nestor. Unfortunately for Emily she accidentally beats Nestor's sunglasses, revealing that he has strange eyes, Nestor then turns into a monster again and bites Emily to turn her into a flesh-eating monster like him. Nestor takes Emily to training her, they find a homeless homeless man (Rory VanSaint), they kill him and eat their insides, but Clay, Emily's son, has witnessed the whole thing and he must choose between doing what is right and your love for your mother. now it just happens to be a grotesque monster sucking blood and flesh! <br /> <br /> Edited, written and directed by Patrick Rand I thought Mom was a horrible movie. Looking at some of the other comments about IMDb and the genre list, it seems that many seem to think that Mom is a horror comedy. Well, I can tell you now that I have not seen any element of comedy in my mother because there are none, unless they are very subtle. The only thing I can assume is that people see comedy in the actual situation that the mother presents, that being an old lady turning into a meat-eating monster and the predictable problems and emotional anguish it causes the discovering son. There are no jokes (besides naming a Beverly Hills whore (Stella Stevens)), slapstick humor or anything, even remotely funny, in the movie itself and, as far as I can see, it is played totally over 90 minutes. So, since there's no comedy in the mother, that means there's a lot of horror, right? Wrong, Mom sucks and it's painfully slow to watch, especially after the first thirty odd minutes consisting of Nestor turning into a monster a couple of times, biting Emily, showing him how to hunt down food and discover Clay. Up to this point, Mom was moving at a reasonably decent pace, had some special makeup effects, and it interested me, unfortunately Mom runs for another hour, which is basically the emotional crap suffered by Emily's son, the eventual collapse of the marriage of his and her being torn between love for his mother and the fact that she is a flesh-eating monster. This part of the movie is incredibly slow, boring and as monotonous as dishwater even having the courage to resort to a role reversal clich√© scenario where Clay tells his mother to go to her room and stand there locking the door behind her, telling him off by placing bars on her window so she can not escape the room. Mom's script totally ignores the origins of the monsters and asks us to simply accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should, no matter how silly an explanation may have been, I think some background for the monster would have helped. Technically, Mummy is bland and cheap-looking, though I can not say she's badly made, with nothing that impresses or anything I could make fun of to pass the time. The special effect of makeup on the monster is OK, but it is used in very fast flashes, blinks and you will miss them. Do not be fooled by any fancy video box artwork like I was, the monster is only three times at most and all that are within the first thirty minutes. Also there is not much blood, a severed arm, some brief gut eating, a burned body and a drill in someone's arm is all we have. The acting is good, but, please, Mr. Brion James, what is this devious accent? At least James had the good sense to know that he was in the crap and opted sensibly for being killed early in the process, everyone is no one expects the black lieutenant who was also a black cop on Fright Night (1985), but you can recognize him from Die Hard 2 (1990), he did Mom & Die Hard 2 the same year?! Talk about the opposite ends of the spectrum! Overall there is nothing I can really recommend to Mom as a horror movie and it certainly is not a comedy as much as I'm worried about. Very poor, very disappointing and once again I have been fooled by fancy video box artwork with lots of pictures of cool looking monsters. Definitely one to avoid.
