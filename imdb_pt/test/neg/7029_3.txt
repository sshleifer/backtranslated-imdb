This movie was horrible! Ashley Rose Orr, while talented tap dancer and singer (actually a little better than Temple in terms of the latter), is a terrible actress. She plays the character as Shirley we saw on the screen in her movies, whether it's playing on screen or off screen. So what we have is an overly fluffy and totally unreal portrait (not to mention uninteresting). If someone wants to see this side of her, one can just rent one of their movies. The only bright light here is Connie Britton's portrait of Gertrude Temple. I do not think it was very realistic, but at least it was well interpreted. Save yourself the trouble and rent the poor rich girl.
