If you've heard the saying, "The book is always better than the movie," Heart of Darkness is no exception to the rule. I think it was much easier for me to understand the details of the novel throughout the film because I read the book aloud with my English class. We discussed each paragraph in detail, so I understood the concept quickly. I really could not understand the plot while watching the movie. This may be because there were no classroom discussions, but I suppose that is also because I could not paint my own images in mind about the events of the novel. If you're the kind of person who believes in this familiar saying, then stop watching the Dark Heart movie off your to-do list.
