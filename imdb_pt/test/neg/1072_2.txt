Honestly, Mr. Thalluri ... if you make a drama movie in a high school environment following a group of teenagers during a school day and if you mess up time and jump back and forth ... if you do that you can not use exactly the same visual "Elephant" device that is using a camera that is moving from one character to another and having scenes shown 3 times from different angles. You simply can not do it, because it's such a hard blow that it's hard to believe that anyone gave it more than a 5. <br /> <br /> Where "Elephant" (which was released 3 years before this film) uses school shootings (or, to be exact, the Columbine shooting), since the focal point of his 2:37 script uses teen suicide and sees reviews that the shock value of that subject worked. It's the same slow story, lots of dramatic piano music, all leading to an ending that you know from the beginning. At least the characters seem to have struggled to be a bit different in that department. So you have an atypical gay who seems to be a stoner / skater, an adorable boy who can not deal with his gay side, brother and sister of a wealthy family who has his own problems and here comes the nose dip. <br /> <br /> You also get a spoiled bulimic girl and one of the most ridiculous characters of all time ... a guy with health problems who wet his pants because of "urethral syndrome 2" that actually never heard of the invention of diapers, but it irritates the pants in the classroom and then change into new clothes and does it every day! WOW, as much as this movie tries to be realistic, that's the most absurd thing I've ever heard. He is beaten in the bathroom and obviously ashamed of this, but does not wipe the blood from his nose when he goes through the entire school with wet pants and bleeding nose. This is the realism of the new era that leads directly to the "twist" and the final character that ends up being the victim of suicide ... After watching the "very realistic" life of adolescents (one day including incest-rape, adolescence, bulimia, parental pressure on notes and appearance and the gay subject mentioned earlier, kind of like your "very realistic" everyday soap ... trying to be) we watched a dying girl meet us once at the beginning of this movie and who does not is right, but that guy she had a fall left the room when she was talking to him (in a pensive piano sequence BTW, seen that somewhere before?). And it gets even better ... before cutting her wrist in a painful long scene of "Yes" and "No," she asks the 2 urethra-face if he is ok, constantly smiling and then she cuts her wrist with scissors on a school bathroom. <br /> <br /> Now you have a movie that is a total idiocy of Elephant, it fails with some really sloppy stories (the whole rape and incest thing was also unbelievable) and people call it shocker. <br /> <br /> What the hell is going on ?? Is it all it takes to bring a pseudo-dramatic song, a boring story and add a shock issue to the top and people think there's a big message here? I think the Elephant is already overrated, but this movie was the original, while here's an obvious glitch on many other levels. I've never seen a more brazen steal of a whole movie concept in my life ... and believe me I've watched a hundred horror movies, so I know how low you can go there. This is a total disappointment in all departments ... it is not realistic, it is stolen, it is very slow and by all means I wonder what is more useless ... another romantic suicide (many give this point to the movie that I makes them think they only watch Romeo + Juliet all day because there are dozens of movies that deal with the subject in a clear, non-romantic and MORE REALISTIC way) or this ridiculous montage ... Come on! I'm still trying to figure out whether the 2-urethra-face or suicide itself is more unrealistic and ridiculous.
