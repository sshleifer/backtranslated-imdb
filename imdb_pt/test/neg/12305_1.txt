Most movies can be watched easily, even though I do not particularly like the movie. I'm the kind of person who recognizes great movies even though I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand watching. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is fine (Myers is good as the cat, it's just that he's really annoying). The silly songs that the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even to the children in the audience. The plot continues, and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue. The witty remarks of the parents are disgusting, not funny (I remember a horrible comment about a garden hoe being compared to a kind of person that people call "ho"). Even if the film was really short, it seemed to last forever. Do not waste your time. I know little kids who hated this movie. If the kids can not stand it, I do not know how adults can. I'd like to talk more about this movie, but I do not even waste time writing this review about it. I HATED IT! So in summary, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching it! Watch a movie GOOD! <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars - the smallest criticism I've ever given to a movie.
