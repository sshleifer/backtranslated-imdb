I assumed that 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is a horror movie. Yes, it has a good point, but it's a replay of another movie. The acts are so terrible and the plot. <br /> <br /> The story goes from a legend about a scarecrow alive in the cornfield. When an initiation becomes a joke and causes the life of a boy in danger, the scarecrow comes to life and begins a murderous frenzy. Sounds familiar, right? It is derived from Scream, Friday the 13th, Jeepeer Creepers, Sons of Corn, his name! <br /> <br /> 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is such a below-average movie. Just have a scary time. Even the final scene is laughable! Unfortunately, we could still use this as our time killer. But I'd rather you watch the other thing. Unless you're a big fan of bad and flamboyant movies, of course. <br /> <br /> 4/10
