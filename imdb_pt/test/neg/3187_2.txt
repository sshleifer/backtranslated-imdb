I'm scared to have stayed just to watch the first hour of this movie because it really struck me as irrational rubbish and a waste of talent. Liv Tyler plays a sumptuous beauty, but her acting skills are not yet sufficiently developed to give a real kick to the role. As she slowly seduces a bartender into a life of crime, it's hard to feel any real concern about any of the characters. Even John Goodman presents his faintly comic lines with an absence of panache, as if the humorless humor should be recited slowly in case one loses the joke. The end is supposed to be good, but the initial and main course left me with no appetite to find out.
