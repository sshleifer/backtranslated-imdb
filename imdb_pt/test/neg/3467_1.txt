Many of the negative comments here focus on the historical accuracy of this film. OK, it had as much to do with the NFL as the average war movie has to do with a real war, or a western has to do with the real "old west." So, I think we should give them an artistic license. The problem here is that the director (Clooney) apparently thinks that making a crazy comedy means a) doing stupid things, b) mug for the camera, and c) taking stupid scenes from robberies and stretching them for a long time. Screwball comedies need a fast pace, not necessarily frantic, but moving fast at all times. Here, things drag and drag and drag. After watching this movie, you will notice how Mack Sennett was brilliant when he pioneered the genre with his Keystone Cops. After 90 years, you would have thought that principals would have studied the old masters and learned one or two things, maybe even improved things a bit. But no, it is as if someone had seen an automobile pioneer build a Duesenberg, and almost a century later, paid homage and "perfected" the concept by mounting a square-wheeled cart. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed several Clooney movies, I consider him a talented actor. But very few actors can drive with competence; Clint Eastwood remarkably took some time to get the hang of it. Clooney is clearly at the bottom of a very steep slope. The film becomes more watchable during the few times he is out of the frame, but when he is in the picture, he becomes the center of attention. In the fight scenes, his assault is so offensive that you would like someone to really beat you up. <br /> <br /> If you are making a crazy comedy and want some romance, you need to develop some chemistry between the man and the female leads. Clooney and Zellweger have all the chemistry of the pair of dumpsters in a parking lot. No spark, no wheezing, not even a post-mortem contraction. Zellweger, who also made great films, must have traded his botox injections for oak tannins, giving him an incredibly hard wood performance. She just might have ripped out the "tough act in a man's world" if only once, while trying to test the guys, she looked at the camera with a half smile and a twinkle in her eyes. But no, she kept her jockstrap tight until the end. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest sin here is that the movie just is not funny. Doing stupid things is not the same as clowning. Doing stupid things in a very inventive way, like the Stooges, or very athletically, like Buster Keaton, can be hilarious. But on the other hand it's boring and, well, stupid. I think I got a good laugh out of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid that one. I saw it for free on the cable, and still wanted my money back.
