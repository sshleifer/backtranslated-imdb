André Roussin was an expert on what the French call "Boulevard Theater": he touches the eternal triangle: lover man / woman / (man or woman). Many of his pieces gave Elvire Popesco some of his best parts on stage. ... and the great actress was the main reason to watch them, because Roussin is not Sacha Guitry, by far. The French public remembers "Au Theater Ce Soir". Still with me? Roussin's plays were not meant to be filmed. And this is mediocre material, even if the writers call Lewis Carroll to rescue them. I like Stewart Granger and David Niven, and Ava Gardner is a eye candy. , being rude, predictable - even the native's intervention (Ball-Ball) is ridiculous - a farce around Menage à Trois on a deserted island where Granger would be some kind of Robinson, Niven, his Friday and Gardner his girlfriend on Friday.
