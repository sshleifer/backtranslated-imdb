But not everything was bad in this movie. less understood right, as well as some of the more original methods of murder seen in a long time. There is even a story (middle) and it is about that. But for a film exploitation there is a surprising amount of We have 3 interracial babies - maybe. We have a psychotic Vietnamese prostitute - nice back, oral sex (okay it made me shudder) and some female version of Gene Simmons (I do not understand this part) We have an honest goodness Capone - the rates among the best actors in this movie - that is not a compliment And finally we have a government conspiracy thrown to - I do not know - try to connect the murder of revenge / random / theme by Jimmy boy to make the psychotic Vietnamese seem sens act ??????? If nothing else this movie proves that the Italians and Americans do not have a block in this type of film. Latinos can do crap, just like the rest of them. The compliment goes to anyone involved in this achievement that has surpassed and made a career for themselves.
