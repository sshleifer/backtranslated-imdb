What you might expect from any comedy produced by Adam Sandler, the Grandma's Boy is predictable and so stupid that it's disgusting. Allen Covert acts as Alex in the film, a 35-year-old potboy who works as a video game tester and had to live with his grandmother and his two roommates after losing his apartment. There are some usual twists: he has difficulty adapting to his new life situation, which in turn causes him to have problems at work, which is particularly bad because he is trying to preach one of the new office advisors . Play a weird boss, a star from an alien company, a really nerdy friend, some scenes in place of a big pot, a really big party scene and an original video game that Alex is trying to finish on his own mix of Grandma Boy in your totality. Allen Covert does a small advantage, Linda Cardellini is cute enough for her role as the office advisor Samantha, and some scenes can chuckle, but none of that does Grandma's boy is worth much of anyone's time. Most of the supposed funny "jokes" or whatever you want to call them are nothing but "humor" that would leave someone in National Lampoons ashamed to watch, Joel Moore is incredibly dull in his role as mentor to JP games. and the whole movie really succeeds in being annoying over not funny or substantial. Well, at least Grandma's Boy did something for someone: Adam Sandler was able to pay some salaries to his unemployed friends, David Spade, Kevin Nealon and Rob Schneider.
