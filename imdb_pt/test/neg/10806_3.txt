When the claim that a movie is famous is that the younger and lesser known brother of Martin Sheen does, you know it's not going to be really good. "Soultaker" is a silly, low-budget film about a group of 20-something young men being chased by an angel of death. It's a stupid movie, but it's a lot of fun, and even a little nice in its stupidity. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is very small, and is stretched as far as possible. Joe Estevez is not much of an actor, luckily, to the public, he has few lines and his role is mostly just about him walking. This movie really seems to be trying to be a horror / fantasy franchise considering it has the same layout as a slasher. 4 characters, each one dies one at a time ... will anyone live? Who really cares? Although it seems that I hated it, I did not. I just did not like it very much, but I was mostly interested, so I guess that counts for something. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 of ****. 90 min. PG-13 for language, violence and nudity.
