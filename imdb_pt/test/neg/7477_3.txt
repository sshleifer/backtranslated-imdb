Perhaps the best part of the show is the fact that it creeps right after Conan O'Brien and Late Night fans are suddenly watching the Carson show. Carson Daly can not hold a candle to Leno, Letterman, O'Brien or any late night talk show host, and Last Call seems to miss more than hitting this hit and miss genre. The only show rescuing the quality is that it is so short. But I would not call it shit. Carson Daly is sincere and does not hide the fact that his show is not great (that honesty is really useful here), while some of the Last Call sketches and material seem to be stolen, they still find the mark sometimes. In fact, some of Carson's plays were a lot of fun, and the sketches occasionally have their moments of decent comedy. As an interviewer, Carson is fine even with just one guest, not exactly late at night stuff, but still above the level reached by a high school AV team. However, he does not have the quick intelligence that makes Conan so hilarious. I do not like his musical guests, but that's more because I'm not a fan of this kind of music so I'm not holding it against him. <br /> <br /> In the house band. I do not know Joe Firstmans' band and I would not compare them to the CBS Orchestra, the Tonite Show Band with Kevin Eubanks or Max Weinberg 7. Even Cleeto and Cleetones are better. But, Firstman's bandmates still do the show in my opinion. Especially the Alto Sax player who sometimes shows up (he has long dark hair and sunglasses and is always playing on the top log), if I watch the show for him, I do. <br /> <br /> In short, this show is not worth a bag full of bits of kibble n 'bits. But it has an audience and appeals more to the younger "mtv generation." If you do not have cable TV and it is at 1h37, there is not much else to choose from and, surprise surprise, there is something worse in this period. So if you're expecting Poker After Dark, 30 minutes of Last Call will not kill you during the wait.
