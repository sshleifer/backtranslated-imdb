I was reading in a Stuff Magazine about some of the most bloody and bloody movies Asia had to offer and I immediately jumped on Netflix to quench my thirst. Boy, what a mistake I made. This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Firstly, no plot, what I hoped to be the plot (see: "Revenge") turned into a series of events going on in an effort to spend its $ 14.89 special effects budget and wasting studio time . They should have saved their money and not wasted their time nor yours. <br /> <br /> When a major turnaround occurs in history, Tetsuo II: Body Hammer gets a new identity and I did not buy it. A flashback is given that should answer our questions, but it seemed to me that I called Showtime at 3:47 am and crashed ACID. The film continues and gets out of control with extravagant graphics and special (Olympic) effects. <br /> <br /> Do I look bitter with this movie? Yes. Did I see the Iron Man? No. Was there a plot? No. Was it so symbolic that I did not understand? DO NOT. Was there a Body Hammer? Beat the hell out of me. So take my advice and stay away !!!!!! <br /> <br /> (I must admit I had so much fun writing this and laughing with myself about this movie that if you want to laugh, ASSIST!)
