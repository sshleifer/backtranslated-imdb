I would not deny that I really enjoyed watching any Japanese horror movie, but everyone should get pretty fed up with them after having seen the same thing over and over again. <br /> <br /> The film follows the story of the horror movie. Rancor. Audrey, as requested by her mother, will get her sister back. But when she arrives, something strange happens to her sister and then her sister is dead. She wants to find out the truth behind the curse and then a photographer (Eason) joins her. On the other hand, there is also something going on with a family and three girls, but they seem to realize it too late ... <br /> <br /> Actually, I can not see the points for the three international schoolgirls to appear in the movies as they are not (quite) related to the story. The reason the woman who holds the grudge keeps killing people is still not very clear (it seems to me that they are just saying the same things I saw in spite). And the sudden appearance of Audrey in front of the boy is undoubtedly strange, which, I suppose, is an attempt to relate the family history. The murder scenes are absolutely the mix of those in the Ring and Shibuya Kaidan. Acting would be another bad point. Like Hong Konger, I really would like to support Edison Chen's first effort in Hollywood, but as a movie lover, I really can not find any point to support the bad acting. Other actors like the father, although he appears in some scenes, also should have done better. What's kept good is the atmosphere of the movie, especially when I watched in the middle of the night alone. <br /> <br /> If you have time, really enjoy all the horror movies and have seen all the horror movies possible except that, like me, you can go to kill some time. But if you really like Japanese horror movies of this type, you should spend some time observing the Japanese version of the Ring.
