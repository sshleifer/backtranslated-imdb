After watching the first movie of BCI's new Aztec Mummy Collection, it's hard to believe how excited I was about the set and how upset I was when the release date was postponed. I watched a lot of Mexican horror in the last few months. Some great ?? The curse of the woman who cries. Some fun despite obvious flaws ?? Night of the Bloody Apes. And some cheese? Pick any movie from the Saint. One thing all these movies have in common is that none of them can be called "boring." Well, that's not the case with the Aztec Mummy. It's been some time since I last watched something so sleep-inducing. I was not expecting or expecting a great movie, but at least have fun! The Aztec mummy takes every situation that could be interesting and sucks the life through repeated scenes of people who do nothing and then extend these scenes for what seems an eternity. I think that's what happens when you make an 80 minute movie with only 30 minutes of footage. Extra padding! For example, for anyone who has seen the movie, what purpose does The Bat have in addition to bringing a masked type of fighter to the screen and extending the execution time by 15 or more nonsense minutes? <br /> <br /> I just hope the other two The Collection films are more fun than this.
