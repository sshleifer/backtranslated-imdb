When something can be anything you want it to be or mean, you are bound to register with someone as being quite special. But just as the shape of a cloud in the sky may appear to one of us or remind us of a battleship and another aunt's butt, and still another absolutely nothing but a cloud, it does not make this cloud significant except by interpretation of the spectators. Anyone who thinks he throws a plush giraffe through a bright window, or is worth it, without relating it in some context, is just trying to impress us with his intellectuality. <br /> <br /> This movie, like the dreams of a madman, does very well, especially since there is no standard or expectation for what dreams would be, and even if we were crazy, that would hardly give us sound reference points To compare. A love affair with this movie carries the same risk of seriously interpreting Nostradamus. Any real meaning that was being conveyed at the time could be buried in the private jokes, provincial reflections or minutiae of his day, and some selected radical intellectuals! I found a bit of an agenda, even with my limited ability though. <br /> <br /> The film is definitely anti-fascist and to some extent anti-Italian. I observed that although the years 1929-1930 were years of great public works and urban renewal in Italy, any indication of this seemed to be avoided. In addition, (avant-guard academy spinners take note of this for their next class) the short and short-haired man with the mustache in the party segment near the end is a caricature of Victor Emmanuel III and his tall female companion no less than the Queen Helen, formerly Princess of Montenegro. Without an understanding of potential historical relevance, even the apparent irrelevance is beyond the competence of academics or other intellectuals who would have an irrelevance to impress us. <br /> <br /> I pleasantly add my own buckets of paint to the disfigurement of this cinematic joke. But in an adaptation of the famous mot by the boy; The film does not really have a face (disfigure). Paint would help to burn though.
