All right, let's split it up. Why is this one of the worst movies of all time? Because there are so many answers to this question that I'm having a headache. Come on ... Cracker World? Mr. Honkee? The part with the Arabian face? It's just awful, I do not really care about all the crap of white racism, but when they did that with the Arabian guy, I wanted the names of all the writers. It really is not worth watching 3 seconds of this movie. It's not even funny-bad that was my first interpretation. I hope the person who directed this movie does not commit suicide, but it seems likely, I do not see any other option. Never watch this movie again if you watch, you can not say that you died without regrets.
