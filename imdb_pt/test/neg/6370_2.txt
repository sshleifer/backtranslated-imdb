I was in 6th grade and this movie aired on PBS during a series called 'Wonderworks'. I clearly remember sitting on a couch watching the movie with tears streaming down my face at the end. In the film, Jesse, the main character, forms an unusual friendship with a girl named Leslie. Due to a very simple but careless mistake, one of the couple dies. At the time, I found the story very powerful because fatal error is exactly the kind of mistake a child would make and so any child watching the movie would find it easy to identify it and feel the emotional weight of the ensuing tragedy. . <br /> <br /> Last year I finally found a VHS copy of the program. I probably should have stayed with my memories. Watching the show as an adult, I was absolutely shocked at the horribly made movie. My girlfriend also had a memory similar to the movie, and she was also very sad about how bad the movie was compared to her memories. <br /> <br /> Many adults probably have a good memory of watching this movie when they were kids. I strongly recommend that these people leave their memories intact and avoid seeing this movie as an adult.
