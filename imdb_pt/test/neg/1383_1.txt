The slogan of this program is, "He's talking his mind. We're hiring extra lawyers." If you look back in time, any classic comedian has never prided himself on being polemical. Richard Pryor's slogan was not "I'm raw, racist and daring." It's basically how Comedy Central is releasing this show - in your face, it's not a PC and "honest" - but how can a television boast of being that way? Where is humility and humility? And what suddenly made Carlos Mencia that huge figure for Comedy Central? Let's start at the beginning - Dave Chappelle cancels his show (which has become UNFORGETTABLE and controversial) and Comedy Central is looking for someone new to push. They hire this guy named Ned, who claims to be Mexican, even if he's not. They spread their faces in a few TV commercials and make it appear they are being "daring" by releasing it on the public. <br /> <br /> I've seen many hateful topics in the forums for this. show, and I do not agree with the detractors of "Mencia." This is not a horrible show. It made me weep with laughter sometimes. When it's funny, it's very funny. Yes, it's juvenile - but so has Chappelle. <br /> <br /> The problem with Carlos is that he uses a lot of the same stuff over and over again. And it is very obvious. Open marketing left out, "Carlos" has now said beaner so many times that I lost count. He's trying to make the next line famous (like "I'm Rick James, b ****!"), But it's too obvious. <br /> <br /> In terms of repeating himself, Carlos uses many of the same jokes repeatedly. For example, in one episode he said he would love it if all Mexicans disappeared from America overnight. He would wake up and an American guy would be saying, "Room ser'vuce!" with a southern accent. <br /> <br /> He used that same joke - literally - when he appeared as a guest on Adam Carolla's talk show. It was a lot less funny the second time because he seemed more desperate. <br /> <br /> Is "Carlos" funny? I think so. There are some scandalous moments in your show. But he focuses a lot on trying to be controversial rather than just following the flow and letting his comedy progress naturally. Repeating silly nonsense over and over again, along with silly faces and loud vocal cries, actually ages rather quickly ... I just hope that Carlos - or his writers - can give a new edge to this program because now he's starting to subside in hell of repetition.
