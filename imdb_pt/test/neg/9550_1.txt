SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> A clich√©-riddled movie that somehow makes an anti-death statement with dignity, though it tries to do the opposite. Washington is a paralyzed forensic agent who has been suffering and wanting to die for the last four years (apparently he wrote his huge sales book only a year ago, so not everything is despair). He organizes an assisted suicide with his doctor, who will return in a week. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, it helps in a serial killer case. He recruits the brave, I do not want to do that, but I'm so good at it, cop Jolie, and they track impossible clues to highly improbable conclusions in a matter of moments. Hey, that old bolt means the killer has the millionaire's wife in a steam tunnel near the old Woolworth building. Shyeah, right. It's laughable. However, he is not smart enough to find out that the doctor who will help him is the killer. <br /> <br /> When he arrives in Washington to kill him (ahead of schedule), he changes his mind and strives incredibly. for his life. Cut to the obligatory bad guy about to shoot the good guy scene when BANG the gun goes off --- but the bad guy did not fire! Not the woman comes out of the corner, she has just shot his back.
