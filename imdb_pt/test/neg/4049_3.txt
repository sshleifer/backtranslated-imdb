Despite his ambitious ambitions, Zurlini's film must be seen as a failure. It's one thing to create a world that draws the viewer to feel the boredom and anguish experienced by the protagonist (which I think is what Zurlini was trying to do). Another totally different thing is to make a movie that is tedious and meaningless, episodic. Despite the beautiful cinematography in an astonishing location - and a wonderful soundtrack - the film never attracts audiences. Much is involuntarily funny (the fake sound of water dripping into Drago's quarters, for example, or the silent movie robbery of some of the actors) or simply confused (Why exactly does Drago want to leave the fort for the first time?) So that the film to succeed as a coherent work.
