After the wit and vivacity of Highway 61 and Roadkill, I had hoped that this movie would shine, but it was as swollen and self-deceived as the hard-rock stars he parodyed. The rhythm dragged on, not helped by an excessively long sequence of hallucinations, the characters were flat and memorable, and Art Bergmann is not a Jello Biafra. I had to prick myself to stay awake.
