I can not believe the high notes that people gave to this movie on this site. The writing is incredibly bad with people arriving on time and revealing exactly what the heroine is doing to try to escape. (Do not you hate it when that happens?) And the acting is so, very bad that you can have a splinter in the eye of the whole scene being chewed. <br /> <br /> A sow is holding her hostage, the kids are off the open screen, so she whimpers. To help, instead of screaming when, just a moment ago, she was brave enough to break windows to scream at those same kids. <br /> <br /> She's finally free and alone at home. Your chance to ask for help, so what does she do? Wander the house and lie down. She's in the basement, locked. So, what does she do? Take a nap Come on! Most of the film is the sow moving away and find her sitting dozing off when he wakes her up. Four times! What? If the writer is too bored to actually write a real plot, why should we be paying attention? I think the key here is that it was originally a piece for the radio, so they filled with the heroine just sitting instead of pretending to be screen writers and actually writing any action. <br /> <br /> And the end is horrible. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is completely implausible, terribly written and almost comically represented. Watch out for this movie at all costs!
