I have been a Shakespearean lover since childhood. I'm Jewish, too. Merchant of Venice is anti-Semitic no matter how much scholars and lovers of literature try to reinterpret it. <br /> <br /> In the play, Shylock is portrayed as demonic and cold-hearted and has no forgiveness. , without heat, without love, except for money and cruel vengeance, while Christians are gentle and moralistic people. His motives in the play revolve around money (he plans to avenge himself from the outset based on the damage done to his business as well as on racial hatred blind), no noble ideals or hurt racial pride as this movie wants you believe. And this characterization is given to him by Shakespeare himself, not by the other characters. As a final test, the happy ending is where the Jew loses his money and is forced to convert to Christianity. <br /> <br /> I recognize this and move on. It's part of the story and I like Shakepeare despite this fact. So I hope a movie based on this game is straightforward. I would rather see work tailored to your rich language and tell stories without any bleaching. <br /> <br /> But many of the subtleties and playful characters of the bard are lost in this film. For example, in the last scene in which men discover Portia's secret work as a man who also took out her rings, instead of the playful play of words and misunderstandings as the truth unfolds, it becomes a petty game where two malicious women play cruelly with their future husbands. <br /> <br /> So instead, we get beautiful detailed sets, rich language fragments with little reinterpretation, casting, an intense court scene, and a The truth is that I think it would be much more easy to identify anti-Semitism in history and move on if left as it is. Despite all the laundering that the producers of this film have taken from their hats, there is still a lot of hatred, except that now people can make excuses and pretend that the portrayal of the Jews is not so bad anymore. <br /> <br /> And finally, another problem is with most of the actors being miscast. Pacino is out of his reach and very uncomfortable with the language, not to mention the horribly false accent. Fiennes as Bassanio is dull and awkward with language. Irons is reliable as always, but does not do much with his role. Portia is a bit OK, but it's nasty, and covered in bad makeup, just like the movie.
