This horrible effort is only to show what happens when you not only use computers to generate effects, but also allow you to plan the plot and write the script. Someone somewhere has obviously come up with new software that asks a few questions and then produces four hours of loosely connected cliches, awful dialogues, and a collection of characters that you just wish everyone drowned in the first five minutes. Tom Courtney took the prize for the worst performance. To say that it was made of wood would be an insult to the trees. It is difficult to criticize Robert Carlyle in almost everything he does, but the odds were against him even in this, especially because he was for some unexplained reason required to adopt a British London accent. <br /> <br /> A complete wash.
