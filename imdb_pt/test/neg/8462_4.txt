this movie is not so good ... but it's good when you just want to laugh, because it's very ridiculous :) there are many mistakes in it and it's cheesy. I got this movie for Christmas 5 years ago, but for some reason I never gave it. I think I like it for a rainy day, although I only watch it as once a year. This is a 90s movie, so it's very funny to see how everyone dresses and acts. this movie is good for someone young ... despite thinking about it, I did not like it very much when I was 12, but this is just my personal opinion. the film was really predictable. I wish it had some weird extra twists, but I think it was trying to be an appropriate movie for everyone to enjoy. I think it was appropriate for the whole family, but Hallie's dress was a bit indecent, but certainly appropriate enough for the family stuff.
