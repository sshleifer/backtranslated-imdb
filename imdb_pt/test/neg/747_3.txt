The BBC and the Arts & Entertainment Network should be ashamed to foist this unfortunate production on the world. The acting is, with the exception of Robert Hardy as General Tilney, amateur at best and painfully painful at worst. The costumes are exaggerated and have some really macabre excesses - was the costume designer obsessed with feathers for women's hats? Certainly EVERY woman in Bath had no feathers on her helmet in the early nineteenth century. The production values ​​are bad and the rhythm of the film makes you feel quickly edited at the last minute. All in all, an agonizing movie that I had to force myself to watch until the end. It's a pity, since the producers obviously spent a lot of money on costumes and locations. Compared to Emma Thompson's sublime "Sensation and Sensitivity", or the extraordinary production of "Pride and Prejudice" of 1995, or the subtle intensity of "Persuasion" of 1995, this production of "Northanger Abbey" certainly left Jane Austen rolling his grave.
