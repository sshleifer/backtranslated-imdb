It hurt to watch this movie, really ... I wanted to like it, even enter. He obviously threw for very little money, I looked the other way and told myself to enjoy the inspiration. Unfortunately, although I appreciated the film at that level, the acting and editing were terrible, and the last 25-30 minutes was a very complicated territory. A 95-minute movie should not be dragged. Ratings for this one are good so far, but I'm afraid friends and family might have an opinion on this. What happened to these transitions? Dear Mr. Editor, did you just get your first copy of Adobe Premiere and made it your main goal to use all the goofy transitions that come with this silly program? Anyway ... some better actors, a little more passion and a more attractive edition and this makes a decent movie.
