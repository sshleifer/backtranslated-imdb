I'm so disappointed with this movie that I can not express it. I was so excited when I started watching this movie to see the all-leather Mickey Rourke and that Third Rock From The Sun kid acting like I was a psychopath. I thought, wow, this is going to be a winner, Natural Born Killers style. And it got better. The production value was great, the direction was great, the acting was great, the cinematography was great, and the plot was, well, the plot, well, what? About half way through this movie I was pulling my hair screaming "What the hell is going on?" and I mean this literally? Nothing makes any sense. Anything. Anything. Anything. Aaaaaaahhhhhhggg !!!!
