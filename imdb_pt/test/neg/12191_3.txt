ATTENTION: I would advise anyone who has not yet seen the movie not to read this review. <br /> <br /> When I first started watching this movie, my expectations were that it was a vampire movie, which would be awesome, considering how Rodriguez and Tarantino helped make the movie. I started about 15 minutes and already my hopes for this movie were down the drain, which shocked me. First, the story with which I was going was not at all attractive in any way possible, and just boring and boring to the point where I just wanted to turn it off. I was getting more frustrated with this movie as it crawled, but I guess I expected it to get better ... so when it finally showed vampires, BLEW MY MIND, in a very bad way. I thought, "Okay, this movie started with a horrible story about these two criminals, so MUCH slowly turned into some vampire movie that I thought would be the beginning, the last 30 minutes?" To add to this, they try to make the main characters all cool and awesome and mean around the end when they simply are not; A rabbit would have been more intimidating than these characters! This movie is a horrible piece of crap !!! From dawn till dawn I disgraced myself and leave a terrible taste in my mouth, discouraging thoughts in my head, and I let my body unable to get out of the horrible shock I just wasted 108 minutes of my life away in a horrendous movie. I do not understand how George Clooney, Quentin Tarintino, Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo, being all the good and honored actors that they are, could partake of that useless dirt. In my opinion, From Dusk Till Dawn is one of the worst movies of all time that I have suffered my eyes. Do not see, you will be doing yourself a great favor ...
