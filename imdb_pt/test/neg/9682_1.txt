This version of "Noah's Ark" established Hallmark's (and Turner's) reputation about 100 years ago. However, production has its positive side ... a learning experience for entrepreneurs of neophyte films in "how not to make a movie" <br /> <br /> Where in the annals of biblical literature and common sense it is possible to find these quotes and situations: <br /> <br /> "Okay, boys, let's seal." "It's a shame God created the sun to shine only during the day when we really needed it at night." "We're not kissing ... we're just whispering in each other's mouths." <br /> <br /> Wood to build the Ark with "Georgia Pacific" stamped on it. Metal nails. Kids flying kites. A peddler (how can James Coburn sleep thereafter) selling Chinese hats. Pirates attacking a wooden Ark, which they wanted to capture, with burning fireballs thrown from catapults. Glass bottles of wine (Noah was in a continual state of inhibition. It was a miracle that he could see the Ark, much less build it.) Lady Godiva (Mary Steenberg in a blonde wig walking by the ark on a white horse .. still rated G) Protecting biblical pirates with an iron skillet (teflon-lined?). Disembark at Mount Ararat after passing through the Straits of Hercules. <br /> <br /> etc., etc., etc. <br /> <br /> Special effects ... you have to see them in to not believe them. <br /> <br /> The list goes on. This movie should not be missed; but if you want the full version of the TV, you should call NBC for the screen version ... but only if you agree to acquit NBC of all responsibility for having displayed the thing in the first place. Only the expurgated version exists in the rental companies (without pirates, etc) ... that is, those rental companies that dare to store them. <br /> <br /> Marvin Cohn <br /> <br />
