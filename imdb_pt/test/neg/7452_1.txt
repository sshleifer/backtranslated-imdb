I've seen this movie several times, it sure is one of the cheapest action movies of the eighties. So I think a lot of viewers would definitely change the channel when they came across this one. But, if you're in a big junk, "Dragon Hunt" is made for you. The main characters (the McNamara twins) sport big mustaches and look so ridiculous in their camouflage dresses. One of the best scenes is when one of them is shot in the leg and is still kicking his enemies into nirvana. This movie is really awful but, again, it's a great party tape!
