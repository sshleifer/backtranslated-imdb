I can not believe the positive reaction to this movie. I had high expectations for this and was disappointed. First of all, they used all the clich√©s of racism in the book. It was so predictable. For example, since the second the young latino appeared, you knew he would be a really cool guy because he looked like a gangbanger. The character of Matt Dillon has been touched a million times, a police officer who has been hardened over the years and who would see the light to some extent at the end of the film. Predictability hardly ended with these characters. A phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script. The moral of the story was PC to the max. There were some clever twists, but not enough. The dialouge was embarrassing at times. It was not all bad. I just can not believe this movie scores high so far. It was a little fun, just a bit insulting to intelligence. I admire what this movie was trying to achieve, but it was very short.
