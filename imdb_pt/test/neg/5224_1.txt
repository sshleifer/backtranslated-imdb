This is quite possible the worst movie ever made. I know people talk about how Ed Wood's films were horrible (Plan 9), but this movie makes Plan 9 look awesome. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris makes a point, so I have no idea. Maybe ruin your film career. In addition to Chuck Norris, the cast of the film consists of extras in daytime soap operas and Mike Norris ... that's right, Chuck's son. <br /> <br /> This director does not even have a resume and I have no idea where the plot or script originated. This must have been illuminated by a horrible southern Baptist minister who somehow had a third-degree cousin who owned a studio (which I'm sure was already closed). <br /> <br /> I really do not know what else to say about this movie. I'd like to give you a summary of the plot, but I'm lost. There is something about Jesus and Satan ... some eternal battle. In addition, there are Indians. And a bunch of weird kids who do not know how to act ... they're just awkward and should not be on camera. I do not know what was going on most of the time, but I know the movie was a great laugh. Mike Norris pushes his daughter (by bicycle) into the street somehow ... but in the shot he's in the middle of the park. So somehow she learns to ride her bike at a speed equivalent to The Flash and gets hit by a car or a bus ... I do not know. But she's dead. This is really the funniest scene in the movie. I know it sounds sick, but when you see Mike raise his hands in victory and then hold his head and scream in terror ... you will understand. Does not show the daughter getting hit or anything ... you just have to assume she was run over by some vehicle. But the film is not clear. So maybe it was not related and she died of cancer. Anyway ... after that, the movie gets really confusing and I have no idea what really happens. I'm a Christian and I have no idea why this movie was made. I do not see any value to this movie in a religious or non-religious sector. This is probably the first thing they show students in the film production of 101 ... this is what you do not want to do. <br /> <br /> Just watch ... you'll hate him and me for suggesting that you see.
