"The new hope of Romanian cinema" ... if this is the new hope, then I really would not want to see the savior hero of such a prolific cinema (Romanian cinema, of course). Now seriously, where should I start? 1. The shit scenario: you're kidding me, this is not even believable not to mention that it is high grade of stupidity 2. the direction: what direction? This movie should have had psychological strain, at least that, since they decided to make it seem as ordinary as possible. Oky, I admit, Radu Muntean is not Polanski, Hitchcock, Fincher or Lynch (the list could continue), but at least the least effort would have been appreciated. 3. The language: Oky, I do not understand why (almost) all Romanian directors believe that if you make the film as miserable and obscene as possible then you have art. I do not care about explicit language or poor image quality, as long as the end result is worth it. In this case, this does not happen. There is nothing to comment on, since everything this movie means has already been said a thousand times, the characters are too little portrayed to become memorable, the "shocking events" that occur are also poorly illustrated and become unimportant . This film is based only on self-induced emotions, on the "we should" hype. Someone was found murdered, so "WE NEED" to be sad, frightened or panicked, someone went through this and that, then "WE MUST" feel in a certain way. This is silly. Because a movie is a fiction, nothing is real here. So the only real emotions are the ones you discover when you wander to the bottom of the world (the movie is). <br /> <br /> * / * * * * *
