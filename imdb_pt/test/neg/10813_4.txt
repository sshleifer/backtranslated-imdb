I totally agree. This is "Pitch Black underground" and a storyline well spent. The best scenes I thought of were the divers exploring the caves, passing through impossible underground passages, some of them hitting the heart. The scenery was great. If they had dispensed with the toothless CGI badboys "aliens," the movie would have been much better. All they would have to do is never show monsters, but have everyone else in mind, and follow Jack's descent into madness, and this may have been a hitchcock-style thriller, maybe a prize material. The acting is not bad. But these rubber sticks only reduce the standard fare.
