An example of all the worst gay stereotypes of all the movies. <br /> <br /> And Charles, why do you speak in that pseudo British / loud-strange accent, and insists that the boy speak that way too? Has anyone else noticed that all the music on the soundtrack is exactly the same? You should stick with the good old Hollywood camp you're so good at! Die Mommy Die II, the Sequel !! I do not see the value of spending time and money on such a project; there are so many stories of REAL gay young people to be told and we should be seeing those, not this crap. It's a waste of time. Embarrassing example of gay cinema.
