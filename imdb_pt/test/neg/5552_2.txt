I love camp movies, believe me and the usual Gordon Lewis technicolorian gore does not bother me at all, but this is just one of your dumbest movies, even more so than BLOOD FEAST, I'm not joking. THE GORE GORE GIRLS is about a crazy person who kills a lot goes (re) - goes (re) girls from a nightclub. A detective and a reporter try to discover the great secret. Maybe the performances here are a bit better than the normal H.G Lewis movies, but that's not saying much. The camera work is even terrible. <br /> <br /> But at least it's kind of watchable with the go girls ... and you're going to spend a lot of time with that, and the killings are just plain crazy absurd: a girl is killed with a hammer wood banging on her ass (!) and will not let me talk about what she does with her nipples. You'll laugh like somebody else with this. But the best of all this mess is a scene I only love about camping: the go-go girl before being attacked by many feminists dancing in a very American way. Although it is important to note that this was one of the first films that received an X rating because of its violence. <br /> <br /> ONLY if you want to laugh and have a good time (But only with a lot, A LOT of beers).
