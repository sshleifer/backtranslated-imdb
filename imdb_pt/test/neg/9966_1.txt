I heard legends about this "movie" (quotes used not to insult movies) for a while, so when I finally got the DVD, I began to watch it impatiently. In the end, I * had * to move quickly through only some of the most stupid, inadequately and senseless scenes of this senseless childish mess so that it would end faster. <br /> <br /> This may be the worst movie I even "played" - and I used to be associated with Troma for a while. "Manson Family" makes the bottom of Troma's entrances look like an art-work, bold and innovative. I could go on and talk about the syphilitic skeleton of a "plot" he has, the revoltingly bad "actor", the painful, inept "targeting" scenarios and props with his "ninety-nine dollar" look (I particularly " I loved the plastic toy guns used in the murder scene of Tate!) or the nauseating look of all this garbage bag (I think it should be a drug-induced hallucination; I have absolutely no idea how a hallucination induced by drugs look or feel, do not want to find out - but I think drug addicts with burned "brains" will love this "movie" (they seem to be the only ones who have succeeded) I have seen many films from several "Worst" 50 lists, traditionally opened by Eddie Wood - and Eddie Wood would be shocked by van Webber's absolute and untalented ineptitude (or whatever his name is, I certainly do not want to remember that) I've never seen "Superbabies" or their sequel but I wish "Manson" joined them in the IMDb rating. Fortunately, this obscure junk can not be seen by enough viewers to ensure enough of many "1" votes - and so much the better!
