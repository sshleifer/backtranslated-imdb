I did not care much about it, it seemed too artificial for a documentary. In addition, the filmmakers seemed to guide me toward certain characters, and yet I was completely unfriendly to the protagonist because of what they chose to show me of him. <br /> <br /> This movie disappointed me because the story and the people were interesting but the film was embarrassing because of the moody editing that did not allow the viewer enough time to understand each scene. Developments in the story were shrouded instead of showing men in boxers or other things that were incidental to the tale they were counting on. <br /> <br /> I recommend you skip this and just read this story.
