One of the worst movies I've seen this year. Everything about the movie screams "AMATEUR". For a movie set in the 1800s, everyone talks like the 1990s. The acting, particularly the people who play the masters of white slaves, is horrible. After about an hour for this movie, I left. What a waste of time and effort. For a much better film on this subject, see Steven Spielberg's "Friendship".
