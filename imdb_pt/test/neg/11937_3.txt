I had high hopes for this movie when I saw the ad and decided to watch it on TV without interruptions by commercial breaks. I liked Lee Van Cleef in many movies, but I'm afraid that having the other characters calling him Chris repeatedly does not make him a reasonable facsimile of Yul Brenner's Chris. <br /> <br /> I found this movie to be a complete disappointment - the soundtrack of the song tried to convey the magnificence portrayed in the original, but also failed to bring the film up to the original standard. The rich textures of the characters in the original were absent from the film. I think if you did not see the original, fine. Lots of cliches and little depth to the characters. He missed the humanity, the compassion, and the three-dimensional characters of the original.
