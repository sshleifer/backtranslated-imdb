It's a male bargain. I saw this on Sci-Fi a while back, and the idea sounded interesting. It could have been a good movie, and the storyline itself does not look like a male attack, but certain specific references to men are really annoying. I can still watch the movie again because at least he tries to redeem himself by insinuating that maybe the women in the movie are not really as violent as they say but it still does not make up for the really tiring male. -Bashing I mean, I can understand a bit, it's part of the movie plot, but come on, it gets really tiring after a while. Not only that, but presuming that most women in the world would accept to become homosexual so easily and that the few remaining heterosexuals would be a minority to the point of "getting into the closet." It is simply unbelievable. There are many women out there with cultural or religious restrictions who refuse to do so, it's totally implausible. I mean, I know your science fiction, and I love science fiction, but the best science fiction has at least one suggestion to be possible, and that's very implausible. The phrase "Truth is stranger than fiction" arose because fiction must at least seem plausible to be welcomed, but the truth is not always. This movie is not it. Other than that, the film has some good acting and the final moral of the story, that something like what happened was wrong, bail out a little, but not enough.
