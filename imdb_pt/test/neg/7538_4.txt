After seeing PURELY BELTER, I visited this site to review it, but not just to check the curriculum of screenwriter and director Mark Herman. As soon as his name appeared on the opening credits I knew that I had seen his name somewhere and after checking, I discovered that he wrote and directed the film version of LITTLE VOICE as one of the most underrated British films of the 1990s. /> <br /> PURELY BELTER is a totally different kettle of fish. It's a stereotypical view of Geordie's life and very bland. Everyone is a wife beater, a single mother, a shop steward, a drunkard, or an addict. Since many scenes are set in a school, the physical education teacher is a sadistic bully and is the closest the film comes to reality. Oh, and everyone is very grumpy, which adds to the nasty unpleasant atmosphere <br /> <br /> I did not really like PURELY BELTER as I watched and now that I know who Mark Herman is, I like it even less . With LITTLE VOICE Herman proved that you can make an entertaining uplifting comedy with souls from the north, but I had to ask where your unquestioned talent was in this movie?
