The film begins with a 30-minute explanation about the war, the human cyborgs, battles, story and then turns two actors into a gravel pit. They run around this gravel / desert area for about an hour shooting at each other. That's it. Should have cost about Â£ 10.00 to do, with the change. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Marks in ten: Acting -9 Sets 1 Dresses -9 Direction -50 Production 1 Untitled Untitled 4 <br /> <br /> I think improving this movie would be: Miss the comment. (Let the observer decide what's going on). Remove some of the horrible CGI. Add some techno songs to it. They can only rescue you .......
