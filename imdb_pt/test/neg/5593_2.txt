Why was this movie made? What were the creators of this thought?!?! The first 8MM movie, at least, had a plot that made sense and was potentially interesting. The first film was about the film industry of snuff. This sequel is about ... wait ... the porn industry !! Yes, as if the snuff film industry, an industry in which people are supposedly killed in entertainment films, were on the same level as the adult film industry, an industry in which people film other people involved in sexual acts and unstimulated situations. for eroticism. Only the idea should warn you how badly conceived the idea of ​​this movie is. It is not helped by the lack of plot, character, acting, direction, script, logic, theme or even sound design. This is an incredibly annoying movie that never caught my eye. Literally nothing works. Why a suspense movie about the pornographic industry involving murder and betrayals anyway? I do not have much interest in adult movies, but I've certainly watched them before. Why would anyone make a movie about his ills and what would they do in a sequel to a movie about snuff movies? I do not even know if there is an industry involved in the production of snuff films, but I hope not. The idea of ​​a snuff film alone is awful and only really sick and bad people would be a part of it. I do not think the adult movie industry revolves around murder and torture. I'm sure a lot of people make pornographic films for good intentions, rather than hurting and killing people. It is never good to hurt another human being. The adult movie industry is not about hurting people. It's about creating movies that are, for me, a distraction and a waste of time. What is this movie trying to say? Does not work
