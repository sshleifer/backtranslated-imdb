I've seen some bad action movies in my day, but this one is just awful. I feel it is a waste of time to even write this, but I will summarize. Why is this movie such a shit? Here are 10 reasons: 1. Very politely driven and cut. 2. Bad bad performance of the entire cast. 3. Silly dialogues and many clich√©s. 4. Many holes, many scenes do not add up. 5. Shoot badly (and many problems of continuity). 6. Ridiculously bad performance by the lead actress. 7. Unreliable (and not very good) action scenes. 8. Even for a Snipes movie, it shows a great lack of acting materials. 9. Outrageous accents (of the whole cast). 10. Last but not least - many implausible facts, such as a football tournament in the US, the CIA needing to do background checks to get new information about its employees, a mattress that is explosion-proof and so on. In essence - it's a waste of time, not funny, not fun, not even a joke - DON "T WATCH IT !!! Seriously, just do not.
