I had just read the book and was really looking forward to seeing this TV adaptation that was broadcast on the Hallmark Channel on Monday night (05/30/05). The key to the whole book was the man-of-steel-stolen Manifesto, but I watched for an hour (3 1/2) and saw the man with the steel teeth, but I never saw him steal a Manifesto. I've seen someone steal some viruses, but what does this have to do with the book? It's a shame because this film had great production values ​​and a good cast, but it's not the idea of ​​turning a book into a movie (TV or movie) to make people who read the book be part of the public. They only held me for an hour. I thought the book's premise was great and what they did, but they dismissed the whole premise. This book had a big McGuffin (to paraphrase Hitchcock), but they ignored it. And he said in the titles that Forsyth was involved in the production. They certainly should have paid him a lot of money.
