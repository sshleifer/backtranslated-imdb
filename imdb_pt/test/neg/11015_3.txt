Humor is a very individual thing and the audience at The Wog Boy seemed to enjoy it more than I did. I found it an anachronistic case, most representative of the old racial humor of Australian cinema of the 60s and 70s. The boy meets the storyline of girl never takes off because of a lack of chemistry between Lucy Bell and Nick Giannopoulos while I found laughter on the floor. If you want to spend your money on this, wait until you are in the video.
