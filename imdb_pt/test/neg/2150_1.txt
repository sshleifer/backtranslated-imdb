This has to be the worst case of excessive acting since the age of silence. Not just one or two actors, but pretty much the entire cast. Lee Majors and Bo Svenson were fine, but the rest of them looked like the first time they performed. <br /> <br /> So the budget was not tremendous. Many of the costumes and costumes were believable, but there were many things that jumped the viewer to let us know that they could not check or pick up all the accessories to match the period. <br /> <br /> I can not think of an aspect of the movie that I liked or did not shake my head at. Your time will be better spent burning lint collected from your belly button.
