I do not understand the exaggerated good critics of this film, except that a lot of people in Venezuela are understandably very lively, based on the fact that Venezuelan cinema is actually a little late in relation to what other countries are in the region. <br /> <br /> The first film of all is very repetitive, many scenes are almost identical to each of the two main roles, so you have the impression that it is a filling of time. A time fill is also a good point, as this movie is definitely too long with 105 minutes, you will start getting tired after a while and watch on the clock. <br /> <br /> All the actors are very bad, except for the Venezuelan Edgar Ramirez, who brings a bit of clowning and plays the Venezuelan recruit Pedro. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is not a representative film about the people of the region (Caribbean zone), tends to ridicule them.
