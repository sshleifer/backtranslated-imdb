Saw this DVD used cheaply, and got it for a chuckle. I recently also found "The Octagon" on DVD and bought the one to remember, having seen in the theater as a preteen, and loving it back then. The problem now in "rolling back" to these American karate movies is that since then I have seen so many action films from Hong Kong and Thailand where the fight scenes are long, fast and jaw-dropping. I'm thinking particularly of such fights as Jackie and Benny "The Jet" at the end of "Dragons Forever", or in Tony Jaa's circular fight of "The Protector". Hollywood kung-fu offerings simply are not "filmed properly," and even make someone with certified skill, like Chuck, seem odd at times. And what's worse than a slow-motion fight? So you know it looked bad at normal speed, so they slowed down to that effect. This really highlights just how ridiculous an opponent looks and expects to just be kicked in the chest. <br /> <br /> Poor Chuck, he just has no intensity in this movie, nor does he project any just threat. Compare this to your ex-co-star Bruce Lee, who had charm and attitude to burn. When Bruce faced some adversary, you could almost see the air around him crackling with what was about to happen. In "Breaker, Breaker," Chuck seemed to accidentally kick people in with total indifference. When the judge arrives to see him in jail, and sentence him to death, Chuck is looking with a sad look, and I thought "OK ... he is doing this third eye focus thing and will grab the judge by the throat and get out of it, "but he does nothing but look with a doe-eyed look. Terrible. And while the DVD cover gives you hope, listing a runtime of 1 hour and 5 minutes, actually is 1 hour and 25 minutes, so there's another 20 minutes watching the pain. <br /> <br /> For a great fight action, go watch Jackie Chan in the first "Police Story" .... the fight in the mall at the end is pure gold ......
