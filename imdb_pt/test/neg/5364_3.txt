I'm a fan of the paranormal and I love Ghost Hunters, so when this show was released, I decided to give it a try. I could barely sit in an episode. The show is so obviously staged. I mean, each episode involves someone being possessed or involves a demonic force trying to kill the family. Another major flaw is that these guys never belittle anything. When I watch Ghost Hunters, they find evidence and try to refute it, and if they can not, it's evidence. In this program, they find a voice or a video proof and are very quick to call that ghost. This completely ruins their credibility, unlike the TAPS and Ghost Hunters, who really know what they're doing. Honestly, if you're interested in the paranormal and want to watch a show about it, watch Ghost Hunters.
