You know, I'm getting very tired of all the generic music being used in these types of movies (see Jawbreaker, Disturbing Behavior, etc.). Every scene of genuine tension here (and there are some) is immediately toned down with some tacky pop melody, completely diluting the suspense. Why do they do that? To sell some soundtracks, of course, but in this case, the mission was not fulfilled - did anyone buy the CD? <br /> <br /> And yes, Mrs. Mirren attacks her role with enthusiasm and pleasure (with some cheez-wiz to add kick). But what are Molly, Leslie and Vivica doing here? Their roles (they are so underused that I can not use "characters" here) have no purpose in the story, so I can not understand why three well-known actresses were chosen. <br /> <br /> Oh and the ending is so incredibly banal and irresponsible. Children go unpunished and act as if nothing had happened - all smiles at graduation. They are criminals, people! No consequences for your actions (kidnapping, aggression, tampering with notes) - nothing. Little things too-was Tingle's story about her husband true? What is with the beast? Would Katie's virginal character lose her cherry on such a whim? (Great message, guys.) Why did McKean go to her house? How did Kate's academic enemy come through the door right now? How do students even get the addresses of teachers? WHAT IS JEFFREY TAMBOR ?? Based on what McKean fired Tingle? She is bloody, beaten and held hostage by the students, for God's sake! <br /> <br /> Oh, well, I'm spending a lot more thinking on the script than Mr. Williamson apparently did, so I'm going to stop here. 3/10
