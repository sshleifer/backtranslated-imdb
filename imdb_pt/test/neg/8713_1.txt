A very, very, very slow, aimless film about a young man distressed and adrift. I'm not sure who was most lost - the plain characters or the audience, almost half of whom left. <br /> <br /> Trying tricks with black and white camera angles and smart, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - since the acting was bad and the plot and lines almost nonexistent. Too little music or anything to talk about. The best scene of the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running in his head. He goes to a record store used to buy for his lover and has to sing the song for two clerks before finding the album. A cute scene promised, but it came down from there. The rest of the film lacks art, charm, meaning ... If it's about emptiness, it works, I guess, because it's empty. He wasted two hours.
