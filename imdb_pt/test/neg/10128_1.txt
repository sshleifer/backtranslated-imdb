If you wondered if Disney could broadcast a show with a more pampered character than Paris, more superficial than Britney, more insipid than Jessica and more narcissistic than THE GIRLS NEXT DOOR, do not ask yourself more. The most surprising thing is that Selena Gomez is apparently the heroine. She should also be an outcast of the schoolgirl's spoiled, shallow, insipid, and narcissistic "popular" girls, which is no more credible here than for Hilary Duff in LIZZIE McGUIRE. Lots range from recycled BEWITCHED & I DREAM OF JEANNIE to "parodies" by HARRY POTTER. The older boy alternates between being a magical genius and being unable to master the complexities of his own shoelaces. The youngest boy is just one of the clever boys who multiplied on TV as cockroaches in New York (and with the same appeal). The father is the stereotyped father of the TV and the mother ... well, she's not totally horrible. But everything pales alongside the hideous, disgusting yet horribly fascinating spectacle (like a bad car accident) of Lopez's arrogant, self-satisfied, arrogant performance. And, again, she's the heroine.
