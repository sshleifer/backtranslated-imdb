How does a movie become a biblical epic? By simply quoting some scriptures and using some Bible names for your characters? The only thing that was biblical about this epic was the names of the characters. Oh, I almost forgot that the 3 kingdoms, Israel, Egypt and Sheba were also used. Where did King Vidor get the rest of his story? It certainly was not from the Bible. It was a complete and utter absurdity. If you want to read about Solomon's reign as King in Israel, then read 1 Kings 1-11 and 2 Chronicles 1-9. You will even encounter Adonijah in 1 Kings 1 and 2. The Queen of Sheba (which does not appear until King Solomon has been king for about 20 years or more, which, by the way, is long after Adonijah and Joab were dead) can be found in 1 Kings 10 and 2 Chronicles 9. One of the first things that Solomon does is to make an affair with Pharaoh, taking his daughter. <br /> <br /> Yes, King Solomon became involved with Pharaoh. worship of false gods and that is why the Kingdom was divided after his death, not the Temple being destroyed by lightning. Moreover, I think that Solomon was very busy getting married and providing temples to the false gods of his 700 wives and taking care of his 300 concubines to fight against Egypt, let alone a dead brother. <br /> <br /> Like I said this movie was total nonsense. If you will not use the Bible story, call it something else. This could have been called Romeo & Juliet or Sid & Nancy. <br /> <br />
