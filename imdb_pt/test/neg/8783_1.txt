This movie totally sucked !!! Do not even rent! You're going to hate it! The plot made no sense, the characters sucked, and why was that penguin trying to get the stone anyway? If that penguin girl would only like him because he has a beautiful stone that relationship would not be based on love only in cash! I did not really like this movie (hate is such a strong word!). And penguins can not fly! Even if they believe they can do it, they can not. p.s. I'm not who you think I am!
