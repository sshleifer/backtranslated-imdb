I have to say that I really liked UNDER SIEGE and HARD TO KILL. <br /> <br /> Watching Seagal doing his funny martial arts on people. I've always been looking at Seagal-Movies and unfortunately, I was disappointed for the first time with the GLIMMER MAN, which I found very bad. FOREIGNER is probably one of the worst Seagal ever played. Horribly annoying, poorly edited, wrong soundtrack and so on! Dear reader, do yourself a favor and stay away from it! <br /> <br /> Honestly: Stay away!
