WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the movie yet not to read this review. <br /> <br /> If you plan to watch this movie NO! I warn you ... this movie is terribly annoying and basically gruesome, not the kind of horror movie to watch. I confused this Piranha movie with another Piranha movie and when I noticed that I made a mistake, I decided to watch this movie anyway. I wish I had not. This film is so horrendous and so intolerable in every piece of material that I could not let anyone say that this movie was kind of decent. For one thing, this movie should be called a boring conversation about the wilderness instead of piranha. They only show piranhas once! At the same time, the way this movie sounds so badly heard, I became drowsy only 20 minutes later. In the end, my mouth was wide open and I stared gloomily at the empty TV screen. It's a very poorly directed and poorly filmed piece of junk I was afraid of brain dysfunction after watching ...
