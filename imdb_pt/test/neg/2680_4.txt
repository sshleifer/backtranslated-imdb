All the ambiguity about Michael Myers has disappeared thanks to the chronic habit of this series of staying with its continuity and taking the relatives out of nowhere. This entry introduces the potty angle that he is not only a psychotic killer, but is actually controlled by runes, which appear as a constellation of stars every Halloween, and a cult is using it to ... erm, well, this movie is far from coherent and I lost track of the plot after a while. The film has a credibility so profuse that it does not have a drop left by the end. Why does Michael put a victim's clothes in a washing machine? Why does an empty hallway have a deadly peak coming off the wall? Does being electrocuted really make your head explode? And so on. He left Donald Pleasence, in his penultimate role in the movies, to produce some wonderful little moments from the heap of terrible dialogue he gave.
