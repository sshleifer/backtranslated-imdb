Oh God why? I am horrified by the sheer ineptitude of this delicious and shocking absurdity ... as if all this made sense. Well, like this movie from the 1940s bottom poverty line in Hollywood, nothing on this door beating horror - made in three sets - makes a lot of sense ... except the horny Dr. Markoff (jerkoff?) Who wildly covets after a little piano daughter of the player who has great melons and a flouncy hairstyle. It's just terrible ... and it even has a gorilla and a big dog for mindless added distractions. More Elephantine than Elephant man and this is only 62 minutes away!. .... MONSTER MAKER is the kind of movie that kids in 2005 just howl in disbelief and wonder what the hell their grandparents saw in their youth that made them the lovable movie hunts they are today. I think you just had to be there. In 1944, or whatever it was, this crazy idiot was shown to impressionable 13-year-olds in glorious 3000-pound palaces on a rainy day. Somehow. It was made for no reason by PRC Pictures movie cheaters in the war years by fugitive German refugees who knew who to make a movie since leaving Europe when the Nazis advanced in the UFA studios ... the monster in this film as the scientist crazy is actually a Nazi nightmare.
