If she had not been married to the producer, Jennifer Jones would not have been the most obvious choice for the leading female role in this tragic story of a case between an American soldier and an English nurse against the backdrop of World War I. Her British accent is not perfect, and in the 1950's it was unusual for a great romantic actress to go to a thirty-something actress, even one as attractive as Miss. Jones, especially when she was several years older than her leader. There were a number of beautiful young British actresses in Hollywood around that time, such as Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Jean Simmons and Joan Collins, and any of them could have been more convincing in the role, but Miss. Jones had an important attribute. was missing, that is, a marriage certificate with the name of David O. Selznick. In the case, the film turned out to be a turkey that undoubtedly was grateful for not having it on their resumes. <br /> <br /> The lengthy story tells of the romance between Frederick, an American volunteer who served the Italian army as an ambulance driver and Catherine, a nurse at the British Red Cross. After the Italian defeat at the Battle of Caporetto, Frederick is unjustly accused of being a German spy and sentenced to death. (The film paints a very hard image of Italian military justice: it seems that the Italian martial courts had the power to pass the death sentence after a thirty-second trial without hearing any evidence and without allowing the defendant to be legally represented. speak in your defense). Frederico manages to escape and cross the border into neutral Switzerland, accompanied by the pregnant Catherine. <br /> <br /> Hemingway's novels were not always a big hit when filmed. Howard Hawks has managed to make a good version of "To Have and Have Not," a film that is considerably better than the book on which he is nominally based, but this is because he ignored Hemingway's plot and turned the film into a remake of "Casablanca", located in Martinique and not in French Morocco. As the 1943 version of "For Whom the Bell Tolls," "Farewell to Arms" is very time-consuming and fatally slow. It is also miscast. Jennifer Jones never makes Catherine come alive. As for Rock Hudson, his so-called Christian name may unfortunately be appropriate. He could be as solid as a rock, but also impassive as one, and in this film his Frederick looks like a representation of the Great Stone Face. Despite the passion and emotion inherent in Hemingway's plot, the emotional temperature is always very cool. The picture has little more than some attractive postcard views of the Italian and Swiss scenery. Not surprisingly, it was not a success and his failure ended Selznick's career as a producer. 4/10 <br /> <br /> A goof. Shortly before the battle of Caporetto, an Italian official claims that Russia had already concluded a separate peace with Germany. This battle began in October 1917, at a time when Kerensky's Russia was still fighting alongside the Allies. The Russian Revolution did not happen until November; was only the "October Revolution" by the old Julian calendar. The new Bolshevik regime signed an armistice with Germany in December 1917, but a separate peace was not signed until the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918.
