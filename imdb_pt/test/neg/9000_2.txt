Problems: 1) Despite being considered a "loving homage to Poverty Row," many of the old images are not even Poverty Row movies - much of it is from RKO's "The Most Dangerous Game" (1932) silent (!) of "The Lost World" (1926)! <br /> <br /> 2) Much of the old footage is used only as a fill (the old maple footage) or as silent footage (for example, of Belle walking, looking or looking), often repeated; <br /> <br /> 3) Where is the pantheon of Thespians Poet (Bela, Boris, Lon Chaney Jr., George Zucco, John Carradine, Buster Crabbe, Tom Neal, etc.) lines for the 'new' (as in Woody Allen's "What's Up Tiger Lily" or Steve Martin's "Dead Men Do not Wear Plaid")? Even Mike Nelson's faint comment on the colorful "Reefer Madness" is funnier than that. <br /> <br /> High Point: Gregory Mank's long, but extremely enlightening lecture that gives you new respect and admiration to Bela, John Carradine and George Zucco. This is worth the price of the DVD alone!
