First, the initial concept of a fortune lost in gold bars discovered in a New Zealand lake, inside a collapsed World War II aircraft is a grand opening. What follows is nothing more than cartoons like nonsense. Men chasing men, cars chasing men, helicopters chasing men, chasing helicopters boats, boats chasing boats, for the better part of an hour, the most boring absurd, with absolutely no breakthrough in history. Special mention should be made of the edition of the chop shop, since many scenes seem to have been united in random order. The action of all involved is an embarrassment. One last thing, the picture quality and sound quality are so bad on this DVD that you will be horrified. - MERK
