There is the thrill of the budget film noir. And there is the frustration of sinuous and uninteresting low-priced movies. This falls into the second category. <br /> <br /> Spot is the name of a nightclub. The film is about a police officer whose father was killed by gangsters. He goes out to locate them. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the bad impression. Maybe it's me. But I felt I had seen it a hundred times, most times better than it is here. <br /> <br /> It also has the promise: the policeman is fascinated by a woman who plays records that she introduces on the juke. boxes. Then they meet. Now, although this was done well before I was born, I have seen this kind of juke box. And it's incredibly fascinating: when I was a teenager, I went into a bar that still had this device. I always liked juke boxes, in bars or snack bars. But this was different. You spoke to it and a sensual female voice sounding spoken back to you! This is addressed here, but fell into the general and uninteresting stew. <br /> <br /> The film has one thing to do: in a small role, features the very young Anne Jeffreys. What a beauty she was, and it certainly is!
