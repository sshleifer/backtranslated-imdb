I watched this movie in Telly the other night and barely knew what a bash would be ... I knew it would be stupid but not so bad! This film exemplifies everything that is terrible in the Australian comedy. In addition to the most boring and uninspiring scenarios and characters I've ever seen (besides those dubious American comedies of tax breaks produced in France!), Most situations were boring, unbelievable, stereotyped and not so funny ... terrible! <br /> <br /> One of those scenarios that really bothered me was the nerds on the bus scene. From a screenwriting perspective, writers have used the most uninteresting - not to mention unbelievable - scenario to leave these three without their luggage ... They are on holiday for their lives and will risk everything (including $ 300). deposit, luggage and room) to exercise your rights to dance on a bus? I mean, they're half an hour away from your destination! At least they could have sent the bus driver away, but no, they gladly left because 'they can not take it anymore!' And ruin your vacation ... Anyway, I can not believe the writers did not make this scary scenery workshop out. I think a 10 year old could get up to 5 smarter, funny and believable models. <br /> <br /> I can continue with many others - the stereotyped psychopath really unimaginative, all relationship to the abandoned anger. girlfriend and tag along the virgin, the 'Wow Man! Outside goth girl 'inhaling things on the train - EVERYTHING was just pitiful! I can not think of a redeeming feature of the movie except that maybe the nerd of the third wheel was kind of cute. You ruined your career by appearing in this garbage!
