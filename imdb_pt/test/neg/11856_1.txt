So bad, it's fun, especially during cocktail hour, and believe me, you're going to need a beer, a drink, or anything to go through this turkey. Where do they get the financial backing for those "hideous" movies painted by the numbers? The fun in this movie is to predict which characters will be eaten and in what order, and end the so-called "uniforms" that the "military" playboys wear. The kidnappers, by the way, are not the same kidnappers we found in "Jurassic Park", but a raw species. (Sorry, there are no spoilers here. You will have to watch to find out for yourself) Do not expect the plot to make sense, simple as it is, just go for the ride. You can make a game ... have another drink every time you hear a certain sound ... or better yet, every time someone is chewed by a "raptor". With a little luck, you will not even remember to have seen this "made-for-TV" C-series movie!
