Now, do not get me wrong, I love bad movies ... no, I love bad movies, Troll 2 ... ouch painful, Hands The Hands of Fate ... just watch Torgo go, Guru, the Mad Monk ... Is that traffic noise in the medieval background? Okay, of course, but this is one of those films that obviously was trying to be something better, but could not. Why not? Well, it would be easy to blame the plot, but heh we saw worse, there were not many holes and heh I know there is not much originality, but that does not need to kill a movie. The effects are not bad (if you completely ignore the last scene), the monster is fine, the truck quite menacing, so where did it go wrong? Well, I'd love to put the blame on 'Chris Moyles' Harley ... then I will! Comedy and horror are difficult to mix well, bad comedy and even worse horror and there is the problem. I hated this guy from the moment he raised his head (literally), the continuing annoyance of the overly meek Adam becomes annoying, so annoying that you lose the belief that the mildest of people would not react by pushing you out the moving car door ... and I thought it was the monster pieces that the director should have difficulty convincing us. Why are bad movies fun? Well, you have a lot of fun making holes in them, laughing at the script, all the howler monkeys, etc. This movie does not do the coveted category of 'Worst Movies' because it's bad because it's annoying. Do not worry, go watch anything else and you'll be a better person for it ... I promise! (Fade for songs by Torgo Torgo Torgo)
