Occasionally funny, but usually annoying. I recognized Robert Hegyes from Welcome Back Carter (aka Epstein) as the ex-celebrity criminal. There is a slap scene in the knee, with the French having a bad reaction to American food. S. Baio, S. Kellerman, and Tom Arnold are billed but only have minor roles. You never know the characters and it's hard to care what happens to them. Not recommended.
