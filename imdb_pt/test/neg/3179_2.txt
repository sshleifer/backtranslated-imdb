I like Wes Studi and especially Adam Beach, but whoa is this movie a lot of pretentiousness. Weighing slowly. Extremely enigmatic to the point of obfuscation, not because the plot justifies it, but because there is almost no plot. Still less on the path of characterization. This is almost like one of those old Charlie Chan mysteries (the cheapest studio versions of Monogram) with many unknown characters (like the former former senator with the past who is now a recluse) and many people being killed. about objets d'art that you would not look twice in the mall. Great setting, though. Beautiful hair in redhead too, though I never realized what she was doing. Not even my wife. Sheesh, at least the old B movies had the decency to be short.
