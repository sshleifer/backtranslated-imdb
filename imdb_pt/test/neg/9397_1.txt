The film had no emotion and has nothing to keep its interest. The movie had nothing exciting, funny, dramatic or romantic about it !!! How can a movie be romantic if the girl never gets the right guy until the last seen in the movie, what the movie ends ??? Maybe part II is romantic, but someone will have to risk wasting their money! I have nothing more to say besides not wasting your time !!! The movie had nothing exciting, funny, dramatic or romantic about it !!! The movie had nothing exciting, funny, dramatic or romantic about it !!!
