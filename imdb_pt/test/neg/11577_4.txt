Jim Wynorski strikes again with the very literal spirit KOMODO VS. COBRA No guesswork here. A giant CGI Komodo dragon - looks like a hairless dog - takes on a giant CGI king snake, with a group of tree huggers and others caught between them. The tree rangers get the captain of the charter boat Michael Pare (who else?) To take them to a federal island off limits. An experiment by a mad scientist to grow very large plants became an experiment in the cultivation of very large creatures, thanks to our disgusting military. Now all that remains on the island is the very large creatures and the small, well-made daughter of the mad scientist. The group runs to it in the old plantation lab, the monsters arrive and the chase continues. If you watch enough Wynorski / Sci-Fi Channel movies, you'll recognize some of the sets and locations of many other movies. Acting is non-existent, as is the plot. At the very least, you can watch the barely animated compo / dog step on their victims before arresting them. The snake only attacks and swallows. No imagination at all.
