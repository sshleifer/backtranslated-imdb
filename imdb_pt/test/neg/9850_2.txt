This is a rarity of movies where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch with a bottle of vodka. To be completely honest, we are a group of people who really know the man, Mo Ogrodnik, and we decided to become idiots with this movie. <br /> <br /> The cinematographic aspect of Wolfgang Something's photograph seems to have left out both close-ups and breasts. The collaborative effort of Mo and Wolfgang revealed the passion of the two actresses, passionate plastic breasts. There are also beating beetles. As Violet would have said, "This (plastic peen) goes up your butt." Mouse porn and the subsequent rat crush are fearful. <br /> <br /> All right. So if you're still reading, let's explain who we are. Mo Ogrodnik teaches at NYU and we are a group of her students, who, finishing a film class with her, decided to look ugly and watch the directorial debut here. She also wrote Uptown Girls. I can not tell you how much this was hammered in our skulls. So this movie is quite an experience. At the bottom of this post will be a drink game we created for this movie. <br /> <br /> About 13 minutes into the game, neither of us could see right. Dido's huge amount in the first thirty minutes created enough reasons to drink to pacify an elephant. There was something secretly pleasurable about seeing two young girls on a Kurt Cobain look-alike with absolutely no context, except for its mysterious scene in the convenience store. where he was naturally reading a local newspaper. Because that's what we all do. The heart-shaped glasses were delightfully derived from Lolita. And something about that provocative scene of the naked boy who raises his chin suggests the story of the director of homosexual pornographic experiments. We wish we were joking. <br /> <br /> Enough of intellectual contemplation. I DO NOT PLAY DRINKING! This will ensure that the viewing experience is positive. It is very simple, and very likely to send at least one member of your group to the immediate care. <br /> <br /> The Mo Ogrodnik / Mature Drinking Game: 1. Whenever you see anything related to pornography, have a drink. . 2. Whenever you see the name of the auteur Mo Ogrodnik appear, have a drink. 3. sex. 4. (plastic peen) require two drinks. 5. Whenever someone points a weapon at another character, have a drink. At this point, you will probably need to fill / pee any remaining sobriety from your body. 6. At any time there is blood (INCLUDING "LADY BLOOD"), please take a sip! 7. The underused hula-hoop girl requires one dose per second. 8. Free use of the "magic black man" requires a drink. 9. If you can not figure out the line, keep drinking, Beyotch. 10. Whenever you are able to predict a line, have a drink. Trust us. Is easy. <br /> <br /> That's it, internet! Keep drinking and try not to get carried away. <br /> <br /> -Hawaiian Smirnoff Punch, Jr.
