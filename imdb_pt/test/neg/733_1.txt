I watched "Fuckland" a long time ago. I lied if I said I remember in detail; what I remember most vividly is the irritation that provoked me and the feeling of a total waste of precious money and time, not only my time and money invested in watching the film but also the director's. Supposedly, "Fuckland" is a critic of the Argentines, introducing us (I am Argentinian too) as small people who take credit and even boast of petty and ridiculous victories, and think that we are the best something that God (who is also an Argentine) created. I will not discuss it. It's probably a true statement about a fairly large part of the population (the part I despise, by the way). And even if that is not true, that's not my point. The worst sin committed by "Fuckland" was to express such an assertion about his own director. The continuous impression I got was that the director was too busy trying to impress us by sneaking a camera into the islands to worry about making a good (even mediocre) movie. Many of the jacks taken with a hidden camera are useless. The director chooses to show off with a silly editing of old war-takes and their own. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film proudly presents a Dogme certificate before the opening titles, only to disrespect its principles afterwards (for example, including the director in the credits - another sign of his pride?). <br /> <br /> I found the film offensive, not as an Argentine, but as an observer. I felt underestimated. "Fuckland" is simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
