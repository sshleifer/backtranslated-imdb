Good design. Good songs, although like the other guy said they do not run with too much energy. Bea Arthur, trying her best to do something with the material, had an occasional good one-liner as the friend of Mame, Vera, and helped carry the song "Bosom Buddies". Other than that, there is nothing worthwhile here. Slow tempo, incredibly bad cinemetography, not very good singing (except for Robert Preston), a horrible script, bad acting (except for Bea) and a horrible main actress. Who thought Lucille Ball would be good as the elegant and life-loving Mame? The bosses of Warner Bros. were doubtless in doubt when they decided not to use Angela Lansbury, who had done so well on Broadway, and instead used Ball, who was not as funny as she was 20 years ago. , could not act at all "in the right way," and used a painful croak as an excuse to sing. Even though (perhaps why) making the film painful for her and even if she funds, she is not Mame. Tia Mame is such a great movie and the soundtrack of the Broadway musical with Lansbury sounds great. For the most part, there is nothing here that is great, engaging or interesting. Forget about it unless you're a big Lucy fan who thinks she can not do anything wrong. I hope that after seeing this, you realize that she was only human.
