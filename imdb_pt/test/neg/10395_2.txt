I just rented the Blackwater Valley Exorcism because the cover and the photos looked terrifying, and I do not usually watch movies that are automatically released on DVD, but that sounded so interesting and scary! I was in the mood for a good scary movie, and for me, ownership is one of the scariest themes to watch or learn. Just look at the exorcist or the exorcism of Emily Rose, both fantastic films that made break not only wise horror but the story as well. <br /> <br /> The Blackwater Valley Exorcism is about a girl, Isabelle, that get go is automatically owned, so we can not even tell what kind of person she was to start with. But is a former wife-beater who turned priest in the case with a gardener ...? I know I know. So they go into various other stories with Isabella's priest and sister, and the priest beat up his sister and played with Isabelle? I'm not sure, so we went into a story with Isabelle's father and his questioning about his wife's fidelity to him. <br /> <br /> I mean, history only comes in many directions and was not well developed. at all. Not to mention that the exorcism did not seem authentic and more than just scare the pants of the film type, which I did not like at all, because I could not take it seriously. Whoever has directed and written this clearly has no idea where to go or how to direct the story well, so I really would not recommend it. <br /> <br /> 2/10
