Some kind of compliment should be given to Hellraiser: Bloodline. Actually, it's full moon full moon. Are all the brands, say, the "Demonic Toys" or "Puppet Master" series, without its dopey charm? The Full Moon can get on with the silly product because they know it's silly. These Hellraiser things, dude, do they always take themselves seriously? This increasingly stupid franchise (though not as stupid as me for having seen it) made up for its low budgets by being stylish. Now it's just ish.
