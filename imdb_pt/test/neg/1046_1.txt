"Five Characters in Search of an Exit" has to be one of the most annoying "Zones" ever made. It was on the Sci-Fi this morning and, as always, I changed the channel. I put on my Top Five list of the worst "Zones" ever produced. Dizzy and predictable, and not worth watching. Serling worked this theme to death (Earthmen at the hands of aliens, who were often giants), and in this particular version, it just does not work. Anyone who has not seen this before, will find out quickly. This is another piece of Serling philosophical humor, perhaps paralleling the situation of those in prisoners of war or concentration camps, where prisoners may lose interest in finding out where they are or fighting their captors. William Windom, as the soldier who is the last to "fall", is the only curious to make the effort, and it does not take long to find out the result.
