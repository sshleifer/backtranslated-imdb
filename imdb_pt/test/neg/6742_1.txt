This movie is so bad that there are no words to describe it. If I could get a video camera of a monkey dancing for an hour and a half, it would be a lot more fun than that. The plot is so monotonous and unimaginable that it is not even worth mentioning. The best part of the movie was when the credits rolled and I had a laugh knowing that the name of the main actors was James Bond III. Just trust me and stay away from that pile of crap!
