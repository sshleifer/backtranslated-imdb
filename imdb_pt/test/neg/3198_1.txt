Anyone who thinks this movie is great, desperately needs to see its head. It seems to me that this movie was made as a joke. Does not have good points. The props cost about $ 10 and the whole set looks like it could fall off at any moment. Why are movies like this made in the first place? It also had two of the most annoying characters I've ever encountered in the boy in the spaceship and in the twentieth century redneck. This movie is almost as bad as "Cool as Ice", starring the incredibly talented "misunderstanding" Ice.
