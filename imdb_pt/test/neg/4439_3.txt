"Quintet" is definitely not a movie that most people would find entertaining or interesting. There is no scene, dialogue, acting or plot development that can spark a spark. The icy world is one thing, but the messy plot is something you really can not stand. The characters are not only three-dimensional, not even one-dimensional, there is no emotion and there is no sense in anything that is happening. There is a world wrapped in ice, where no one does any meaningful work except playing Quintet, and the rules for the game are never even suggested. Houses are not heated, nor electricity, but who and what produces? There is wood, but there are no animals except dogs, so where clothes or shoes come from, as there is apparently no industry, and they are all dressed up like in sixteenth-century Europe, which is a strange contrast to the not-so-futuristic pavilion setting. The whole movie seems to be tied to Altman's imagination, and he never bothered to share his ideas or his vision with the audience. Desolation or hopelessness have nothing to do with the lack of appeal to this film, the world of "THX1138" by George Lucas is not a brighter place and the characters are no longer fun, but history has its way. In the Quintet, there is no obvious or even insinuated path, and in my opinion it does not even make you think of the idea behind everything, such as a similar film, "Zardoz" by John Boorman. It's not even done in Altman's unique style, so it also does not attract its fans, and I'm one of them. In all, Robert Altman had a dream and woke up without telling anyone what it meant, not even to him.
