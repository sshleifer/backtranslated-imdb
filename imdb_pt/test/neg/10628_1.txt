About the movie itself, there are ample comments. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say something about the German version that I saw recently on TV. It is severely cut. From 103 to 76 minutes! It is common for the bloodiest scenes to be cut for German TV. I understand the reasons for this, but this movie was something else. They not only cut "kicks" - they cut out entire sequences, sparing only glimpses. Like: "We have to attack them" - a second 5-second shot of explosions in the field - protagonist running away. <br /> <br /> When the assault on the island begins, it is no longer possible to follow the plot. All cuts create something that amounts to a series of erratic and disconnected scenes that no longer make sense. <br /> <br /> I could not bear to watch the end after spending 60 minutes with that nonsense. <Br /> <br /> I think I would have given the original 7/10 The German version is worth only 1/10 <br /> <br /> Put it on DVD (and check the run time first) or forget it.
