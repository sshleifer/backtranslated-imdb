I bought a DVD collection (9 movies for 10 Euros) where this was included. It ended up being the "uncut version," whatever that means. Aside from the low average quality and short scenes, there was one thing that was really weird - the mild sex scene. It started with a close-up of 2 larger breasts. After about 2 minutes I had an expression on my face that fit the term "boooooooooooooring!" perfectly perfectly. 7.5 minutes of not even jumping concrete like breasts (right now the term breasts is a bad choice) is way beyond the entertainment. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie was more like "people are not / that / stupid, are they? <br /> <br /> Lucky me, the DVD was scratched and I got my money back .
