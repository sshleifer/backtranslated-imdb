Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had. I think my eyes started to bleed. I actually got sick the night after watching this. I do not even consider it a movie. Movies should be worthwhile and fun. That fails horribly. I could not get through the whole movie, so as the ending may be the biggest phenomenon in movie history, it gives this little chance a chance. Otherwise, it would be a zero plan. <br /> <br /> I can not see how National Lampoon, let alone any organization, would sponsor this atrocity. Renting this DVD is currently one of the worst mistakes of my life. Just watch this if you want to make a movie you will never look great. <br /> <br /> No doubt this is the worst movie I've ever seen.
