I saw some bad things in my time. A half-dead cow trying to get out of the high mud; a head in the collision between two cars; a thousand plates knocking on the kitchen floor; humans living as animals. <br /> <br /> But never in my life have I seen anything as bad as The Cat in the Hat. <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than 911, worse than Hitler worse than Vllad the Impaler, worse than the people who put kittens in the microwave. <br /> <br /> It's the most disturbing movie of all time, easy. <br /> <br /> I used to think it was a joke, some elaborate joke and that Mike Myers was maybe a drug addict snorting cocaine who lost a bet or something. I shudder
