First of all, the whole idea of ​​remaking a classic like "Psycho" is nothing short of ridiculous. A lot of time and effort was wasted here. I'm sure they are smart enough to know they could not improve on the original so they must have had a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock in their minds. However, the idea that started as a well-intentioned tribute, results in being a slap in the face of the master of horror. This film is poorly produced, poorly represented and unnecessary. The original classic looks good on its own even after 40 years. The Hitch event returning from the grave and coming after the people responsible for this piece of junk is unlikely, but if I were them, I would sleep with one eye open just in case. Do not waste your time.
