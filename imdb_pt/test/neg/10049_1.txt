What if someone made a horror movie that was completely devoid of plot? <br /> <br /> Well, I think it would probably end up a bit like this. I do not think I've ever seen a move was so steady that its banal (at the beginning) slide to complete crap (until the end). I just kept it, because I kept thinking it could not get worse. Well, by the end, "Ghoul" / "Horror Cemetery" proved that I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Who would have suspected that a movie with a dead-living lizard man, evil cultists stealing the grave, and crazy Scientists thrown in for no discernible reason could suck this bad? One might think that there would be at least some humorous value ... but not here.
