This movie starts off on the wrong foot and never works out. The first scene shows a Life Flight helicopter landing and, outside the window, you can distinctly see the mountains in the background. For those of you who may have never been to Houston, there is no elevation change. The city is just above sea level and a 5-foot slope is considered a great hill. To follow this scenario, any injection outside the hospital immediately informs the viewer that they are not in Houston. The trees are all missing leaves or they are pine trees, none of which Houston has much. Even the hospital itself, outside, is unbelievable. Memorial Hermann Hospital is one of the major hospitals in the United States and is right in the middle of the medical district a few miles from downtown Houston, but all the outlets in the hospital make it look like the hospital is in the suburbs or even wants to have been responsible for the part of the tropical storm of the movie was eliminated because the numerous radar outlets are wrong. The first radar image in the film is that of Hurrican Hugo arriving in South Carolina. Later we see Kris Kristofferson quitting his job and one of his assistants tells him that Alison is heading south through Houston, but the image of the radar shows that Alison clearly moved to the northern Gulf of Mexico in Houston ... probably the initial land of Alison. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it's not that bad. JoBeth Williams, Kris Kristofferson and Rick Schroder all do a decent job considering this is a straightforward movie for TV. The plot of the story is decent and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it a little more fun. My only problem with acting is the interpretation of Houstonians with big southern accents ... the actors sound like they're from Birmingham, Alabama, not Houston, Texas. <br /> <br /> The film shows your point of view and for the general public, it does exactly what it should: entertain. If you are looking for a factual account of what happened to the city of Houston in June of 2001 then you will be disappointed. One thing to keep in mind before watching this movie is that it is based only on the evacuation of the Memorial Hermann Hospital and not on the tropical storm Alison and the impact on the Houston subway itself. If you are looking for a factual account of the impact of tropical storm Alison on the Houston subway, I suggest you watch Storm Storm from The Weather Channel for Tropical Storm Alison. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of *****
