I saw this movie with my girlfriend. It was a total disaster. You can actually see that it was made cheap. Badly scripted and with very poor acting. I read several book versions of different authors and also listened to a version in the audio book. We could not take the film seriously because of the missing elements. The experience of seeing this was how the Blair Witch visits Green Acres. Then there were parts that were vulgar. They show this little boy using a bed pan and they actually show the contents of it. The witch throws the contents over the boy and the whole family laughs. I thought it was nasty and very strange. I really can not understand why anyone would think it would be fun. It shows another scene in which Dr. Mize arrives and Betsy Bell is urinating in her dress on the steps of his house in front of his mother and brothers. Instead of the mother taking her away, it's her brother. How sick? The little boy in the first scene of the many scenes that deal with how his body gets rid of garbage begs for toilet paper and goes to the house outside and makes those sick faces of joy with sound effects. I think they should have left all that aside. The makeup on the reverend James Johnston as an older man did not make you assume he was older. This made you think he was dipped in fish dough. Joshua Gardner's blood when he falls off the stairs is even worse. The scene of John Bell's death looks like they picked up flour and tried to do something with it to make it look like a sick and serious man. For me, a lot of disgusting comedy with problems in the bathroom and inexperienced people involved was the fall of that picture. These people would do better if they filmed commercials for local TV stations for bathroom products. They chose a good subject and failed to produce it properly. I rate this film Capital F less.
