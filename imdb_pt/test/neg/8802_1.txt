This movie is bad, so bad that my mother can barely stand the "suspense" of Disney's Snow White, was laughing at the whole movie. My first warning should have been that it was in the $ 5.50 box at Wal-Mart. But I actually found some good movies in this bin, so I can not blame myself for this mess. The second caveat should have been that when the box played the DVD, it actually cost $ 3.88. Once again I've never been to ignore the baratinhos. This movie is definitely not for people looking for something good to watch, and certainly not for everyone who likes occasional bad movies. If you need background noise while doing something like playing cards with some friends, then take this, but if you're looking for something to actually watch, do not worry. It was very disappointing because there were so many good actors. I felt like I was watching Willard's chocolate version.
