"Committed," as in Heather Graham being COMMITTED to saving her husband / marriage, and then being COMMITTED to a psychiatric ward to stop doing it: that clever and clever use of words. those senseless, philosophical films in which the narration is a series of such wise observations that border on poetry (poetry-chic from the 90s, better known as "chit-chic poetry" ). Oh, it's so je-ne-sais-quoi ... Written / directed (or "autedured") by a woman (Lisa Krueger, whoever you are), this is a meaningless, lethargic, spiritualist nonsense and characters that are meant to be interesting, but are merely seen before or simply bland. Latinos in this film, as part of the poor urban minority, are typically glorified throughout their primitivism obsessed with mysticism as a "spiritually superior" people who are the "highlight" of the film's political correctness. <br /> <br /> The whole affair is lifeless, and it ceases to be so when occasionally good cast members appear (Kay Place, Baker, Wilson). On the other hand, we have Casey Affleck, who is one of the best examples of why nepotism equates to first-degree murder as a crime. I have rarely seen a more apathetic "actor"; a slim, ugly idiot running through his lines in a drowsy way, almost as if he were uttering them in an almost awake dream, but that weak voice, one of the weaker male voices I've heard in my life. (He must have gone to the Tobey Maguire Lethargy School of Performance.) To cast that idiot into anything speaks volumes about any movie, that is, about any director or producer. So Lisa Krueger is a waste of space without talent. We also have that idiot who played the lead role in the "Werewolf" of the MST3K; I think his name is Goran Vishnjic, but I'm not sure. Check out his ridiculous accent and idiot speech.
