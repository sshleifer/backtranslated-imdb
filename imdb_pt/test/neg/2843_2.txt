At first I thought this should be a bit of comedy / horror when I had seen the body in the bathtub with the woman just stopped screaming again and again, but as the movie went on, it got flatter and flatter. . The plot was silly with a man upset that real estate prices have risen, so now he decides to call some radio shrink and stammer his fury because he has nothing better to do. So the law gets involved and desperately tries to make us feel that they really care about who the caller is and they go out of their way to track down this guy. One suspect after another is charged. This movie is terrible and the love scenes of Adrian B. and her husband are annoying and made me advance the film. Avoid it!
