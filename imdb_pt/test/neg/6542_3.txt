When the PUFFY CHAIR waves, beware of the soft and colorful upholstery. <br /> <br /> The movie starts very well. Josh (Mark Duplass) and Emily (Kathryn Aselton) are a boyfriend-girlfriend couple who has a bit of difficulty with their relationship. A discussion takes place one night and in order to make amends, Josh asks Emily to come on a trip to her father's house, where Josh plans to deliver a reclining LazyBoy chair for his father's birthday. Emily accepts and along the way they catch up with Josh's restless brother Rhett (Rhett Wilkins), an Amish-looking fellow more in touch with the lives of others than his own. <br /> <br /> The trip quickly turns into more fights. between Josh and Emily, as well as a bitter feeling for The Puffy Chair (initially it's very dirty and crumbling until Josh "convinces" the original owner to reform). Rhett quickly verifies that the cause of all Emily and Josh's problems is LazyBoy and puts him in the torch one night ... <br /> <br /> And this is the last time we hear about the chair, even if there is many minutes left in the movie. <br /> <br /> The big problem is that the title of the movie is The Puffy Chair, when it is not the chair that occupies the center of the stage. It's the condemned relationship of Josh and Emily and how roadtrip seals their feelings for each other. Once the chair is destroyed, there is never another mention of it, even if they reach Josh's parents on his father's birthday without a gift. Josh never mentions the chair, nor does his father. There is no connection between this and their lives. So why call the movie The Puffy Chair and why is not there a connection with it in the end? Bad script. The other annoying thing is that Mark Duplass's brother, Jay Duplass, is not only the director but also the videographer (and not very good). Almost all scenes have a quick zoom on the characters that become grainy and out of focus before the camera's autofocus reaches and autodefines. Initially, this took on a singular and artistic feel, but quickly became unbearable. <br /> <br /> The acting in the film is accessible and fun. All the actors / actresses did good works. But the poor quality of production, the blistering finish and the lack of consistency in the title caused many problems.
