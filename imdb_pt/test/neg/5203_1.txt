As a huge fan of the original Delta Force, I thought about choosing this movie. I realized that it could not be so bad. However, here is a list of things I learned while watching Operation Delta Force 4: Deep Fault. <br /> <br /> The Delta Force, despite being the elite of the American military, is made up of slightly overweight men. The 30s and early 40s. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force, despite being the elite of the American military, has standard-issued pistols or AK-47s on its most important missions. The Delta Force, despite being the elite of the American military, has not learned that during stealth missions, wearing bright red ski jumpers and running in open spaces will not exactly keep it out by sight. <br /> <br /> - When you drop a Molotov cocktail into a tank, it explodes externally like a grenade. <br /> <br /> - When you are hit by tank shots, you may run away, although the smoke caused may present minor difficulties in breathing. <br /> <br /> - You can die from a standard gunshot, but you can also live despite being hit several times by a sniper rifle, and a few times by an AK-47. In melee combat, Delta Force members, despite being the elite of the US military, are routinely assaulted by railroad attendants. <br /> <br /> - If bandits are approaching you on a slow moving train, there's nothing to worry about - among the 4 of them, they can not figure out how to make an automatic weapon fire automatically, much less hit anyone from 5 meters (16 feet) with at least 50 attempts between them. <br /> <br /> - If you have few actors, just recycle them - the thug of Operation Delta Force 1 plays a good guy named Mac in Operation Delta Force 4, and the guy who played Mac in Operation Delta Force 3 now plays Skip Lang, a different legal guy. <br /> <br /> - It's not good for The Delta Force to shoot an unarmed terrorist, even though he's trying to reload his gun to kill him. <br /> <br /> - Grenades explode on impact with ground when thrown by members of the Delta Force. When launched by people who are not from the Delta Force, they explode exactly at the point where members of the Delta Force threw the grenades back to the bad guys. <br /> <br /> - Tanks can drive faster than standard trucks. <BR> - Militia and personal armies use exactly the same helicopter as the UN used in Operation Delta Force 1. <br /> - When a helicopter arrives, a bad guy in that helicopter can not see If you lie down face down. <br /> <br /> - Shooting someone several times in the chest will cause minor damage. Stabbing that person in the knee will kill them within 5 seconds. <br /> <br /> The Delta Force steals cars from elderly people to move around when they are in foreign countries because the US military does not provide them with any means of transportation. This may also explain why they took the public transport. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is not really the best movie moment, but it's good for a laugh.
