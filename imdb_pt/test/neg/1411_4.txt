I found this vehicle Robin Williams slightly amused at best. I think you would call it political satire. It's about a political presenter / comedian who decides to run for president and unexpectedly wins. I discovered that most of the humor was drying me up. and Robin Williams is much more restrained and calm than usual. I would say the movie is more of a drama than a comedy, with a bit of mystery and suspense. I think the dramatic parts worked better than the comedies and the mystery. and suspense (although it's a small part of the movie) worked better. Still, I would not rate this film too high. For me, it was a waste of 2 hours, but nothing special. My best advice would be to get him on TV / cable or rent it cheap first, before making a decision on whether to buy it. My vote for Man of the Year is a 4/10
