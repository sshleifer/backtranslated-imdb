Killer Flood: Drug Day Broke: 1/10: Finally, a movie whose title is spoiler proof. Even with the low standards of disaster movies, excuse me, allow me to correct myself, even by the low standards of movies made for TV disasters, that's really awful. Where do I start? <br /> <br /> The dam modeler may have seen a picture of a dam, but I doubt it. Most dams, especially large dams that generate electricity, have, ah, I do not know a nearby power plant, some floodgates for water to pass, even a high voltage electric wire or two. <br /> <br /> The dam also has few personnel. Two, count them, two employees work the entire dam, all three shifts. And the employees were apparently imported from a clich√© movie of World War II, as they heroically and somewhat unnecessarily praised complete death scenes with pictures of grandchildren floating. One of them can be shot by the dam itself in a way that defies description. <br /> <br /> Special effects consist of flowing water superimposed on the city photo in a method that makes a Godzilla movie from the sixties look like the Matrix. A three-year drawing with blue pencil on the film would have produced better results. Since the disaster money shots are useless how is the rest of the movie? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the script and acting follow the lead of the special effects. This is not a diamond in the rough. That's the brute. So, is it a guilty pleasure? Killer Flood is horrible enough to generate some laughter and the movie itself has that serious incompetence that makes a good cult classic, but bad disaster movies need to age like a good wine. (Avalanche, The Swarm, Meteor) It is also doubtful that Michelle Green hiding from the flood in a bin with a golden retriever will never match the great Henry Fonda being struck by raisins that are supposed to be killer bees. Come back with me in 2024.
