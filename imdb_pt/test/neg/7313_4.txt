The credits at the end say "ALL led by Shigeru Izumiya". This is an appropriate way of expressing this, because it seems that the material shot from various projects was played in some way, almost not even trying to make it all a consistent job. It looked like one of those songs that are marketed as movies to make money with those video commercials, but here we have the marketable music and live performances missing, except for one scene that can also be marketed as a weird music video in Japan. Whatever it is. <br /> <br /> It does not make sense. Visually it is also not very special, although it has its moments (for example, the female creature with the "dust of death", which is tied in a bed base and some metamorphosis along) and certainly has an industrial feel for it. Normally I would call the effects of dilettantes, but what this movie offers in this regard is disconcerting more than anything else. Do you remember those cheap video effects from the music videos of the '70s and' 80s that make them look so old-fashioned, like an image within an image flying across the screen? There is much of this kind of effect in this, and for no apparent reason. The most partial apparent effort comes in the form of a collage of photos. The photos look like album covers. Whatever it is. <br /> <br /> I do not know what's happening with the subtitles of the version I saw. The Chinese (or whatever these hieroglyphs) sometimes appear to appear when nothing is said and the English often appear without the Chinese. The English subalterns talk a lot about life without death (is it possible?), And a mind without a body, which provides the closest thing to an understandable conflict between the characters in this film. A guy (a scientist) says that life without flesh is death while another guy (a metamorphosed guy) who claims that his mind is beyond his body now that he has taken the "dust of death" blown on his face and now he knows the secrets of the flesh and other embellishments; The metamorphosed guy is visibly questioned about the scientist's statement. Whatever. <br /> <br /> Erm, the end - all written by perception of ambiguity
