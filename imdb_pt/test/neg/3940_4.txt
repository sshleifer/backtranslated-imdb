Stay Alive is a bizarre horror movie about a video game that kills people just as they die inside the game. The friends who play this game soon discover this, and then realize that they must defeat the Blood Countess of the video game or accept their destinies. We had video tapes on The Ring, a deadly site on FearDotCom. Now it's for video games. Stay Alive does some things well; the development of the character is a bit deeper than it would normally be in a horror movie. We really see some of the characters' feelings and past and know them very well, so the audience can gain some emotions for them. The film is also very suspenseful. Tense and unnerving moments are often reproduced in the film, accompanied by disturbing and frightening music. There are many jumps and bumps for the viewer. That may be ideal once or twice, but these fake scares that Hollywood seems to like to overdo in horror movies these days wear out at Stay Alive. The camera will tend to provide sharp angles or quick flashes to give viewers a quick glimpse of a demon or witch, and try to scare them with this sudden onslaught on the screen. Because? The blood is obviously very weak because of the movie script. Stay Alive's script is very tacky and rather risible, and the characters tend to interpret it in a very melodramatic and confusing way. In addition, cliches come from all directions, for example people wandering on their own in search of a strange noise or if they have seen a figure in the dark, they will investigate. However, the computer graphics used for the video game segments are quite impressive and have a colorful and sharp appearance, working well with the other parts of the movie. But overall, there is just not enough to handle this movie. Stretching in just over a hundred minutes, it will not be a battle to stay alive, but rather stay awake.
