This movie was so frustrating to watch. Split screens do not allow you to get too involved with the emotions of the actors. I was constantly going back and forth watching all those tiny images that I encountered with wiplash until the end. This is basically a steal from "The Talented Mr. Ripley" and "Timecode" I was very disappointed with the filmmakers who try to be cool. I wish I had left like so many other people did.
