As a Scotsman, I think the idea of ​​"Macbeth" changed to America in Time and Space. I'm sure this does not apply to IMDb users, but why are so many Americans unable to relate to ANY concept of a movie other than that? t set in your country? This attitude does not favor Americans in the Great World here. It was already bad enough that "The Wicker Man" was remade and set in the US, totally stripped of its cultural context, and with a Polticaly Correct the genre shift for a main character. <br /> <br /> Anyone wonder what comes next, Robert The Bruce as a New York City cop?, Mary Queen of Scots as a "Soccer Mom" ​​juggling, children, career, and relationships? <br /> <br /> Come to Hollywood, open all other Cultures on the Planet!
