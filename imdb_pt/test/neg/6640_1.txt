So I called HBO, I just thought I would have some quality movies and I saw that. Carrot Top is so bland it is nauseating to watch. I've seen bland movies before, but I think it's impossible to watch because Carrot Top seems to think it's hilarious. Watching this movie is really like watching a movie designed for 5 year olds with exaggerated and insane reactions replete with ultra stupid jokes that only a 4 year old would appreciate. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is how some other talented actors actually signed this project, such as Larry Miller and M Emmet Walsh. If you've ever seen the absolutely horrible Carrot Top commercials (or whatever they were) then it's more or less the same. It's a pastry festival that is a waste of a high budget that could have done something, saved homeless people ... anything but that. I'm not sure if it's in the 50's of all time but for the $ 10 million spent it's a shame.
