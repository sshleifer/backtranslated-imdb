This film is about a young woman who goes to live with her rich cousins ​​falls in love with one of her cousins, and rejects the advance of an amoral suitor who brings problems to the family. After seeing the 1999 version and reading the book, I decided to watch the older version. I thought it was true for Fanny's character in the book, but he was also a boring character. Fanny's character played by Sylvestra Le Touzel was dull; she seemed to be about to faint. I also did not like Robert Bourbage, who played Henry Crawford. I could not imagine him interested in Fanny or her cousin Maria. Jackie Smith Wood, who played Mary Crawford, was fine, but the wig she wore was so ugly. I lost interest in his acting and kept looking at his wig. I kept waiting for her to fall from her head. I could also see a slip of his real hair under the wig.
