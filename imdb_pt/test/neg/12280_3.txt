An essentially undecided action movie has two good guys (Fong and Roundtree) versus two villains (Mitchell and Pierce). Fong is perhaps the most charismatic action leader of the '80s, the small part of Roundtree is a far cry from his "Shaft" days, and Cameron Mitchell adds another shameful role in his career, one to sit next to Turn in "The Toolbox ". Murders "(this man was a respected actor once, now he wears flowers in his hair and complains of people bleeding on his rug.) Only Stack Pierce acts with some dignity.As for violence, do not worry: most are badly made to offend someone. (* 1/2)
