Maybe it's unfair of me to comment on this movie because, for the first time, I hung up a movie because it was so bad. I can watch anything, but this movie was very annoying. I was bored before putting on the DVD and thought this could be a scary movie / laughable action action to lighten the mood. Not even that, it is a device that increases the level of annoyance by the power of 100. Had to turn it off after 45 minutes because all that had happened at that time was that some people had dipped, and a large mole had been discovered . Seriously, this movie is not worth it, even if you can enjoy a bad movie like I can, avoid this movie like a plague. The worst thing I've seen in years.
