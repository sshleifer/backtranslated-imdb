This film is an incredibly self-indulgent piece of character that assumes that the mere impression of a story is as good as a true story. It was totally painful to watch and if I had not been fooled into buying the DVD because of John Travolta and the positive buzz I would not have finished watching it. <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing that resembles an interesting premise. and seems to rely heavily on (and frankly, heavy) characterization. There is an altercation scene between Purslane and Bobby Long in which a TV is destroyed which, when thrown away, is incredibly flabby and inopportune. <br /> <br /> I found myself caring less and less about the characters as I watched this. It was probably a lot of fun, in film school terms, to do that. But it's very annoying to watch. An indulgent and pretentious film school project you should not waste money.
