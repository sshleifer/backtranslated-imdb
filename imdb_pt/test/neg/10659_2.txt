The pace of this movie is very slow. It takes about 70 minutes to get Katie to China (who we know she will) and leaves 30 minutes to wrap things up. The plot is so predictable that you know it all after about 5 minutes. Nothing surprises you. I think the movie is a mature film, but the movie is full of stereotypes that are right at the top: Katie - A beauty who realizes it seems, boys and shopping is not everything. She realizes that she can "feel" and "see the real world." Touching. <br /> <br /> The mother - tall, nervous, screaming mother (wow very innovative) who needs to take care of a strong man. <br /> <br /> The father-patient is always understanding and caring for the incapable woman. <br /> <br /> The boyfriend who just wants to get into his pants. <br /> <br /> The Chinese comedian clown who can not speak English properly and played a laughing part. Thought Hollywood dropped these characters in the mid-fifties. <br /> <br /> The nurse who sometimes knows everything how to move in China that the next moment is a carbon copy of the mother ie a woman who can not handle the situation or knows anything. <br /> <br /> The deformed Chinese girl who with the help of us, will make help and we will become a beautiful girl. Because in China (a third world country according to the film) has nothing and therefore needs our charity. Gah, wake up and smell what you're cleaning. <br /> <br /> Of course there is a bit of poverty in China, but the picture of the aid from Western countries (read USA) is so superficial and happy, it is sad and revolting. Shanghai (where the film is set) is the most expansive and evolving city in the world at the moment. <br /> <br /> The Chinese father who is so good and good-hearted that in the end he has a desire ... to be a cowboy in a white hat ... <br /> <br /> The teacher (Sean Astin) who has this really moving story (not) that he tells without feeling. Why Sean? BECAUSE !? <br /> <br /> Etc etc. It's hard to find a "real" person throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> This is nothing more than a movie that feels good for Americans under age. 15. If you want to learn something about the world, for example, Hotel Rwanda instead. For a better life story or a rip-off movie, I suggest you watch the Italian Cinema Paradiso that won the best foreign film academy a few years ago. <br /> <br /> The only good thing in the movie was the small scenes of the city that really capture some (not all) of the beautiful Chinese side of the country. I was there and saw some of them.
