It sounds like a rather innocent choice at first - the name "employee of the month" might sound like "Office Space" and the "Office Clerk" program. I think not. This is not even a dark comedy. The director of this movie, whoever the guy's name was, was a complete idiot and has a wicked, sickly mind. There is no pleasure in being lured into feeling sorry for a complete loser who betrays his wife, steals his high-level work and lies through his teeth 24/7. The second I walk in the room when my family is watching (and believe me, they were just watching more because they were praying for there to be at least some relief, maybe even some fable in the end, sending a warm message of good justice and when the good guys they look good). All the good guys were killed so long ago that they did not have time to look good. No memorial was made. <br /> <br /> This movie has borderline insanity. It disrespects the elderly, the dead, and women - and the director tries to make people enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie only two because the soundtrack was good. But even that was not memorable. If you're lucky enough not to see it in theaters, definitely my friends, do not do it at home.
