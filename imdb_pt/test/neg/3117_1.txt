French cinema sucks! Below all these psychotropic visions with their distinct attitudes cultivated by my God-am-me! Pestilence to the renowned symbolic film and waterproof chiffres! I will not have a mind for this anymore! Léos Carax, you ever thought, that a dialogue in a movie could be natural and vivid? Maybe I'm too common to understand you? Or was it your task to confirm all the clichés of a Frenchman that the world can have? Guillaume, the guilliotined, arrives at his home palace, Mme. Deneuve, not in the photo, plays the flute: "Here I am, my dear!" Right now, I knew she's in the tub and we'll see her soon enough. Do not get me wrong, I'm not cocky, and the incestuous sex scene was the climax of the movie. But this is in Berlin, we say "etepetete", which means something like "être-peut-être", a snobistic, self-satisfied, and, worst of all, seen often in French films I can say! Another example: she, beautiful and willing, is looking at herself in the mirror, combing her hair, and her young, bearded, savage guru rushes into the room, shouting breathlessly: "There is no escape, there is no escape!" Forty years after Sartres existentialists and consorts - what's new, what's interesting? My God, there is that woman and she loves and admires you, what would be more natural to be happy with your life? And when you're not, please explain better because !! Born French means you have to live a life in extravagance, no escape, is that the point?
