Ah, another movie with bikes, the staff of the angels of hell and Steve A-Lick him as the driver of the not so cool car. This movie does not depend on history, but on lots of drinking, marijuana and many idiotic acts. Steve's interpretation of a dying cat during his serenade "I love what I know" made me vomit for hours. Bike Linda (rrrr) chick makes out with everyone! Fats made the best performance since he just grunts and makes sounds. I also challenge you to try to understand what Banjo is saying. "You're messing with private stock." This is scriptwriting. <br /> <br /> I liked the ending. What better place to have the climax than a lighthouse! You have to see this to dislike it. <br /> <br /> DIE Jeter, DIE !!!
