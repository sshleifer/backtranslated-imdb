This is one of those movies that is so bad it's amazing !!! It has everything a movie of the eighties needs: long trousers, mustaches, girls with Farrah hair and, most important, NINJAS !!!! I have a few moments of choice to portray myself for you. Cole's army friend has a weird monkey-like face and always seems to talk without moving his chin. He gets his butt delivered to him over all the other scenes by the bad guys who want his land, so he gets drunk all through the movie. At one point his farmworkers finally return after being expelled by the hired gangster and Frank's henchmen, I think his name is Frank, he's so moved that he yells to the whole group "Let's have a fucking fight !!" and they all happily move to the farm's fighting area to start the festivities. This is funny on every possible level. If you dirty or literally still warm my heart. Another funny thing is the little grunts of Sho Kosugi and the animated moves of the ninja style. I remember this guy from when I was a kid and he used to say that he was the only real ninja in the world (he had ads in martial arts magazines) if I remember correctly. My friends and I were a little crazy ninja during the time that this movie came out and I remember seeing it at the local theater many times. I was wondering how I watched it on Starz last night because every American gangster guy always has a fortress in the Philippines and wears a white suit from Steve Martin. In fact, this guy goes way beyond that, requiring all thugs to wear white Steve Martin suits. There's a scene in which it looks like 20 Steve Martin impersonators are attacking a 1970s (Cole) Sears underwear model. As we end up for the final battle, Cole involuntarily invades the bandit's headquarters and is immediately sighted by a secretary who in turn alerts a guard who fires a round of his action shotgun not to 30 feet from the bad guys and no one seems to notice or Care. Cole, wearing a completely white ninja outfit, keeps sneaking up a staircase and then turns to the area where all the bandits are. The second in command tells him that he did not have to kill everyone as they were waiting, so he gave a ride to the bad guys in the huge Cock Fighting arena. Do not ask me why Cock Fighting is a big part of this movie, but it is. When they arrive, Cole is still wearing his ninja mask, although everyone involved knows what he looks like without him. The final battle is approaching, since Cole has killed everyone and now Sho, as I like to call him, reveals having kidnapped Cole's wife, also known as Frank's wife, and they find themselves in the fighting arena of sexiest cocks you've ever seen. Sho then, very politely, I must add, releases said lady and the battle is about to begin. They bow and begin to circle each other, both masked by the way. When they join in the battle, it seems that Cole becomes another person, intermittently, as "Finishing the Game," a fun parody to complete Bruce Lee's "Game of Death." Cole finally comes out on top, Kills Sho, who dies with honor to be beheaded and all is well. Next we see Cole, after ruining everyone's life is about to split the city again, but not before announcing the brutal death of a fat guy with a hooked hand and then inexplicably flashes at the camera, freeze frame , credits, done.
