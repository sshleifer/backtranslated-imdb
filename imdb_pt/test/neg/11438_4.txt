This movie was bad and the movies about how some college students stay in a house to get money by renovating it and then they find out that the house has a Deamon woman in it and that there is a portal to hell. A lot of stupid scenes like at the beginning of the movie, as they are cleaning the house and they start dancing a cheesy song and some of the Demons at the end of the movie are just some guys in bad clothes trying to make scary sounds and there are some good bloody scenes like when the Professor has his face torn. I only hired this movie because I'm a big fan of horror movies and its only value is to see if you're a fan of horror movies. The acting in this movie is very bad, the only good actor is Roy Scheider, from the great movie Jaws, and all through this movie there are lots of flaws and my rating is 4 out of 10.
