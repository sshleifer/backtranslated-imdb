This movie was pretentious, foppish and just down is not funny. The filming technique reminded me of MTV. I'm Hartley's fan. But what was he thinking? So much more thought could have come into this movie considering the subject. This could have been a real theoretical battle over good and evil, but Hartley seems to have used the support technique to drive out the viewer.
