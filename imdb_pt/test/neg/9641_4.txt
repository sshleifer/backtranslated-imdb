My mistake when thinking about it was a serious war movie is hell before I see it. This all ended in seconds in the movie when the "MTV" logo appeared. It could also have been called "Sexy-N-Loose" by the National Lampoon. And played for the audience of "MTV"; the film that followed the first comic seconds played like the video clips they used to play for over 40 years. At least Disney was smart enough to send their RatedR material to Touchtone and allowed us to take it seriously. Okay, I'm being tough. it was not that bad of a movie. However, it definitely has its share of overacting and the film is extremely biased / unilateral. Of course, I'm not a fan of war movies. I can not watch 'Platoon', 'Full Metal Jacket' or 'Saving Private Ryan' more than once. Of course they were good movies but they are not my forte and they all seem to mix after some time where I would not be able to distinguish one from the other. After a tour in Iraq, Phillippe plans life after the war, but is drawn back due to a clause in his contract. Or at least that's the plan of the military until it comes out of AWOL and the characters accelerate cross-country into a surprisingly few dollars never captured. No, I have not been to any war or Iraq, nor do I agree with that. I also do not have all the knowledge when it comes to recruiting or signing your contracts. I can say this: although I regret that you have returned to this conflict, I can not feel sorry for someone so stupid for not reading the fine print. It is as if someone on his deathbed were bending over to finally read the Surgeon General's warning in his cigarette box and said, "Oh, they are what? Mortals? I'll sue them!"
