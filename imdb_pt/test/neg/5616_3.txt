I at least was really hoping that this movie would be very good, maybe my expectations were a bit high, but the fact is I love Judd Nelson. In fact, it is the only reason why this movie is worth watching and its really not that good role. The main highlights of this film are bold sex scenes and boring dialogue. If these are the highlights, I'm sure you're getting a good idea of ​​what kind of movie that is. There is definitely a reason why this was made for the movies on television. Just watch this if you have nothing better to do on a Friday night or just enjoy spending money on video rentals. Save your time and rent The Breakfast Club!
