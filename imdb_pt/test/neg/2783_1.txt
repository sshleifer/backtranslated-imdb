This is one of those movies that you watch with a group of people. You will have the best time. It's very, very bad, like Bad Showgirls, but without the quality of Showgirls. <br /> <br /> You have the best mix of bad actors, bad director and bad script here. Anything that may be wrong can be a fun night, you have it here. The first to be the slogan is "a bunch of teenagers ..." These people are both "teenagers" and my grandmother. <br /> <br /> The director has no sense of suspense or tension. The 30-year-old "teens" are out there and the "monster" comes out and attacks and this happens practically throughout the movie when the monsters are revealed. There is no suspense building this, neither surprise nor anything. It's more like when you were kids pretending to be hunted by monsters and they just invented things as they were. And when I use the word "monsters" I exaggerate. More like a couple costumes in Halloween masks bought at the 99 cent store. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that this script was dismembered in a few days without rewriting and I can only imagine how poorly and poorly formatted looked on the page because it was clearly written by an amateur with no clue. It is another example of one of the bad things about this day and age: anyone can make a movie. <br /> <br /> But of course the best bad thing about this movie is acting. It's as bad as you can get. There is not one person who has the least ability to act and leadership is the absolute worst. It offers all the lines in that monotonous manner without any expression and you have to wonder how someone so bad could participate in any movie no matter who he knows. When he had to "cry" when his girlfriend was killed, it was one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Watching these people reciting some of the terrible dialogues is very funny. But when the nigger said "tell her ... tell her ... I love her ..." before her death scene, there was a huge chuckle in our group. Funny and funny things. <br /> <br /> My only hope is that this movie gets ratings bad enough to take its place where it belongs: in the lowest IMDb rating, 100 movies. We can do this, people! <br /> <br /> PS. It's a surprise that the only "great" review that this movie did here was from someone from Virginia (who has a comment, just about this movie and nothing more). And guess where the movie was made? Virginia. I've said it before and I'll say it again: the people working on the film SHOULD NOT be able to comment on it.
