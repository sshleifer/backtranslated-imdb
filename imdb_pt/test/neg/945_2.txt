this movie was absolutely horrible. most of the comedy scenes seem obsolete and banal, and possibly the funniest scene in the movie had already been seen in previews. The whole premise of the film is so unbelievable and ridiculous that it's hard to get into it. the actors themselves portray the most unrealistic characters. it's not just that the movies are so hard to swallow, but it's like they keep forcing you to fall into the throat expecting you to change and accept. the plot itself is so shallow and easy to predict. somehow the boy is rejected from all the schools in which he enrolled (I suppose he completely forgot to attend community college) and decides to create his own school for rejected classmates. all goes well for some time until the validity of your school is questioned. all the time the idiot character can convince his beautiful neighbor to fall in love with him with his witty sarcasm, which apparently is a skill that only he has. so comes the final fight with the students, somehow, all coming together and fighting for the survival of the school. it is clear that the lead character persuades the state board of education to allow his school to stay alive with some "inspirational" speech. This movie would have been more fun to watch if I was under 16 and still ignorant of all college issues and issues.
