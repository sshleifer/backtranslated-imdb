This peculiar and watchable film is the story of a deluded dentist who begins his mission or crusade to combat tooth decay on the back and beyond Patagonia. Coming from Northern Ireland via New Jersey, the main character, Fergus, views his crusade as a mission of great importance and addresses it with all the enthusiasm, vitality, discipline and attention to detail one would expect from a trained dentist. What increases joy as your grand plans unfold and gradually dissolve when he goes from disaster to disaster in the interior of Patagonia, the back of a personalized motorcycle or his mobile dental unit. We never get to know his wife, nor the rich philanthropist who is sponsoring the ill-fated mission, but, we get a solid showing of Lewis. Fans of her work will not be disappointed by her very convincing performance as the duped dentist who is gallantly adored by the innocent but sexy 18-year-old woman leading the ahem ride. <br /> /> This movie is not for everyone and I can understand why it was not pushed by the facts. It's a low budget movie, sometimes charming, always disarming, slightly entertaining and instantly forgettable, which sets with low expectations and almost succeeds.
