First of all, I would like to point a big middle finger at Troma's DVD distribution team, who was actually stupid enough to reveal the identity of the pivotal killer of the film on the back cover! The synopsis randomly mentions who the person responsible for the massacre is on graduation day, for God's sake! I do not care how terrible or predictable an 80s slasher might be; just mentioning who did it ruin the whole point! So, a word of advise in case you also buy the Double Troma containing "Graduation Day" and "Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell", no? repeat not? turn the box and read the back! Watching the movie is already a painful experience, but reading the back really would ruin everything. <br /> <br /> Now, what about the real movie? Oh boy! Personally, I'm a fan of Herb Freed's cinematic 'work'. Well, actually, I do not know if I should admire him or pity him! All of Herb's films are very bad and amateur, but at the same time you can tell that her direction is lively and full of good intentions! Unlike "Haunts" and "Beyond Evil," he followed a popular contemporary genre trend and tried to profit from typical high school horror movies. Just to offer a minimum of originality, all victims of "Graduation Day" are promising athletes and members of the same track of coach George Michaels (incredible name! I think Herb Freed is a fan of "Wham!"). During opening credits, we witnessed a young woman dying dramatically on the field moments after winning a 30-second run. The debate over whether the coach and teammates were not raising their physical boundaries is raised, but a particular individual takes a step further and begins to sadly kill everyone he considers responsible for Laura's death. What a crazy little movie! The script must be one of the most incoherent I have ever seen, with lots of fake clues and subplots going nowhere and death sequences that are almost too cheesy for words! There is a guy impaled by a soccer ball attached to a dart, others are beheaded with an absurdly large sword and the most miserable bastard of them all fall to the death in a bed disguised as thorns! Herb focuses on the ingenuity and fast pace of the killings, so much so that he totally forgets about the subplots he introduced earlier in the movie! For example, Laura's sister returns home from her military training and apparently initiates an investigation into the circumstances of her death. In the middle of the film, however, his character hardly appears in the film. In addition, the stepfather of the girls is referred to as a violent drunkard, but this interesting given is immediately ignored as well. Instead of carefully mounted suspense and fake red rings, we are served disco dance sequences and skating and ?? clear ?? countless images of unattractive 80's girls taking off their blouses. Despite being very bad, "Graduation Day" had a respectable cast! Christopher George ("Grizzly," "City of the Living Dead") starred heavily when demanding trainer Carmen Argenziano ("When a Stranger Invites") briefly appears as a detective investigating the growing number of missing teenagers and Michael Pataki ("Dead & Buried", "Dog of Dracula") has a very entertaining part as the school's stressed director. The adolescent beauties on duty include Linnea Quigley and Vanna White. Heck, for some horror fans, the presence of these two girls is already reason enough to count "Graduation Day" among the most exquisite slashers of the early 80's. It's a stupid movie, but entertainment and laughter are guaranteed!
