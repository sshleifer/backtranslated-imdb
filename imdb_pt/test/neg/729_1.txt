Usually, when I do not see a show in an original race, I meet it later on the cable and realize it's a gem. The "Gimore Girls" is one of those rare exceptions. I'm glad I lost. <br /> <br /> I really disdain shows that it fills every minute of the actors space with incoherent, stupid and boring jokes. This is just an hour. The mother, Lorelei, made me wonder if she's bipolar and out of lithium. She never stopped talking; every minute, every second, talking to everyone she interacted with. Worse still, his speech is childlike and muuuuito like, Valley Girl. She talked about the boys, her hair, her mother, her clothes. Like, what's the sitch? (for the situation). I've watched this show three times and still do not understand the purpose of this series. It's not a comedy, it's not a drama, it does not make sense except to make three generations of women in a family look like the "Girls" on Planet Mars. The males, by comparison, are smart and make the show a little watchable. If Lorelei existed and tried to cling to me with conversation, I would have to make her get rid of her. She obviously does not know how to give a subtle hint to stop talking and start listening to someone else. She also does not know how to really perceive the existence of others. <br /> <br /> In a show, Lorelei comes home from a date near 10 at night. She got the date after chasing a guy she met at an auction. She enters her daughter's room, where her daughter asks how she went. She talks about how boring the guy was. His meeting somehow got some words. Lorelei complained about how the man did not stop talking (choking). I hope the date has learned how lucky he was. <br /> <br /> Another person here commented on how the mother acts like a teenager and the daughter is the adult personality. Lorelei even dresses as her daughter. This obviously in her 40s mother dresses up and looks like she hit the mall with her high school friends in tow. <br /> <br /> I thought this show should have been followed by "Just Shoot Me," because that's exactly how I felt.
