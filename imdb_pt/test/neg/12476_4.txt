I was surprised by the enthusiastic response to this movie. It seemed tedious to me as much as I liked to look at Penelope Cruz, and the details of the plot often barely worked. It also seemed to be an intensely sexist film: if gender roles were reversed, almost everyone with any sense would sit idly by complaining that the film is intensely misogynist. It is not only that both main men are portrayed as complete idiots and sexual predators, but also that women are portrayed as almost perfect, forming a utopian community that has no conflict of any kind and is based on relentless generosity and good humor. Utopias are notoriously tedious and this is no exception. But it is also interesting to note what happens (and here comes the draw of the plot, although it refers to a very precocious scene) when the teenage daughter kills her father. (1) Her mother runs to take responsibility for her and (2) the daughter seems to suffer almost no remorse (and, in fact, her emotional life disappears from the film). It is not exactly a glorified murder, though Aldomovar's camera persists in the blood in a bloodthirsty manner, as if making an attractive painting, and then becomes soaked and out of sight without bleeding either the daughter or the mother, neither materially nor emotionally. Later, the film reveals another murder, again by a woman of a man, and again it is a murder that the film implicitly endorses. In short, Volver is an ideologically directed film with an unpleasant and indeed disgusting ideology, and so I write an ideological critique. But, besides, it's not very interesting. It does not have the depth of, say, Aldomovar's speech to her, which I loved.
