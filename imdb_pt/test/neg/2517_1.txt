Luchino Visconti, the artist with the sword. Courage must be the first word associated with all your work. Movie. Theater. Music. Revolutions, artistic, cultural, personal. A legacy with powerful consequences and endless ramifications. He introduced neorealism through the work of an American novelist James Cain in "Ossesione". He gave Anna Magnani the most extraordinarily beautiful closes of his career. He gave us Alain Delon and Maria Callas. But the last word about his life and work rests on the talents of a certain Adam Low and the voice of Helmut Berger. What a terrible fate. <br /> <br /> For those interested, there is a 61-minute documentary by director Carlo Lizzani (a man who really knew Visconti) entitled LUCHINO VISCONTI A PORTRAIT. It's on DVD distributed by Image Entertainment
