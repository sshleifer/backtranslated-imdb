Jessica is a young, virgin, and very innocent girl who lives with her aunt on a remote ranch. Jessica is also a powerful psychic, capable of diving, retro-cognition, precognition and esp. When young and handsome Gordon Hawthorne comes to visit him, he is instantly skeptical of Jessica's powers ... until her abilities reveal a lost wristwatch and uncover an old treasure chest. However, the treasure chest contains the severed head of a secular Satanist named Gideon Drew, whose powers are far stronger than those of Jessica. Despite his warnings about evil among them, Drew mentally enslaves everyone to make eye contact with him. But Drew wants more from Jessica. He needs his radesthesia skills to dig up his body, so that he can rise from the dead and dominate the human race. Will Jessica's powerful fleur-de-lis, combined with Gordon's love, drive away the old evil before it can destroy them all? <br /> <br /> This is not a very interesting movie. It certainly could have been - the basic story is interesting and imaginative, but the acting is heavy and the whole thing moves very slowly to maintain interest. Jessica is also too innocent - almost annoyingly, and Gordon, her love interest, is wooden, hard and totally unemotional. Neither character is very friendly and the low budget is painfully obvious. A hasty end does not help either. Avoid, unless it is the MST3K version.
