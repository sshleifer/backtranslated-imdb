Okay, we have a movie that some are calling one of the best movies of all time ... but I'm sitting here thinking about hell !, the sux stories (there is no story), the diolouge is quite simple, artistic, nothing good! , and the acting is not at all real standing up, so if you want to pretend to be artistic, say you like it, but if you have a real vision, say you do not like it or you explained why!
