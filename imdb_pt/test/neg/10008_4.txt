Rich farmers in Buenos Aires have a long-standing non-marketing policy with the Crawfords in Manhattan, but what happens when the Latin son of a mustache falls by a certain Crawford with bright eyes, blond hair and gay moves on the dance floor? The 20th Century-Fox musical has a glossy varnish, but looks a bit outdated on the edges. It is very heavy in the frenzied dance and gymnastics, extremely fine in history. Betty Grable (an eleventh-hour replacement for Alice Faye) gives a boost, even if she's paired with lead Don Ameche (in tan makeup and straight hair). Also good: Charlotte Greenwood as Betty's aunt, a limousine driver who is constantly sleeping at work, and Carmen Miranda making herself (who else?). The stock footage of Argentina far outweighs the action filmed on Fox's backlot, and some of the supporting performances are horrible. By the time of the end of the great horse race, most viewers would have had enough. * 1/2 of ****
