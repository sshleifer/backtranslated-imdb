They said it would be a bigger movie than Turks Fruit. How dare you <br /> <br /> them? It's not even 10% of that classic. Bad performance. The only character I felt sympathy was the one played by Angela Schijf. His performance was the best in the entire film. The story could have been interesting, but it was not. Some scenes were very beautifully filmed (lights and camera), (the opening scene for example), but the bad acting made the magic disappear <br /> <br /> I really do not understand why so many people voted this movie so good <br /> <br />.
