Jacqueline Hyde begins as any other normal day for individual telemarketers Jackie Hyde (co-producer Gabriella Hall) until her boss (Robert Donovan) dismisses her for personal phone calls at work, however, not all of them are bad news. lawyer reporting that his grandfather (Malcolm Bennett) died recently and that he left his mansion and fortune (why such things never happen to me? Sigh). Very excited, Jackie heads there and leaves at home while looking for the thermostat late at night. Jackie comes across a secret room where her grandfather holds the bright red formula he invented that allows anyone who drinks to change their appearance. Being a bit on the crappy side, Jackie finally fits into the glamorous Jacqueline (Blythe Metz), however, Jackie's alter ego begins to take over ... Written, co-produced and directed by Rolfe Kanefsky I thought Jacqueline Hyde was complete and total crap from beginning to end and it's as simple and straightforward as that. According to the opening credits, Jacqueline Hyde was "inspired" by Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," frankly, if Mr. Stevenson could see what was being done in his story here he turn into his grave. To begin with, I think Jacqueline Hyde was / meant to be a horror movie, IMDb certainly describes him as such, but there's no horror in that, except how bad he is. I would say that Jacqueline Hyde is more of a soft-core porn than anything else and extremely docile with it, why sit back and watch it smoother than a soft porn crap when you can watch hard-core things that actually deliver the goods ? Why, that's the question I ask here. It's not even a good porn, besides being very soft, it's boring, boring and the sex scenes that are not worth it are few. The cleverest aspect of this film is the title that would have been quite clever, were it not for the fact that another film used the title of Jacqueline Hyde (1998) over the last century and, judging by the IMDb plot summary, sounds a lot better than this piece of crap. This is one of those movies that you have to watch yourself to see how bad it is, but just hope you never get the chance. Director Kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget, but that's no excuse. Currently filmed on a digital camcorder, the film looks cheap and the few instances of CGI seem to have come from a Nintendo Gameboy, the 'shocking' finishing touch probably has the worst metamorphosis effect I've ever seen and it's pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when Jackie's breasts grow through the most terrible CGI. That's another thing, the film takes itself very seriously. The subject is a drug, it's very predictable and contributes to a bad movie, but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk, the movie might have been more fun to watch, unfortunately it's not like that. Forget any decent horror, violence or violence, for there is nothing more than a beheading surprisingly no bloodshed in the end. <br /> <br /> Technically, Jacqueline Hyde is a home-made movie, photography is boring. With point & shoot variety, music, production design and special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script. The acting was horrible, seriously, this is bad. Jacqueline Hyde, in my opinion, a lot of crap, there is not a positive thing about this turgid film that I can think of. Any suitable movie lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap, definitely one to avoid.
