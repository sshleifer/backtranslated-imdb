This movie looked like it was mounted very quickly on both plot and plot. My two daughters were ready to go 30 minutes before the end of the movie, which rarely happens when we go to theaters. This was a Nickelodeon production and would have been better if they had released on the t.v. station. The animation itself in some parts was o.k. but the plot was horrible. A classic tale of a child trying to meet a parent's expectations is used in many children's films, but the animation or graphics need to be really good for keeping the child's attention. This was not the case with this movie. There were also strange elements between the male protagonist and the female protagonist that the plot could have done without.
