Disney's "Snowball Express" is not as dated as some of its products at this time. There are no hippies or hot-rodders, only Dean Jones inheriting a ruined hotel / ski resort from a deceased relative. When Jones and his family walk into a quiet town in Colorado, the guys who give them directions - looking like extras from "Deliverance" - are curiously vague about the hotel (hopefully it looks like a shed in a room), but actually the accommodations are very enjoyable. Jones' teenage daughter has a sour look on her face (which does not stop one of the local yahoos from looking at her), and of course the clumsy Dean Jones is a stumble-down on the slopes, leading to many falls. in the mud. Perhaps this scenario may have benefited from some magical whim, as this script is rigid and frozen. * in ****
