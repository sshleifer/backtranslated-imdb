Business executive is kidnapped, made to wander miles and miles in a forest for days and days exchanging dialogue with his hijacker. And we have to listen to all the nonsense ...... Meanwhile, Arrogant wife and family are at home with the FBI asking what to do ...... ..... at no time does she seem preoccupied with her husband's fate except when it comes to ransom ..... A love story "Give me some time!" The plot is ridiculous. all the scenes are filled with an air of expectation that something significant will happen but it never happens. The result of the kidnapping is predictable and stupid, and it becomes even more silly when we learn. of the hijacker. <br /> <br /> That's rubbish: <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
