My jaw dropped so many times watching this movie, I have bruises. Okay, granted, I really was not expecting the quality of, say, the Others or even Thirteen Ghosts (the new one, which was just terrible and still head and shoulders above that insanity). Someone noticed the fine characters ... I would not call them "skinny". "Fine" implies that there may be something for them. How almost nonexistent? In no particular order, we have: The girl who will scream; The American who will discover all this; The macho guy who will only bull through it all until he is killed: the wise black man who is going to die early; The extra guy who's there to die first; The extra woman who is there to play hard. That's it. This is their list of characters and that is what they are and what they remain from beginning to end. If they were "thin", they could at least change a little from start to finish. But they did not. Well, okay, the American guy decides he's going to stick with the fieldwork at the end and the Screaming Girl goes back to wherever she came from. This is change. Other than that, they all act on their assigned roles and rarely demonstrate any real emotion when they finally find the threat. <br /> <br /> Now, producers rely on an original threat, I'll say. I had understood that the story would be "Tremors", but with ants instead of giant worms. I give credit to the writer: they are very nice ants, very scary and what they do with the bones is excellent. (The first time the "bone thief" appears, I admit I jumped a few feet). Unfortunately, the very cool concept becomes Alien in the Desert very quickly. We have received many comments about ants that may or may not be true, but we do not understand much of the mythology on which the threat is based. And we have all the cliches of monster movies already made. People enter places they know they should not and when they do not have a compelling reason for it. Moronic characters try to stop our heroes and die for it. A character does double duty as "scientist who does not want to kill the monster, but study it". A Very Cool Gadget is presented just so the American can tell everyone something about ants that, I hope everyone will know anyway. Then the gadget is broken. Our heroes are left without the only thing that can keep the threat at bay. And then there's that final, annoying moment when we know the threat is still with us-and we wonder exactly what and how the hero or heroine came for it. That makes everything that was once so useless and false. <br /> <br /> Three stars for the cool use of ants and bones. Nothing for clich√©s, awkward dialogues and obscure characters.
