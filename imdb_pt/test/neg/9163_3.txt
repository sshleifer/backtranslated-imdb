When I finally got to see this movie recently, it turned out to be exactly what it seemed to me at first glance ... plus a CG / live-action review of Hollywood from an established cartoon franchise. Nothing special or memorable. Designed in every way possible to attract very young children and very immature adults, making heavy use of comedic devices like farts, poop and Theodore's butt size. <br /> <br /> This movie would bother me a lot less if it was not such an obvious step for the Chipmunks. Even the characters I encountered have been changed for the worse for this movie. While in the past each of them had a very distinct personality, here they all behaved like immature and intelligent children with ADD, constantly jumping erratically from the walls. Especially it bothered me to see Simon portrayed that way ... He should be the smart, serious nerd who acts like the "straight man" with Alvin's crazy antics. But here it's practically a copy of Alvin. A joke in the movie even implies that Simon just * thinks * he's clever but actually is not ... and honestly, if I had never heard of the Chipmunks before seeing this movie, I would have agreed. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie is just another obvious cash-grab, and I'm more than a little sorry to have been made. The fact of being a "child" movie does not excuse its flaws ... To excuse a stupid movie that degrades a classic franchise just because it is for children is an insult to children, and any child deserves something smarter than this movie.
