I'm sure the people who made this film think they're doing something wonderfully politically correct because they can criticize the US wars in Afghanistan and particularly Iraq, suggesting that the US does the war well, but then they do not clean, the seeds for future problems. Moreover, they do so without making Islamists the enemy, and without making the Republicans the enemy, since it is the Republicans who are in power and are doing this supposedly great thing, overthrowing the USSR by secretly providing a war in Afghanistan. <br /> But seriously now. . . Do we really want a movie that says repeatedly "let's kill some Russians!" How is this the biggest thing a red-blooded American can do? And should we find this congressman adorable because he surrounds himself with women with big hair and revealing clothes? Even his supposedly intelligent assistant, who is always professionally dressed, keeps looking at Charlie as if he were just the most wonderful, the most beautiful, and the most wonderful guy ever. Like she was Nancy Reagan to her Ronnie. Julia Roberts does a good job in her role, but basically women are really humiliated in this movie, and that was pretty annoying.
