For starters, I'm not a movie reviewer I have not seen, nor am I a film-maker when they do not deserve it. This movie was really that bad. The basic plot was extremely stereotyped and, although not great, the plot deserved about 5. The part that really bothered me was anything referring to swimming in the film. I've compiled a short list of things wrong with the swimming aspects of this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. No character development 2. No sense of time. 3. Completely inaccurate swimming scenarios, which include: a. A team of six swimmers going for something called "National" and "Regional", no mention of how they qualify. B. That same team going to hell with that encounter was no real swim at any point in the movie. W. The rival program ceases to be a secondary school for a club team back to a high school and then to a club team again. d. In the scene where Ellis is interviewing for a job, the banners show high school wins and placements at the nationals, but the team consists of 5 to 12 swimmers, depending on which of the 3 encounters are going on. and. A team of 5 boys and a girl wins nationals / regions. f. Said girl wins an event of 100 men butterfly. g. In this race, the girl beats two guys from a team that the previous year was in the top 3 of the country. H. The announcer changes a race from 200 to 100 for the 200 again in the space of 45 seconds. Me. In the final relay, the 4X100, which is being swum in a 50 meter pool, a swimmer is seen doing two maneuvers. j. In this same relay, teams anchor the swimmer and leave the blocks, sparking an inspiring conversation that lasts about two and a half minutes, or about three times as much as the leg would take in a national match. k. The film starts in the month of July or August, assuming that Ellis was applying before the start of the school year, and the pool should be closed in 3 months, so assuming these things are true, swimmers will no longer be able to swim to win national / regional, in less than two, since the pool had to be cleaned and the kids did not start practicing for a while. I. I'm sure there are a few more hundreds, I'm just trying to block them from my memory. 4. Throughout the film there is not a single mention of a swimmer's time. 5. If you are going to make a movie about swimming, it would be a good idea to hire extras that can swim well. 6. The scene where the child is kicked underwater is physically impossible. That said, all the swimming scenes were too slow, the swimmers had horrible techniques and the idea of ​​being able to qualify for a national meeting within three months of learning to swim is just an insult kindly everywhere. <br /> <br /> OK, if you still do not believe me, let me tell you that this movie is one of the 5 worst movies I have ever seen, and this is coming from the guy who owns Gigli, Soul Plane, Hands: The Hands of Fate, Skullduggery, and any other piece of crap that was put into the film. Please, do not go!
