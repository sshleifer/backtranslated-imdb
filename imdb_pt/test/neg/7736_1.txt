The hero's message is very clear: the idea of ​​Greater China is more important than the death and suffering of millions. At a time when China is hanging its war toys on Taiwan, it is unacceptable for Western viewers to endorse this overproduced, government-sponsored and dogmatic garbage. <br /> <br /> Particularly surprising is the promotion of this theme. movie by the liberal media. Roger Ebert, Chicago Tribune, David Edelstein, Slate, Charles Taylor, the Salon, and many others wholeheartedly supported Hero. In doing so, they implicitly legitimized their reactionary political message. The only critic (who I know) who saw through the brilliant facade of the film was J. Hoberman of The Village Voice, who wrote about the film's "hypocritical traditionalism" and its "glorification of relentless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of the national greatness." I, for example, sign my name under Hoberman's final pronouncement: the hero is nothing more than "fascinating fascism."
