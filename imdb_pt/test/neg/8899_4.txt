Another film from the Swedish country hickory, which is always the northern part. If blacks were shown that way, there would be screams about racism and for good reason. <br /> <br /> This is a scam and you should laugh at the "smart" farce cliches. But it's mostly tiring. A gangster comedy, with the bad Russians (as always) and the bad (and stupid) Finns. And the stupidest of all is, of course, the Norwegian, according to Stockholm's prejudice. <br /> <br /> Andreas Wilson is the only one who tries to make a performance that reminds us of reality. This is not funny. This is neither exciting. A very crude burlesque to make you interested in some way.
