Oh my God, this is so stupid. Completely useless, offensive and repulsive. Why writers have such a big problem in actually joining Zoey and Chase, we all love them too! in normal shows, there's really more of a plot conflict in the show, wow, what a concept. Also, you can not even differentiate episodes from Zoey 101, because the same thing happens every time. Quinn explores Dustin for something weird, Nicole is giggling and stupid, Zoey kind of goes there, Chase drooling after her all the time, but she does not surprisingly notice, and Logan is an idiot. repeat.

It's like a bottle of shampoo. and at the end of the movie, omg again. so useless NOTHING HAPPENS. it's like they designed it specifically so the movie could fit between two episodes of the show and the show would be completely unchanged after the movie's plot.
