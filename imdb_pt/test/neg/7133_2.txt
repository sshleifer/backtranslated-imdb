People may say that I am severe, but I can not help it. The movie is so bad that I was absolutely shocked. The first movie was bad enough if you ask me. It was very exaggerated and silly, but this, despite the scary scenes, has a very stupid story. They actually investigated Kayako's past and discovered that she had a mother (who miraculously speaks English) who was an exorcist and "fed" evil spirits to her daughter. Stupid? Yeap. OK, it started with Kayako, who was an ordinary housewife who had an affair with some guy and killed herself. This part is still OK. Because of this moment of anger, she has become a vengeful spirit that kills anyone who enters her home. Acceptable. Now her murders began to stretch a bit where she actually had the opportunity to travel all over Tokyo just to finish off her victims. (His victims were traveling, were not they?) It hit me hard. Now, if a ghost could really do such a thing as travel the country without paying the fares for public transportation, I would not mind being. Ask someone to come and kill me then. And to crown it all, the ghost that was once described as very vindictive (In Ju-on: The Grudge, which was so much better than this garbage) is now portrayed as a ghost who really has fun and felt it's his mission to people. Things got worse (for me, the viewer) when the ghost turned into big hair strands. I mean, ??? If a ghost had such power, I would seriously care to be one. I've never really liked movies portraying ghosts like MONSTERS because they are not. The overall results are simply bad. Like The Grudge 2. With a better plot and less exaggeration, this show would have been better
