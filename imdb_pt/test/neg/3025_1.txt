Good Lord. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you right away, I only watched 20 minutes of this movie. As I'm a hardcore fan of Eraserhead, the "what, you can not watch a strange black and white movie with little or no dialogues?" defense does not apply. I just can not watch terrible black and white movies with little or no dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie is what happens when you give an anguished gothic child with no talent and nothing to say a camera. and budget, and let it put as much offensive images on the screen as possible. It was clear from the outset that this movie should have been 5 minutes long (assuming it should exist). Shots that should last for a few seconds creep by minutes because the director has "I-just-love-the-sound-of-my-voice" syndrome, and refuses to cut into another shot until all the footage has been seen . From the moment the mask girl began masturbating the corpse of "God" (the opening scene of the movie! Joy!), I knew it was only a matter of time before I turned the tape off. After at least ten minutes of a different corpse being pulled, twisting, on a rope, by a gang of mysterious cloaked men, I knew it was time to quit. I rarely give up a movie. I sat all over Blair Witch 2: Book Of Shadows, though not fortunately. That does not deserve the 20 minutes I gave him. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Eraserhead, DO NOT let simplistic comparisons with the film involve you in renting this piece of amateur garbage. Allow me to direct you to Tetsuo: The Iron Man, for a piece of incoherent oddity in black and white.
