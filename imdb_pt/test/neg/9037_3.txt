Another movie that makes the history of the Beach Boys worse than it is. I especially remember the scene where Brian says he must leave the tour and the other Boys call him a traitor. I did not happen like that, and as the movie indicates at the beginning is that some scenes are over-reacted. A movie about The Beach Boys does not have to be that way because a lot of things happened anyway. The sad thing is that this movie gives the wrong image about the boys to those who are not so familiar with the group. Hard-core fans like me knew this is not the whole truth story and that's why I gave it a low rating 3. However, it's the best movie about The Beach Boys I've seen so far, which tells a bit about the other movies. If you want the truth I recommend the documentary Endless Harmony.
