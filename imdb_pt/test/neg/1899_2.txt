What a frustrating movie. A small southern town is overflowing with possibilities to explore the complexities of interpersonal and obscure and shadowy relationships hidden under placid surfaces, as anyone who has read anything Carson McCullers already knows. That does not do any of that. Instead, writers were content with cutesy gifts, cheap cheap fuzzies and banal melodrama. The thing looks like a movie made for TV, and it was directed with no particular distinction, but it's hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this stuff interesting. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating aspect though is the fact that there are many extremely competent and attractive actors in this cast, all trying to do their best and doing what they can with it - well, there is no other word for say - nonsense. A tragic waste of talent, in particular that of the great Stockard Channing.
