Oh my gosh! Beeb has reached a new level with this policy-correcting act, a mixed race family living in Birmingham with a poorly played child. Whoever ordered this stuff should be hunted and thrown to the dogs. The normally funny Jasper Carrott is as funny as he is in this show and does not get me started on the others. They have the timing and subtlety of a nuclear bomb. I just hope the comedy gets better, but with the likes of Little Britain and Catherine Tate, I doubt that much. I think you'd better get the box set for a decent comedy from the past like Fawlty Towers or Bottom if you want to laugh. <br /> <br /> BAN THIS SQUEAKY CLEAN LITTLE!
