I've seen Ed Wood's biopic for many years. Tim Burton paid tribute to this incredibly talented but nevertheless enthusiastic filmmaker. <br /> <br /> So I saw Plan 9 and it really tickled me to the end. A silly story with bad production values ​​but still fun and even funny. <br /> <br /> So this. What can you do about it? Well, since Wood was reported as a cross-dresser, it's amazing to see a movie that handles this as a cartoon. Yes, there are some stabs in teaching the public something about the subject, but for the most part it's a really distorted kind of self-parody. <br /> <br /> One of the problems is that it has a hundred points of view. On the one hand, it is an appeal to tolerance. Another portrays transvestism as a disease. And finally, tell the audience, "Okay, if you're shocked now, then wait until you see this!" The problem must have been that Wood had to make a commitment for the film to be made. You can almost feel it when you see the opening title of the producer: personally supervised by ... So where are we. This is not a serious subject film or a complete schocker. <br /> <br /> The value of entertainment is virtually nil. The wooden voice is slightly amused, but only because it sounds so misdirected. This was done in the 1950s, but one could argue that it was brave to make a movie that even mentioned the word transvestites. It all comes down to what the film itself is trying to defend. Schock. The rape scene, while light, exists simply to do this. <br /> <br /> So sorry. This is a misfire, but the discredit is not just Wood's.
