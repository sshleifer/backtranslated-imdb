I first saw a poster advertising this movie on a Helsinki street in Finland in June 2000. What struck me was the proud proclamation that warned all readers that the film, although French, had been "Banished in France". On my way back home in New York I discovered that one of the city's "Art House" theaters was showing the film, and so (with my Finnish bride) I decided to see the reason for all this fuss. Dude, we ever did. <br /> <br /> From the comments I read here, and from the reviews, I knew the film was violent and sexually explicit. Not necessarily offended by any of these two conditions, I went with an open mind to see what had upset the sensibilities of our Gauls cousins. Presumably, as anyone reading this will know, the story involves two women embarking on a crime and a series of murders in France (the film has English subtitles). The resemblance to "Thelma and Louise", however, ends with this; sex is unusually graphic (and in abundant supply), as is violence (very treading to death, and much blood and other organic matter splashing after the impact of bullets). <br /> <br /> On an intellectual level, one could argue that the essence of the film is the relationship between sex and violence (manifested by the only sex these women know: one is a small prostitute and the other one wins When they, during their fall into crime and murder, dominate their sexual situations, they react only with the same violence and brutality that they themselves know and understand. It is important to note, however, that the victims of her turmoil are not just scary men interested in scary sex (of whom there are several), but innocent bystanders, a woman in an ATM, for example, too. I really understand why the repeated "porn movie" footage was all that was needed (except to describe physical contact as cruel, non-passive, and downcast) and the relentless gore became quite tedious after the first spasms. olentos. It is a crude and crude film, but in fact, it is with gross and crude people and equally unpleasant circumstances. From one point of view, the lives of French subclasses are exploited, and it is rather bleak; a travel diary for France, it definitely is not, perhaps that is why the French forbade it. <br /> <br />
