This is a fun movie. I suggest you rent it, buy a few gallons of rum and invite the whole team to this. My favorite parts were 1. the shootings that were so well choreographed that John Woo himself was jealous, .2. The wonderful special effects. the Academy Award winning performance and .4. The fact that all the gangsters in the movie seemed to be making a bad representation of "Scarface". I mean, Master P as a Cuban godfather! This is an innovative territory. And with well-written dialogue, including lines like "the only difference between you and me Rich, is that I'm alive and your dead", this movie is truly a masterpiece. Okay, right.
