Anyone watching this movie will notice that the makers have played a lot of money in this movie. It's interesting that they call it "The Hole"! The production values ​​are good for a short film. The hole tries to look great and does budget in some way, but is hampered by the video format in which it was filmed. I speculate if this was made in 35mm, it would be awesome and would slightly raise the content. Many Hollywood movies look good and that is enough for an audience independent of history and content. <br /> <br /> My honest opinion, 3 out of 10 for that effort. Maybe Ishimoto's next movie is on display.
