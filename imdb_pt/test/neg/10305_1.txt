The first season was great - good mix of work and brother and friends at home. was really a very funny show. <br /> <br /> Now he appears again and the brother and the two hotties are gone - and the whole thing revolves around the airline. Even the old man who ran the company fell - far above the limit, where before it was perfect. <br /> <br /> That's just Sarah Mason - one of Hollywood's most beautiful girls. /> <br /> This is what happens when you let some executives get their hands on a show. You can almost see the meeting. "The old man is funny, let him focus on it, get him over it, and do everything about the airline ... it will be a crazy version of the office!" Anyway, no hot, no clock.
