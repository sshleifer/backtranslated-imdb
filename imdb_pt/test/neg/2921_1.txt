I'm thinking of some things for this movie: First, it's really a really bad movie. That's really "Superbad." The film looked very promising in the trailers, but fell flat ... Maybe the original idea was good, but between a bad script and a bad performance the film became boring and empty. My advice is do not miss 2 hours of your precious time. You have been warned. This is the first movie I rated 1 star on the IMDb ... Second, none of the characters are nice. You really do not care what happened to them ... Third, the villain is very easy to identify. The grandson kills the father, sodomizes the friend's son, impregnates the maid, suffocates the grandfather ... As JT says: "If you like evil without retribution, this is your movie". Nothing more to say...
