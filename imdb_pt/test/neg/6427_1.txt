Wow, what a bad movie. It is not scary, and hardly understandable. The plot does not fit, and the acting is absolutely terrible. What is the line of a famous critic? "She runs the emotional range from A to B." Yes. That sums it all up. Not even good for the value of the camp! I was not expecting Oscar material, but this? And is her friend a ghost? You would have to have mollusc IQ particularly stupid not to see that coming. <br /> <br /> This movie (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the audience that goes to the movies. If only someone involved with him could tie the narrative! This results in 1 out of 10, simply because there is nothing less. On the positive side - at least not two full hours.
