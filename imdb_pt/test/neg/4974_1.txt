I started watching this because I was looking for a background comedy for my Sunday morning. So I noticed that this would be a road-movie and I decided to watch it. <br /> <br /> The first 15 minutes were terrible, but I wanted to take a chance because I never judge a movie. without watching it completely. Then things began to improve a little bit. That sounded like a good road-movie about friendship ... But then the movie started to get horrible and predictable, and by the time the movie ended, you felt like you wasted your time. Does that have anything to say? Why did they make a movie like that? And I was not expecting a modern Citizen Kane, but still, I have several ideas on how that movie could have been improved. <br /> <br /> So take my advice; leave it alone and watch a real road-movie. There are many of these. I will not make the directors of these films look bad by putting their names on this review. <br /> <br /> 1/10
