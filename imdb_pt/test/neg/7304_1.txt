This has to be the biggest joke ever. I'm surprised that all the other actors kept a serious face. I may be wrong, but the impression I had of this movie was that they tricked Frank Stallone and Joe Estevez into acting in that movie that has a budget of just under $ 40 depending on how much nerf bats and painted spray equipment cost , the most incoherent movie ever created, and sit back and laugh at the fact that Joe Estevez and Frank Stallone were not kidding. <br /> <br /> If by chance they were not kidding and legitimately tried to make a real movie, I'm sorry for all involved in the creation. I had a big love affair with cheese movies, but this movie is so bad I can barely watch it. They repeat useless "special effects" so often that it's obvious they were just trying to cover up the fact that they only recorded 30 minutes of footage. If I were forced to watch this movie repeatedly, I would be unconscious with my own hands after one and a half. No offense to the great Frank Stallone, but I'd rather watch Sylvester teaching a fingerpainting class for 10 hours than watching that movie again.
