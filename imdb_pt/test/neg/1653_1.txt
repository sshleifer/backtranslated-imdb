It tells a lot about the UK when such television shows are not only made but are also displayed in three series. Unfunny, politically correct to the point of becoming ill and badly acted and written. Meera Syal was not funny or accomplished anything she did, keep telling me I'm wrong, and Jasper Carrott, the funny guy as he is, is past the early eighties. This is such a bad comedy that could have been made by ITV, but even people like The Upper Hand and the one who had James Bolam as a parking attendant looked like Fawlty Towers compared to this junk. I would love to sit down with the writer / director of this program so they can point the mood in this program. Admittedly the majority of the UK population is made up of uneducated pine cones, but this would not tickle your funny bones. That's if they could get away from Big Brother or their cell phones, but that's another story. Complete and absolute dirt!
