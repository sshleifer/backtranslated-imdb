Watching this movie really surprised me. I've never met to stop watching a movie in its entirety because 3 dollars to rent a movie is a good amount of money and damn, I should at least watch the whole thing and get my money's worth. I did it in about 30 minutes of this absolutely bad movie when I thought to myself, now I'm a little dumber after watching this movie. I can not believe that the director and the actors in this movie actually had so little respect for themselves to allow it to be released! There is nothing I can say that has not been said by the other critics, but even in the worst films there are usually one or two decent performances ... not in this pathetic garbage. I've seen better acting in high school plays. Each, and I mean that every "actor" is evil beyond belief, and what is truly amazing is the uniformity of evilness ... dammit, must have been the director. Where did they get these people? <br /> <br /> This is possibly one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. Although entertaining in some places because of its laughable script and even its weakest acting, and I use that term very loosely, it is unfortunate that this movie has not been consigned to the hell of movie B for all eternity. What could have been a good idea was ruined by an ultra-low budget, sound and bad effects and actors who probably gained their wings on children's television and poor children's television. <br /> <br /> Please stay away from this movie. Not worth a minute of your time.
