(Spoilers) "Cash Crop" is something like that. Farmers who do not give luck cultivate marijuana to survive. DEA agent explodes in the city. Farmers hide the pot. The DEA agent leaves the city. History end. This film features solid performances from some second-level actors, mediocre directing and a script more or less ... but it has no history. And since history is the basis of every drama, "Cash Crop" is an absolute failure. Very annoying to recommend.
