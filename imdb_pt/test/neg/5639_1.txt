While I hear my parents watching (after I've given up 10 minutes on the movie), they have no idea what's going on. When "Charles Dickens" looked at the camera, I kind of expected him to turn into a demon (yes, he looked like one). Unfortunately, this did not happen. <br /> <br /> This film had several reasons why I did not finish: one, it was unbearably slow. I mean, seriously, it was SLOWW. You can only understand 10% of what is said, and the characters were poorly introduced. <br /> <br /> If you have an English accent and like a lot of talk, no action, terrible acting, cheesy laughs and the same music / sound effects played over and over again, then this is the movie for you ... <br /> <br /> 1/10 - completely horrible. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
