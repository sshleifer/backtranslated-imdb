I am a regular reader of Kathy Reichs' novels, Temperance Brennan. As such, I am extremely surprised that she consulted this program. <br /> <br /> It's HORRIBLE compared to the books. The character Temperance Brennan is, in the books, a land of low to recover the alcoholic mother and divorced of a daughter of a college. In 'Bones', she is an arrogant (rhyming with rich), which, in the typical fashion of the PC, is not a mother. The emphasis on his team of assistants, complete with shocking details of who has had so many sexual exploits, is totally in stark contrast to the books. <br /> <br /> In total deference to the PC movement, it portrays the group's enemies. USA as peace lovers (!). Some of the information is not correct, for example, having a character from Afghanistan as an active member of an Arab-American friendship group. Since when is an Afghan an Arab?! I am sure that if negative references were made to 'disadvantaged minorities', or women, or GLBT's, the series producers / writers / directors would have to make an apology. However, in the typical extreme left-wing fashion, all racial slurs go to the most successful minority group - Asians, like Booth's agent David Boreanaz, continually refer to Angela Montenegro as 'strabismus'. <br /> <br /> Forget these things, and forget about this show. After the episode "The Man in the SUV", I thought about trying a second episode to see if it would get any better. It only got worse! I do not even care if the teen in question was murdered or committed suicide, and I will not be watching the show any more.
