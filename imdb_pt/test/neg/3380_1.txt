Although I could summarize this pathetic episode of the Night Gallery in two words, these two words being "horse dung," I am required to write a minimum of ten lines. This is a very minor episode, not worthy of Rod Serling's standards, but rather an inept attempt at some kind of ironic black comedy. The premise of giant rodents that inhabit the moon, a lifeless sphere, is utterly ridiculous, as is the construction of a gigantic mousetrap. I suppose we must also assume that the moon is made of green cheese and that is how these absurd creatures survive. I can only assume that this episode was presented as a filler to supplant the other two episodes that aired on that date. All in all, a waste of film, actors and time in the air.
