who thought of having Iron Eagle sequels should be shot. In this case, once was enough. Iron Eagle was a good movie to watch. Even though it's unrealistic, it's still fun. The Iron Eagle II has a meaningless plot and can be used to cure insomnia. I did not even bother watching Iron Eagle III, but looking at the R-rating, I assume it's more violent than the last two movies. Well, Iron Eagle IV is probably the most inane sequence. Lou Gossett Jr. returns as the ever-delicious "Chappy" Sinclair. Another Jason returns to fill the role of Doug Masters (Canadian Jason Cadieux, who looks like Jason Gedrick of the first Iron Eagle). But wait (Here comes a possible spoiler) ..... Was not Doug dead in Iron Eagle II? The writers must have drained by a story, so they revived Doug Masters saying he was a prisoner of the Russians. This movie was the cheapest of all Iron Eagle movies. Why do filmmakers find it necessary to make sequences for nasty movies? (eg, Police Academy films). I've always enjoyed the work of Gossett Jr. in these films. He was the only one holding this turkey together. Let's hope this is the last of the Iron Eagle sequels. let me rest in peace
