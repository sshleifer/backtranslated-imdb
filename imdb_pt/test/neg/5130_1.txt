I registered for the movie only to comment on this movie. My god what a steaming pile of horse damn it was! Nor should it be presented as a real movie, this is very misleading. this is a 15 year film project at best. The acting is terrible. But even good actors could not save it. The dialogue is probably the worst part of this movie. Who the hell wrote that crap? And that constant joke from the chubby lesbian about Kaye being a "damsel in distress" got old pretty quickly. God, I'd rather have a camel carry a wet dump in my ear than watch that crap again. Do not rent this movie. If they gave you the movie for free, do not watch it. smash it with a hammer. Even if breaking this video made you lose your Hollywood video account or great success, it would be worth it. this is an abomination. I suppose I've said all I can about it without being redundant. Any questions .... Send me an email.
