I was debating between this movie and 2012, but I chose Inglourious Basterds because of its astonishing high rating in IMDb. I must say now what a disappointment. I expected a certain amount of gratuitous violence, but I also expected a lot of witty dialogue. I have a huge dose of the first, but not enough of the latter. I felt cheated. The relationship between violence and plot is very important and I think this movie is totally wrong. And the plot? It's so believable or really so fun. Save your time and money. I can not believe what this rating says to the bloody and violent tastes of the modern masses.
