When I saw 6.0 on IMDb, I was quite impressed and excited to watch this movie, as a 6 for a horror movie should be quite entertaining. At first I thought it would be an evil, disturbing and invisible force (not having read the book) to terrify the public - but, indeed, it is rather mundane - killer plants. Regardless, I'm a pretty open-minded individual when it comes to movies, so I thought maybe the movie would bring some kind of innovation in carnivorous vines. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations due to the excessive amounts of clich√© and lack of originality. Moreover, the female protagonist continues to bother him with his stupidity. Unless the movie is intentionally a bad movie rated by B-class that is fun in the joy of evil, no movie should ever have a main character annoying you if someone expects the public to care about the character. These functions should be reserved for secondary characters. The characters were not developed, the monsters (plants in this case) were not explained, and the cliches were dripping everywhere. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is slightly effective are some of the bloody / bloody scenes, though compared to movies like High Tension or Ichi The Killer. Consistently flawed logic (such as why a character does not watch the top of a rope during a second attempt to descend to the ruins when it just broke and almost killed someone), even if it is smaller, increases and just continues to annoy the audience. The movie could have been saved by using characters or some sort of story device to reprimand or "rescue" idiot characters who did something stupid (or at least let the character recognize or regret his own mistakes). But continuing to allow the idiocy to preside will surely cause the audience to abandon all care with the character, in turn taking the horror out of the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a badly made movie. An example of a well-made movie involving the beautiful twenties being killed is the remake of the Electric Saw Massacre (and the prequel as well) that certainly instigated fear and had far fewer flaws in the character's logic. In short, if you have plenty of time to kill, go watch if there is nothing else. Otherwise, do not waste your time with this movie below the expected and go see something really scary and highly satisfying as the remake of The Hills Have Eyes.
