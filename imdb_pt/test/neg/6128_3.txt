This is the second adaptation of Charlotte Armstrong by Claude Chabrol to the screen: the first was "la rupture" (1970) (from the novel "the balloon man") and it's really a shame that no one cares. Chabrol, and I ask any of your fans to see you. "The chocolate" cobweb was not such a strong detective story to begin with. I read it 20 years ago and forgot all about it.
