"Wagons East" is widely known as the last film by John Candy when he died on the set. That's what makes it so sad: not simply that Candy suffered a fatal heart attack but was on the set of such a bad movie. Seriously, I do not know what they were thinking when they invented this crap, but the movie does not have redeeming qualities. It's like they pick up all the unused scripts for stupid westerns and just mix and film them. No wonder John Candy did not want to make the movie; perhaps his contractual participation was what he did. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the point is that Candy did a lot better than this over the course of her career. To be sure, he had already completed "Canadian Bacon," by Michael Moore, in which the United States declares war on Canada. Just stick with this and you can say that Candy finished her career with honor. As for Richard Lewis - who had previously co-starred with Candy in Eugene Levy's absurd but hilarious "Once Upon a Crime," he compensated for this piece of guest-often appearing in "Countdown with Keith Olbermann" in recent years.
