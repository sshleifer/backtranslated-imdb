Film Noire is a genre that requires a certain level of tact, intelligence, intelligence and imagination. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie your cousin Marky, the junk truck driver, is always talking about how he's going to become great. the movies would some day do. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is wooden and lifeless. The visual, while obviously expensive to do, is the work of a director who tried to be intelligent and failed miserably due to a severe lack of brain power. The performance ranged from sub-par to simply bad. The story may have been recovered by a real writer and director, but I suspect these people would not have touched it with a barge stick. <br /> <br /> About 1/4 of the way, I noticed striking similarities. with the scene in Simone, where Viktor, desperate to get rid of his actress, makes the worst movie in the world. I thought of checking the IMDb to see if a similar effect occurred in that movie and, to my surprise, it happened. I would almost be tempted to give a 2 out of 10 just because the pretentious groupies are exposed, but I will not. It's so bad.
