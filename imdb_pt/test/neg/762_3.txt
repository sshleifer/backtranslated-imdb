C.H.O.M.P.S. is very much like any number of extravagant Disney family comedies from the late 1970s - The Sidewalk Cat or An Unidentified Flying Oddball, for example. Totally devoid of anything creative, hitting the same cliches to death, though vaguely entertaining in a meaningless way. The actors will not win any awards, nor the director, writer or team of FX, but in their harmless and insipid predisibility there is some vague entertainment to be had. The idea of ​​the robot dog as a security system is so full of holes that you could use it as a strainer. The incredibly repetitive disco soundtrack will stay in your head, so beware.
