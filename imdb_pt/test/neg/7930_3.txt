This is yet another pseudo-intellectual film "Let's make the Nazis look very bad." The Nazis were very bad, no doubt - most already know that. However, this does not necessarily make all films on the subject good. A Discovery Channel presentation of "The Wannsee Conference" would have been much more interesting. <br /> <br /> "Conspiracy" falls on your butt between two categories: documentary and drama. It is not a documentary, the film is very "staged" and the presentation is very "ordinary". It is not a drama, the characters are superficial and the conflicts are easily solved.

"As the film shows the Wannsee Conference, the meeting had nothing to do with reaching consensus on the final solution. The decision on the solution had already been made by the SS. there were no decisions or plans made at the Wannsee Conference.There were only threats and coercion (some needed less than others). <br /> <br /> Finally : One thing the film shows (albeit in a non-exceptional way) is that man has a tendency to turn to culture and aesthetics, an attempt to hide for himself the fact that he is committing terrible atrocities. seen in most powerful "leaders" and politicians.
