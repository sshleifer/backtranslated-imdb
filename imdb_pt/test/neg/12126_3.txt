The plot of "Open Graves" is very simple: it is a board game called Mamba, where players die in real life in the same way they die in the game. Deadly scenes include killings through computer-generated crabs and snakes. cardboard and deliberately annoying and there is not even a little bit of suspense. I liked Eliza Dushku in "Wrong Turn", but she is completely wasted and memorable here. The climax with CGI witch coming from the sea is totally laughable and stupid. The only reason to see "Open Graves" are some interesting camera angles sexier Eliza Dushku. If these films are the future of horror, then I seriously give up. Give me any low budget horror film or 70 on this modern piece A very generous 3 out of 10.
