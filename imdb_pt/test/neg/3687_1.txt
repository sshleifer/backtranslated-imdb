I've never made any comments here on IMDb, but as I've seen this movie, I can not be quiet. I just set up my account here just because this horrible movie. in two words, this movie is PURE CRAP. the movie does not make any sense! Nothing makes sense in this movie. Watching this movie was pain all the way. I do not understand why Val Kilmer agreed to make this film. He plays a minor role as a gang leader, says few words, and he is there like 5 minutes in total. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD based solely on the name of Val Kilmer in the box and the interesting photos on the cover. <br /> <br /> As stated in another review, Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back !!! The title of the film itself brought the clue on the classification that everyone should give: ZERO
