My Caddy Limo was destroyed !!! Well, I had one like this - I drove hoi polloi and many of Chosen Ones through Manhattan for a few years. <br /> <br /> This was a lot more fun than this movie I can tell you. Lordy, what a bomb - as in RPG it boom. I also drove many more stars in my white caddy than appeared in this movie movie. Robert Patrick is a very serious actor and did a credible job with the absurd that he had to work. Unfortunately, Rutger Hauer played his part as a circus clown with a red nose. If he could not take it seriously why should his audience? The director should have kicked his ass off the set in the first hour of filming. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was written by children of 10 years of age by 8 years of age. Surprised, there was not much more to fall apart on sets. Oh, well, I'm a movie fanatic - ergo - you must catch the evil to get to the good.
