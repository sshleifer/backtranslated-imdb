River Queen's sound recorder should have been fired, there's no excuse for a bad record on the set today. Murmuring voices were the end result, and cinematography was, at best, fair. The story had potential and I'm sorry for the foreign actors who must have known they were on a turkey shoot while they were filming. It is obvious that the film was suffering from the cheap budget syndrome, and the scene in which Temuera is reproducing inside the house as a battle intensifies is simply too stupid for words. <br /> <br /> I noticed some shortcuts made on the Maori side of the protocol, but this was probably due to the length restrictions of the movie, etc. Despite everything I was not impressed with this movie, the Whanganui River has many beautiful places, but this film gives us a cold, monotonous and claustrophobic image, with nothing of beauty. The film needed more sunlight and better camera angles, less screen clutter, better sound recording, and more thought needed to be put on what moviegoers would see on the big screen. <br /> <br /> We took the hat to all involved, although to complete what must have been a very difficult shoo. I have the greatest appreciation for anyone who can make a feature film, unfortunately I did not like this.
