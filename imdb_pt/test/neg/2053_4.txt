I simply watched this movie just because of Sarah and I'm also giving these 4 stars just because of her, on the other side This movie was easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The action was horrible. The script was not inspired. This was a film that remained in contradiction. The film was sloppy and unoriginal. It's not like I'm expecting a good movie. Just something to give me a jump or two. That did not even do that. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the more I think of the general plot, the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we continue to find. Really a shame, since I'm pretty sure there was a good idea lurking somewhere ... <br /> <br /> I might be getting a little rough giving the movie a 4/10, but given the actors involved and again SARA's obvious writing talent, this movie really should have delivered so much more.
