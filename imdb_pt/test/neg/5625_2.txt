What an atrocity. I'm not demanding total verisimilitude from a movie, but the plot and script of "Killing Zoe" are so naive that I found myself shuddering for all (fortunately short) ninety minutes of the movie. Readers of these reviews have already discovered the plot: Zoe, a program girl who falls in love with the American safecracker Zed, is also a bank clerk who Zed will help steal an assault on Bastille Day. film stresses credibility from the outset. Zoe and Zoe's magical night is highly prosaic, and Zoe's claims to have experienced the orgasm of a lifetime seem to reflect the writer's teenage fantasies more than any real chemistry on the screen. Zed's complete indifference when his friend Eric throws Zoe out of the hotel room hardly prepares the ground for his subsequent strong attachment. <br /> <br /> In the second act, the band of Eric's bohemians - drug-addicted losers leading a marginal life of petty crime - get ready for their big assault with a night on the town. Here the main goal of Roger Avary seems to be to prove that he knows something about drugs. A secondary topic involves convincing us (by endless repetition) that Eric is REALLY, REALLY happy to see his old friend Zed again. Really happy. Eric's exaggeration and affection for Zed are not even remotely believable - for example, check his false perplexity when he discovers a dead cat in his building. The development of the characters that will accompany us through the rest of the film is a belated reflection. <br /> <br /> The assault is a disaster - understandable, since the plan is laughable and the criminals are complete amateurs. It is where Avary continues to pay homage to his idol Quentin Tarantino, showing that he may be more violent than violent. In reality though, it is just more annoying than annoying. To increase the excitement, there is an extra security guard hidden inside the main safe. That was boring in video games, and it's annoying now. <br /> <br /> Zoe is taken hostage during the robbery, but despite our expectation that she will play a key role, she just looks beautiful. Or more precisely, Avary can not do anything with it. In the last five minutes, literally, she comes to life, breaks the hostage situation and saves the grateful but still stunned Zed from suffering any consequences of her crime. Why she does not care about her involvement in crime - or why she cares about him - is impossible to say. After all, she had no chance to see that he is more decent than the rest of the class. <br /> <br /> All dialogue is blighted and false. A lot of it is in French. As a native speaker, I can certify that it does not sound remotely true. Eric's sweet sugary speech, alternating fast with the tough swindler, must be charming and scary, but instead it's just annoying. Meanwhile, his accomplices of frightened cats are more Scooby-Doo than Thomas Crown. When Eric is shot dead in a ridiculous example of excessive force, we can all breathe in relief: like the hostages of the banks, we will soon be set free from this miserable ordeal.
