After huge budget-setting disaster films set in America such as The Day After Tomorrow and Deep Impact, it was refreshing to see something on a smaller scale as Flood. <br /> <br /> Utilizing mostly unknown actors and actresses and really focusing on England, it was a welcome change of pace to see the Empire State Building being demolished. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a strong movie on any basis. While it is quite shocking to see all your favorite landmarks in London being demolished by a storm of CGI storms, Flood does not deliver anything. <br /> <br /> The performances are gentle, being saved from hell. by David Suchet and his refreshingly calm performance as deputy dean. He may be a little too calm for what's going on in the movie, all that fake water in London must have made him rather annoying. <br /> <br /> It is understandable that the effects were not as good as TDAT and DI, but the CGI was, at best, medium. <br /> <br /> Bland, disappointing and sometimes even tiresome. Watch if you need to, but watch something else right away.
