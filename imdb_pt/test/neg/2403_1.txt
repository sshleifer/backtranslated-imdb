The Russians never dropped children's toys filled with explosives in Afghanistan, that never happened !!! Who invented this? Hollywood portrays the Russian army as horrible and terrible troops of evil! That's disgusting !! US President Jimmy Carter accepted the view that "Soviet aggression" could not be seen as an isolated event of limited geographical significance but had to be challenged as a potential threat to the Persian Gulf region. The uncertain scope of Moscow's ultimate goal in its sudden fall to the south made American participation in an even more independent independent Pakistan. A large amount of damage was done to the population of civilian children by landmines.
