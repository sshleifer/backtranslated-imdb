This movie had a couple of funny parts, but for the most part, it made me want to go ahead and change DVD's and watch "Malibu's" instead, which I had in my own collection. At least I would know there was something funny coming up and give me something to wait for. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this very low budget film. And I do not judge a movie by budget. It lacked originality and was too predictable. I would not rent or even watch this movie again, and I am usually a repeat infringer of the movie. The actors were forgettable. The story was kind of thoughtful and left me with an insatiable desire to have fun. I ended up watching Jamie Kennedy's White Boy Gone Gangsta to scratch the itchiness of the comedy.
