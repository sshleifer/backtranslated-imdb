I am an Indian living in the United States. Why India continues, like an idiot animal, emulate everything that the American is beyond me !! The main problems with the film are not so much the empty plot and the stupid comedy. It's that this movie has a lot of sex, touches, women dressing up as prostitutes on the streets, and a lot of curses that do not belong anywhere on TV. <br /> <br /> For producers and directors of the movie I have this message: You continues to weaken the strong family values ​​of our nation by doing this kind of garbage. You continue to allow the young women to think that it is right to have a feminist attitude and not have morality. You continue to make dance music that belongs to the smallest of the adult clubs and bars. I'm ashamed to be an Indian after watching movies like this. <br /> <br /> In 2003, the United States government suggested that the best way to destroy Iran is to send "miniskirts" there. No need to do this for India. We'll wreck ourselves like this.
