When I put this movie on my DVD player and sat down with some cocaine and some chips, I had some expectations. I hoped this movie contained some of the strengths of the first film: incredible animation, good fluent story, excellent voice cast, funny comedy and an incredible soundtrack. But to my disappointment, none of this can be found in Atlantis: Milo's return. I had read some reviews first, I could not have been so disappointed. The following paragraph will be directed to those who saw the first film, and who liked mainly the points mentioned. <br /> <br /> When the first scene pops up, you will get a shock if you choose Atlantis: Milo's returned from the exhibitor at your local video store (or any other) and had the expectations I had. The song sounds like a bad imitation of the first movie, and the voice cast has been replaced by a not-so-appropriate one. (Except for some characters, like Sweet's voice). The actual drawings are not so bad, but the particular animation is a sad sight. The plot is also very weak, since it is more like three episodes of Schooby-Doo than the only adventure story we had last time. But do not misunderstand, there are very good episodes of Schooby-Doo. I did not laugh once, though I may have laughed once or twice. For the public who did not see the first film, or do not care especially about a similar sequence, here is a quick review of this film as a standalone product: If you liked schooby-doo, you can like this movie. If you did not, you can still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do. And I suspect it might be a good movie for kids, but I would not know. It might have been better if Milo's Return had been a three-episode series on a cartoon channel, or on the breakfast TV.
