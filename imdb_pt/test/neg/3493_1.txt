This movie is bad. Just bad. In absolute terms, bad. <br /> <br /> The dialog box jumps off the screen and slaps you in the face with your completely artificial jokes, and then defecates your ability to detect even subtlety traits. <br /> <br /> Racism is bad. Racism in Los Angeles can be especially bad. I live in the city of Angels, I can attest to that. What is so terrible about fanaticism in Los Angeles is its insidious nature. It creeps on you with a knowing look or a swallowed word. Even on the brink of a fistfight, he almost never goes out and says, "Why does he have to be black!" <br /> <br /> I can clearly see that the cars are black, the detective's partner is Hispanic, the DA is white. As long as there is film rolling through the projector, I can let the visual, the music, and the words lead me to this conclusion without just telling me the conclusion. The characters thrill and read between the lines to make connections and conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is a partnership and trust between filmmaker and audience. This confidence is violated by this film. <br /> <br /> A good movie draws you in directions like an audience, and it guides you with suggestions to get to a point. This movie hits you with your point and insults you and your intelligence along the way. My unanswered question is: why do we, as a society, collectively say "thank you"?
