I really did not want to write a hard review of this movie because I really appreciate how difficult it is to make any kind of movie with an incredibly low budget, much less try something as ambitious as a science fiction. <br /> <However, this movie is really horrible. The acting is among the worst I've ever had to endure and as a fan of low budget movies which is a pretty serious charge to make. There are a lot of aspiring actors out there who would work on a deferred payment scheme if they believed the movie and what the director was trying to achieve. I'm sure the actors did the best they could, as well as everyone involved in this production, but simply was not good enough to produce something of this magnitude. <br /> <br /> Then there is the dialogue. Very poor indeed. There is no excuse for that. I got the impression that the script was written hastily on the back of a beer mat after an epic drunken session. I hesitate to use the word "laughable," but that's exactly what the script is. I had no empathy with any of the characters. In fact, they criticized me with the result that on more than one occasion I wanted to hit some of them, Mr. Stirton was overburdened by taking on many roles. Clint Eastwood he is not. Again, there are talented people who are willing to work on deferral if they believe in the project. <br /> <br /> Much has been made of the special effects of this film. For money, they are exceptional if overused. It's as if someone says "I have effects later and boy I'm going to use it". Whoever did the CG work was among the most talented of this team. Quite simply, money was not available to make a movie as ambitious as this one tries to be. Congratulations on trying, but unfortunately you can not achieve your heady goals in many ways. <br /> <br /> I welcome everyone involved with your production, I really do, but for the next effort, they need a better producer or reduce their visions to something more manageable. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I can not recommend this effort to anyone who is not the most enthusiastic of film students or the usual insomniacs. If you want to watch a true masterpiece of low budget science fiction films, try the "Dark Star" student by a Mr. John Carpenter.
