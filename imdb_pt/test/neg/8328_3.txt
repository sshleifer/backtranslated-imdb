"Tragic Hero" is a movie that is definitely trying to imitate the classic Godfather movies, focusing on family, crime, loyalty and revenge. In addition, this is part of a two-part series as The Godfather was also (at the time). However, this film does not even come close to the level of those classic films and, in fact, is worse than other triad thrillers being released in Hong Kong at the time. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons is the acting. With the exception of Chow Yun Fat, the acting is generally exaggerated and unbelievable. The public tends to find the humorous procedures simply because the actors can not maintain any degree of seriousness. As a result, we find that the film is not emotionally engaging or intense, as we do not particularly care about what happens to these characters. <br /> <br /> Another reason is the lack of focus. The narrative tries to incorporate many different elements of the story into the film, but this results in parts of the film becoming underdeveloped as well as without any real sense of coherence. The public sometimes gets lost in the procedures we're seeing, not knowing what the character's motives are. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film contains a decent armed struggle, but again, since we do not care about the characters, we do not care about who lives or who dies; The scene loses its intensity and suspense because of it. The other pieces of the action set are quite mundane in nature, with a feeling that it is too controlled rather than flowing freely. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a strictly medium movie and is not recommended for the film in general. viewer ... Only hardcore genre enthusiasts and Chow Yun Fat fans should consider this movie for viewing.
