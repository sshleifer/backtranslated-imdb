By the time the Hellraiser franchise was coming up, the premise was wearing a little. Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) is a scientist in the future, who as a prisoner gathers his captor from the story of how his ancestors (all played by Ramsey) built for the first time the evil Configuration jigsaw puzzle, which puts evil on the world. and how his subsequent lineage had dealt with the said box. The film is a flood with lack of continuity in relation to the other films and lack of coherence in this. Yes, this may be due to a combination of rewriting, massive cuts in the original version of the movie or what you have. But I'm reviewing the movie as it is, not what it was or could have been. And as it is now, it's a mess. Of course the franchise will continue indefinitely, with direct to DVD sequences, but this was practically a death-nail for your chances of getting a new one released in theaters ever again. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D-
