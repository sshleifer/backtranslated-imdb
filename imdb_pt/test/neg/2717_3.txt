I'm easily satisfied. I like bad movies. I like movies with attractive young women in small amounts of clothing. <br /> <br /> This movie gives everyone a bad name. Yes, you know that what you are getting is not art, or something. But even for the kind of movie that it is, Beach Babes From Beyond is not very good. <br /> <br /> Some people have already given 10. I can only assume that they are people who have had the organs that allow rational thought to occur surgically removed. <br /> <br /> It's not very good. It just is not very good. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 only because of a) novelty value to the famous relatives and Burt Ward and b) some of the girls are cute. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, did I tell you it's not very good?
