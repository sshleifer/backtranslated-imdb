This was an irreverent comedy of the 1970s kind, mocking the psychiatric profession and Beverly Hills. I did not care, but I opposed more than irreverence over marriage and religion: two topics that secular filmmakers (meaning everyone in Hollywood and elsewhere) just can not stop destroying. Walter Matthau plays a strange character, "Donald Becker," who walks around with a clergyman collar, which offends me, but when has Hollywood ever bothered to offend Christians? <br /> In any case, despite this absurdity, the film has its fun times and even a little charm. Dan Aykroyd is good at paying a nut case and Donna Dixon ("Laura Rollins") is a knockout. I'm sorry she does not play a bigger role.
