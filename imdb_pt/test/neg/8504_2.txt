I give this film 2 stars purely because of its slightly liberal plot. Without going into too much detail. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is terrible. Really terrible - wooden, shallow. <br /> <br /> The graffiti on the show is weak, so weak that I can only imagine why they bothered to use graffiti artists. It was obvious in the spray scenes that they got other people to do the 'job'. They might as well let the actors do the painting and save themselves a few pennies. <br /> <br /> I would avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> The crazy boy soundtrack used to be something I heard on my iPod, it will take a while until I can go back there for fear that this movie will come back to my mind. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. Unless you're thinking "Wow, it's been a while since I've seen a really bad movie ..."
