As the main "character" Lillith Silver likes to point out - "you know f ** k all about vampires". Clearly this statement was aimed at the cast and crew, which create an extremely bad image of the blood-sucking undead of all favorites. According to the misguided director, vampires are all hardened on a white base and huddled in latex similar to a piece of flesh in plastic wrap. With Bannana-like fangs and a severe case of asthma, our main character, Lillith, creates a caricature of the "modern" Vampire. <br /> <br /> The plot consists of a playstation collection for 9-year-old boys. piece of paper, then mixed up to invent this horrible tale. Lillith, our pale protagonist, is a Vampire Slayer who claims to despise members of everyone's favorite cult, the Illuminati! Instead of incorporating Killer's classic accuracy and stealth methodology, Lillith walks past an open window and begins to bite the necks of her targets before firing on them with a weapon (which apparently does not leave bullet holes thanks to the continuity of evil quality). ). PC Plod is then assigned to solve the murders, he arrives at the grizzly, but surprisingly obvious conclusion that Lillith is actually a Vampire and proceeds to hunt her armed with the usual vampire dispatch tools, including a cross, garlic and a piece of sharp wood. . Meanwhile, Lillith, who has a habit of beating her boss, is upset when an old enemy takes him by surprise and demands that a ransom be delivered in person. As you can imagine, this does not happen as planned. I will not put myself in the pain of the following scenes, so I'll skip to the end. Lillith and her "nemesis" have a showdown, and after Lillith gets the victory is revealed, with all the extravagance of someone saying they have cancer, that the two are lovers of the century and the whole plot was some kind of twisted game . Yeah, that kick in the balls was the real end of the movie. To my eyes, this conclusion joke is the cherry on top of the latex cake, and saddle this movie in the coffer "Never ever watch this". <br /> <br /> As far as cinematographic techniques are concerned, the film merely does not bother creating any style. The director tries to rescue his disaster by giving some close-ups and some multi-angle shots, but that's not the saving grace that the film needed. <br /> <br /> You may be screaming "but this is a B movie, it's bound to be crap!" I, however, do not feel sorry. I've seen some B movies, like the dead evil 2, and Jesus Christ the Vampire Hunter, and therefore this doom can not hide behind excuses. The budget was low, this is obvious by the lack of location and good actors. Perhaps, however, if the director were more creative and spent less money on pay for makeup and fake blood, he could have done something decent with this sick attempt. Decadent sex scenes are not beneficial at all and just served to give me some laughter about obscene acting skills everywhere. Half of the budget must have been paid to the female cast just to get their tops for lesbian jokes. If I wanted to watch a vampire porn movie, I would have bought Muffy The Vampire Layer. <br /> <br /> The cast is bad, the story is worse and the effects are incredibly false. This movie had some potential, however, its obscure tone and embarrassing portrayal of a classic horror character merely served to be his downfall. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh with some friends, I recommend you watch this mockery. If you're looking for a more serious Vampire action movie, try Blade or Underworld to calm your bloodlust in fury.
