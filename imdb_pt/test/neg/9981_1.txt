Who really wants to see this? Disgusting violence, disgusting sex, for so long. I do not want to, but I've always been true to my philosophy of watching any movie as bad as it can be. This was the hardest (shortly after "Next Friday"). <br /> <br /> It's basically just crap. How can you call it anything else? The story of a Roman emperor as an excuse for Gore and T & A. Yes, yes, "Hey, it's realistic, they've been like this." Okay, but why bother with this? I do not care if it has been like this (and there are many scenes in which I really doubt). The point is, why should anyone want to see? The problem is that there is only one reason why you may like the movie and that you like violence. There's nothing special about it, just cruelty. You can say "Cool!" as you would say in splatter-slasher movies. But violent horror movies, at least, can cause shivers and excitement, perhaps characters that interest you. But here everything is dark, monotonous and boring. Every character is crazy. "The story of an emperor who can not handle his power." What? In the first scene he runs naked through the forest with his sister! I have no problem saying we saw a madman for two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> But maybe you get excited watching Helen Mirren, pregnant and dancing. Or 5 minutes of hardcore scenes that some people see as the movie message. Or castration, yes, that was fun! Real birth scenes like Hilarious! Humans, animals, who cares, let's just treat them like toys. <br /> <br /> I do not care what anyone says, this is not movie, this is only 2 and a half hours of blood and sex, demeaning and disgusting. Go watch a porn movie if you want sex or watch a horror movie if you want violence. At least these films do not pretend to be a work of art. And they are shorter. <br /> <br /> [0/10] [6 (1+ - 6)] [0/4]
