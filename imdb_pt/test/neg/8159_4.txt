This film features a fairly decent earthquake effects sequence for a 1936 earthquake. The reason you did not see it is because the public in the 1930s was in love with Jeanette MacDonald's photo; in which the eponymous star made its way through countless songs while the plots stopped altogether. The FX crossing time is very good. MacDonald's songs do not, and the awkward insertion of such songs to show their typical talent is not good. <br /> <br /> The gray device of two friends who grow up to become a priest and a villain is given another run through the machinery (Manhattan Melodrama, The Departed). At the 30-minute mark, you've heard the song "San Francisco" three times. Entertainment in the thirties is usually an accumulation of irritation. Only the Grand Hotel of the decade renounces the hassle with the degree shown in San Francisco, Dinner at 8pm, Little Caesar, Stagecoach, All Silent On The Western Front, Les Miserables etc.
