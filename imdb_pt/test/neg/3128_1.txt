This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> We should like it and be rooting for an arrogant, know-it-all bank robber, played by Dale Robertson, and a timid provocation played by Linda Darnell, extraordinarily beautiful in a red firefighter dress. She must have been sewn on that bodice! <br /> <br /> A senator in the film thinks Native Americans and whites should try to come to an understanding, but fanatics nonetheless make the most of the day. I could barely follow the interminable dialogue of intolerance emanating from the mouths of the other characters. Except for Wounded Knee and Dances with Wolves, there are few movies that positively portray American Indians, and very few Old States do. This is exceptionally bad in this regard. <br /> <br /> The romance between Robertson and Darnell irritated me when he entered arrogantly, forcing a kiss on her while she makes the old man hard to get game. <br /> <br /> There are unintentional mood scenes, like the characters who obviously are not walking around on a multi-level stagecoach. <br /> <br /> A fun incident in the plot is Linda Darnell's character made a big effort to buy tickets for the stagecoach, only to require a horse to ride, minutes later, for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Another funny scene is when the diligence comes to screams. stop at the sight of a cowboy hat lying on the side of the road, and not only that, but then all the passengers crowd to take a look. <br /> <br /> 1 star.
