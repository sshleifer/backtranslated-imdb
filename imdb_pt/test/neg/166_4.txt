A strange, intentionally distorted biopic of Dyan Thomas in which we heard just over a dozen lines of his poetry. Instead, we have to endure a crude exposition of character seen through the prism of his proto-bigamous relationship with his wife (Sienna Miller) and childhood love (Keira Knightley). Matthew Rhys plays Thomas with enough charm to inoculate us against his repulsive selfishness and Cillian Murphy composes the persistent tense love. <br /> <br /> The movie never seems to decide where it's going. There is no arch, like a viaduct from one end of the war to the other. Maybury seems much more interested in his two female leaders (who would not do that?) Than in the man who unites them and then divides them. Miller is the choice of the two (I find Knightley competent at best, but I never found her understanding), but both offer terribly inconsistent Welsh accents. Other funny decisions include too much for the inconsequential character of William (Murphy), artistic production (for example, double crossfades) that is neither impressionistic nor symbolic and the old brown act of the period that does not mix. 4/10
