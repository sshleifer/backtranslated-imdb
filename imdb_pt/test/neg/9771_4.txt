Such pain! Pain in the form he promised in his central idea, but never fully recognized it and continues to blow a lot of sand on his face. I would not say that this South African / Canadian / British horror movie is awful, but it's just bland, predictable and there's very little memorable about it. It is a guarantee that you will forget, not long after watching. I tried to watch it last night, but I had to finish it in the morning, since I could not keep my eyes open. Even so, I could not remember where I was, which left me watching from the start again. The only thing that caught his eye was Andreas Poulsson's sharp cinematography of the vast, harsh, scary places of the desert. A good, bright chic creates an impressive visual sense that can not save the film from that general empty feeling. Everything else is below normal and almost leaves the grid. Like the revelation of the beast. There is. The computer generated special effects of the sinister monster are tolerable, and there are some terrible flashes of flesh and bones stripped. But there is very little, for there is no hiding the fact that the clich√© script wants to ponder over the generic character conflict to create tension and uncertainty. There would be no problem if wilting writing was more than simple and superficial, because it has never generated any strong and enduring suspense, but it does not make the work uninteresting. The main characters are shallow and the token holder falls into the dispensable basket. It's your stereotyped group. The performances of Scott Bairstow and Warrick Grier are colorless, and beautiful Rachel Shelley tries, but looks quite tired.
