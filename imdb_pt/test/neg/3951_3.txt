After the mysterious death of an old friend, a group of teenagers finds themselves in possession of Stay Alive, a horror survival video game based on the horrifying story of Erzebet Bathory known as The Blood Condess. The group starts playing the horrible game and soon they are killed one by one in the same method as the character they played in the game. As the line between the game world and reality disappears, our heroes must find a way to defeat the cruel Countess of Blood. "Stay Alive" is an incredibly poor horror movie, with no suspense. Wrestling director William Brent Bell does not have the bloody clue how to make a horror movie. The fright spikes are annoying, the blood / blood level is almost nonexistent and the story makes no sense. The dialogue is totally bad and the work of all involved is embarrassing. "Stay Alive" is easily one of the worst conventional horror films of 2006. Stay away from that stinking coward.
