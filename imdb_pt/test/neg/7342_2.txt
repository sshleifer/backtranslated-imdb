I'm shocked by all the good reviews on the cover of this movie and IMDb. It belongs to the $ 2 deposit at your local video store. To say that this is a B movie is extremely generous. <br /> <br /> In addition to not having a single character that can be rescued, only slightly better than average, and an ugly image quality of the 80's, the script of this film is monotonous. without life. This movie is not just annoying - it's pathetic. (It is true that occasionally there is some slightly interesting chemistry between the two main characters.) Even the final plot twist - instead, the only twist in the plot - does not save this movie. <br /> <br /> Rent "Diamond Men" If you need to, but do not hesitate to turn it off after you become appraised about its lack of value. 2 out of 10.
