Yet another TV show becomes a movie. Steve {The Office} Carell plays the grumpy agent Maxwell Smart in a movie that is so bad it makes the worst movie you've ever seen become the second worst movie you've ever seen. The seventh rate story - if you can call it you have a megalomaniac trying to dominate the world. It's so bland, it's absolutely pathetic. About the one thing that Anne Hathaway does as agent 99 looks good - she seems unable to do anything else. Bill Murray has the good sense to limit his screen time to about 90 seconds, and some faces in the TV series appear in very small roles. The film must be part of suspense and part of action movie. It's neither. Even though I was not a fan of the TV series, at least light years ahead of me. All it does is drag it through the dirt and cheapen any good memories we have of it. Thank goodness Don Adams is not here to see you. Keep Hollywood going! Keep making bad movies like that and keep sending them to the multiplexes weekly. No wonder the film industry is coming down the tubes. This movie is so rotten that it's not even good for laughs. If this movie were a newspaper, it could be used to line the bottom of a cage. There is absolutely no reason to see this movie. A root canal is nicer than that! Zero rating minus five stars. Unless you are a masochist, STAY AWAY. Better yet, do what the title says - Be smart and save your nine dollars. You will be able to buy about 2 gallons of gas with it. Put it in your car and be grateful for not having missed it by going to a multiplex to see this bomb!
