Yes, this title line actually appears in this movie. Because? I'm not sure. When the line was actually being told, did somebody on the crew filming, at some point, not laugh? I would have liked to see the takes of this movie, mainly because I think they would be more fun than the movie itself. Directed by director Jim Gillespie, ("I Know What You Did Last Summer,") comes a teen slasher movie that seems to assume I've never seen a teen horror movie before. Of course, he should not get all the blame. There are also three writers responsible, and this is somehow based on a video game that is still in production. The title of the game is "Backwater", but when looking for information about it, I invented absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> And so we started the movie ... I'd like to say before I continue I was not expecting this to win an Oscar. When I'm in the right mindset, I enjoy a fun horror movie to pass the time. I think there is an opportunity for an effective, original and intelligent slasher film. "Venom" is not that movie. <br /> <br /> There is almost no character development. That's nice. You do not expect much. However, instead of a well-connected cast, this movie decides to introduce us to the following characters cliches of horror films ... 1. The Final Girl: She just finished for her boyfriend. This means that at some point in the movie, when they are in danger, they will decide to reunite. That more than likely means that he will die and she will be the last survivor of the film. "Eden" is played by Agnes Bruckner, without much enthusiasm, I might add. <br /> <br /> 2. The Boyfriend: He's around to coexist with The Final Girl until his death. Of course, he can save her, but he's doomed and we know that. "Eric" is played by Jonathan Jackson. <br /> <br /> 3. The Bimbos: Usually horror movies only feel the need for one of these, but here we have two. They steal, steal, show off their breasts (not in this case) or they can be alcoholics. A staple of the genre. They also wander through poorly lit areas, often saying things like, "Hello? Is anyone there?" "Tammy" and "Patty", appropriately named, are played by Bijou Phillips and Davetta Sherwood. <br /> <br /> 4. The Jackass: Of course, he looks cute, but he's the idiot of the movie that is inserted just to be an idiot. He says stupid things, does stupid things, obviously never seen a horror movie, and it's one of the pleasant deaths that you watch that sort of thing. "Sean" is played by D.J. Cotrona. <br /> <br /> 5. The Girlfriend: She loves Jackass, though almost no one else does, and she's usually the one who's been alive for a while, so she can scream and cry until she starts to stumble and be left back. "Rachel" is played by Laura Ramsey. <br /> <br /> 6. The Creepy Janitor: In this case, the Scary Gas Station Attendant. Enough said. "Ray" is played by Rick Cramer. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think you get it. The remaining characters are not as common as they are equally removable. There's "The Gay Guy" (Pawel Szajda as "Ricky"), which was definitely stolen with respect to screen time, and "The One Who Knows What's Going On". Of course none of this matters, because at first everyone always thinks he's crazy. "Cece" is played by Meagan Good. <br /> <br /> There are a few other characters, namely a substitute played by Method Man, but he and others are killed quickly and have less character development than the following. So, you're probably thinking, "Why does this movie require such in-depth analysis? It's just a summer horror movie, for crying out loud!" Based on this question, does it deliver the goods? Yes and no. The acting is not particularly convincing, even considering the amount of talent involved. Bijou Phillips was hailed for her performance in Larry Clark's Bully, and Agnes Bruckner has been a promising talent for some time. <br /> <br /> So what about blood? There is some. That's really about it. Many of the juiciest pieces are cut. That is, a scene involving someone's face and a jet of sand used to remove paint from cars. <br /> <br /> For the filmmaker's credit, there are some interesting scenes. I liked the part where part of a house was literally ripped off so that the unstoppable villain could reach out to the characters. If everything had been centered around a smarter script in which the characters did not make the same stupid mistakes that literally hundreds of horror movie characters did before them, it could have contributed to a more nice. All the most interesting characters are immediately killed in the first third of the movie and then it becomes a not particularly interesting countdown until we know it's just The Creepy Janitor and The Final Girl. <br /> <br /> I suppose I must be a bit tired, but as a fan of horror movies, I wonder why I should have bothered when I could have easily written a better script. I will not even mention the numerous cases of terrible CGI.
