I found the film a little predictable and annoying, but I'm 14 years old. <br /> <br /> I was very upset with my little cousin, because she was very hyper that day, so I saw a movie on the Disney Channel and put it on and told her to watch it. <br /> <br /> She's 6 and loved the movie, some excerpts she did not have as the end, but I also did not understand that Eddie was the star of the shoot video I thought it was Jordan's video?! but she liked it. <br /> <br /> I noticed the mistakes as in the end, Jordan was not really playing guitar, but she never. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a movie for if you're seriously bored or 10 years old or younger. <br /> <br /> It calmed my cousin well. <br /> <br /> despite all she did was sing for the rest of the day then.
