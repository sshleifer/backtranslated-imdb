Has anyone ever noticed that this version is basically a scene-by-scene remake of the 1933 version, with some of the scenes removed? It makes me think less of a movie that does this, showing a clear lack of creativity. In all fairness, I tend to be biased in favor of Katharine Hepburn, but this version of the movie looks like cinematic plagiarism. The 1933 version was enjoyable and sweet, although a little strange in the presentation and sometimes transition, and then this version took the script, the music and even a good amount of scene blocking the previous version. I do not understand the point of making the film again when the method of redoing it was basically redoing George Cukor's movie with everything else except the people who work on it.
