This song is totally out of sync with the movie, appearing from time to time as a Wagnerian bombast and a otherwise non-existent Lone Ranger. The performance, apart from the two principles, is non-existent. It would have been a great student film. Russian soldiers are just role models trying to act. The constant interruptions with explosive camera angles and people's monochrome clips were quite annoying, but that's just a personal feeling. The plot is not worse than others, in fact no worse than most, completely ignoring logic, reason and reality. At least nobody walked in front of a machine gun for three minutes without being hit. The three top-level villains were exaggerated.
