This movie looks as if someone had a cute idea for a movie, thought of two or three funny possibilities, hired a good cast, and then turned the whole thing into a lousy screenwriter and even worse director. The director filmed a romantic comedy as if it were an obscure art film - strange camera angles, filtered blue outlets, closed eyes and closed for raindrops. Steve Zahn was fine, as usual. Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; he was perfect for a romantic comedy. Sandra Bullock fought bravely with a character who was supposed to be crazy, but whose eccentricity consisted of things like kissing a husband she hated, abandoning her son, going on carnival rides, volunteering to undress and hitchhike with a airline. The script had few funny lines; there was no physical comedy; it was boring. He introduced potentially funny situations, then cut them before they could develop. Above all, the "twist" in the end was a slap in the face of anyone hoping for a fun romantic comedy. If you saw the movie trailer and liked it, like I did, my advice is: do not go to the movie. This will only ruin a good trailer.
