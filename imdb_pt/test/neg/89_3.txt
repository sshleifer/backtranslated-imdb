The artificial melodrama, with script adapted by Mel Dinelli of his play "The Man", refers to a boarding house owner who receives a problematic do-it-all, which may be homicidal. Despite the solid work of Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan (both trying their best), this tedious thread is not very inventive within its primary set (which quickly becomes visually monotonous) and cast of characters (there is however an intelligent dog who feels the worst!). Hokey and humorless, with an affected direction of Harry Horner (maybe Lupino should have driven?). Where is all the suspense promised by the ads? Dinelli also acted as co-producer. * 1/2 of ****
