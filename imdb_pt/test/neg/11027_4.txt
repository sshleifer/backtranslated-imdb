Carole Lombard and James Stewart try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the tribulations of a newly married couple. The scenes work as if they were divided between several directors, each with a different goal. Some are capricious, some crazy, some melodramatic and some surprisingly noir. There is even an extended adventure sequence when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a blizzard. It's hard to say which scenes are the most incongruous, when the film as a whole is so erratic, and the plot is not exactly believable. It's only worth watching for film students or actors' fans - smaller parts, like Judge Doolittle and the intrepid pilot, are also very well played.
