I watched the unrated version of this movie and as a person who studied Speck's life and crimes closely, I must say that this film is a flaw but ambitious take on the real story. While capturing the true horror of Speck and the murders, this film makes the following factual errors. 1. Speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene as described in the movie. In fact, he was primarily an alcoholic and pill that rarely took drugs via the syringe. 2. The Asian nurse who survived the Speck massacre did not squirm down stairs and under the sofa in the living room as depicted in the film. That would have been impossible. In real life, she hid under the bed while Speck methodically eliminated her 8 victims. 3. The movie shows Speck as being violent and brutal with women as soon as they know them. Is not true. In fact, Speck was at first calm and gentle, reassuring women that he would not hurt them. That was how he managed to tie each one of them. 4. The real Richard Speck was not the deep thinker the movie shows he is. FBI profiler Robert Ressler interviewed Speck in the 1980s and said that Speck not only did not know why he committed the murders, but that he was not interested in why he could not shed any light on why. Speck was known for being below average intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this film. If the story were not so tragic and horrifying, the narration would be laughable. All in all, Doug Cole's performance is suitably threatening and cold-blooded, although I do not think the real Speck was so advanced in its violence. No doubt he was a very violent person when he was under influence, but he was also known, after all, for being a very clever con man who was able to make people comfortable before victimizing them. Beverly Ann Sotelo's performance as a surviving nurse is the best in the film. She's a great actress. If you're a bit scrupulous, do not watch this movie. It is very graphic and disturbing.
