Arnold fans will scream for joy, fans of ruthless action will scream in astonishment, and Catholics will just scream. <br /> <br /> Ilogically written by Andrew W. Marlowe and untrained director Peter Hyams, * End of Days * Gets the Army Terminator from his open hospital gown (Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the big screen after his cardiac operation ) while blowing things up in Mysterious Ways and blaspheming the Bible verse to give Catholics something more to whine about. <br /> <br /> It's 1999 and the condemnators around the world live in fear of their computers getting weak and losing their downloaded porn. Even with the technological stench of Y2K changing the streets of New York, the former police officer became an alcoholic safety guard, Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger, with the shallow history of "dead wife and boy" for the Loose Cannon effect), must face waters to save 20-year-old Christine (Robin Tunney) from being recruited as? wait for it ?? The Bride of Satan Dun dah daaaarrrh! Stupidity follows. <br /> <br /> For every anti-hero, there is your anti-christ. Gabriel Byrne is the devil here? and he's away to party like it was 1999, on a mission to impregnate Christine with the Anti-Christ between 11 pm and midnight, December 31, 1999? ironically, when all the porn will be lost? bringing the end of days. Being able to read minds, conjure up hallucinations, and employ unlimited magic, Satan does not speed up the impregnation process by appearing months in advance and courting Christine as a teenage model and closing the panties easily at the appointed time; instead he appears on December 28 as a Keyser Soze Terminator and wonders why she does not get him with thighs open ?? Here is a movie where nothing makes sense at the moment it is uttered, much less after contemplating its truth or mythology. A priest (Rod Steiger) tells Jericho that '666' is actually '999' upside down with a '1' in front of him. So wait - * Prince * is the Antichrist? <br /> <br /> Satan Soze chases after Jericho and Christina (J and C? Do you understand?) Through the city, in no time doing anything that would actually precipitate his capture. . In one scene, Satan recreates the wife and son of Jericho to tempt him to reveal where he hid Christine. But if he can see so deeply into Jericho's mind in recreating his family with enough nuance to inspire nostalgia, why can not he see where Jericho hid Christine not ten minutes ago? <br /> <br /> Satan can make a murderer speak without a tongue, but he can not make the killer unleash a semi-automatic weapon. And when Jericho shoots Satan at point-blank range, Satan is courteous enough to open his shirt to reveal the closing wounds, so Jericho will not worry about Satan's health - is not it hygienic to hurt with open bullets ?? In fact, instead of simply owning Jericho to approach Christine and rape her, Satan spends so much unnecessary energy on side projects (crucifying the tongueless guy, blowing up Jericho's partner Kevin Pollak and then saving him, and then blasting him again, ridiculously fighting Jericho when he could snuff him with the thought effort) we wondered if a more efficient killer / lover should not be put on the case? say, Antonio Banderas. <br /> <br /> What I find most precious about End of Days are Arnold's valiant attempts at Method: "sad" means to roll the eyes and not let anything escape with a foreign accent; "depressed" means carrying a bottle to your lips and not letting anything go with a foreign accent; "mortally frightened" means to open your eyes and not let anything escape with a foreign accent. There is definitely a pattern here if we could just decipher it. <br /> <br /> In the end, the devil is dispatched not by the holy men whom Catholics pray for the liberation of apocalypses like these, but of the atheist. Jericho. While the timid men of an impotent god exhort "faith" and tremble in their cells doing nothing about Satan, actually walking among them, the Prince of Darkness is thwarted by a nullifier with a great weapon and a foreign accent. What clearly says something that Catholics refuse to listen blindly: that even if the Devil existed, those who were indoctrinated to irrationally and irrationally would fear him would be unable to cast a belief in his fall, much less act on it. Moreover, they may not truly want it to be defeated, for only through their polarity contrary to the existence of their god will it become sustainable. <br /> <br /> For it is written in the book of Revelation, "And the Prince of Darkness will descend upon the earth without any solid game plan, and impregnate a virgin on a date that will have no meaning until the Gregorian Calendar of 1500s adopt the numbering of the day that will put it in sync with the equinoxes and syntax Anno Domine that will bother For millennia wise people would have forgotten the actual date of Christ's birth and appropriated the pagan saturnal festival instead. the prince will perform a Revolution through tight purple pants and ambiguously lesbian band members? "I can believe that people are being drained of blood and crucified, and the alcoholic is built as a Mr. Universe; I can believe that a giant and supernatural monster can not kill an armed face with only a foreign accent; I may even believe that the devil must perform some Celtic Druid ritual of the thirteenth century as preliminaries - but what I can not believe is the 20 year old virgin in New York in 1999. <br /> <br /> Especially in around Principe ...
