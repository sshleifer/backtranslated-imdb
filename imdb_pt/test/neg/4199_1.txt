No. Just NOT. That's all that needs to be said. <br /> <br /> Summary: A random guy is in a cornfield. For some reason, I'm not sure, but it's your duty to run inside. The next big thriller? <br /> <br /> A five-year-old could make a better movie just by filming an ant hill, or even just growing on grass. Seriously ..... <br /> <br /> You can not say that you have bad acting, because there is NO acting. You can not say that you have bad writing because you do not have writing. You can not say you have bad cinematography because there is no cinematography. You can not say it's a bad movie, BECAUSE THERE'S NO MOVIE! If you do not believe me, go watch. Just do not say I never warned you .....
