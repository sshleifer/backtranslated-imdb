With a catchy title like the Butcher of Plainfield, this variation of Ed Gein and Kane Hodder to play it will undoubtedly leave the shelves for a few weeks. Most viewers will be bored with this latest version of Ed Gien's life. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Ed's agitation and gives us a glimpse of his Psycho and his address in Plainfeild. It's these scenes that give the film a much-needed tremor. <br /> <br /> What ruins this is the constant focus on lives of other characters and focuses less on Eds.Big error here. <br /> <br /> Kane Hodder is a strange choice to play Gein, but he does very well, and deserves more acting credits than he gets these days.Prascilla Barnes and Micahel Barryman also appear. <br /> <br /> 3/10
