BOOOOOOOORRRRRINNGGGGGGGG and STOOOOOOOPIDDDDD. He continued to fall asleep. If you want to see Miles O'Keefe riding in a Hairy Speedo by all means rent this movie. If not, please do not bother ... Rife with anachronisms. Should this be defined in the Ice Age, the Iron Age, the Steel Age, or the Age of Reason? What was the reason for the black nylon wig in the face dressed as Genghis Khan? Should this be Genghis Khan? If the Actor had access to so many advanced technologies and sciences, why do we expect another 1000 years for Leonardo? It is never clear where the actor comes from or whether he should be some superior type of being. You wonder if everything was explained in the first movie, but after seeing this you know that you will never bother.
