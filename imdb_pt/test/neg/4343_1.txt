'This Life' is really as bad as it sounds. His cast of mercenary, lascivious, ruthless, dubious and shallow characters is intended to reflect on his post-eighties scenario, and I must admit that in that sense it is a precise creation. Unfortunately, this does not leave me with sympathy or caring, and I consider it just one more step towards the premium rate television phone in cheats; surprisingly bad, cheap, reality and 'celebrity' saturated with television; and other cutting-and-trailing attitudes that have destroyed that milieu and, indeed, much of British society. Sounds exaggerated? I do not think so. In this respect, programs like 'This Life' were indeed as influential as they are often called.
