Being trapped in bed with the flu and feeling too rough to get up to find the remote, I really watched this abomination from start to finish (how many people can say that? And to who can - what's your excuse?) . My God, has there ever been any total mess released by a big studio? There is not a second of genuine tension in a so-called "thriller"; the script is inept and ridiculous; the scenarios appear to be remnants of a low-budget TV movie; and the cast ... WHAT THEY WERE THINKING?! Sally Field gives what is undoubtedly the worst and most embarrassing performance of any Oscar winner in history. His annoying nasal groan and his stupidly cheerful behavior in what is a life-threatening situation are truly asinine. It is a wonder that she did not use all her future earnings to buy and destroy all the impressions of this turkey. Michael Caine, who now pontificates tirelessly on the art of acting onscreen - even commanding classes for alleged actors - must be taken and filmed (preferably by one of Telly Savalas' henchmen). Angela Cartwright, an actress I usually like (and whose name does not even appear in the opening credits, poor soul), is ten years older for her role, and her horrible yellow graduation dress should haunt her nightmares to this day. Slumming are Karl Malden and Shirley Knight - hopefully they've collected a large pay package to ease their involvement. The whole movie is a series of bad scenes, but one of the ones that impress me most is the explosion that results in the "ceiling" (if a deck of a Upside Down ship can be termed as such) collapsing and a load of boxes of empty cardboard falling in between! Ooh, how scary! Really, really, terrible.
