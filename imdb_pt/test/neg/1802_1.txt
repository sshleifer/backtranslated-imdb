The 1994 film production of Heart of Darkness was by no means able to match the excellent book. The film contained unnecessary scenes that confused the viewer rather than helping them understand what was happening. The director obviously was not experienced, and if he is, then he did not demonstrate. In addition, scenes from the book were left out or altered, scenes that were quite important. The film made me feel a little bored and was a complete waste of my time. The characters acted as if they had no idea what was going on, and the actors did not portray the emotions Marlow and the rest revealed in the book. Overall, the film was terrible and completely lacked the suspense that was needed to make it remotely interesting.
