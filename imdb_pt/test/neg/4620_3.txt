I have a fondness for these ups and downs in British social norms and it is rare that anyone misses me. But our Betters have lost me a little. It's a tale of social climbers and their joy at breaking the rules, but personally I found it a little boring. <br /> <br /> I like the Duchess, although she earns a little too much and Constance Bennett plays amicably the role of Lady Greyston, a role that Bette Davis might have played the other way round. <br /> <br /> Movie comes life in the third act when Ernest joins the party. He's so lively and fun (and, in fact, probably uses more makeup than Lady Greyston). It takes the last line of the movie and it's a gas!
