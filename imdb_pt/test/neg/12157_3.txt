I've been waiting for this movie for a while. On the first air day in Turkey, I watched. It was totally a disappointment to me. I was planning to watch a historical movie, but the screen was fictional. First of all, the main character of the movie Cengiz Han, the great achievement was portrayed as a smooth, calm, even a loser. You can not feel the power in the movie. Historically, the war machine he created was conquered even (even more) the world known in those years. To do this, first Cengiz unite the Asian tribes. However, in the movie, this loser man is in a poor man scene alone, and in the second scene, he is commanding armies. War scenes were incredibly week. In the final battle, the Mongolian knight was wearing double swords at his sides and cutting off the enemy. :) As a consequence, my friends and I just laughed at these scenes. Mongolian Army means Mongolian archery knight. You can not see that in the movie. Another bad thing was the use of fantastic elements in the movie. I do not want to go to the scenes that Cengiz was portrayed as a prophet. We can say in the integrity of the film, it is acceptable. However, the scenes when the old monk saw the future and go to find the wife of Cengiz Khan after Cengiz gave him a mission is very funny. When the monk died in the desert, Cengiz's wife feels it and finds the corpse on the mainland. Are we talking about Asia? Once more we laughed. There's a lot more to say, but I do not feel like this movie has the courage to talk any more.
