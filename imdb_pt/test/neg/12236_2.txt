There was nothing remotely funny about this movie. It makes fun of various sports movies and clich√©s, but nothing about it is remotely funny. Most of the films they parody do not even fit the movie and are just theirs, so they can be in it. No The lead actor was well released, but that's really the only good thing about this movie. Also the various cameos on it were kind of cool to see but I have no idea why they would waste their time being in this piece of garbage. Thank goodness I spent only $ 4 on this as this is not something that is worth spending money on. Just notice if you have absolutely nothing to do or just want to waste an hour and 30 minutes.
