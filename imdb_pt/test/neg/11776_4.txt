Given the subject of drug addiction, Down to the Bone can hardly help but be a depressing movie. But depressing does not necessarily mean evil. Unfortunately, in this case, it is indeed very bad. The film has some good things to do, most notably Vera Farmiga's acting performance in the central role of Irene, a mother who works with a cocaine addiction. But there is not enough good here to make up for evil. The flaws of the film lie mainly in the story, which fails to captivate and never really seems to continue. Irene goes to rehab and comes home to an impudent husband who has no idea how to support her attempt to quit the habit. Irene grows up near another recovering addict, a nurse at her rehab center. Complications result. But history never gives life. It does not look like the movie is really going anywhere. You can say that it is a realistic and hard view of the daily struggles of an addict. Maybe yes, but in this case does not make an interesting movie. The whole thing has a very "blah" feel. Minimalist cinematography does not help, adding another layer of monotonous to incredibly monotonous procedures. And none of the other performances compares to Farmiga's. Hugh Dillon is just like Irene's friend nurse, but no one else in the cast adds anything of value to the process. All in all this movie is a dark, depressing and rather boring ride.
