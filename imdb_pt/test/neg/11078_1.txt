First, let me say that those of you who voted "10" are just fooling themselves and trying to get votes to a respectable level ... something this movie does not deserve. (The only movies that deserve a 10 IMO are the classics ... Godfather, Shawshank, etc. See the top rated movies of all time for the full list.) I also noticed that a lot of people gave a positive vote for being so realistic as it is inside a cave. Although I would have to agree with them in the surroundings, they simply are not rating the film as a whole ... they are passionate about the environment but miss the overall review. That would be like I vote a 10 for the movie "From Justin to Kelly" because I think the beach scenes remind me of what it's like in the Florida Keys ... although this may be true, it does not deserve the movie to be 10 because the film as a whole was rancid. <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell you that something saved this movie, as usually if something stinks in a horror movie, something else catches or compensates for weakness. (Ex. - Bad actors are overshadowed by a big plot and / or great camera work and scenery.) We started the DVD and everything started quite normal. We jokingly began to choose who would be the first to die ... after a bit of driving and hiking, they set up camp for the night. At that moment, I talked about some things that really made me turn off the rest of the movie. Two main problems I've had: bad effects and an even worse story. The first thing we all noticed was that the fires were not real ... you can clearly see the "cgi" or false flames in which everyone was sitting. For a horror movie to have such a striking effect, the flaw should have told me how I was in the next hour. <br /> <br /> Only minutes later, I was shown how badly written this movie was. I do not remember exactly how they got to the point, but basically, we discovered that the "Nerd token" is writing a book about cave exploration, etc. Another guy in the group wants to tell a story about an experience, but hesitates, stating "I do not want this story in your book." The author convinces and persuades the other that he will not put the story in his book and that he can trust it. (A direct quote: "If I tell the story, you'll definitely want it in your book.") At that point, I was expecting a story of 5 minutes or more, complete with flashbacks and heartfelt acting. What I received was a short, ill-told (and acted) statement. I say statement because what he ended up counting was 10 seconds and 5 sentences. I do not remember the exact quotations, but basically he says, "We were in a cave, the cave was flooded, a girl died when our friend saw her drown." You may think I'm overreacting and being really critical, but that's not far from being a direct quote, line by line, of the movie scene. <br /> <br /> In the next 50 minutes, The Movie takes place in the cave and although the lighting is what I imagine being in a cave, I could have actually done without the really fuzzy / hazy look of the movie, and the shaking camera is just one I did not do. go to. (I have a really good vision, and after watching the main parts of the movie, I felt I was legally blind). I was emotionally distant from this movie, so the parts that probably should have been scary were not. Maybe I'd been able to ignore the very slow and misunderstood start to this movie, I would have at least been scared, but I do not remember anyone in the dark room, even squirming in any of the "action" scenes. The last scene was probably one I'll never forget, and that's not a good thing. Basically, two women are trapped in a naked room. The "monster" arrives to attack / kill the women ... he is stopped when he sees a photo of a boy. A flashback occurs when we discover that the "monster" was injured like a little boy and spent his entire life in the cave. Cut back to the present tense, and he takes his "mask" (a large skeleton with what appears to be a suede shirt). He looks at the photo and the two women seem to have found the weakness and weakness of the cave man. At that point, he stabs and kills a girl, then begins to rape the other woman, instead of graphically. After about 30 seconds watching the camera sway and sway while he rapes her, roll the credits, the movie is over. <br /> <br /> Honestly, if I had to do all this and I lost money while renting this movie, I could have saved myself an hour and watch the first scene and the last scene of this movie and still hang out with the same thoughts that I have now. <br /> <br /> Those of you comparing this to the Blair witch are fine. off ... if any of you had read about how the director and writer filmed Blair would realize how revolutionary he was ... delivering to each cast member a screenplay on the film's day / night without the other cast members they knew what the other actor was doing is great. <br /> <br /> If IMDb left me, it would be a negative score ... I do not understand how anyone in their right mind can recommend this movie.
