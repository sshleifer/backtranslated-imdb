During my struggle to stay awake during this borefest, I struggled with my quasi-dosage to discover some silly storyline about schmucks of fraternity, quite unbelievably unpleasant, running into trouble with a psychotic, semi-human / half-radioactively damaged cyborg called Splatter who sends his soldiers behind them for the murder of his prestigious politically vocal leader (for whom Splatter killed himself, setting them up to take the blame so he could become the leader). These face-painted aberrations form a group that expresses their feelings anarchically, albeit without violence, living in dilapidated streets abandoned by the "civilized world," expressing their concerns about nuclear disarmament. Anyway, most of the movie has these five henchmen running through dark streets with graffiti walls, while Splatter and his punks chase after them. Fortunately for these guys, they find a chic punk to assist them on their journey out of this rather ugly terrain with which they are unfamiliar. This territory that fraternity guys are immersed in is a real labyrinth of streets and alleys with the idea of ​​a more difficult exit, particularly when the crazy ones and the Splatter group occupy almost every turn. <br /> <br /> Yes, I was deceived like the others. thanks to the HR Giger poster which is the most excellent. If only he had been the creator of this coward ... this is not the case and we, the viewer, are left with a film modeled after, of all the films it seems, THE WARRIORS, of Walter Hill, except that this film does not have style or scream that movie has. The film has a plethora of bland bits and weak confrontations between fraternities and punks with hand-to-hand fighting, often laughable. The setting is quite interesting, and there are some atmospheric uses of neon light, but it's not the environment that's the problem ... it's the plot and the characters within the environment that become tiresome. The saddlebags under my eyes weighed more every minute that this movie continued. Yes, Texas CHAINSAW is starring Edwin Neal (a rather funny voice man who has a fun interview on the DVD I rented for this flaming movie) and Marilyn Burns has "key" roles as opposing members of his faction against the movie . the government resulting in the final completion within a complex of buildings at the end. Neal's character, Splatter, uses these metal tips that emerge from his metal arm to kill his victims.
