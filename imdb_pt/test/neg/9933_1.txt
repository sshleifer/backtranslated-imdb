First of all, even the IMDb is relaxing with this movie, as the cast list is very "gappy". Even main characters are missing, such as Buddy, for example. <br /> <br /> Now, back to the movie. I love watching movies, but this one tortured me for 82 minutes or so. It was horrible. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And the reason it bothers me so much, is because I was very excited to see it beforehand. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is good. It could have been a great movie, if done properly and with careful casting. Golden Brooks was a HUGE disappointment. Now I see that the only role she can play in is the sexy, sexy, fun girl she does in Girlfriends. Melodramatic papers are not for her. She basically killed her character, Rachel. <br /> <br /> I love some of the cast, such as Deborah Cox, Mel Jackson and Darrin Dewitt Henson, but neither did they save this catastrophic movie. Of course it's just my personal opinion that I can not stand Hill Harper as a man, and he did not help me like him any better here, too. <br /> <br /> Golden Brooks's voice bothered me so much. that I really had to force myself to finish watching the movie. It seemed she whispered throughout the joint. The director is not even wasting board space, he did such a poor job. The editing, photography / camera focus and almost everything about this movie was SAD. Not to mention the dialogues! Absolutely unreal and often hilarious (when should make you cry and look deep within yourself). <br /> <br /> As I said, it could have been a very good movie, but it was seriously confusing. I would not recommend it to anyone unless they are important in photography and want to see an example of the "What Not to Do" type in their future work. <br /> <br /> Have a great day everyone !!!
