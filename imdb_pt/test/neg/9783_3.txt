"The Bone Snatcher" begins extremely promising with the introduction of a new and original type of invisible evil, as well as with the use of the filming location sublimely isolated from the African desert. While pipelines are checking in the desert, three miners are attacked and killed by an apparently non-mundane creature that devours their flesh and leaves only a pile of half-eaten bones. The expedition's crew sent to rescue them discover that the monster is a mutant top ant and soon they are also trapped in the strange desert. Director Jason Wulfsohn maintains a respectable level of tension until the nature of the monster is identified. Immediately after that, the movie quickly turns into an ordinary creature, with all the characters coming out of the survival race, one by one. The second half of "The Bone Snatcher" is unbearably boring; with the inevitable cliches of love stories, as well as the complete absence of bloody murder pieces. All characters are unbearable stereotypes that act and tell you exactly what you predict with several minutes in advance. There is the beginner who has to prove himself, the female with cerebral ability, in addition to his hot appearance, the detested experienced guy who redeems himself in the end through self-sacrifice and ?? Last but not least ?? who could forget the wise black guy who refers to the monster using all kinds of voodoo names. Wulfsohn goes to great lengths to make his monster look like the outer space threats of "Alien" and "Predator." The ant-creature has infrared vision and collapses when tossed, yawn! The film actually only benefits from its unique setting and the handful of unpleasant images of decomposed bodies. This could have been a modest gem, but instead is less than mediocre. Avoid.
