A very exaggerated, smart, nervous reinterpretation. <br /> <br /> They fell in the "because it is modern, it has to be sensationalistic, smooth, etc." trap. "Romeo and Juliet" took this idea with much more success, but I really think it's time to go beyond the two extremes here (period piece vs. film of nervousness). <br /> Just because this is a "modern" retelling does not mean that the movie has to look like a magazine ad, or has anything to do with drugs or weapons. <br /> <br /> If the embellishments were as subtle as the words of honey, Macbeth would be a much more powerful film. So, read your Shakespeare. Read aloud. Ask your Oxford dictionary a few questions. Skip the movie. Or not, but you were warned. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the super long review. IMDb made me do it.
