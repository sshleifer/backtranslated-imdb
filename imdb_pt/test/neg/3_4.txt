Wow, another Kevin Costner movie. Postman, Tin Cup, Waterworld, Bodyguard, Wyatt Earp, Robin Hood, even that baseball movie. It seems he makes movies specifically to be the center of attention. The characters are almost always the same ... the heroes, the defects, the greatness, the fall, the redemption. Yes, within the first 5 minutes of the movie, we should all be amazed at his character, and it accumulates more and more from there. <br /> <br /> And this time the story ... history? ... it's just a collage of different movies. You do not need a spoiler; You've seen this movie several times, despite having different titles. You will know what will happen before it happens. This is how to mix an official and a gentleman with backdraft, but both are easily better movies. Watch Backdraft to see how this kind of movie should be done ... and also to see how a good but somewhat underrated actor, Russell, plays the hero.
