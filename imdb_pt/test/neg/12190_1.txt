This movie is simply scary, as the talent involved did this is beyond human belief. I think they must have drunk when they thought of this idea, I feel like 2 hours of my life have been taken from me. Harvey Kietel will try and distance himself from this crap, it should have been a great crime film, but it turns into a bloody mess of vampires. I would recommend this movie to people who like to sleep through movies, you will not miss a thing. Humor is set to appeal. for the less common dominate, movies can elevate us and remind us that life is worth living, this movie just depresses you. As DeNiro said in a film the saddest thing in life is to waste talent this film is a perfect example of this statement.
