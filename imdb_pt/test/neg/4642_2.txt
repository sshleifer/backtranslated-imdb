Okay, granted, I'm a low-budget horror fan who along with him occasionally comes a piece of crap that even the most stubborn fan of extravagant movies can not bear to witness ... TRANCERS 6, directed by Jay Woelfel , from DEMONICUS. <br /> <br /> First of all, the TRANCERS series, begun in the mid-1980s by Charlie Band and his Empire Pictures, is basically the franchise that is about Tim Thomerson and his excellent interpretation. from the hunter Trancer Jack Deth. Well, low and behold, due to the budgets of Full Moon (which, despite what people said, actually brought in high-quality features like HELL ASYLUM and DEAD & ROTTING), Thomerson did not return for the sixth edition. Courtney Joyner returns again and delivers another below-average screenplay which features Jack Deth (played by Thomson ... in flashbacks, which are extremely poorly inserted ... he has a different hair style, like every time he is shown, and some "shemp" lying on a table) down the line on her daughter's body. Well, from now on, you have "Jo Deth" acting like Jack ... but it's a shame she does not really exhibit the same screen presence that Jack Deth did. <br /> <br /> The film, filmed in 16mm, is simply an embarrassment to the name TRANCERS ... without offense to anyone at Young Wolf Productions. I mean, I respect you for really wanting to go out and make a TRANCERS movie without Tim, but with a little more time (despite being filmed since December 2001), it could have been better. <br /> <br /> However, check out the Full Moon DVD, which is a double feature with the original TRANCERS, and features trailers for the last 10 more Full Moon features. <br /> <br /> Overall, I probably would have liked to have more features if you did not have the name TRANCERS, but like anything, you can judge it by someone's opinion and should check it out for yourself!
