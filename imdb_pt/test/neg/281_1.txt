I felt compelled to write about this movie after I joined IMDb because I thought it was the worst written script I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> The acting / directing / other areas of the film are fantastic. I love Brad Pitt with George Clooney. It works. The witty joke was still there also from the first film. My question is how in the world did they let this script get out of the crafting process? I thought not only did the plot develop like a slug running down the end of the sidewalk but this turnaround? (I can call it that) was so incredibly stupid that I wanted to go and demand a box office refund. I've never felt so touched and used in a movie in my entire life. Here I was expecting something similar to the first movie (good chemistry, good acting, good direction, incredible plot) only to find out that they had taken my 8 bucks and mocked him. <br /> <br /> One part that leaves me still is that this movie has already grossed more than 125 million dollars. <br /> <br /> In short, I felt that this movie insulted my intelligence. I still feel that the only part the writers focused on was a bit with Julia Roberts acting like Julia Roberts. This movie made me sad and angry.
