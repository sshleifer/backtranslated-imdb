Spoilers !! <br /> <br /> I hate this, but it's better than the others after that, they keep getting worse. I hope Gibson has the intelligence to stay out of the next. Much of the same with humor, ie the bathroom, children, etc. The more we can see your relationship evolve. Drugs, thugs why South Africa! I found it unbelievable, perhaps South American, that some country in the Golden Triangle would have improved the script. It seems that the late 80s, early 90s, had the bad guys, like Die Hard, the powerful Ducks play Ice Land Gary Busey in the last Weapon, etc. Hollywood repeats itself. This one with a similar story has to go over. The police attack, the condo scene on the beach, the fight at the end, and even the top of Gibson's girlfriend killed by the copper attack were too much. Like many parts 2, they get worse, and 3 or 4 in this series increase the slope speed. 3/10
