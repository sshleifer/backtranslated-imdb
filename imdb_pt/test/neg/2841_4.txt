(Some Spoilers) Dizzy like Flickers dishwater slasher that has this homeless demented Harry, Darwyn Swalve, out of Murder Realtor across the city of Los Angeles because of the high prices they charge for their properties. Looking like an extra from a "Spaghetti Western" by Clint Eastwood, Harry, who lives in abandoned houses eating dog food, gets very annoyed when his life-style as an invader is interrupted. This happens when several real estate agents have invaded your space in an attempt to sell the houses, which it sits to its potential clients. <br /> <br /> Joseph Bottome star in this horror film keg fund as radio talk show host Dr. David Kelly, the cute and popular psychologist of the KDRX survival line. DR. Kelly is being sued by the family of one of her interlocutors, Tracy, who ended up blowing up her brains while she was on the air with the doctor who could not do anything to help her survive her ordeal of taking him. The real estate killer talks to Dr. Kelly in the air about his adventures and the police try to get the phone number and address, keeping him on the line, but he refuses the order not to harm the its rating by having potential callers did not connect with fear of being monitored by the LADP. Kelly is also having a hot and heavy case with a real estate manager and busty agent Lisa Grant, Adrienne Barbeau who is the sales office are the main victims of Harry in the film. Harry also begins to murder Lisa's main competitor in the housing business, the noisy and outrageous Barney Resnick, Barry Hope, who threatened to put Lisa out of business by any means possible, even if he has to kill her. <br /> <br /> Getting Berney alone and with his pants down Harry cuts off his head while he is being entertained by one of his clients, a prostitute, whom he leaves dead and hanging out with Barney without a head. The film ends with the deranged Harry taking Lisa as a hostage and causing Dr. Kelly to try to come to his aid only to have Det. Shapiro (Robert Miano), looking like he has not slept in a week, pops out of nowhere and blows up Harry's brain. Harry quickly comes back to life minus the gay subject between his ears and kills himself for the second time in the movie being thrown from a balcony and landing on the ground like a dozen members of the Los Angeles police, armed M16 and ready, let's go the scene. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie "Opean House" worked with laughable tension almost nonexistent. Even the sex scenes between Dr. Kelly and Lisa did not save the movie, as there were very few, only two, and the sexy Adrienne Barbeau was a bit underexposed, with little light and too many clothes, Harry, the murderer of the film, was also a little comical to be taken seriously in trying to make a point, to Dr. Kelly on the phone and personally, about the high incomes and real estate prices in the country and how people like him find it almost impossible find a decent place to live. You can sympathize with Harry's concern with the high cost of living, but be very critical of him in how madly he went about fixing him.
