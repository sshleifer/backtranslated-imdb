When Family Guy debuted for the first time, I was not in a discriminating mood. With the '90s containing a wealth of intelligent and surreal cartoons, why should I be? Nickelodeon produced Doug; Ren and Stimpy and Rockos Modern Life, among other beautiful cartoons (Yes, this includes Spongebob). Everyone had a quirky and dreamlike animation and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialogues. The Simpsons have become a direct phenomenon, perhaps not as brilliant as their greatest proponents claim, but a very good investment of their time and certainly rule out the false axiom that all TV is junk. South Park began as a rough but hilarious attack on everything with a unique and clever satire underneath. It evolved to become a Monty Python spectacle - it spiked with outrageous concepts and brutally fast and brutal social critiques (as the defense of noble gnomes) and eventually became fully self-referential and "meta" like the Simpsons, and unfortunately jumped the shark . Family Guy is superficially like The Simpsons and South Park. It squeezes buttons and is a favorite among college students and bestiality enthusiasts. However, what is lacking in true intelligence is lacking. <br /> <br /> The show is famous for its use of tricks, especially for flashbacks. Many are references to bad or commercial TV sitcoms. Some are funny (especially the first two seasons), most are not. Are they inherently funny references? I'm not sure, but they're mostly what the show continues to regard as their characters are painfully uninteresting. Where Homer and Bart have charms, and Cartman has an artillery of self-consciousness and sheer indignation to support his horrible behavior, Peter Griffin has no excuse. He's just a tall, nasty pig. Anything funny coming from your character is just because the writers forget how not to feel good on that day. Lois is also very shallow and dull; Meg is a prop, just to be abused; Chris is retarded and only occasionally funny, and the two main stars of the show (Stewie and Brian) are so inconsistent in their characterizations that it's actually kind of useless. <br /> <br /> Other tricks that I can not stand up to is when a character obviously points to something and stays in it for an uncomfortably long time. This happens a lot lately and I can not take it anymore. Not just the chicken mentioned that likes to beat Peter, I'm talking about the painful moments in which they talk about pop culture and stimulate it as if they were alien spectators. This is not wit or even ironic humor, it is totally boring and lifeless. <br /> <br /> Not that the show can not be funny, in fact, some of the previous episodes made me roll. Highlights include the pilot episode, in which Peter loses contact with reality after losing his precious television; when Peters' religious fanatic father appears and wreaks havoc; When Peter becomes an agent of the Megs school, and the episode of "pancake." I suspect these are episodes that have accidentally incorporated real human traits into their characters, or have simply been times writers have had real comic inspiration. <br /> <br /> One last thing, the show is not offensive. It's just offensive to those who have not attended the show in the first place, so it's almost like a circle to the chorus of the hips.
