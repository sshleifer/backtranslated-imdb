I just watched 2FTM. The trailers intrigued me so much that I actually went to see him on the opening weekend, something I never do. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. The story has a lot of potential and it's frustrating to see it spoiled. I really feel like the problem with the movie was the direction and Matthew McConaughey. Firstly I'm not an MM enemy, I thought he was amazing in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star. I liked his performance in those films without having to see him with the shirt 3-4 times. Yes, we all realized that he is a handsome guy with a handsome body, but I think most people knew this 10 years ago when he came on the scene in A Time to Kill. Showing you with the shirt off pumping iron like crazy sweaty 3-4 times in the film is totally unnecessary. I think once would have been enough. It would not surprise me if they played those unnecessary scenes so girlfriends and wives would be willing to accompany their significant other, no woman wants to see a movie about sports betting unless ... enough about that, let's get into her role. I feel that his performance was very forced and he did not seem very comfortable. I know your character should be this charming southern, but his lines were cheeky and cheeky. It was almost as if he was referring to Days and Confused lines a few times! In short, I did not like your character, even though I should. The accent, his shirt off, the cheeky cut lines, the weak sales pitches. His character was just too much of a tool, like Brandon or Jonathan. Pacino and Assante were great, but that's no surprise. Piven is fun to watch as Arie .... oooops I mean Jerry. I just feel like this movie was very commercial and it went badly wrong. It is insulting that they could have a great story, and throw bad ingredients to try to make it a box office hit. 1. Legal story that appeals to man 2. Hollywood actor for female females (make sure he has lots of scenes with the shirt without lifting weights) 3. Al Pacino with 4 great speech scenes and 25 great liners 3 All characters Dress up in a thousand dollar suites and have an extremely dark tan 4. Jeremy Piven to play the same character he did in Entourage and Old School 4. Play Armand Assante to seal the deal 5. Batch, good writing, character development and intelligent casting are unnecessary <br /> <br /> That will be good enough for most people but not me! Anyone who disagrees with me, ask yourself this. This movie would be much better if: A. Directed by Sodeberg B. DeCaprio or Ed Norton as Brandon instead of MM <br /> <br /> I will probably be a minority in thinking that this movie sucks. I noticed this as the woman next to me began to cry during Pacino's ridiculous final scene shedding a fake tear while embracing Russo. The financial success of this film will guarantee one thing. The film that goes to the public receives what the film goes public, a big budget crap.
