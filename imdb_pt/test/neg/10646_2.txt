In the 22nd century, an architect named Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) commands a space station, which he himself designed. As can be expected, a special force is sent to pick up the expensive station and place the Merchant in custody. Upon arrival, they find him participating in a strange ritual with the use of a mysterious cube. During the interrogation he reveals that they should let him finish, what he began, or else the hell he cast will bathe in blood ... To convince the officers who keep him captive he remembers his inheritance, about the maker of toys who built the box and the reasons why it's here in space ... <br /> <br /> The film that is essentially the same for Hellraiser, that The Quickening went to Highlander. Something to be ignored and forgotten, since it will not influence much the knowledge of Hellraiser. By far the most despicable of the franchise, with a much lower feeling than its predecessors (who will face the films of class B or C). Acting sometimes seems to be influenced by a medium-budget pornographic film with unbelievable wooden performances, which actually makes you think: So, when are they going to undress and start with intercourse? Surprisingly, there is not much sex in the film, despite the introduction of the seducer-demon Angelique (a totally superfluous character who unnecessarily messes with what we know about the Hellraiser world) offers ample opportunities for lovemaking. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film consists of three abrupt stories stuck abruptly (one in the future, one in the present and one in the past) that have no focus and are rushed in an amateurish way. The end result is extremely poor, basically underlined by the fact that you have no interest in what happens to any of the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> A little blood in the movie, but it was an absolute failure.
