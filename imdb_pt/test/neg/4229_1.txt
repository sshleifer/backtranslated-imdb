I just had the misfortune to see this truly horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Think about that scene in Magnolia at the end with the slow presentation of that woman. Now, remove the pan, add the breath and the bearded men to the mix, and you have what the whole two and a half hours of Humanity was <br /> <br /> The Inspector is a real idiot, not even an idiot , just a slow-paced, slow-witted idiot. How they've settled a crime is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Mandatory sex scenes are horrible and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Eventual villain of the play (he raped and killed an 11-year-old girl). ) is flagged too early and not surprising unless you have the same idiot. <br /> <br /> Uninspired camera work. The director was there saying that it is up to the public to provide their own interpretation of the process. I suppose he also meant to provide his own dialogue (there is an entire bugger - increasing his level of boredom), inventive camera work (just static, totally removing the obvious beauty of the landscape in which the film is being filmed) and plot ! Really awful. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10.
