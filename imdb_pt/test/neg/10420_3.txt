I'm sure Poe would have considered it a farce. The first two stories are decent, nothing spectacular. And then there's Toby Dammit. What the hell was Fellini thinking? It is a disconnected piece, random and bland, with little to recommend it. One should feel frustrated with the lack of background story or conclusion, but there is only relief that it is over.
