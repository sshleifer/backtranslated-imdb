Some giant scorpions are in a submarine and they kill everyone. Two months later, some marines and the scientists in charge of the scorpion project go to the submarine to recover their cargo. After finding 200 corpses, the Navy commander tells the doctor, "I need to know if there's anything down here that could be a danger to my men." Ui, do you think? She refuses to say what's down there, citing "needs to know." Yes this is very good. One of the scientists is apparently some kind of dumb idiot - real heavy on the idiot, light on the savant. He set the task of fixing the lights. He finds the control panel for the lights, cuts a wire and yells like a banshee. Then he does it again. Then he picks up a hammer and crushes the control panel into pieces, which causes all the submarine lights to start working. <br /> <br /> And so it goes. Apparently this was done in Sweden; I'm not sure if the Swedes have a very strange sense of humor or if they are just horrible movie producers. I'm inclined to think they're horrible movie producers. If you guessed that there is a big explosion at the end of it, well, sorry, but this is necessary, so I can not tell you. <br /> <br /> If you absolutely have to see a giant scorpion film, let me suggest Tail Sting, which is a flamboyant and fun movie about scorpions on a plane, or Bugs, which is a rather B-movie B on scorpions in a tunnel. Watch this movie as a last resort. Oh, it's watchable, it's hard to turn it off just because of the madness, but that's all it has to do.
