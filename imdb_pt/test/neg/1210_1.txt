as a retired USAF MSG (aircraft maintenance), this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. the fact that a teenager can get on the flight line, much less getting into an F-16 is ridiculous. the military spend millions on each pilot to make them the best in the world and this movie makes the Air Force and all its members look stupid at best. Yes, I know it's just a movie, but it conveys a message to the younger ones that we're all idiots, and believe me, we're not. the logistics involved in creating any kind of mission are highly involved, even in the 1980s, military computers were too safe to hack into any teenager, and the other flaws in this movie make Peter the more convincing. Sorry for me, this movie has no entertainment value.
