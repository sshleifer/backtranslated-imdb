Does not that sound familiar? Oh, wait, that's right .. 90% of the jokes in this movie have already been made in the TV series. What's the point of repeating yourself, you may ask? Is it for the benefit of Americans who have not seen the show? Were the writers uninspired? Or maybe everyone on the set suffered a sudden attack of amnesia and forgot that they had already covered this floor? Anyway, for someone who has watched the first three series, that was pretty boring. I had to turn it off during the 'tablets that turn your green water' part .. yeah, its very funny, but give us something original for the love of god! In fact, if the best new thing you can do is Leonard Rossiter's on Saturday Night Fever, you can forget it. <br /> <br /> The guy they managed to replace the late Richard Beckinsale is a similar guy, but not half the actor. Personally, I exorcised the role, as a mark of respect for him. Or better yet, do not worry about making the movie, and just let the hilarity of the TV series speak for itself. But no, they could not do that ... not as long as there was money to be made. Sad, really. 4/10
