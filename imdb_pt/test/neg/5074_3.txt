As? I wondered why I had not seen this in theaters, or even a single commercial for him, and then, after I saw the movie, I realized I had been cheated HARDCORE. I'm a big fan of Transporter, and a big fan of Blade, so when I saw this I pictured a killer fight scene between two badasses, lots of shootings, a lot of things. Instead, I received the film Ryan Phillippe with a brief participation of Statham and Snipes. The guy who does the audio and video in the criminal lab has more time on the screen than Wesley. It was like renting a Jackie Chan movie expecting a lot of kung fu and getting Erin Brockavich. I expect bad Hollywood movies, but actors like Snipes and Statham should treat the fan base better.
