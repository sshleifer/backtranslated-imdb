Lame. Lame. Lame. Ultralame Should I continue? There is one, I repeat * a * funny scene in all this amateur and fun Special Hour of a movie: the fat father of Fares Fares hitting someone with his beer belly. That's it. The rest of this nothing shocking and mediocre stack consists of the typical bored-looking Swedish "actors" who deliver the dialogue that enters one ear and leaves the other, a banal story, careless direction, and, well, little else worth mentioning . Cast nefariously Fares Fares is as charismatic as an accredited accountant and his nose rivals that of Adrien Brody in terms of ridiculous immensity. Torkel Petersson should only work with Lasse Spang Olsen. The rest of the cast is, fortunately, easily forgettable, while Fares's giant nose and phony will always haunt me in my dreams. <br /> <br /> Josef Fares helps to ruin Swedish cinema. Do not support it and its absurd. Jalla Jalla is for comedies what Arnold Schwarzenegger is for the performance of the character, Kopps would have been much more respectable if it had been a YouTube video without a budget, and Zozo was simply the most pretentious and false garbage that had ever been released by a director Swedish. Wake up and smell the roses: Swedish films can be so much better than that, so stop pretending that Fares movies are worth it simply because they are "good for being Swedish." Please.
