I never wrote a comment about IMDb before, but this movie was so bad that I had no choice but to warn you not to waste the two hours of your life. As an avid historian of World War II, I do not even know where to start as this film was historically inaccurate. Carbines with Korean War bayonet wings, cleaning rods and safety sights absent from the K98k, German uniforms that did not exist, the list could go on forever. Added that it is loaded with flaws, it has literally no plot or climax and is acting in tandem with its local high school theater. The epitome of cheese. <br /> <br /> PLEASE ... there are many good films about World War II to waste your time with this crap.
