I can not say if "The Cavern" is a ripoff from "The Cave" because I did not see it. I've seen "The Descent" and this is not terrible, but it's very difficult to watch and so is this. Difficult to watch, as in, there is very little light and very fast movement, so you are pressed to say what you are looking at. There are times when I think you should be scared, judging by the music, but afraid of what? Bad camera work? Poor lighting? If that is the case, this should be the scariest movie ever made. The story is that a group of cave explorers goes to a cave in Kazakhstan (home of Borat) and makes its descent, but something is (of course) in there with them. And what is this? One guy says it's a wolf / bear hybrid, that is, just before it's torn apart, but whatever it is, you can not see it. And when you think (or expect) that the movie is running out, as the screen dims a bit, you see the two remaining cavers (the two women) wake up somewhere in Betty and Wilma's outfits and start trying to find their way out from wherever they are. They drink some water and begin to eat SOMETHING until they find out what it is and begin to vomit ... and then the mystery of what is in the cave appears, and you will simply be surprised. Maybe not. Dumb dumb dumb .... I think I'm pretty well done with cave movies at this time, 2 out of 10.
