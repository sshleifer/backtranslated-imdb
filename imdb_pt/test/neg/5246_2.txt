Christopher Lambert attracted me to this film. What a waste! The plot has more holes than my string vest, the special effects were not very good, it did not take long to find out who the creature's mother was and the creature owed more than a small debt to Predator. Anti-climatic this movie could have been made much better. That raises an interesting point, though. When will Hollywood discover the rich vein of European folklore out there just waiting to be mined?
