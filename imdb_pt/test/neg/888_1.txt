I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life. Date movie. That was bad. But this ... this is just ... not good. House Party 4 is the worst movie of all time. It's that simple. It's basically Ferris Bueller with black people. Oh, and it's not funny. It's awful. So horrible. Chris Stokes may be a superstar at BET, but he's an idiot. He can not write a comedy. Or a horror movie. I like to refer to him as a lesser and lesser known Uwe Boll. Except that Uwe Boll's movies are funny, if you know what I mean. You can invite some friends, show up in Alone In The Dark and have fun laughing and eating snacks with your friends. Chris Stokes is like that except that if you invite friends to watch House Party 4 with you, no one will laugh. Not even the bitchy guy or the illiterate athlete. I'm serious, do not laugh once during this whole movie. The acting is terrible and the movie looks like a bad indie movie. What was the budget for this movie? 5 damn dollars? I mean, what the hell? This movie sucks; Do not waste your time on this crap. It's disgusting.
