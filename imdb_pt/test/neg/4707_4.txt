I just watched Goliath Awaits I asked for from my library. I vaguely remembered from years ago and wanted to watch with my son. Anyway, the movie was less than 2 hours long and I thought it got a lot longer when I first saw it. The back of the VHS box states that the Goliath "contains a Nazi archive whose secrets could destroy the free world forever." The divers were supposed to be on a secret mission to retrieve the demonic document. There was nothing said about retrieving this document. In addition, the box says that the "insatiable boiler of the bestial ship feeds on human blood." This would make it a horror movie and there was also nothing revealed in the movie about it. I can not remember the details when I watched this year on TV ... but can the back of the box be true? Maybe the 3 hour movie revealed more details ?? <br /> <br /> Just wondering if anyone knows anything about it.
