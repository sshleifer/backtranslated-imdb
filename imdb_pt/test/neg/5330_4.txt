I've been fooled to see this for many friendly comments here. Boy, they are far away! Giving this 9 to 10 points and calling it "one of the best films of the 90s" is simply unjustifiable. The big problem here is lack of rhythm and a fine plot like paper. It's like antics in Prozac. Everything is predictably and indifferently. The plot is weak to begin with - two garbage collectors spy on their naughty neighbor, witness a murder and unravel a garbage conspiracy - and the film can never go much further. There are some fun situations and decent acting but this is nothing close enough to save this movie from a heel. <br /> <br /> It's just a comedy that does not take the fat ass off the floor, so why waste it? your time?
