This movie smells. No money, no acting, no nothing. I got this in the movie tonight at 3 in the morning and felt compelled to comment on it. This movie has nothing to recommend it. I can not believe it has already been released for US television! No one in this movie can get out of a paper bag. The failed comedy attempts fall flat on the floor, the special effects consist of a worm-like "worm-like monster ... I can not even begin to tell you what that production is like. It looks like it cost maybe 50 thousand dollars to shoot, but only because it's at 16 millimeters, and that's probably a generous estimate! Anyway, I lost interest quickly and had to be content to watch "Matlock" reruns instead of finishing it. This is how this movie is bad !!!
