This was one of the worst movies I remember seeing. I'm sure I've seen worse, though, if it slows me down. <br /> <br /> The humor is not funny, there are stupid stereotypical jokes that, again, are not funny. I was a captive audience on a plane and I saw this movie. It was a complete waste of time. I liked Martin in the previous films, but not this one. Like Queen Latifah, she was great in Chicago and in Set It Off she was good too, but that role was horrible. <br /> <br /> I mostly credit the flaw in script writing. I feel strongly that you can not save a stereotypical, bland script with decent actors, this movie as an example. Still, everyone involved should have been wise enough not to participate in this film. I am struck by the fact that something so bad can become green, made, released in theaters and promoted.
