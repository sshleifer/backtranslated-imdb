***** Classic **** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Tragic Review: Oldboy is not for everyone. It is widespread violence, the eating of live octopus and is an unimaginable story. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a man who has been kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years, Oh Dae-Su is released, only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days. Now the story may seem exciting to begin with, but once you watch this festival of bloated and not original blood, it develops into a mixture of bitter blood and a strong film. <br /> <br /> The direction is at the level of the average and by no means the standards of what a South Korean thriller should be. Oldboys acting scenes are parallels with boring humor and a poor writtern writing. Oldboy is occasionally presented with performances of fine straw that one could only feel shameful about. Verdict: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, but it's scope and vision is not clear enough to see more than the gray abyss of fog. <br /> <br /> Tragic
