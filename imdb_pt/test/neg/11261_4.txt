I read all the novels of Dave Robicheaux and I consider James Lee Burke my favorite contemporary fiction writer. I also visited New Iberia and a lot of Acadiana to be able to better visualize the scenario in most of these books. Needless to say, I expected a lot to see "In the Electric Mist," especially since I thought Tommy Lee Jones would be great as Robicheaux. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed. The story was very hectic; the interaction with the "ghosts of the Confederate dead" was superficial and lost the impact and nobility it added to the book; and Tommy Lee Jones was sad, unimpressive and difficult to understand as DR. The best way to describe this forgettable movie is to add my "idem" to a previous user comment that this movie was like one of those old movies made for TV. I expected Jill St. John or Cameron Mitchell to show up at any time. Location settings were accurate, and the photograph sometimes captured the essence of the muffled juicy junctions of juke and scary ground graveyards in southern Louisiana. Too bad that the disjointed performance of the story and the underperforming performance of Tommy Lee interfered in the unique mood and spicy enthusiasm of the region. <br /> <br /> Next to the final comment: In the novels, the nickname of Dave Robicheaux is "Streak". because of the distinctive strip of silver hair on one side of the head. (Similar to how Pauline Walnuts of the Sopranos would appear if he were seen only in the profile.) Tommy Lee did not have this tendency in this film, probably because the editors are fans of James Lee Burke and they retouched the thread after witnessing Jones' case . Final imitation of Dave Robicheaux. <br /> <br /> Final comment: Although I generally find Alec Baldwin pompous and unpleasant in most roles, he was by far a better Robicheaux in "The Prisoners of Heaven" than Tommy Lee was in "In the Mist." In addition, Heaven's Prisoners is much more interesting and exciting, with uniformly convincing performances and a more evocative atmosphere than this new movie. <br /> <br /> "In the Electric Mist" is good to watch when it feels like "veging out" and there is nothing better on the TV. But then, they are infomercials.
