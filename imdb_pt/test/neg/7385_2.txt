man was so hard to watch! was not funny, was not well done and had no sense or plot for it. the acting was horrible. it was not well done. It seemed like a bunch of kids my age were just going around and making a meaningless movie. is by far the worst broken lizard film. If you are a broken lizard movie like me, you will be disappointed and bored until your death. please skip this nonsense movie about ugly faces looking for girls. you will not regret your advice. by the way, do not say you did not find this comment useful just because you did not agree with it. This is stupid, like this movie. the only OK scene was when the main guy was playing rugby and was defeated. I liked this cause, I found your character very annoying.
