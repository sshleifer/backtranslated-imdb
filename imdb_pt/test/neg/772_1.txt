Sideshow is a good example of a basically interesting idea that was very, very wrong. When it comes to horror movies, and especially with the influx of teen movies at the moment, a movie based on a group of teenagers watching a mysterious show of horrors is something that you could enjoy yourself with. However, the writer has decided to make a very straightforward, very boring, very simple tale about five teenagers who become part of the show when angry dwarf Abbot Graves turns them into freaks using some pathetic machine that turns them into beasts <br /> <br /> The five teenagers are picked up one by one until the last guy stays, their 'punishment' is that he is unable to join his friends and so 'stand alone'. What a load of rubbish! The actors are really poor, this movie has no comedy (and it could have been so funny!), without blood (and could have been so horrible!), without action and without horror. (and could have had both of them!) <br /> <br /> The director failed in his duty to try to make it a little interesting to watch. His experience in soft-core obviously deactivated any creativity he may have had, since all the scenes are the same, with very few editions and little movement. The overall quality is poor. <br /> <br /> I'm not usually influenced by nudity in the movies, but believe me the only highlight of this movie was a pair of breasts.
