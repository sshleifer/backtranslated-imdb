... do not waste your time watching this project of vanity. I've already had my deleted comment twice, for reasons I still do not understand, aside from the suspicion that someone involved with "Gone" is not happy with what I had to say. So I've narrowed things down this time with an excerpt from my original comments that can not in any way be taken as a personal attack on anyone, or unfair comments: "Gone" is the type of train accident that gives new meaning to words Horrible and blistering dialogues, a script that simply flutters like a fish out of water, acting to shame the most egocentric, cinematic theater divisions inspired by the school " Survivor "of crane shots, followed by static close-ups, nostrils, awful ADR work, special visual effects that are not pedestrian music that can not sustain any mood or emotion, terrible editing with nonsense freezes and disappears , no art direction to speak - the litany of evil simply continues ... I felt genuinely misled by the time it took me to advance for the most part ... for a long time it could have been better spent looking at a wall ... Under no circumstances should anyone be enough to be reading this subject for this "movie" because long before they finish, they will be wishing they were "raptured" before to make that mistake. "<br /> <br /> Case closed, a man.
