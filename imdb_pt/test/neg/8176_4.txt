This may not be the worst movie to win the best shot, but it's up there. Well on second thought this is probably the worst movie to win the best picture. Still, you'd expect it to be worth filming. This, in fact, although it is also questionable. The movie contains almost no depth and is just "fun" after "fun" if you want to call it that. At first it is very interesting, but it seems that everything is exaggerated on many levels. <br /> <br /> The performance was not spectacular to watch, but it was very interesting to see Charlton Heston in his first leading role. I found many of the characters as the tone of the movie annoying after some time. Who I really liked was James Stewart as the philosophical clown. He saved me the film in which he gave a much needed extra layer. Unfortunately, after Stewart there was not much else. <br /> <br /> The direction of the much respected Cecil DeMille was nonexistent to me. I found the film tacky at times and its use of Betty Hutton was a mistake. The look of the movie was very good sometimes, but it did not generate that magical feeling that the classics need to have. The writing was actually very good, considering how shallow much of the film was. From movies like that came the term "Hollywood Trash". There is no depth, no valid attempt to draw emotions from the audience and simply no artistic value to the film. Then of course the many holes in the lot all over. This movie was consistently annoying and frustrating. I even had the sense, through this movie, that much of what I was watching was not just an imprecise depiction of circus life, but the opposite of what it really is. Why this won best picture is beyond me, but it's not like the first or last time the Oscar goes and made a mistake.
