I never comment on a movie, but I must say that this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I feel like it was done by a beginner movie student and not to put talented movie students, but that was awful! I did not buy the lead actress and felt I was in acting class with her while she was in the movie. Her decisions were very secure and I feel she was imitating other actresses in movies and not acting and making her own decisions. The direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves. The ending may have made a bit more sense if there was someone narrating the events and not a song. I love Patsy Cline, but her songs appear quite frequently in movies. Maybe the selection of songs might have been a bit more original. The song "crazy" was a clich√©. Like I said before, I never comment on movies and I've seen my share of good and evil, but that was the worst. Excuse.
