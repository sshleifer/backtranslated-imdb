As the title suggests, there is a philosophical and meritocratic thread that runs through this film: if a man has talent and seeks to find the way to society and money, what would be the result if he denied it for not having the factor X? This question is unsatisfactorily addressed in this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's book and left me a bit chilly along the way. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is the Ripley of the title and besides clearing the way on a financed tour to Europe falls under the spell of his commissioned target, Dickie Greenleaf (Law). Homoeroticism and social insecurity blend into a violent conflagration that intensifies and complicates for the rest of the film. Law, Damon and the extremely nice Paltrow as Dickie's girlfriend are fine. I enjoyed the special participation of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Freddie Miles, the society friend Ripley could never be. The problem is that the story is lumpen with no bow - or redemption, incidentally - which makes it rather difficult to swallow. 4/10
