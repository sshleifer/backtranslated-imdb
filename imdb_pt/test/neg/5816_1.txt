If you are looking for a movie with beautiful pictures of Mount Everest, then you can enjoy this movie. Just jump forward to the mountain views. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Alert) However, if you, like me, believe that lives are precious and not to be wasted, then this movie will leave a bad taste in your mouth. 6 people were killed, 5 Sherpas and a Japanese party member just so a man could try skiing on Mount Everest. <br /> <br /> The question is raised in the film about whether the continuation of the expedition to meet his personal goal was still worthwhile in lives, and he replies an emphatic "Yes." The part about skiing is in the last 15 minutes. He skies for a short time, then falls the rest of the way until he stops in the snow.
