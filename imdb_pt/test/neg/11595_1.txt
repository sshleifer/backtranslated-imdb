As a total movie geek with the fortunate job of video store manager, I usually watch all kinds of movies, from good to very, very bad. This was a film with so many lines of cornflakes, extravagant CGI effects and predictable plot points that I laughed long before turning it off after 30-40 minutes. The "creature feature" genre of the movies has put horrible things in recent years (Godzilla 2000 anyone?), But this movie makes me think that the creators were not even trying. It may be worth checking out just the potential of "making fun of me" (counting the shots!), But I could not, in good conscience, recommend this movie to anyone.
