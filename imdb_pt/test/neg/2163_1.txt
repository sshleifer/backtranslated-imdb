Cyber ​​zone, as this DVD was sold in Oz, is about the worst B-Grub I've ever seen. In addition to a restrained and impassive act by Singer, indicating that he knew how bad the movie would be, the other actors sway over genuine line-of-sight attempts (Swanson and Quarry) or absurd imitations of classic movie scenes. Mathius Hues makes the most detestable portrait of death since Jim Carrey's Mask. All this without real discussion to suggest an attempt at parody by gender, period or any common vein is simply irritating. Do not even try to put the points together with the plot. It's Blade Runner, disguised with little content, actors or scenario due to a very limited budget. "You get what you pay for" is never more apparent. There is a repeatedly irritating reuse of limited sets with no attention to the trim of clothes and a host of special effects that would have hit the cutting room floor for Dr Who in 1976. The helicopter explosion deserves a setback to demonstrate my point. Of course there are masochists who will absorb this tripe, but if you are watching this movie for a bet, make sure you get more than your pay rate. For $ 2 this DVD will make a rollercoaster cheap and interesting.
