This movie was missing in many areas. It's about that kind of Elvis that runs cars and is approached by these cyclists from SATANS ANGELS. One of them is called Banjo and they beat up college kids for fun. They want the Elvis guy to be their "driver." Sometimes I wanted the MSTK3000 people to be quiet because the movie was really good. Of course, there was violence and a lot of cheese lines, like "What kind of beer do you want? A COLD ONE". That was cheesy. The guy who plays Banjo is a great boxer and I was happy to see him do some fight scenes. In addition, the cyclist named FATS had a NAZI SWASTIKA on his jacket !!! That was very bold if I should say so anyway.
