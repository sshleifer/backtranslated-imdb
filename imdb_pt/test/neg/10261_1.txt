Everything about this movie was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was bad. And it was all the blood and blood that was in "Demons" which is a good movie and was not scary at all. My brother said that this movie was bad, but I had to give it a try, since the first movie was very good. When the movie ended, I understood why my brother thought this movie was bad. The only advantage in this film was the music of "The Smiths" and "The Cult", but this is a movie and the soundtrack to music is not the most important thing. And I saw that four sequels were released after this movie, I did not see any of them, but they can be as bad as this, I have no plans to see them, but maybe I'll watch them for some time.
