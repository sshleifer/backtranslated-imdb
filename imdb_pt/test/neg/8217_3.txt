The film successfully presents a graphic depiction of the suffering of forced sex work, but nothing more. The leftmost agenda behind this movie can be seen a mile away and leaves the viewer so embarrassed while watching this feeling. Thus, women are abducted and sent to the former Yugoslav territory to work as sex slaves because (breathe deeply) the American military institution is corrupt and looks away while its private security agents sell people abroad. You do not need half a brain to see the relevance of the war in Iraq and the Black Water Company. <br /> <br /> What a load of crap left most! It seems that all my life I have been deceived into thinking that this problem and many others were a direct result of the control of communism in this region for 45 years. But no, it was the American war in Iraq, which is also responsible for earthquakes, tropical storms and the constipation I had last week. <br /> <br /> The film ignores the fact that 95% of the sex trade is women willing to sell their bodies for money and entry into the western bloc. You also see scenes that are so stupid that you want to pull hair. We have someone chasing a woman on the streets of London in broad daylight, spanking her, so somehow she drags her unconscious body 800 yards back to the apartment where he rapes her. No one sees this or calls the police, and the woman who runs does not mind shouting during the chase. Better yet, we see 4-5 women lined up in central London later - in broad daylight to be sold, one of them has a crushed face, and people are shopping in the background as if nothing was happening. You can not do this stupidity. <br /> <br /> I used to think this garbage was exclusive to Hollywood, but apparently I was wrong.
