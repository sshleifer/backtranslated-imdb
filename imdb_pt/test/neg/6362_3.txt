Well, this movie was not as horrible as I thought it would be. I was hoping to give a star. I chose to give three. Because? Well, for a horror / science fiction movie, it's not that bad. Of course the characters are cheeky (as is their acting - including a young Leonardo DiCaprio), the effects of cheap appearance, and the monsters ... well, let's say I've seen more effective Halloween costumes in elementary schools ... But there was something about this movie that made me watch it to the end. A little humor helped a bit, I guess. And if you've always wanted to see an alien gas, this movie will let you live your dream. 3/10
