Thunderball and Never are two of the biggest box office mistakes and Never is a surprise farce from the hero of Empire Strikes Back, Irvin Kershner. Klaus Maria Brandauer seems to steal the show when, in the midst of the plot unfolding, Bond's mission turns more to Hollywood (sometimes when Basinger comes in). How about Klaus Kinski? I still think the cast of Largo does or, as is evident in both films, breaks the story. Worst of all is Connery's attempt to get past aging and hairy as the sex symbol he really was in the 1960s. The '80s were a barren time for Bond movies, though For Your Eyes Only is a great title . Sometimes, when I need to spend some time on vacation watching this movie at the frequent festivals of Bond reruns, I think the best attribute of the film is its score, and I do not like soft things. 80s 'jazz'.
