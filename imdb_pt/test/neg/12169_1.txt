I remember when this show came out. It was originally announced as a mini-series. At the end of the last episode, he said "To Be Continued" to the dismay of all the people who had watched the boring thing beyond words. Finished as it should, so yes, you can blame the series for not having end. The plan was for there to be another obviously if the ratings had been higher, but it was a boring show for so long, and the angry people did not end up saying yes, so they never did again. Some of the comments blame the cancellation and lack of finalization of the public, when the truth is that for this program, this is not the case, it ended the way it was planned to end, it is just a bad end.
