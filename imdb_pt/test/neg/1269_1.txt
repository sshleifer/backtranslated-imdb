I was excited about the concept of my favorite comic book hero being on television ... and very disappointed with the end result. <br /> <br /> The only "surprising" thing was the wall screening (despite the visibility of the film). cable). I did not think Nick Hammond was Peter Parker ... and he was visibly of a different constitution than the guy who did the acrobatics in the spider suit. You could say that they were two different actors. Granted, I can also see in the modern Spider-Man movies when I'm looking at Tobey Macguire and when I'm looking at the CGI. But this is from a trained eye and CGI work experience. Still, the 70's version could have been better, despite the lack of special effects. <br /> <br /> The webs were fake and they looked like ropes that seemed to involve things instead of sticking to them. And what was happening by giving him a spider phone to walk around. He is the personal web slinger. <br /> <br /> Sorry ... I did not want to get so excited, but our beloved wall tracker deserved better.
