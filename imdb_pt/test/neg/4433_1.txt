Calling this disaster film will be a euphemism. I do not even know where to start! I have questions, and many of them. I wonder who designed this script? Who gave them money to make this movie? Who was in charge of casting and costume? They should all be prosecuted! I saw this movie in the catalog of my local library and thought, "Hey, great!" I had just seen the two FOG movies that Hollywood produced and then realized that Bollywood had a version. Unknown to me, it would become a total and utter exaggeration! <br /> <br /> Dhund - the fog, is a film about four friends (actually only one of them, but you should know that there are four friends), one of them is a beauty queen (played by 1st Mrs. from India). World, Aditi Govitrikar) and the director spares no expense to let you know that. The script even states that she (the character's name is Simran) has Aishwarya Rai's eyes, Kareena Kapoor's lips and Rani Mukherjee's hair. Feel free to vomit if you want, at least at this point you have not seen the movie, unlike me poor. Simran gets a death threat one day from one of the uncles of the contestants, who tells her to give up the contest so that her niece would have a better chance of winning, but Simran's boyfriend does not allow her to do so and so she participates in the contest and wins, which causes the uncle of her former college classmate Tanya to come after her, but with the help of her cousin Kajal, Simran drowns the guilty party and they list their two boyfriends in the task of getting rid of the body. It's difficult, but they eventually do. "In a scene borrowing from Hollywood's Diabolique movie, the pool where the corpse is hidden is only drained to reveal that the body is missing and this starts a conundrum of Whodunit and Where-is-it? By the time the movie is over, the movie successfully steals scenes from 'I know the that you did last summer, I still know, Scream 1, Scream 2, Scream 3, Murder she wrote episodes and not m Columbus and Scooby Doo '! No shame, I tell you! <br /> <br /> Inconsistencies and problems within the movie include, but are not limited to: 1. A meager Simran caters to phone calls three times from his possible killer, the camera shows that she left the phone off the hook, but the phone can ring again each time, and she answers to answer it. <br /> <br /> 2. Tanya tries to kill herself because she does not win the beauty pageant? WTF Even Aishwarya Rai, who is ten times prettier, did not try to commit suicide when she did not win Ms. India! <br /> <br /> 3. At the pool scene, children who come to retrieve the ball that fell into the pool disappear conveniently as soon as the police arrive. And the ball disappears too. <br /> <br /> 4. The assassin's clich√© blue contact lenses change from blue to brown in the drowning scene, but when his corpse resurfaces, his eyes are blue. <br /> <br /> 5. No one who dies in the movie is lamented (strange, especially to Indian society). <br /> <br /> 6. When Vikram jumps into the dirty and dark pool, an underwater camera shows us his actions and miraculously the pool is transformed into Olympic size and is clean and clear as day. <br /> <br /> 7. The sexy belly dancer performs a soggy pseudo-orgasm song and a dance number over the age of majority. That would have been cool for some bachelor party, but they were celebrating the win of the Simran contest! Hello!!!! <br /> <br /> 8. Kunal, Sameer, Simran and Kajal can not dance nor Lip Synch properly. But do not blame them, just accept that there was no choreographer for the dance numbers. <br /> <br /> 9. Nothing in the movie was choreographed, it was like they just told the actors to show up and do whatever they want. <br /> <br /> 10. The film unfolded as if there was no script. Either this or the director was loud and drunk filming this crap! <br /> <br /> 11. When Simran's photo was published without her consent in a magazine, she flew to the police headquarters to arrest the photographers, but she receives death threats and never bothered to alert the police . <br /> <br /> Just to mention a few of course. This film was a painful experience for me and I advise everyone to ignore it by all means necessary and possible. Bollywood should be terribly ashamed of this kind of film.
