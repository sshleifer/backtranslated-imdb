In a farce key, Gaud√≠'s afternoons can be taken as a mediocre exercise. Marcia Gay Harden and Judy Davis made a good cast (Juliette Lewis's new-age weird character was incredibly removed from reality, I know a young American who croaks like her !!), but GA does not show much beyond her plot told. While movie production has to do with believing, there were some notable inconsistencies in the script. Two samples: you pay 14 euros to enter the chapel where Cassandra and Frankie meet, NEVER at 7am, and you can not leave a terrace without paying the bill (they will charge you on the spot if they do not know you) or get out of a cab like that (Americans always tip taxicabs even if they do not wait, but the footage portrayed in the movie was ridiculous). Do not believe me, reader: come and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> If you've never been here before, you might not care about it, but good movies should be considered regardless of their origin. No one knows about GA here, and I'll make sure it does not change in the future.
