You'll feel like you've been vacationing in Hell after sitting and watching this horrible TV movie. This film is an over-action (very bad over-act) exercise for situations that have made it to be more than what they are. I will not give up the plot, but once you realize why the people in this movie are fleeing the native man in the movie, you will demand the two wasted hours of your life back. The only advantage is to see Marcia Brady running in a bikini!
