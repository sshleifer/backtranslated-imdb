I am the only person who thinks the entire Forensics and Crime Scene community in the US should detest this all-powerful spanking on their faces. A rookie cop is the first to a crime scene where his support is so slow to respond that she has time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera. By the time he returns (still no senior cops, SOCOs or other assistance to the lovely Jolie - this is New York, is not it?) It started raining and she starts working on photographing the evidence, only after she stood in front of an Amtrak to prevent it from disturbing the scene. <br /> <br /> I want to know the name of that camera, since the photos were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zoom distorted the images !! The horror continues: - not in the film itself (quite common I'm afraid), but in the character of Lincoln Rhyme played by Mr. Washington. This man is a highly dedicated Forensic Crime Scene Examiner with years of experience who, instead of the highly trained but invisible Examiners of the local Crime Scene, entrusts the work to an inexperienced cop, a rookie cop, who proceeds to find the clues and move them before you photograph them, contaminating each item and making the DNA profile virtually impossible. Now that was a brilliant idea huh? I know one should be able to suspend disbelief to some extent, but those who say that this movie is clever must have completely disassociated themselves from their thinking ability to find this film believable. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 4/10 by the superb performance of Denzel Washington and Miss Jolie's lips, which are the only items that require my disbelief to be suspended!
