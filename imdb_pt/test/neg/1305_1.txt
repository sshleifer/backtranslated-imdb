This movie follows on the tracks of The Riddle to an all British cast in an absolutely horrible movie! Bad CGI effects, bad editing, bad direction, a cast that I hope has been well paid, as this will be a nail in many career coffins. <br /> <br /> Nigel Planer should have dressed his Neil wig one more time & left with a laugh at least! It was like a particularly long and protracted episode of "Torchwood," but without the fake Canadian doctor from the camp ... he had the same overly dramatic, perpetually repeated music in a vain attempt to raise some tension. <br /> <br /> Oh, mankind!
