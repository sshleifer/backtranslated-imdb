Before I dismiss my post as "do not understand", let me tell you ... I am one of the biggest fans of Richard Kelly and "The Twilight Zone" out there. Donnie Darko is one of my all time favorites and I even thought Southland Tales had its moments. I'm a big fan of science fiction. I was very excited to see "The Box", could not wait for him to leave. <br /> <br /> That said ... "The Box" is terrible. Behind "Drag Me To Hell," this was the worst movie I saw in 2009. And it just will not end! Whenever you think you have come to an end, another change in the plot and you are going for more torture. I was really moaning in the movies at the end of the movie ... I could hardly take it anymore. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with "The Box," no matter how you do it or try to justify it is that it just makes little sense. Trust me, I understood, I understood what was happening. But that does not mean it makes too much sense to look back. Take the basics, for example. The main couple ... Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, playing Norma and Arthur Lewis. Diaz loses her finances at her job, then laments to her husband that they are "living from salary to wages." Well, sell that f-ing Porsche your husband is driving then !!! They live in a beautiful 2-story house in a beautiful subdivision. Marsden is working on what appears to be a well-paid job at NASA and Diaz is a talented teacher. And yes, Marsden drives an overly expensive car. But are they somehow living wages to salary?!? No need to press the button, just cut down your expensive lifestyle a little! The film would have worked better if they had shown the unemployed couple with serious debt. Instead, they are seemingly desperate for money ... all the while living what I would call a luxurious lifestyle. Like I said ... you can understand what's going on, but it still makes little sense! This is a rare combination. <br /> <br /> There was a horrible scene in a library that I feel will fall into one of the worst segments of film history (acting terribly along the way). It was stupid, illogical and out of place. I can not even begin to describe it completely, so I'll move on to a subplot that involves nose bleeds and body possession by aliens. (Yes, I'm serious, unfortunately). A boy is in Diaz's class with a wicked smile and a smile on his face (a sinister smile that apparently goes completely unnoticed by all who have authority at school). He begins to ask personal questions to Diaz, literally embarrassing her in front of his class. No punishment is given to the boy ... he was not even invited to stay after class for a lecture! So Diaz is at a party ... and the same kid is one of the hired helpers ... past shirt, apron and everything! I do not know many alien-possessed kids (who seem to be in Junior High) who also make the moonlight as a bus boy at parties sponsored by teachers and school staff ... but we found one here! (See what I mean ... you can fully understand it, but it still does not make sense ... a rare combo!) Like many things in the movie, the kid comes and goes ... no real explanation about him, not ending with your character. Moving on ... A lady then approaches Diaz at a grocery store, telling her that the experiments are being done secretly and that her family is one of the guinea pigs. Well ... hmmm ... if aliens own the powers where they can remotely control a body ... and the aliens do not want to help Diaz ... so who was taking the body of this lady and giving Diaz advice? ! Again ... The girl was trying to help Diaz ... and the aliens were not interested in helping Diaz ... so who the hell was controlling her body?! Never explained. I never talked about it again. There's nothing !! It goes on like this and so, for what it seemed, 2 weeks. That would not end! I wonder if this movie went through a massive re-filming at some point. It was poorly edited. Diaz's accent was there in a minute, the next. Sub-plots started but never ended. The numerous setbacks of the release date obviously show the problems producers had with the finished product. It really is a train disaster. <br /> <br /> Pass by this one ... there is no redeeming value in it. 3 out of 10, just because I like Diaz and sci-fi! But it probably deserves a 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading! <br /> <br /> JD
