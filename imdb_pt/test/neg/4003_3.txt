Predictable Unmotivated Pointless Caricatures Contrived actors did what they could Actors clearly indicated they were ashamed of doing so There is no emotional connection REAL SEQUENCE OF THE FILM "Who are you calling?" (sic) "The police" (sic) "You can not do this, Stevie." Turn off the phone "(sic)" Jesse has a lot of drug money, you can not involve the cops " I'm sure stealing money from criminals is a crime, even if they arrest him, at least he'll be alive. "(sic)" Listen to me, Stevie, this is not right, Jesse will end up dead. . "(sic) Best friend starts to bear arms Brother," Hey, what are you doing? " No reply. "Hey, I have a family to worry about." (Remember that your son is sitting there watching all this) Then more and more and more exposure <br /> <br /> Notice how in the above sequence, in no time the police on the other line says "Hello? Hello? We can hear everything you're saying. We're sending someone there now. " <br /> <br /> Embarrassment for all. Oops
