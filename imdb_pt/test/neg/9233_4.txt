I understand the director's purpose of telling stories that are not stories, but the way he tried to show the passing time (the two runners, who first appear running together, than running around with a stroller (sic!), man alone ...) and to connect the "adventures" of the characters (the final scene, with the maid going up a mountain watching the big black on another cliff, and then seeing the boat with his former employer and saying "Oh, a boat ! ") were terrible. At the same time, I liked the way he portrayed the middle-upper class, even overly. I think it's a bad movie. If you want to watch it, do as a film student, trying to see technical aspects and issues. It will help a lot.
