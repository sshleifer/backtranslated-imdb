Nothing that Carson Daly has said or done about this show has already made me laugh, or even smile a little. I do not understand how this show survived for so many years. <br /> <br /> Even the "funny" band member is like one of those kids in high school who thinks no one is good enough to even look at him. Daly and that guy are just arrogant boys of brotherhood. It seems they do not even try to be a little funny. <br /> <br /> Show AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. <br /> <br /> It makes my soul cry. <br /> <br /> I just can not emphasize enough how amazing this show is. Do not watch. But if you absolutely need it, I recommend scratching your eyes and clogging your ears with cement beforehand.
