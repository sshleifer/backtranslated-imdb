The title is from a passage in the Bible (Deuteronomy 28:28). Let's just say it's horribly out of context - but nevertheless, that's where the title of this dying movie originates. The other reviewers cover the details of the plot, so I will not repeat it. But the husband, who is a psychiatrist, gives a lecture on "Bottom Function," where he discusses how a person may know someone else and may experience a "cataclysmic crisis" in his life, where he ceases to be self-possessed and unable to fair trial. He is saying this on the podium just as he looks into Leonora Vail in the audience - the woman who will become his lover. It is not too subtle to show that this is really what will happen to this poor man. <br /> <br /> I think the whole premise of the movie is implausible and simply did not work. Here is an exaggerated psychiatrist, and we must believe that this beautiful young woman falls in love with him and falls between the happiness he and his wife shared. What is even more implausible is how the betrayed wife responds when she discovers infidelity. She not only understands but also INSISTS that her husband embarks on several months' vacation with the homeless - "so that we all may have a little relief from this unbearable stress." GIVE ME SOME TIME!! I wanted to reach across the screen and strangle not just the adulterer, but the stupid woman. <br /> <br /> The fact that the whole movie happens as a flashback after already revealing the end of the movie in the beginning. (the fact that her husband suffered a terrible accident) - leaves no doubt as to the outcome of the sordid affair. I think that was a bad decision, since it leaves no twist in the story, since the whole movie is completely predictable. You already know of the wife's resignation to the case at the beginning of the film, when she calls the lover to the bed of the dying man and does not express ill-will toward her. <br /> <br /> It's not just the faulty script, but Noel Coward is terribly miscast (though it's his screenplay). He and Leonora have absolutely no chemistry on the screen. It is interesting that Michael Redgrave was originally cast for this role but was replaced during filming. I wonder what that was? In the end, neither husband nor wife makes you feel any sympathy for any of them. I think Margaret Leighton played the prostitute very well. But she could not beat all the negatives that this movie had. In addition, as is the case with many British productions of this time, the dialogue is difficult to understand due to the pattern of quick and clipped speech of the actors. I saw it on TV and could not even trust closed caption to fill in the blanks for me. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this.
