Despite a small handful of well-executed scenes, this entry (the fourth) looks tired. Toshiharu Ikeda, who directed the superb SEREIID LEGEND and the seminal Japanese film Splatter, EVIL DEAD TRAP, shows little enthusiasm for the rancid premise. A scoundrel becomes obsessed by an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porn photo shoot. Predictable harassment, harassment, assault and rape occur. <br /> <br /> The staple of Roman porn is sex. And sex mixed with violence. Both potentially exciting subjects for sure, but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh. A masturbation scene in which a woman forces the opening of the pen (through the condom) is very little disturbed until late. <br /> <br /> The rain theme of the series continues and the final scene of the film brings relief.
