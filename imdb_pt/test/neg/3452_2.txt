This is a bad movie. It certainly belongs to how not to make a feature film category. History, direction, acting and style are plans like a pancake. History consists of five? Yes Five ?? football matches spread throughout the duration of the film, each more filmed than the previous one, as a dysfunctional amateur soccer team strengthens. That's it, this is the plot. It's hard to know who this movie is. It is very banal for football fans and there is nothing for teenagers or adults. There is nothing for women, not even a female character. It is the monotony that wears you when the team plays game after game after game after game after game. History, as it is, dialogue and mannerisms seem to have been drawn from a past Ireland, with all the actors making Dublin theatrical accents. It does not have to be seen to be believed. Avoid at all costs. Can someone give me back my 90 minutes? High point credits in the end, too many low to mention. Brendan Gleeson is in this movie.
