So, what do you do if you're a faded-looking porn star? I know, become a pop star! This documentary - and I use the term loosely - follows Colton's trials and tribulations as he tries to transform himself from a gay porn star into an electronic music singer (read: dance). I just wanted Mr. Ford's voice to be as muscular as his arms ... sorry to say that his vocals are painfully thin. There's not a lot of interesting happening here, but Mr. Ford and his friends are eye candy. <br /> <br /> Watch him record a song that sounds just like any other irrational dance music. Watch him travel to New York to make "connections." See him return to LA with little success. See yourself looking in the mirror and ask, "Why am I wasting my time watching this mess?"
