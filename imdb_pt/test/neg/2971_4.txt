Silly comedy launches an embarrassed-apparent Ray Milland as a British officer in second world war Europe escaping German confines and taking on a man-hungry gypsy woman played by Marlene Dietrich. Slow, long and wrong: the footprints are too old for this type of juvenile forage, although Marlene shines in her lonely moments. It took three screenwriters to adapt Yolanda Foldes's book to the screen, but that stuff must have looked like 1947 - it smells like something Ernst Lubitsch could have produced in 1939. The scenery is moldy and the stars have absolutely nothing. chemistry together. ** in ****
