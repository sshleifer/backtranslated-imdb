Yes, I admire the independent spirit of it all, but it's like a Road Trip with a bad cast and no budget. I laugh when I watch American comedies, I do not laugh. This movie made me laugh, but only because of the abundantly obvious attempts to simulate high-budget American high-school / pot-flicks. <br /> <br /> If you want a good independent American comedy with marijuana referrals, go watch Kevin Smith or Richard Linklater flicks or something. Do not waste your time with this piece of film. <br /> <br /> I mean, how can you take those comments seriously when most people are complaining that the characters are not smoking marijuana! <br /> And by the way: in Norway it's called "Dude, Where's My Pot"!
