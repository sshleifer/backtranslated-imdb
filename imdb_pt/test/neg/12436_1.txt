Look, do not get me wrong, I love independent movies, but Come on! I could barely sit without wanting to kill myself. the director had absolutely no talent and he turned something that might have been good for an F *** Nightmare. I'm a punk enthusiast and even music sucks. acting was crap. <br /> <br /> I'm usually a bloody heart for these low budget movies, but this one, I have not even tried. Please do not waste your precious time and money. I'm sorry for being so hard, but come on! dragged himself and so on. Remember when the kids came in at that party with the weird cupcakes and the watermelon martinis? How did they blend in? He was frustrated how they could go anywhere they wanted and get into trouble and have sex and a "meaningful conversation" with whoever they wanted. I know I'm blabbering, but my mind is just buzzing with everything I hated about this movie.
