There was a time in the United States where everything was possible in the movies, then came the roughies, movies containing horror and explicit scenes. The most well-known are Forced Entry and Waterpower, but of course they were made with a little budget. All shown at 42nd in NY, but hey, there were other grindhouses out there that did not show any budget roughies. Wet Wilderness is an example of this. It circled the underground scene after a time so copies were available but as seen in other reviews, some copies were abruptly cut to completion. But the version I saw was complete. Well, I'd call it another porn, then a rough one, there's a serial killer around, but he likes to see others having sex instead of killing them, when he kills, it's done off-screen. The acting is the worst I've ever seen. And I figured the so-called actors did not like what they're doing, for example, at the beginning, when we have the lesbian scene, watching a girl stop performing and pulling a pubic hair out of here, so keep doing what was happening, or when the mother is riding the black man, the daughter is sitting in the grass irritated by ants! But it is the plot that made this famous, incest and racism what it made famous. When there is blood, watch the two girls sitting waiting for a cue to act, god, that's worse, but it's still something you should have if you're in trouble and grindhouse. Make sure you have the full version.
