I hope this is not an omen of things to come. High definition camcorders are getting cheaper all the time (though I'm not sure that's what's been used here), so it's an opening season for all aspiring Scorses and Tarantinos. <br /> <br /> There's no hiding the stink of this stinky price tag, and calling it 'movie' would be doing a great disservice to the industry. The photograph is of a standard you would expect on a family outing to the zoo. I could build a new house with all the woodwork. What is remarkable about this is that no one stands out as the worst. They are all equally terrible. Like a lot of Ben Afflecks. Or Steven Seagals. <br /> <br /> What fooled me was the title. I'm a sucker for this sort of thing, like Frankenhooker, or Monsturd. Frankenhooker was pretty bad too, but at least I got some laughs from that, and the acting was just plain bad, not horrible. I can not comment on Monsturd as I have yet to get a copy of him. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I hope the people who did it do not make a living out of it. Otherwise, they may be encouraged to try again. Please, guys, pawn the camcorder and go back to your regular job.
