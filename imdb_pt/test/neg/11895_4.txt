I saw this last night at the Tribeca Film Fest and the holy god was very bad ... From the script to the editing, to the acting, to the cinematography - none of this worked. Not to mention that the set designer was so absent-mindedly wrong for the time frame (it covers the years from the late 70s to about 2006). Even John Hurt, who is usually an incredible actor, was so ridiculous. Granted, Quinten Crisp is an over-the-top guy to begin with, but Hurt was given nothing to work on here. I do not know much more to say except the audience I saw with absolutely loved .. so maybe it's just me. But the public loves anything at the film festivals when they sit next to the director and all the actors. It's not a very accurate test of how good the movie is or how well it will play. Personally, I thought this movie was terrible. On the other hand, it was so terrible that it was hilarious. Get drunk and get shot while on HBO in 2 years, if it's that far.
