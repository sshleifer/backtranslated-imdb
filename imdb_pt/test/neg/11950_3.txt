Go to the store and get the original. I do not understand why Hollywood has such a need to make a perfect foreign film and remake it. "Mostly Martha" or "Bella Martha" has a much better cast. Beginning with the heroine Martina Gedeck, who convinced me much more in the role of the job-obsessed perfectionist than the most famous Catherine Zeta Jones, with the Italian cook and the niece suddenly deprived of her mother and forced to live with an unfit, unfit for the rearing of children. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the American version of the film is a copy of the original German. They just traded the actors. However, they also changed the story because it would have been difficult and unconvincing to materialize a father for the girl in an American context. <br /> <br /> I was thinking about it. Maybe the father could be Puerto Rican, Cuban or Mexican. Well, there are many "guest workers" in the USA. Choose your choice. But I doubt any of them have appeared to take responsibility as the Italian father did in the original. So the American movie leaves that part, but it keeps the Italian cook. And in doing so the whole story changes. In the original "Martha" is so far from reality that she thinks it's okay to send her niece with a complete stranger in a foreign country. <br /> <br /> The American "Martha" is softer and therefore the film is sweeter and does not have that advantage that the German film has. In the original, the "Italian" cook is not so beautiful, but much more charming, the little girl is more a brat, but much more believable, and "Martha" is more representative of a career woman . world than the diluted version, we are presented in the American version. And all the opera music in the American version was very annoying. I loved the Italian songs in the original and bought the CD. <br /> <br /> Hollywood acknowledged that "Mostly Martha" was a great movie. Maybe the distribution companies should put it in more cinemas or it should have been shown in English without subtitles. In any case, the original is much better. By the way, this reminds me of another remake. "Let's Dance" is one of my favorites in the original Japanese version and totally forgettable in the American version.
