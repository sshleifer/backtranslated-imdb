Tu pa tam is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But on the other hand, it's better than most Slovenian films, which are full of depressing characters and stories with no bright idea. Your pa tam is bright, optimistic and without any artistic moment. In many interviews, director Mitja Okorn has tried to tell us that his film is of high quality just because it did not cost much money. But to think like this is wrong. Your pa tam is a very bad movie for me. The dialogues are very badly written (90% of the screenplay consists of swearing), the characters are stereotypical idiots, the story and their twists are very predictable and the action sequences (this movie supposedly an action comedy) are filmed very poorly and without any style. Okorn is just thinking that he is even bigger than Quentin Tarantino so he is copying his style during the 90 minutes. The mood of the film is very cheap and primitive (Okorn probably thinks the constant curse is funny). In my opinion Tu Tu tam very cheap (not only by budget) movie with stupid story and very very bad acting.
