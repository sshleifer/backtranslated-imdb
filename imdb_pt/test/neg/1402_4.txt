I just watched this horribly depressing drama and realized that in the light of recent dramas like these, the only ones who could be considered abnormal are those who least know that life is nothing more than tragic. I would suggest how nauseatingly defeatist and counterproductive this conclusion is, even though the relationships and perspectives such as those presented in this film are in fact grounded to some degree. But instead I realized that these films made the very determination of the great trivial "tragedy" when the same boring situations, the same suffocating dysfunctional families and friendships continue to manifest themselves, only if they were repeatedly in some sort of attempt to eliminate distortions of family life (many of which existed in the 1950s and earlier, with personality aberrations and increasingly subtle character), supplanting them with the "reality" of how things really are. That, in fact, what we are watching is no longer the dysfunctional, but, in fact, normal existence and a set of circumstances that actually existed all the time, but of which we may have been unconscious and therefore ignored or at least O The only problem is that many movies have tried to demonstrate this. And doing it almost identically. When I read the synopsis of the film, I immediately thought of 'Ice Storm'. While watching the depressed lack of life of the Travis family, who seemed to endure repeated emotional reprimands, I immediately recalled "American Beauty." And in some ways, the interactions between the parents and the middle son, Tim, I drew similarities from 'Igby Goes Down'. "Imaginary heroes" may be a new, perhaps refreshing experience, considered so by an honest character portrait which, as said before, is not allowed in family movies (which is idiotic to think anyway, considering that we were already seeing these types of relationships shown in movies such as "Ordinary People" as early as 1980, and going back even further than that). But for the well-versed viewer, these films can offer nothing new. In fact, they have become a tiresome testimony of many filmmakers who may try to outdo each other with the amount of traumas and apathy they can accumulate in a family (and here, this extends to neighbors and friends). In fact, "Imaginary Heroes," the latest in this genre (I think there are enough films to declare it exactly as a "genre"), cram so many disasters and surprises into one family that they would award prizes for a movie. daytime talk show host. It is the story of a family that is tested by the suicide of the eldest son, a talented and decorated swimmer who hated sport with passion. The younger son knew this, the father was stunned and blinded by the pressure for the competitiveness of his star child. And it is not clear that the mother and the sister had much relationship with the young man. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's no less fun (to some extent, for those who find this material thoroughly depressing after a while), and the performances are very good, especially by Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels. I hope, however, that filmmakers who in the future want to add comments on distressed family relationships (which coincidentally or not always seem to be white upper-middle-class white families) want to offer something new through material and insight. I should not see distinction (and consequently, no purpose) otherwise.
