It starts with Fulci playing a version of himself, writing some ideas about how people can die. Followed by a fake-looking cat eating what is presumably a brain. The copy I watched was dubbed in English, which I always hate, but I was particularly disappointed not to hear Fulci with his own voice. <br /> Fulci is in a kind of feverish state working on his latest horror film. His stomach turns when he sees things that resemble the effects of his movie, and he begins to hallucinate that he is witnessing acts of horror. He visits a psychiatrist who hypnotizes him and unfortunately he does not have his mental health improved in mind. I remembered the psychiatrist played by David Cronenberg in Nightbreed by Clive Barker (1990). The psychiatrist of this one is interpreted by David L. Thompson, that is very bad. Probably a real-life friend of Fulci, he has a big grin full of teeth when he kills people, although this may be Fulci's black humor at work, which I thought was very poor too. <br /> <br /> The film is made up of a lot of clips from Fulci's films, as if Fulci were on the set directing them, watching recordings on TVs or witnessing the acts. I've never been much fan of clips on TV shows, and I also think things like the Entertainment of Full Moon by Charles Band cutting their old movies and putting three of those cuts together as new anthologies are pretty bad. I think they need to make money? The psychiatrist of Cat in the Brain makes reference to the theory that violence in the movies generates violence in real life. One of Fulci's coworkers talks about having a team of documentaries following Fulci to see how his life is. A lot of self-referential stuff like this. <br /> <br /> In the end, some of the characters navigate a boat called "Perversion."
