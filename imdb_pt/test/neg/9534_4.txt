What a waste of talent - though it seems that Crudup in real life is much more like the insipid, selfish, characterless character he portrays in this disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> In art, sometimes empty spaces reveal more than painted or created content. What this film reveals is the unconsciousness and contradictory / competing, unresolved impulses of the film's director / writer. It unintentionally shows the lack of awareness that a truly evolved and deeply conscious character must have and be tormented in order to deserve empathy or sympathy from the public or whose fault is used to serve as a warning to the public. But this movie fails at any level in this regard. <br /> <br /> The fact that Cal, the main character (much more an antagonist, not a protagonist in the true sense of the word), has no empathy for anyone. , especially those most deserving of it (who DO NOT include it) and that he has this exaggerated, authoritarian, self-pitying, self-complacent complaint, combined with lack of remorse and no sense of guilt or awareness of their impact. in others - all converge on this film to make it the epitome of the self-involved narcissistic sociopath, stuck to development - somehow this is now the gold standard for men in the cinema and in the world at this time and time. <br /> <br /> One of his counterparts (James LeGros) states with a real flash: "I bet you have not done a good thing in life - and I bet you will not." Captures the absolute essence of the character Cal. Something that the other characters he invades in the movie seem to notice quickly, although the director has piled the deck to manipulate the sympathy for Cal. This is a testament to the talent and skills of the supporting cast. The eventual return of Cal has nothing to do with the development of the character, the transformation or the evolution of consciousness. It is only about the final capitulation that until something better appears, he may be back to his comfortable and comfortable status quo of habilitation, where life is easy and no one will require it to grow - something of which he is voluntarily incapable and disinterested in doing. <br /> <br /> The film could have been pointed and intentional about showing the traps and tragedies - the devastating effects of this kind of lack of awareness, but it excuses and glorifies it instead - in fact, it pampers itself in self-pity along with the arrogant, selfish, and emotionally rickety main character. <br /> <br /> (and this certainly sent shivers down his spine as he thought of recent revelations about convicted murderer Scott Peterson). <br /> <br /> If you want to see Crudup in his most nuanced and full of exciting potential that was never really realized in my opinion, see the underrated "Inventing the Abbots". ...
