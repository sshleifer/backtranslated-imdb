Need I say more? The reason why the good Australian version of Kath and Kim was, as mentioned, good, was because of her hilarious and funny originality. The reason this new American version is so terrible is because so much of it is taken directly from the original. Not to mention infidelity to the characters. Kath is to be an idiot. Kim is destined to be fat. Kel (or Phil as they dubbed him) is to be pathetic. Brett (or Craig) is a loser, not a person who acts like heroin and ends each sentence with 'face'. Thank God Szubanski did not sell her rights to Sharon, she would probably end up being a tall, skinny blonde whom Kim likes. <br /> <br /> Kath and Kim are mothers and daughters. They should not be two years apart. And they are not meant to laugh like schoolgirls. This show is a shame to even share the same title as the Australian version. America: Get your own television shows.
