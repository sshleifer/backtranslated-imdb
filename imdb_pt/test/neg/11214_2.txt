This review contains a SPOILER --- <br /> <br /> The movie is a mysteriously trained American Ninja in the martial arts. He falls in love with the Colonel's daughter and passes from the most hated cry of the post to the "hero of the people" at the end of the film. This movie is extremely fancy and very poorly researched. It is good for people who do not care about plot or reality development. Good for children under 14 years. The military mistakes in this movie are comical. I remember that during my three years in the military, we, the private, were not forced to greet or call the "lord" of the NCO, the film does this in several points. The colonel's hair is very long in the ears. The master-sergeant's mustache was against the military protocol in extension. At the post, the colonel was the only officer around. No other officers were shown walking in the mail. You had idiot ninjas brandishing swords against troops with m-16, badly made. <br /> <br /> People filming stink. Michael Dudikoff is not so bad, he only has bad scripts. The ninjas were more hilarious than dangerous. Avoid this movie
