A plane carrying some scientists and a prototype of a DNA machine, a powerful and revolutionary invention, crashes into a jungle in the Pacific. The insurance company sponsors a rescue expedition, led by Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), owner of a large corporation, owner of the prototype, and father of one of the scientists. There, the group finds the remains of the plane five miles away from the expected site and the machine and the remains of the people. Also, they realize that a Sasquatch, a kind of Big Foot, is chasing them. This movie is so ridiculous that I do not know what I'm doing, wasting my time again on this crap. The direction is horrible, the actors and the lines are horrible, copying parts of 'The Predator' and even 'The Blair Witch Project'. To summarize how bad this movie is, her best scene is when Marla Lawson, Andrea Roth's character, is injured, and the expedition's guide says she needs an injection of tetanus vaccine. Andrea takes off his jeans and the guide says, "nice asses, but the shot needs to be on your arm." Ridiculous! My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Sasquatch, The Abominable '(` Sasquatch, The Abominable') <br /> <br />
