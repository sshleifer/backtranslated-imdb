It's sad that some think this movie is worth watching. I'm Russian and I'm angry. There is nothing in this movie that deserves praise, except cinematography. However, I am not of those who find beauty in death or perversion. I think this movie is poorly designed and directed. There is nothing more annoying and even infuriating than blatant speculation in art (if you can call it art of garbage). Balabanov wanted to shock viewers with the pervasive evil and managed to create a hopelessly gloomy film. But the biggest shock is Balabanov's prime-time work. I would never advise any of my friends to watch it. Huge disappointment!
