** May contain spoilers ** Okay, let's conclude this movie in one word: bad. Two words? Too bad. Now why do I think so? Let me explain. Guttenberg leads a special operations team of four people who are assigned to resume a deadly virus after a gun dealer stole it from a laboratory. They do this by attacking the gunsmiths in the middle of a flight and somehow recover the virus after some fighting. However, suspicions about Guttenberg arise because one of the terrorists knew his name. After questioning, team members are attacked by unknown people and everyone begins to suspect that everyone else is involved. After deciding that they can not trust their bosses, they decide, once again, to steal the virus and try to attract potential attackers. <br /> <br /> In theory, this is a plot that could have worked on a low budget budget. movie that only wants to be shown on TV. However, the plot is compromised and the movie ruined in multiple accounts. Firstly, the plot is totally predictable and it's no fun to know how the movie will end after three minutes. Second. The acting is really bad, or the actors are directed to act like dolls. There are not too many emotions, change of facial expressions, etc. I was especially disappointed with Guttenberg, who I believe can do much more, but fails completely in attempting to be an action hero. Besides, although I'm no expert at all, I totally believe that I could put together a better secret operations team, picking up five strangers and training them for a week. This seems to be a theme in the movie to do things as stupid and unprofessional as possible. That goes for good guys, villains and bystanders as well. So I sincerely doubt the scientific and technical advisors, if any, of the film. For example, I poured liquid nitrogen into my hand and did not break instantly. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to actually finish this, but let's say that this movie has a predictable plot, bad acting and they seem to be amateurs at anything. Sorry, it can not be better than that. Do not watch this movie, it's not so bad, it's funny. 2/10
