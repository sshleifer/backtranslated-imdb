Oh, how critics have fallen on themselves to compliment their goldenboy Paul Schrader (author of Taxi Driver) when this movie came out. I've never seen the qualities they were detecting when I watched this movie in the past, so I checked to see if I misunderstood. Mishima is extremely uninteresting. This is a cool and unnoticeable movie about an author living / working in a dark and cold culture. Flat reconstructions do not hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and bewildered. And the rest just gets horrible there ... with soldiers singing songs about the manhood they compromise, about purity, the admiration of swords, and so on. <br /> <br /> It must be a triumph when you learn that you landed Philip Glass; but then you have to take something from him. The score of glasses does not offer a differential of his other work, nor does it provide the film with any perceptible value. In 2010, it should be clear to anyone that Schrader wasted his career on a work with no impact or importance (Cat People, AutoFocus, Light Sleeper, Patty Hearst and American Gigolo). It can get you bored to pieces and kill the urge of a movie, faster than any other. Schrader made a resume full of bad and amateur movies.
