This movie is a disaster inside a disaster film. It's full of great action scenes, which are only meaningful if you throw away the whole sense of reality. Let's see, word to the wise, lava burns you; The steam burns you. You can not stand next to lava. Diverting a smaller lava flow is difficult, the more significant. It scares me to think that some can really believe what they saw in this movie. <br /> <br /> Even worse is the significant amount of talent that went into making this movie. I mean the acting is really very good. The effects are above average. Hard to believe that someone read the scripts for it and allowed all this talent to be wasted. I think my suggestion would be that if this movie were about to start on TV ... look away! It's like a train accident: it's so awful that once you know what's coming, you just need to watch. Look aside and spend your time with more meaningful content.
