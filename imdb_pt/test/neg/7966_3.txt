There is no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was a talented director. Many of his films are undeniable classics that have stood the test of time and are highly watched until today. This list can include the 39 steps, Rear Window, North by Northwest, Dial M for Murder, Vertigo, The Birds, Shadow of a Doubt and some other movies. does not age well and is really so unattainable that it seems to me that it was probably a bad movie even by the standards of 1941. The list of scenes that work well can be listed in a box of matches with a crayon. The script is loose and ridiculous most of the time, but the acting seems so forced and wood and amateur, which is almost unbelievable. Joan Fontaine tries to calm things down, but she's on a slippery slope and Cary Grant does not pay much attention. His acting is so bad that I've seen better performances in high school plays or college theater classes where a Chemical Engineer is acting for the first time without formal training. <br /> <br /> After about 30 minutes of watching this movie you can find the sleeve of the DVD in the dark to see if you accidentally picked up some kind of special edition that was assembled without any editing. <br /> <br /> The subject is serious, however, the film has a silly and silly feel that seems so out of place that you become numb with perplexity. <br /> <br /> "Suspicion" is basically impossible to be seen and another BAD film very overrated.
