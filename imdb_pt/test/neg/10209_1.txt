No Holds Barred is a movie that should never be taken seriously. It sucks hardcore like a serious movie. See more of the way you should plan the 9 from outer space. They are one in the same where both are so bad that they are funny. The funny moments in No Holds Barred are usually the ones that should not be. When Rip (played by Hulk Hogan as only he can touch them) picks up the front limousine driver after his first meeting with Brell (Kurt Fuller) hilarity follows and is a part of the movie that every person should see. It could be the funniest scene of all, I swear. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as someone thought that this movie would make money, I would never know and that person should probably be beaten. I hope they have at least been fired. This movie gets 1 of 5 on my scale and this is only for the unintentionally funny parts.
