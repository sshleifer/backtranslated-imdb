This is what my friends and I kept asking each other throughout this movie. We could not believe how stupid it was! I think someone filmed it on their home camcorder and put it in the movie store and put it on the shelf as a joke to see if anyone would pick it up. Well, I think the joke is on us. <br /> <br /> I think I should have come to this site first and read all the comments he got, each saying that this movie is HORRIBLE, STUPID, and so on. And boy are they right! Although it did provide some good laughs (me and my friends were really drunk) because it's so stupid. We just can not believe that someone was dumb enough to make such a bad movie! I swear this had to be done in the 70's before they had good technology for movies and stuff like that, because every scene looks really bad, but when I looked here, did it say it was made in 2001? What? It sure does not look like a movie that would be made today, but I guess that's what you get when you use a camcorder and record home movies using strobe lights and lasers that look really fake, and you use real-life people from your hometown of actors or up to aspiring actors. BTW-some of those puppies (or were drag queens, we could not tell!) They were so fugly, even my horny drunken college classmates did not touch them with a 50 foot stick. <br /> <br /> So there's absolutely no appeal to this movie, bad acting, bad writing, bad direction, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. Do not waste your time or money on this, you will be completely disappointed!
