An old high school teacher used to brag about having seen all the movies I did, so one day a friend of mine and I decided to make a movie called "Pacific Inferno." Later, we discussed whether the lead role was Carl Weathers or Billy Dee Williams. Our teacher found the argument interesting, so he came up to us and informed us that the lead role in "Pacific Inferno" was played by Jim Brown. We thought he was stuck in a lie, that was until we went to the library and found out that "Pacific Inferno" was actually a real movie. This incident forced me to rent the movie ... it's horrible. Our invented film had a better plot than this piece. Weathers and Billy Dee would have been much better in the picture.
