<br /> <br /> Very tiresome and laborious adaptation of Amis's amusing satire. The hero is portrayed not as a sympathetic loser, but as a mere scoundrel. Most of the rest are pure caricatures, with only Helen McCrory putting in real quality and providing something of the wit of romance. The setting of the period is camped out as if it were the 1920s, not the post-war period of the horror comics and rock'n'roll. A real failure, even by the bad TV standards of the UK. <br /> <br />
