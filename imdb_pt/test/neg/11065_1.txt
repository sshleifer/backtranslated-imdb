There seems to have been some money behind this movie, but it would be impossible to imagine a movie so poorly planned and executed if I had not really started watching it. To begin with, since we are in the cave with the characters (the usual stereotypes of young adults we have known in horror films since the early 80's), the film is filmed almost entirely in close -up. Since the actors are wearing helmet lights, it means that all we see are dazzling lights alternating with total darkness - we can never see what the characters see; So when they yell "Look there!" we're allowed to beg "What?! Where?" Ultimately, the film has a strobing, stinking, nauseating light effect, meaningless until we get to the end. <br /> <br /> And I will not say what the 'end' means - but you will recognize it if you have already seen the old early 60's Arch Hall laugh fest "Eegah!" with Richard Kiel. <br /> <br /> But what crazy person would like to make a variation on a theme like "Eegah!", long remembered as one of the worst movies ever made? But that's what we got here, people. Except that, unlike "Eegah!", "The Cavern" is not the idea of ​​someone's goofy fun. It is unwatchable. (I ran at x2 at normal speed, only to end it, hoping that I would actually be able to see something at the end of the movie, but when I did that, it was just stupid.) This movie provided me with a satisfying moment, though; since it cost a couple of dollars, after I took it out of the DVD player, I managed to break it with my own hands - what a relief!
