At first, the film seemed to be going very well, they had the character profiles defined ... the plot seemed to be headed in the right direction ... however, as the movie progressed, it seemed that the director was focusing on the wrong kind of things. ..or just a lot was edited from the movie. The identities of the characters have changed for the worse in the film. Also, there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning - in other words - they had things inside the movie that did not seem to fit into the movie itself. And the title ... not where in the movie the title fits the movie ... I suppose the title works for the previous ones ... The actors did well with what they had ..... if they had a better director and writer, maybe this would work better. But that did not happen. So now there's a terrible new movie coming out this Friday .... My opinion! ... do not waste your time or money.
