This is the worst movie I've seen since a long time. Historical accuracy is totally non-existent. For example, James Wolfe, who is portrayed as a Canadian antifranceso, is exhibited in London during the summer of 1759. The natives are like Indians from a bad Hollywood movie of the 60's: they wear deerskin clothes and ride horses. never ride a horse). The film is taking place in Quebec City, but filming takes place in Louisbourg, showing the Atlantic Ocean. <br /> <br /> The original scenario should include the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, but the producers abandoned that idea. saying that the costs for uniforms and participants would be over 4 million dollars! I think they've never heard of re-enactment. <br /> <br /> The whole film is planned to be a new Titanic: an impossible love during a historical tragedy (the fall of New France). There's even a song played by Celine Dion at the end of the movie (yes, I stayed until the end of the movie, but I'm deeply sorry). But worst of all, this movie cost $ 30 million. I just do not know how they spend all that money. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my anger, but I'm very angry.
