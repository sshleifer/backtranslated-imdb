This show sucks. was put on Fridays on the roller coaster, and while it undoubtedly destroyed the theme of Friday's programming, I will judge it rationally ... I still think it sucks. It really is super lame. Zoey and his stupid friends are weak characters and the pot sucks and it's too bad. <br /> <br /> Lame continuity and marijuana sucks and I think dialogue and joes are weak. The weak mood and lame characters are bad, and the whole show is frankly a disappointment that is not worth watching. It sucks and it's really, really bad. It really has to be one of the worst shows on TV, it really is not worth watching. I mean, how weak and annoying can a show be before being destroyed?
