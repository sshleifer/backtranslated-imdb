"Tenchi Muyo In Love 2" is the third film by Tenchi. It looks like its creators took elements from the first two to create this one. At the risk of giving spoilers, Tenchi is kidnapped and the team has to retrieve it. Nothing new there. A past love of Yosho is the bad guy. This was done in the second film. The battle between Aeka and Ryoko is starting to get boring. The film has almost no action scenes and very little comedy. I personally do not know what AIC, the manufacturers, were thinking. I gave this movie a vote of 4.
