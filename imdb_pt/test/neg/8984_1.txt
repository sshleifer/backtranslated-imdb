I do not leave IMDb comments on movies, but this ... this movie was bad. very bad. I swiftly advanced most of it, stopping where I hoped the performance had improved since the last scene, just to continue with the rapid advance. Lot of Formula - once the obvious killers were discounted, there was only that which was left. And that was in the first five minutes. Scene by scene it seemed that I had already read the script before because there were no surprises, no mystery. The character Tori ... bad acting bad. A real waste of time on DVD and a definite 'Let's go to bed early' option if it's the only thing on television. If you watch this movie, you will realize that you will never be able to regain the time you have just wasted.
