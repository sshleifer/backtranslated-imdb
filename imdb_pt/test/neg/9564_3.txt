It's funny how instinct tells you something. For example, as soon as the company's credits read Nude Image, I knew instinctively that I had seen a really bad movie for them somewhere before, but could not remember where. However, I knew that JUDGE AND JURY was going to suck and it was. Maybe I'm psychic? <br /> <br /> !!!! SOFT SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The opening is quite violent, with several people being carried away because they have no more reason than to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I do not know about you, but I'm getting a little fed up with exploratory onscreen violence these days along with bad language, especially if it's criticized by actors as bad as those in this movie. Either way, the plot revolves around the bad guy being executed and coming back to take revenge on the man who shot his wife. Oh, did I mention the bad guy and his wife murdered some people on their wedding night? Yeah, he's a real jerk. In fact, it's so bad (and I do not want to say that acting - I'll get to that in a moment) that he's impossible to take seriously and that's before he runs only to return as Elton John, Elvis, a French chef etc. I wonder if Keith David got paid for it? because he seems like he's having so much fun on the screen that's the only reason he's playing the part. Too bad that this reviewer did not have any fun watching JUDGE AND JURY. Hey, maybe the producers could send me Keith's fee? Gawd just knows I deserve this. <br /> <br /> I did not really like this movie as if you had not guessed it and my main meat is not with the stupid plot or the cheap production values ​​but with your attitude towards violence. If like me, you had a bottle of wine broken over your head or you were kicked several times in the ribs, you will know that violence is an obscene and painful thing, but JUDGE AND JURY will make you believe that if you window, go through some balusters and fall twenty feet on a table, not only will you not be unhurt but will be able to escape from a pair of rabid diabolical dogs. It can be argued, of course, that any film starring Sly, Arnie or Bruce also suffers from this same dishonest demonstration of violence, but with JUDGE AND JURY, my current was ripped out.
