Hello everyone - for what it's worth, I'm in a PhD program on Indonesian politics and I came back this semester after about a year of fieldwork, mostly in Jakarta. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of movies. In general, I would go out whenever I could and buy tons of local VCDs while I was there. This I have seen in the theater since it opened while I was there, and fortunately I closed soon after. <br /> <br /> Who was the intended audience for this movie? The spoiled wives and daughters of the Indonesian super-elite whose antics are weakly and ineffectively parodyed? The vast majority of Indonesians who could never afford a single dish, let alone a full meal, at the site of the movie's central restaurant? Or gay Indonesian men, whose dilemma in the Muslim-dominated society of the country is reduced to an absurdly simplistic preaching, how to respect themselves. <br /> <br /> If all that were not enough, the soundtrack was recorded or mixed so ineptly that even native-speaking Indonesians could not hear many of the lines. <br /> <br /> Soon, if you're looking for a high-end gay film from a region of the world that seems to be the least likely to produce such an animal, forget it. "Westler" from the early 1980s, or "My Beautiful Laundrette", from the same era, have been far more successful in dealing with homophobia and doing so by not showing incessant and verbose scenes. <br /> <br /> In general, an unfortunate waste of money in a country that still can not educate all its children, nor keep them healthy.
