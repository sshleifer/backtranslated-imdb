A feminist treatise in which if the observer believes that: i) wild animals are rarely tamed by singing but instead attack, kill and eat (the line that bears never attack unless provoked is a joke - unless " provoked "means meat); ii) homosexuality is both immoral in itself - and its acceptance almost always associated throughout history with signs of dissolution and decay of a society iii) few women are bisexual (in this, virtually every woman is presented as having no preference for men or women) iv) divorce is much worse than infidelity v) land exists for human beings to use, develop and enjoy vi) it is the responsibility of a mother of an adult child to maintain contact as with the child vii) mother raising your child alone is an unfortunate and real tragedy for the child viii) a father's idolatry for worthwhile ideals is a good and healthy thing ix) adults continue to be responsible for their sexual behavior, regardless of their age, and duty to engage in this intimate and act-giving only within the most intimate and openly sacrificial of relationships: marriage - believe me, you will NOT like this movie! Essentially, it's a kind of Howard Stern that is knocked over by a Jane Fonda type woman (think The Electric Horseman). It's an ugly thing because values, ideals, the script are all so harmful. <br /> <br /> I share the other objections about the strange things in writing: a) Why would this man lose all his girlfriends? - why does he refuse to reveal that his mother's death and funeral prevented him from meeting with them? It's a mystery because he keeps saying "it was personal" when he came across angry and disappointed women. THERE IS? <br /> <br /> b) There is a huge inconsistency (that is, the writer wants to have both) telling us that the protagonist's mother loved her father with everything she had - and then we were told that it was only one great love in your life - your lesbian girlfriend. <br /> <br /> c) The underlying legal assumptions are absurd. We are never told that the enforcer has any right to live on the property - only that it will determine the time of the title of the sole heir and the right to occupy the property. However, in some ways, the movie makes it seem like the executor is the right occupant - which is crazy. (Try to think of any executor of any will that uses the estate of the deceased before the bequest of the will is fulfilled - it does not). <br /> <br /> d) The assumption throughout this movie is that women are equally attracted. for men and women - is simply absurd. Thus, we are told: i) that Penelope Ann Miller's character is dating other men near the end of the film - after having been with the deceased for five years - and before that in a satisfactory relationship with the protagonist, ii) that the governess of the protagonist after being dedicated throughout her adult life to her gentle husband - is now dating another woman iii) that a girlfriend upset with the protagonist now "would like to try a woman." <br /> <br /> iv) a male transsexual is eager to date the protagonist v) that the Mary Kay Place character naturally looked at other women in college ("and they looked back," she says with a triumphant turnaround idiot of the head). <br /> <br /> This is all just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I agree with others about the sound of the DVD (I had to keep it at full volume and come back repeatedly to understand names, phrases). <br /> <br /> This is a movie by someone who truly despises traditional heroism for any man, hates the notion that a man is needed to raise a child, hates the idea that there is any necessary connection between marriage and sex. The movie is meant to preach - and this kind of false message advertisement does not work well.
