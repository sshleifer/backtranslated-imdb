As bad as this movie is, I really like it. Bad acting, dialogue and action made this very funny. I loved John Travis of the Omega Cop and stayed up all night working like the Death Machines checked into the airport, if they could not talk, they probably had to shake their heads at security questions. In fact, why do not they talk? It does not adhere to any kind of convention that makes it oddly interesting to watch - many people being killed around a very loose plot involving hired killers - no "machines" and those strange face / mountain things on the front cover and the trailer do not appear! I love the fact that there is not a cool guy in this movie until halfway and I love the countless nonsensical scenes of an airplane landing - many people are dead and have nothing to do with the "plot" and no explanation is given. about anything - DO NOT expect to understand this movie. Instead, admire how the prime guy can not even deal with an old, random guy at the bar - who is introduced as the villain and speaks against the bartender's decision to hire a half-naked woman to dance badly in the corner for "entertainment." - All the good guys seem to like this! Why did the old guy hit our hero - and why the random guy decided to help the old man in the fight? Why did the hero collapse under a punch from the old guy in the bar, where a jet of water gushes into the bottom, so it looks like it's coming from your mouth? Definite Top 20 B-Movie, you should check for part 2.
