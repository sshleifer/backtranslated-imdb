I could not last ten minutes in this terrible movie. With the age of digital video cameras, it seems to have been filmed on VHS without the aid of any color correction or microphone. <br /> <br /> As a filmmaker, I know the restrictions of indy filmmaking, and even keeping these things in mind, I am impressed that the films are poorly made. <br /> <br /> The only compliment I can offer is that the film was distributed as I have seen considerably better films still looking for modest domestic or international films. launch. I'm guessing the box is what it sold ... it has a good box art, but everything goes down from there. <br /> <br /> Side note: It seems the director has 11 friends since no one on this planet would give this movie a "10".
