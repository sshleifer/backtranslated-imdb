First of all I'm in my 40's. I've been watching horror movies since I was a kid, so I've seen a lot of variety. IMO, this is not as bad as the crowds who gave it a 1 or 2. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a low budget horror movie. Dialogue is bland and acting tolerable at times. The basis of this plotwise movie is actually quite good. For those of you old enough to remember or lucky enough to have seen them on DVD. This is very much like a movie of the week of 1970. Just add smaller blood and blood, smaller T & A and swearing, no big names. That's for a T. I'd rather watch this than Jason vs. Godzilla or any other crap that's still out there. Not so good, DEAD DEATH was a LOW budget film. At least give credit to these guys for trying. With a budget of MIL by chance, this could have been a good movie. My score is a 4 assist.
