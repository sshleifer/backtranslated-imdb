This is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There's so much in the house that goes wrong that it would not happen and it's not funny. Granted this is a movie that means things that will not happen in normal life happen here, however, this movie is more unlikely than theories that no child left behind is working. All these people are in the house and no one noticed another, not to mention the damn owl that seems to be coming everywhere, except in the cage. I could handle an owl joke the first few times, but after an hour I just could not stand it, I'd rather kill myself than see that damn owl again. Did I laugh during this movie? do not. Not even once? do not. Horrible, horrible, horrible. The fact that this pile of garbage has been completed with Ashton Kutcher bowing to his boss and taking off his pants in front of everyone just makes the movie worse. But wait, the day is saved because the owl can fly. AMAZING WOW! However, I give this movie some cred, it's not as bad as the epic movie .....
