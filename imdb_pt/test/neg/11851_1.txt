On the plus side, it's over. That's the only thing this movie has to offer, of course. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some bad ones. This movie is really so horrible, I went and changed my rating to Children of the Living Dead for a 2 just because it was not Raptor. <br /> <br /> Official rating of a line: "Come with me to another movie if you want to live."
