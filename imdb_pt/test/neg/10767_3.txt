I read each and every Scarlet Pimpernel book by Baroness Orczy. Counting this, I saw 3 pimpinela films. The one with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews I much preferred. It goes out of the way for violence and action, occasionally completely violating the spirit of the book. I do not expect movies to stick directly to the plots, I gave up being so idealistic a long time ago, but if an excellent movie from a book has already been made, do not redo it with a TV movie that includes excellent actors and nice costumes, but a poorly decent script. Stick with the 80's version .... Rahne
