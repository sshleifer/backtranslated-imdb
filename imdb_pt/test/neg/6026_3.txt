I seemed to find the trailers better than the movie. They did their job and interested me in watching UNKNOWN. Interest declined early. A simple premise that stands out in the scenario. Five men wake up in a chemical depot without knowing why they are there; much less know how the hell they got there. Confusion and paranoia bring fear and mistrust. The men find out that a hijacker is on his way with plans to kill his hostages. Now men measure each other trying to tell if everyone is a victim and who can really be one of the kidnappers. The cast includes: Jim Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Joe Pantoliano, Bridget Moynahan, Barry Peppper, David Selby and Adam Rodriguez.
