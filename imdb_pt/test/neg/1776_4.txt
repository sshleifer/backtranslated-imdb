I starred as Eugene Morris Jerome in my middle school adaptation of the play and this movie definitely does not live up to the screenplay or the imagination of Neil Simon. I know this game back and forth and I can honestly say that the acting was off, The production was tacky. The changes in the play script were poorly made. If you really want to enjoy this game, you should see the real game, not an adaptation of the Hollywood movie. Eugene's character had no soul and was excessively sarcastic in everything he said. The other characters were out of the key as well. A general, confused, disloyal disappointment with the play, performed amateur!
