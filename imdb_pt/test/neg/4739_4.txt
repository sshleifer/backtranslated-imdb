I loved the blood and blood. The type of violence is what Alien and Predator films are about which no one is spared. This really answers the question of what it would be like if the aliens were on Earth. The answer to this is simple. We're screwed. The effects were beautiful. As there are always some real problems with it. <br /> <br /> 1) The acting was horrible on the part of the witch on the side of the human characters almost put me to sleep because of how dry and annoying it was that actually interrupted the flow of the film and was very annoying. The writers could have made SOOOOOOO much better. The good part was the performance of Alien and Predator, which I thought was very well done most of the time. <br /> <br /> 2) The size of the Predator ship was much smaller than in the first AvP movie. I scratched my head <br /> <br /> 3) Predators wearing the mask while they were still on the ship. This bothers people and I can not understand why. It's not a plot hole like most people make out to be. So I tell you to calm down. It is not a big deal. If this makes you feel better, remember that the child's face was bored in storage, which could be a good reason for this. <br /> <br /> 4) Predator firing your plasma gun inside the ship. I thought this was a little stupid on the Predators side. But then I started to wonder if it was a younger Predator who panicked. <br /> <br /> 5) The hunter and his son almost instantly arrived at the crash site after it crashed several miles away. At least they did not bother us by showing they ran through the forest for 30 min. so be happy with that. <br /> <br /> 6) Why was only one predator gone? I thought that was strange. But then I thought it was because he thought it was just a Predalien he was dealing with and not an outbreak. <br /> <br /> 7) Why were the predators on the ship not destroyed? Well, if people were paying attention, they would kill, but he was killed before he could fully activate it. <br /> <br /> 8) The unlimited blue melted goo. I thought that was a bit of an idiot. <br /> <br /> 9) Predator hides evidence with goo, but dodges a cop. That was stupid too. <br /> <br /> 10) The black out. Well, come on guys, an Alien and Pred fought in a power station. <br /> <br /> 11) Predalien being half face-hugger / queen. It really bothered me. I'm a fan of Alien and Pred. I know strangers do not do that !! Just as they do not give birth as a human does as they showed in Alien4 !! Of all comics, games, books and movies 1,2 and 3, CLEARLY shows their behavior. They need a queen to lay eggs, eggs hatch into the infected host's face-hugger, the parasite appears and kills the host and grows into a drone if it infects a human, a Predalien with a Predator and Runner with any kind of animal four paws. And after living for years and years, they become a Preatorian (a mini-queen who does not lay eggs) I can go on and on but I will not. But this scene alone almost ruined the movie for me. If the directors are smart they would go back and edit this by making a face hug infecting pregnant women. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you're going to see this movie, just go see it for the aliens and predators. And when the scene comes up where Predalin infects pregnant women ... Close your eyes so you do not have to see this insult to the Alien and Pred universe.
