The only reason I did not sleep during this movie is because the seats were not so comfortable. Hannibal is boring> boring> boring and boring !!! This movie is simply terrible, not because of any violence or graphic mutilations. It's really very tame in that regard. The story moves at the speed of a lazy snail. I got the feeling Director Ridley Scott just called this one. The actors are fine, they just needed some direction. The score is also very annoying. It is especially noticeable, since so little is happening in the film. Sounds good, but that's not reason enough to see this. By the way, did I mention it's annoying? <br /> <br />
