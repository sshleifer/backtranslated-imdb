The only time I really laugh while watching this show is when I'm making fun of it. Jamie Lynn Spears only got the actress job because of her older sister, and I do not think anyone could argue with me about it. There's no expression on her face (even when she smiles) - just watch the show and you'll see what I mean. Now let's talk about the show. Zoey 101 is one of the most unreal shows I have ever seen! As many people have said, Zoey Brooks is absolutely perfect: everyone loves her, she's a straight student, and all the boys think she's "hot." The PCA is an in-house boarding school full of rich kids that gives all its students flat-screen TVs and laptops, serving sushi to the kids at the sushi bar. In one of the more recent episodes, Zoey is completely clueless and thinks Chase is not in love with her, and acts like she does not want Chase to love her. So when she walks into Chase's bedroom to prove her friends are wrong, she finds Chase kissing a girl named Rebecca. Zoey, of course, goes crazy, probably because she likes Chase's attention. Anyway, just watch this show if you have nothing else to do and the only thing on television is Zoey 101. You can at least have fun laughing at how unrealistic it is!
