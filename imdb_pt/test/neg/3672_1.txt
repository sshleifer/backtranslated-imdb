If you like to sit in the dark, literally and figuratively, for ninety minutes, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> A waste of actors, resources and audience time. Ultimately, a waste of space. Do not be tempted by the resume. There is nothing more besides. The movie does not have all the basics you could expect from the genre; plot, character, development, outcome. The cast may be able to take advantage of the knowledge that in this case their efforts will be totally forgettable and, over time, their careers may perhaps improve. <br /> Absolute crew.
