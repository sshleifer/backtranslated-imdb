I rented this by mistake thinking it was another movie with the same title, and realized that I had rented it some time before. <br /> <br /> Quick storyline. A couple of artist and photographer rented an apartment in Los Angeles from Joe Estevez, still cursing the fact that his brother Martin Sheen could actually DO! They find a bed in a forgotten room but the bed is haunted by a nasty serial killer of the 1930s and its last victim. Their ghosts inhabit the couple, first improving their sex life, but eventually becoming more menacing. <br /> <br /> What follows is a scene of cheap sex, sensations cheaper and kind of a waste of time.
