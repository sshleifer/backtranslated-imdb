Before attending this film (in an exhibition attended by the director himself) we were informed that he had won the short film award at the Galway Film Fleadh. Certainly this result will give filmmakers hope, anyone can do better than that! <br /> <br /> As no one can notice the blatant beheading of Donnie Darko on this I'll never know. The film is pure drivel, the cardboard action, the ridiculous dialogue and the final just flat! The only crumb of comfort we enjoyed after seeing this rubbish was commenting out loud how terrible it was in front of the director! Yes, that was stingy, but liberating! <br /> <br /> At least Irish cinema can not sink!
