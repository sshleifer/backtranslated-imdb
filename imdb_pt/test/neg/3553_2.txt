I had high hopes for this after reading previous reviews but it was so slow and the plot so basic that well I wondered if I had read the wrong reviews. <br /> <br /> Please, a kid knows the girl next door at 11 and both aspire to love and be basketball legends. Grow up, but watch the progress of others. Guess what! Both receive scholarships to the same university and become lovers again until their father is caught playing with a younger woman. Our young hero unable to deal with the lapidary in the judicial concentration, but somehow decides to go pro and drop studies and guess what is caught by the Lakers. Dumps the heroine because she was not there for him during this emotional period. So for 5 years they go their own way. She returns from Spain having lost her enthusiasm for the game and our hero is getting married in two weeks. Mom tells her that she must fight for her love, so she professes her continued love and challenges him to a basketball shootout. He wins he gets married she wins he loves her. Well, he won, but he decides to dump another girl for our girl. The End has her playing basketball and he has baby duties. Sorry 2 is my highest score. My partner has scored 0 for a lewd story for anyone who reads Mills and Boon
