This movie was on the paid channels today and I had nothing to do. This has to be the worst football movie ever made. This has to be one of the worst movies of the period. The premium service on the cable system has a rating system, and they gave 2 stars out of 4. This movie is not even a half star. Bad acting, Scott Bakula sinks, as usual, Larry Miller? Sinbad, could not act if he tried. Rob Schneider's linings are completely stinky. Fred Thompson should be ashamed that he's in this movie. The only saving grace for this movie was the hope of seeing Kathy Ireland naked in the shower, not even close. A complete waste of time and film. If we could give a negative number, minus 9.
