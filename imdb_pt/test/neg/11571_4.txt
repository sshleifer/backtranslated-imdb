28 years before September 11, there was another September 11, which represented a key date in the history of Chile, South America and the whole world. This was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in Chile overthrew Salvador Allende the first democratically elected Marxist president anywhere in the world and put an end to the Chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the military attacked the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this film is very biased and very nostalgic about the time of Allende's government to be an objective version of man and his place in history. The times were troubled and Allende was a contested figure in the history of his country and the entire world. It is true that he was democratically elected, but his policies plunged Chile into the economic crisis. He was deposed by a coup and a right-wing dictatorship, followed by repression and flagrant human rights abuses, but he was also an ally of Castro, who saw in his policies another way to make revolution. We will never know whether his attempt to build a socialist and democratic society would have been successful. The film's authors take a completely pro-Allende stance, there is no opinion or point of view trying to explain the other side, to answer questions such as why the middle class opposed it, or how their democratic visions could go along with support or being supported by Castro. The tone of the comments is nostalgic and apologetic, almost propagandistic. People who want to better understand this episode of the story need to wait for a movie or book more balanced and objective in the future.
