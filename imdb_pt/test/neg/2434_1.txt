I think this was a HORRIBLE mistake on the part of Disney. First, Kuzco does not need to pass "emperor school" to become emperor! This never happened before. Second, the new voices do not sound like the originals. Very poor redo. And while I loved The Emperor's New Groove, New School is just plain stupid. As all the jokes are the same, and many are from the movie. The plot becomes redundant, always Yzma (this is how you spell it?) Trying to become Empress, Kuzco hindering it, etc. Or Kuzco learning to become a better person. I think Kuzco is annoying with his constant complaints and questions. He's a spoiled brat and it bothers me. I do not think this is worth five minutes of your time, let alone half an hour.
