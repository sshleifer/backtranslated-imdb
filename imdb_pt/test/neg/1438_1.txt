Wow ... This movie really sucks ... 'Nuff said. <br /> <br /> The story: A psychopathic Internet predator chases and lures young men and women into torturous traps ... That's how, he kidnaps people, they find him, he becomes a changed man and is released into the world once more, reverses back to his old habits and begins the torture again ... The story is stupid, it is implausible. The characters are stupid, they are implausible ... Or at least over. It has some very violent images, and if you have a stomach week you may want to stay away ... But again, even if you do not have a stomach week, you may want to stay away ... It's that stupid. The cast: Dee Snider, Kevin Gage ... If you are a hard fan of Twisted Sister and Dee Snider, you may find this interesting, since he is the writer and star of this film. His acting is ridiculously bad, and you can tell he's the one who wrote the horrible script. Kevin Gage ... Well, they say he's been in a lot of other movies I've seen, but I do not remember him from any of them ... And you will not remember him because of that ... These two, unfortunately, make the movie ... They do not do well on you ... They just do it ... <br /> <br /> Scale one to five: 1 It's bad ... It's really, really bad. ..In fact it is so bad, that this movie should come with a clip loading pistol to play Rullet ...
