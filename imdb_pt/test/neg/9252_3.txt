"The Mill on the Floss" was one of the smaller novels of Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under the pseudonym of George Eliot. I tried to read this boring and very turgid novel years ago, but I could not finish it. I will review this film version only on its own merits, for I do not know how closely it follows the original novel. <br /> <br /> The film's opening credits are printed in an old English font that suggests the medieval version. period, and so it's a very bad choice for a movie with a nineteenth-century setting. (On the other hand, about the middle of the movie, we see a close-up photo of a brochure announcing a real estate auction.) This booklet is made from authentic Victorian sources and seems * very * convincing.) Most of this film is extremely convincing in its depiction of early 19th century England architecture and clothing. The exact location of the history of this film is never divulged, but - judging by the actors' accents - I would put it somewhere in the Cotswolds, perhaps Warwickshire. <br /> <br /> The plot, what about it, involves a mill that changes hands a few times (in a few decades) between two rival families, a rich and a working woman. I disagree with another reviewer for IMDb who claims that James Mason has only a small role in this film. Mason has the larger and more central role in this drama, as the descendant of the richer family. Like the spoiled and petulant Tom Tulliver, Mason is dark and impetuous. His performance here belongs to a better movie: it made me want to see 'Wuthering Heights' being reworked with Mason as Heathcliff. As this is a multi-generational saga (something George Eliot did a lot better in 'Middlemarch'), several of the key roles in this film are divided between two actors each: children actors in the prologue, adults in main narrative. The prologue to this film features a nicely written scene, establishing Tom Tulliver as a willing and intimidating man from a young age, and young Philip Wakeham as decent and thoughtful. Through hard work, Philip has gained half a penny: Tom tries to get him away from him, but is not willing to take the coin by brute force: he wants Philip to give him. All the children's actors in this film, male and female, are talented and attractive. Unfortunately, all children speak their dialogue in luxurious accents that are totally different from the accents of actors and actresses who play the same roles as adults. This discrepancy draws attention to the staging of the material. Regrettably, none of the later scenes is as good as this prologue. <br /> <br /> The climax presents a multitude of workers in a storm, much better paced and photographed than the previous scenes. But modern viewers (at least in Britain) can no longer take this kind of material seriously. So far, virtually all British comedians have done a "problem at t mill, squire" comedy routine, parodying precisely this subject, so I had a hard time watching this movie with a serious face. The character The actress Martita Hunt is good in a small role, but the opening credits (in the old English typeface) make her name "Marita". I'll rate this insipid movie as 3 points out of 10: one point for James Mason's presentation, the initial scene with the kids and the authentic Victorian composition in the auctioneer's brochure.
