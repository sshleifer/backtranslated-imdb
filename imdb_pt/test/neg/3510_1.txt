I get the impression that I was watching a different movie for most of the people I know who watched this movie. It's not really that I found the movie offensive or anything - just that the script was incredibly amateur for a movie that obviously had a little bit of money thrown into it. I really respected Paul Haggis' work on the Million Dollar Baby script and was very disappointed to see how bad this script was. It became clear to me that I was desperate to be Traffic's "racist" version, but I do not think Traffic really was a movie worth stealing in the first place. <br /> <br /> The worst feature of this film is how it blatantly feeds its audience. Does Haggis really think we are so dumb as to require an injection of the blanks? Do you need to see the phone book on Farhad's panel, with the address circled in black text? Can we not be left to do something in logic for ourselves? <br /> <br /> I also had a big problem with the dialogue that was so 'on the nose'. I've heard a critic say that the quality of dialogue is deceptively high, because even if people do not talk like that, they certainly think so. This is irrelevant. It is the job of a script like this to use the dialog in a way that helps add the characterizations and credibility of the (in this case highly implausible) situations that are set up. All these characters speak with the same voice and everyone talks about racism. <br /> <br /> Of course, the purpose of a film like this should be to promote the fact that race should not be a problem in these situations, but by making it the sole focus of each scene, it does not become intrinsically racist itself? The characters go around spreading their philosophies and conveniently memorize statistics about race relations as if they were regurgitating excerpts from the research essay they just wrote. It's totally unconvincing and obvious. <br /> <br /> A movie should reveal its meaning gradually, do not hit us in his face in the opening scenes and never give up. I can see that Haggis's intentions with this film were honorable, but I dare to suggest that in directing his own script he was not able to identify and thus overcome his shortcomings. I really hope the writer / directors will be very careful in the future when addressing this style of "mosaic" narrative. This has been well done several times, but it is very difficult to strike a balance between personal and political law. And Robert Altman will not be outdone in that department.
