My name is Earl (2005) <br /> <br /> Review: ...... Well I saw this. <br /> <br /> That's another thing. First, how is this classified so high? I can not understand it. This "show" is filled to the brim with annoying people, stupid people or just plain nasty. The "jokes" are hideous. <br /> <br /> I saw an episode in which Earl's brother's wife got involved and washed with dead fish. I am not kidding. That was not funny, that's repulsive. Then she and Earl's extremely stupid brother (and I say stupid) had sex. I almost threw up. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the most desperate attempts at comedy in a long time. Jason Lee is a talented actor, but is stuck in a helpless role in this horrible "comedy." <br /> <br /> Earl is now in jail for this current season. Let's hope he gets the chair just so this program is put out of its misery. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: This show would be funny to people who think the Larry the Cable guy is funny. For the rest of the world, IT'S NOT A CHANCE. Avoid like the plague.
