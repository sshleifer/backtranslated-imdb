Five Fingers is so bad I hardly know where to start. So let me first admit that I only saw the first half hour. When the first finger was cut, I thought of sleeping a more useful activity. I told my girlfriend the meaning of "five fingers" and she immediately followed my example. <br /> <br /> Could not the producer, director and / or screenwriter consult an amateur chess player? Like me? They should have used a digital chess clock and not an analog. This great joke makes mental pressure to put in Martijn just a laugh. How, when, and why did Martijn date a Moroccan girlfriend? Such a case is very rare in Holland. Calling me retarded is, of course, an insult to all people who suffer from a much below average IQ. Besides, as far as I know, the retarded do not play chess. I do. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is the script, of course. Just compare the little hard candy movie Hard Candy. To keep the viewer in a tight grip, the information should be revealed little by little. A good touch from time to time also helps. I understood from other reviews, that there is a great deal at the end of the movie. Any intelligent person can guess what it is. This obviously only raises more questions - why is the travel guide dead? Oh my, why should I care? The whole movie focuses on only one thing: the chopped fingers. The manufacturers have not even learned the lesson from Hitchcock: it's exciting to make a bomb explode. It's more exciting to show this bomb in action. But no, we do not see the paper cutter until the impossible countdown ends. I'm not going to waste any more words on this crap. Go see Hard Candy.
