Although some prefer to comment on the value of Bond films in the connection of learning frequency, and although most of the jargon that tends to limit Bond to a next 007 has been explored beyond any reasonable claim, there are several redemptive plausibilities that they extend. the credibility of Sean Connery in this doubling role that had his adaptation in return for part of a previous performance of Jessica Tandy in Driving Miss Daisy. While Connery had been less visible in the latter, his qualities as a woman candidate might not frown on embittered viewers as he would in the latest version which, for those most involved, approached theme 007 with resentment, although the general flavor had been altered. Great for those who interest others, pretending to be who you are not!
