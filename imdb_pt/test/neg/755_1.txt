In my opinion, the film was laughable - bad dialogue. Who wrote the script - please keep your daily job. Definitely not godfather or Goodfellas. It's good to be on the other side of the table - poor choice of words. Some of the characters were clowns. But what do you expect from a low-budget movie with no known actors?
