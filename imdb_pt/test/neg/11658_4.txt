This movie seemed to have been rushed to be released for some reason. It's definitely not a well-made movie. So unbelievable. The scenes in which the president (Holbrook) was in the center of the city and walked among the people were a farce. There would not be a chance for ordinary people to be 30 meters from the president in that situation in real life. If it was not for blood and swearing, this was filmed like a TV movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. The talents of Holbrook (President) have never been realized in this film. Shatner's performance is fine. The production values ​​in this film leave much to be desired. Overall, I think most people would rather not waste time to watch this case.
