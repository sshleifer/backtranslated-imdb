For me this movie was a disappointment. Somehow, I hoped he would explain the reason for General Rommel's popularity and his success as a military strategist in World War II. But there is none of this, he deals with the last year or two of his life and tries, in a way, to whiten him. So I have to assume that Rommel was primarily an amorphous and apolitical technocrat in the business of conquest and killing, without any charm or notoriety in behavior. Such real-life people simply do not make good movie material. I almost feel sorry for James Mason, really one of my favorite actors, who had to pretend to be a good wooden character. In fact, was a good director and a great acting talent wasted on this film? with the exception of Luther Adler, who gives a truly memorable and strangely naturalistic portrait of Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> There may also be a cultural problem for people like me who are part of the German-speaking world. Famous British actors representing Germans simply are not reliable. Rommel, for example, is perceived here not only as a German but as a typical southern Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. You immediately think of a certain dialect, a certain type of intelligence, a certain way of seeing the world. opposite to, for example, a Prussian junker. ") I also think that there are now mixed feelings about the July 20 assassination attempt, many of those in the conspiracy were not Democrats and just wanted the German troops to join the Allies Westerners against the advancing Bolsheviks (thus prolonging the war for ever) The best cinematic representation of an intelligent and intellectual military mind is, in my view, Patton (1970) By the way, General Patton may be seen briefly in the wide documentary used for this film, a low angle as it inspects passing vehicles.The open case and the revolver with the mother of pearl claws are clearly visible!
