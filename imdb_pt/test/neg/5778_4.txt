(There Are Spoilers) Usual horror movie with the story happening in and around this mine abandoned by God outside the almost deserted city of Sutterille. After receiving a map of letters and a gold nugget from her brother Jared, Shadrach Smith, Clair and her husband Nick Breman, Carrie Bradac and Sean Hines, they go to the village together with four other friends and gold prospectors in armor Alx & Tori, Steve Wastell & Sangie and Hayden and Rox Ann, Rick Majeske and Elina to claim their claim. Later it turns out that the fact that Jared had disturbed the long-forgotten gold mine caused the ghost of the notorious Jeremiah Stone, Vernon Wells, to come back to life and thereby restart his reign of horror. Stone, or 49er, is about the most ridiculous slasher / killer in movie history. Stone looks like he was buried for years under a few tons of coal running with this hook cutting people in two. After doing most of the local cast, Aunt Nelly (Karen Black), whose daughter Eve (Alexandra Ford) was also one of Stone's victims, tells those still alive that unless they return the gold to the Stone mine , the crazy miner Never rest until he kills all those who still have him. <br /> <br /> Aunt Nelly will have plenty of time to tell her story before turning into a human torch of Stone and eventually jumping into a nearby stream. movie continues endlessly with the killer miner in turmoil looking like he's as scary as burnt toast and as dark as. Even those in the film seemed to show no real fear of him. In one scene, when he invaded Aunt Nelly's house, everyone inside attacked rather than fled, causing the ghost miner to lose his right arm; Stone spent the rest of the film with a miner's pick attached to his "stump." In addition to actress Karen Black, the film "Miners Massacre" also features veterans John Phillip Law and Richard Lynch as Sheriff Murphy and Old Man Prichard. Passable stuff, but nothing special, the film has a predictable ending, with all the gold mine going up in flames. The public gave a suggestion from the creators of the "Massacre dos Mineiros" that the end of this senseless madness is not in sight and may very well resurface in a very near future in a possible sequel, may God help us all!
