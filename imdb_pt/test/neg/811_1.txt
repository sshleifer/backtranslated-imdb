Set in 1945, Skenbart follows a failed Swedish book publisher who decides to take a non-stop train to Berlin. Unfortunately for everyone around him, he is a walking disaster, causing confusion everywhere. The train also has a man and his lover planning to kill the man's wife (who is also on the train), a soldier on the way home, two elderly gay gentlemen, a furious train driver, two nuns, a bunch of refugees and even more people. Said as a mix of noir-ish thriller (which does very well - at least to get started), and comedy, the movie fails with both. It does not look good when the movie changes its tone with each new scene. And as the train rushes toward its final destination, the film becomes more and more bizarre, ending on a truly surreal note. <br /> <br /> Good bits are wasted on a myriad of tangles and useless characters. Skenbart is filled with famous Swedish actors, no matter how small the play. It seems that the filmmakers have called everyone they've worked with and offered a share of them in the film. It's a shame that the performances are as bad as the script (do your lines - do not read them!). <br /> <br /> Comedy is more or less comedy, with the same jokes repeated over and over again. The pace is incredibly slow sometimes (most of the time, actually) with the particular scene dragging on for about ten minutes without good reason. The writer also seems to think that the oath is a good way to replace the decent dialogue. The movie looks great, though, in grumpy B & W, but is wasted on such inefficient movies in every other department. [1/10]
