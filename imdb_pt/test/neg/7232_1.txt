A meat-eating octopus, where that Boaz guy (what ...?) Davidson continues to get inspiration? Anyway, even for the low and low standards of the giant marine animal that kills the genre of people and me, this is a little beyond the terrible. The octopus is one of the weaker, lazy, and weaker monsters I've ever seen. it ended up on the (ahum) East River because Sea World got sick of it. Actors can be seen repeatedly helping the octopus choke them. A bunch of idiots, that way he'll never learn! Do you want all the other giant murderous octopuses (which is the correct plural, by the way) to laugh at him? Meanings. <br /> <br /> Even stopping the octopus is wind, razors that are difficult to handle and also the special marine agent Nick Hartfield and his partner who will retire in a week but first have to be eaten by the octopus. Hooray, octopus won the fight! A couple more and it will evolve (the scars on my mind stay) .Nick, of course, tries to help him is not doing anything (he does not have a gun or something?) But no, that magically also does not help. <br /> <br /> Okay, among the love interest of sea police, Rachel Starbird. Is this based on some comics or something? Anyway, together they try to stop the octopus by walking in the park. They hope this helps, because it's the 4th of July in a few days, and the octopus can attend the party. And you do not know what he looks like when he's drunk. Rachel then takes a school bus out of nowhere to make sure the film does not end while Nick feeds the octopus with more maritime police. <br /> <br /> But it all sucks, and Nick manages to blow up the octopus a little bit, and a lot of kids who happened to be there clap and laugh. You know, at the sight of the belly, this would probably have an infection. In real life, I would say all ages, but I kind of like all ages, so my final idea is: Suitable for absolutely no one.There is no sex, no gore, there is nothing.Now forget that this movie already existed Join the club.
