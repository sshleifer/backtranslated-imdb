Oh man, this movie was too bad. Bad look, horrible story ... the list of good things is shorter than the list of bad things about this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, sure, it's a comedy and everything else tells me that this movie was to be the real deal. The film certainly does not begin as a comedy, but more like an adventure movie with fun elements. You can especially say that they were serious about it by acting, which was in a serious and non-comic way, with the exception of a few over-the-top sequences, obviously. It seemed to me that at first they tried to make a real and serious adventurous science film, maybe even a franchise, but soon began to notice how bad everything was and simply decided to insert a little more and deliberately exaggerated comic sequence, to do the film looks more like a comedy and prevents it from becoming a complete and disastrous mess. <br /> <br /> The film is an odd attempt to mix adventurous pirate movies with serious science fiction action. The film was obviously inspired by the films "Star Wars" and its success. The movie is not ashamed to copy entire sequences and even the way the story progresses, sets, characters and robots show similarities. They have tried to hide this by putting some obviously spoofing strings, but I'm not falling in love with it. So the film is not even original by itself, despite its original concept. You might say this movie is a poor man's "Spaceballs," without even being really a parody. <br /> <br /> The film is bad, with some special effects of videogame (in some sequences, even literally), horrible-looking costumes (mail jacket and swords in outer space?). The sound is sometimes even laughable. It looks like they filmed some soundless sequences and then forgot to add all the necessary sounds later in post production. the mix is ​​also very bad. They tried to hide this by putting the sound in the least at times, and adjusting the musical score of Bruce Broughton. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the movie is so busy trying to make the movie look good-humored. Forget to tell the story. This makes the story of the film seem extremely confusing and poorly written, with a main plot almost completely underdeveloped. It also does not help make the movie really flow. Many things are not explained and some are discarded after a while. The movie begins as a 'pirate' movie, which is constantly looking for and stealing water, since it is little and there is only one planet in the galaxy remaining with water on it (yes, right!). However, this plot is soon abandoned, especially in the central part of the film, in which the film seems to become totally different, with different motivations. It's like the weird and bad sequence, silly, after another, without really clicking. It also keeps the characters too shallow and uninteresting to worry about. <br /> <br /> It is sad to see that actors like John Carradine, Anjelica Huston and a still young and unknown Ron Perlman were attached to this disastrous movie. <br /> OK, I admit that I enjoyed some of the moments, especially the ending, when they span the time span, it was original and fun, but in fact none of that was enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> I did not even like the movie in such an extravagant way. <br /> <br /> 2/10
