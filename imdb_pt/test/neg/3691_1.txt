After watching this movie, I decided it was so horrible that I should join IMDb and write a review to alert others about the difficulties of renting / buying this movie. To be fair to the film, there is only one good section for this movie and that is the cause of the final credits, so you know that this crap is well and truly finished. I watched until the end in the hope that I could have a little pleasure out of the movie. Only tunnels more tunnels and an old man talking to himself (If you watch this movie a lot of time so you will). As for Val, if he keeps selecting movies like that, he might say goodbye to his acting career. There is no sense in writing about what is in the film as it has already been done. Keep your money and sanity and stay clear.
