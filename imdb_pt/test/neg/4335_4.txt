Ben Stryker, a former green beret, stops in a small town called Agua Dolee to visit an old friend Tick Rand. Right after riding in the city on your Suzuki and settling down. A motorcycle gang known as 'The Savages', led by the tyrant Pigiron, invades and finally takes over. Stryker does not want to get involved, but that changes when friends become the real targets. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good to say about this obscene item? Calling hard as the only fundamental reason to watch this low-budget car accident is for the tremendous b-cast that the crew managed to put off for this project. Although I do not think it's a complete job, it's not very good either. Now that cast! Lance Henriksen (being the main character, he strangely has no top billing but the final), Karen Black, George Kennedy, Richard Lynch, Bill Forsythe, Mickey Jones and Leo Gordon. Now, what went wrong with this bizarre low budget situation. The superficiality of the material is very one-dimensional because it lends much to better movie ideas (Mad Max, for example) and creates a complete mess of ideas that simply do not gel and could have been better thought out. Used cliches can be manipulated for good visualization, although they are predictable, but "Savage Dawn" seems to let everything go without letting the viewer absorb everything. The cast is largely wasted on nothing papers. Henriksen, a bleached blonde, is capable of being solid and even with his complimentary presence that provides an enigmatic glow to his character. He does not get up very much and sometimes disappears into action. Too much lateral action, but when he kicked the butt of some motorcyclists, good times flowed. The hissing performance of Karen Black is very strange and it's about screaming and cursing. Although she gets involved in a memorable fight with Claudia Udy's flirtatious character, Katie. George Kennedy, wheelchair-bound, wanders aimlessly until the final assault, and Richard Lynch looks embarrassed as a rebel priest / prefect in a very redundant role. Bill Forsythe simply chews as the boss of the notorious biker package. <br /> <br /> The junky story (written by William Milling and Max Bloom) has that comic look and is much influenced. by the western genre. Just look at the bad guys for that. How they came up with their names is mystery. Maybe they took them off a hat. It's a great second-rate material that most often moves to one dull scene after another. Unfunny comic elements are cast and also a bit of sleaze. Cheesy exploration that is not hard enough and the killings are quite risible. An awkward script is filled with complicated details and banal unbearable. Simon NÃ¼dtern's erratic direction was numb and tepid. One or two intense scenes can not adjust to the turtle's rhythm and to many awkward stunts. The cardboard sets looked dirty, but they did not have this organic sense. Gerald Feil's gravel cinematography was best handled when the main focus was not on the city but on the bleak backdrop (like the beginning and the end of the film) with a few camera touches. Pino Donaggio's clumsy music choices are muffled by his own incompetence. <br /> <br /> "Savage Dawn" is a fast and forgettable midnight movie that is a definite flaw for the most part. There are better and more convincing exercises of the same kind out there.
