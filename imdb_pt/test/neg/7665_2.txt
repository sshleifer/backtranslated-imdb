"Airport 4" is basically a mess for Universal Studios trying to work on a new version - the Concorde supersonic - in its "disaster in the sky" formula. Unintentional humor, best of all is when George Kennedy reaches out of the Concorde's window at supersonic speeds to fire a revolver at a missile that follows the aircraft's flight path and the simple fact that these dumb passengers continue to board the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air. Many stars in this include Robert Wagner, Sylvia Kristel, Alain Delon and Martha Raye as nervous passenger. <br /> <br /> It's not really related to the other films 'Airport'.
