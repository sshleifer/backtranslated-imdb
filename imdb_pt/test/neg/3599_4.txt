Hey! A Disney sequel that's crap! Who would have thought that? In fact, much to judge from the reviews here, and they are not wrong. I really expected to see this horrible movie based on my liking for the original. And there's the cash-in mentality of Disney. Throw away any old junk in the back of a hit and people will go for it. Do not you think they're so cynical? Ask yourself, then ... How many Disney movies have sequels? And so ... How many of these sequences generate an accompaniment? A significantly smaller number. <br /> <br /> Kronk's new Groove is just another example of this. The plot is laughably simplistic and prolonged. Even more annoying was the increase in the number of "out of place" items and scenes - an old personal home, for example, and God forbids an Aztec version of Boy Scouts! Worse still, Kronk's Chippamunk leader has a completely disconcerting English accent, for no reason. An accent that, after very little time, intensely irritated the nerves. <br /> <br /> There are some good things. The animation is very good and the voice talents get along with the below-standard dialogue given to them - especially Warburton in the lead role. But in addition, there is nothing to recommend it. Of course, little kids may like it, but there is little to amuse Mom and Dad as they buckle over this torturous mutilation of the original concept. <br /> <br /> Avoid this monstrosity with the same zeal that you would use to avoid a bunch of male-devouring lions.
