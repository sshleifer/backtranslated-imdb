The film begins in spring 2001. A soldier named John Tyree (Channing Tatum) falls in love with student Savannah Cutis (Amanda Seyfried) during the break. Within the space of two weeks, they fall madly in love with each other (!). But he has to go to war and she has to go to college. They do, but keep in touch by writing to each other. Then 9/11 happens. He wants to reenlist - she wants him to stay home. What will they do? <br /> <br /> Hysterically bad romantic drama. Links are attractive - Tatum is certainly a handsome man with beautiful green eyes and a warm body (he is presented walking shirtless out of the water after surfing) ... but he can not act. Seyfried is a beautiful woman and she tries ... but the dialogue here is awful. When I saw, me and a friend of mine were struggling hard not to laugh loudly at some of the "romantic" dialogues in the beginning. It was just HORRIBLE. For the first hour, I got bored with the ridiculously predictable or entertaining drama with the horrendous "romance." Then, after that first hour, the tragedy comes on the scene and, I must admit, left me in tears. However, filmmakers are struggling to make sure you're crying over death, funerals and meetings with people collapsing in tears. How can you not cry? That would have worked if the performance was better. Tatum's face never changes expression - not once! He always had an empty look on his face. Seyfried was a little better, but not much. To make matters worse, Tatum and Seyfried had no sexual chemistry on screen! They barely seemed to like each other, let alone love each other. There was some beautiful picture of the Carolinas, but this is a boring and stupid romantic drama. A 1 all the way ... and I usually love silly romantic dramas like that!
