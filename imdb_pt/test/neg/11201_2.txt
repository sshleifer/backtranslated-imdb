Has this ever happened to you? I go into my local video store and see some newcomers in the "film noir" section. I spy a copy of a new arrival from a movie I've never seen called NAKED ALIBI. It's one of those video-mail companies that offers (mostly) "dupey" looking for hard-to-find hard-copy titles. The description on the box looks good. The movie has players I like (Sterling Hayden, Gloria Grahame and Gene Barry). So I take it home and watch it. About ten minutes later I started to have second thoughts. Halfway through the movie, I started to dislike it. When the movie ended, I not only did not like it, I despised it. The film begins with police officers questioning Al Willis on suspicion of theft. Besides being drunk, the police have nothing on him. When he pushes a cop and demands permission to go home, the cops beat him up. Detective Conroy arrives, lets the police finish the beating, and then announces that Willis is free. Willis swears he will take revenge. Later one of the cops is shot dead. With no other evidence that Willis is "sore" at beating, Conroy makes Willis his only suspect, despite the fact that his boss appoints a pair of mobsters as suspects. Conroy arrest him, but for lack of evidence, Willis is released. The next day two more police officers are killed by a bomb. This time Conroy goes to the bakery that Willis owns and tries to hit a confession out of it. Conroy does not know this, but a local journalist whose role has accused the department of police brutality of Conroys takes a photo of Conroy trying to strangle Willis and Conroy is fired. But Conroy continues his pursuit and Willis flees to Mexico, where Willis has a mistress. Conroy manages to convince his lover (whom Willis treats quite roughly) to help him prove that Willis is a killer. What is missing in this film is a compelling script. The script looks like only one draft was written and filming began before a completed script was completed. Things happen, characters' personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script. In addition to the fact that Willis likes to bring down a glass now and that, there is nothing at the beginning of the movie to make us think he is a crazy killer who betrays his wife. He treats his wife, his son, and his servants well. At the beginning of the film, you get the impression that your Conroy is one that is a loose cannon. He seems to casually approve of police brutality. Conroy, for no reason is convinced from the beginning Willis has been a criminal. He seems to operate on the motto of the former communist Bulgarian secret police; "Everyone is guilty of something, we just have not figured it out yet." Later, Conroy shows kindness to Al's lover and young son, who now must like him. Excuse! The first impression I had of Conroy was with me for a long time. And he's an idiot cop too. It is only after he is fired and goes to Mexico that he checks for Willis and discovers that a warrant has been issued to him in Maryland. Why had not he thought of that before? Because this movie did not consume enough time. The cast is good. Gene Barry does well considering how ill-conceived his role of Al Willis is. I'm a big fan of the thriller movies of the 1940s and 1950s, but not only did I not think that this movie was good, but it left a bad taste in my mouth (something many modern movies do, but older movies rarely do).
