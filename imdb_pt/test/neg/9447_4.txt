The lives of Megan (Jackie Kresler) and Dylan (Shane Elliott) change in the Nevada desert between Reno and Las Vegas. They stop to eat in a small greasy spoon where they reluctantly learn about the infamous Area 51 by the coffee owner (Jonathan Breck). After getting back on the road in his forty-year-old Lincoln, the radio gets a little crazy conveying Hitler's speech at the 1836 Olympics and then a 1958 Elvis Presley bulletin being summoned for military service. The car slowly undoes and the two are in search of the fright of their lives while mysterious inexplicable things happen in the lonely desert poisoned by radiation; remaining nuclear tests. Megan meets a lost girl (Channing Nichols) and a wounded soldier of World War II. The nightmare journey does not end there. Kresler is awesome and writer / director James Lay makes good use of Patsy Cline's songs. All in all, moderately interesting Sci-Fi.
