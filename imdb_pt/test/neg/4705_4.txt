There is no doubt in a mine that this movie is a stupid and bland joke, but telling the truth is a lot of fun (if you are a first time viewer and try not analyzed anything) Throughout the movie has a very good ideas, but poorly written. <br /> <br /> The story of the two losers, waking up to find that they can not remember what happened to them the day before. Only to find out afterwards that they're after angry twin friends, aliens, transsexual stripper, Aliens nerds and some gang members. <br /> <br /> Is not It Like The Bourne Identity? Yes, I know - how can I compare the two films, what the hell? Both have no memories; the people were behind them and so on. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is stupid and is only for the viewer who likes stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Reason to watch: · Loads of talented young actors, · Very stupid (after all you know it's a stupid movie, why not make it extreme) <br /> <br /> Reason to not: · If you like to analyze, then forget, · Young talented actors get bad, · Good turn really bad <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 (Note: E + Eur-lex.europa.eu eur-lex.europa.eu 'Dude, where's my car?' "Wait, what did you expect from the Ashton Kutcher movie?" I think almost everyone got the same response for this guy - "A really stupid movie." In addition to 'That 70s' Shows' this guy really has nothing to offer his fan. (He should thank the series for his reputation). 'Dude, where's my car,' is one of his trademarks - 'stupidity.' Somehow, your movie is worse than the Adam Sandler movies (you can imagine that). The film is really meaningless, without plot and without anything. Mara Sokoloff, Jennifer Garner, Alison Sweeney and S.W.Soot should not have wasted their talent on this crap. They even invented "Seriously, Dude Where's My Car". This shows how filmmakers are dying to make money instead of quality. <br /> <br /> Max: 4/10 <br /> <br /> Recommendation: Borrow from your friends or just forget about it
