I have nothing against Paul Schrader. In fact, HARDCORE (1979) is one of my favorite movies. But some horror movie fans were in a premature turmoil when their original version of the EXORCIST prequel (DOMINION, the one you're reading now, as it turned out) was dropped by Warner, and when Renny Harlin was replaced to spruce things up and make a new version that was "scarier". In my opinion, some viewers were prejudiced and were automatically encouraged to hate Renny Harlin's opinion on the subject (EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING) before the first frame of film was even unrolled for them to judge. And I should know; because I even went to the theatrical debut of BEGINNING with stubborn arms crossed and prepared for the worst, which I was sure had to come. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that Harlin's BEGINNING book is far more serious than it ever could have conceived, with Stellan Skarsgard doing well as a young version of Father Merrin, who was struggling with his faith in God. It was not a big movie, but it was not near the rubbish I had prepared myself for, well in advance, unseen. <br /> <br /> Well, now I finally saw the real version of the garbage. - and it is the DOMINION of Paul Schrader: PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST. It was relentlessly intricate, uninteresting, and insipid. Stellan Skarsgard's troubled priest was not nearly as interesting as he had been to me in Harlin's movie, and the actor himself was not as good as he was. For all those who pointed out the obvious CGI effects on BEGINNING, guess what? They are here at DOMINION too. Remember the foolish ending in Harlin's interpretation (which I will also agree with the rest of the film)? Well, you will find that this Schrader ending is not much less annoying. <br /> <br /> Let me also say that I resent the absurdity that has been presented by those who appreciate this movie. better than Harlin, saying that we are "retarded" or "we can not appreciate the subtle production of films." As a person who despises MUMMY of Stephen MTV's 99, Stephen Sommers, and being a true fan of the very evocative and understated horror films of the 30s and 40s, I can assure you that this is not the case with me. At least there was "some" degree of terror and things of the Exorcist type in Harlin's BEGINNING; This one is just a real boredom exercise and a great challenge, even for the most certified of the insomniacs. It will be quite interesting to hear the horror fans try to convince themselves that DOMINION: PREQUEL TO EXORCIST was as good as they had already decided it would be anticipated; just as they were predisposed to criticize Harlin's BEGINNING, the second when they learned that Paul Schrader's name was getting soaked with White-Out.
