The book is great. It's one of my favorite books ever. The movie, on the other hand, is incredibly tasteless and bad! When I heard Damon play Ripley, I knew this production was doomed. But I did not expect it to be that bad. The actors go around and act very showy. Except for Law (and even he's guilty of some showy acting), all the actors here are almost amateurs. Speaking Italian and wiggling your arms or hair should not be considered an act. Damon is miscast. He's too tough for a character who should be a chameleon. Paltrow is forgettable and Hoffman plays another effeminate, viscous character. Talk about typecasting. What is really unforgivable about the script (written by the overrated director) is that he completely ignores all the subtle details of the book and creates many of them, and none of them work. ! The addition of the Jazz music stuff is totally WRONG! I think the idea of ​​Minghella from Italy in the late 50's, early 60's is obscured with images of Chet Baker roaming the interior of Italy and spreading. Yes, Minghella is a true visionary. The film is so bloody obvious. That silly scene when Ripley drives down the narrow street full of mirrors. Very laughable. Yes, we get the point !!! Each point or detail appears a mile away, so much so that the film can give the public the false impression that it has psychic powers. We know, for example, that Blanchett's character, introduced at the beginning of the film, will come back later just to complicate matters. And the soundtrack is sometimes totally inadequate. Eccentric when it should not be. The movie continues for a long time and in all sorts of senseless directions. There are many boring characters populating the landscape (many who were not in the book). This movie is bad! Really bad! Apparently, Minghella's son told his father that Ripley's romance was his favorite. Minghella then proceeded to direct him as a favor to her son. Well, the director got what he set out to do: the talented Mr. Ripley, with his aspirations of Hitchcock, is a movie made strictly for 12-year-olds!
