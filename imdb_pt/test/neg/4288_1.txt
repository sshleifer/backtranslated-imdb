Psychological terrible thriller that is almost painful to sit on, every aspect being horrible. <br /> <br /> The combined talents of top actors Kevin Bacon and Gary Oldman are totally wasted, and despite giving good performances, someone wonders why they bothered. Mark Kasdan's script is a complete mess, and Martin Campbell has the narrative jumping all over the place, but if you can not follow it, take it as a blessing. There are many crazy senseless scenes that just do not make sense. The music of Jerry Goldsmith also does not help much. <br /> <br /> Even if there was potential in the plot, director Campbell's approach ruined it completely. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Monday, February 26, 1996 - Video
