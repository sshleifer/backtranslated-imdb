I saw this as part of the DC Reel Affirmations Film Festival. I hope they have better films than this, because this film failed to fulfill any of the hopes that the public might have entertained, from the fantasy of seeing James Franco without his shirt, to simpler desires such as decent acting, consistent direction. , character development or actual production values. Distraught by film school effects such as frozen pictures to show moments of emotional distress and obvious influences ranging from My Own Private Idaho to Terminator 2, this movie failed at almost every level to engage the public. After the first twenty minutes trying valiantly to take it seriously, the public collectively threw their hands down and began to appreciate the inherent inaccuracy of the film. I might be annoyed that I paid nine dollars to see, and it was two hours that I will never go back, but on the other hand, it was two fun hours that I will never go back. This would have been a classic episode of Mystery Science 3000.
