I AM NOT LYNNE BATES MY NAMES IS RITICHIE BUT LYNNE IS MY MOTHER I AM USING YOUR ACCOUNT! Barney and Friends, (or Barney, as it is called here in England) is the most commonplace of all time. I never really liked it, it was 3 or 4 years ago when I was born, so it was nothing new. My friend, however, loved this show dildo. I was about 6 years old and was at his house once, and he had a Barney VHS tape playing on TV. I turned the power off and he started to cry. GROW YOURSELF A SPEAKING DINOSAUR FOR CRYSTALS KNOW! Anyway, I happened to get the Barney movie on TV later that year, and I loved it. I got his VHS a few months later, and I used the tape I loved so much! I gave this tape a few years ago now, but I loved it back then. But the show! My god the show was bad! Several children fell victim to pedophiles because of this so-called entertainment butt plug! Never again, never again! It's not just me who hates Barney too! 85% of all reviews on this show are bad, and just look at the amount of You Tube Poops and videos that take Barney's mess on You Tube! And do not get me started on the BJ Job Blow! Why the hell would the producers dare give a character such a sexual name? Yet another subliminal message on a children's show! And that Baby Bop is the worst since Osama Bin Laden! All in all, I give Barney and Friends MINUS 1000 OUT OF 10!
