I mean, you just have to love the Italian film industry. Someone appeared with a post-apocalyptic action movie ("Road Warrior") and the Italians were busy for years doing one theft after another. Then another one came with a successful barbarian movie ("Conan") and the Italians were busy ... eh, see above. <br /> <br /> In addition to numerous other variations of the theme (one of my favorites is Umberto Lenzi's "The Barbarians" starring Paul Twins), the Actor series was created. And this, the second, is probably the worst (or rather, depending on your point of view). <br /> <br /> Actor is called back to action by his former teacher, who discovered some kind of nuclear power. this, of course, has to be protected from getting into the wrong hands. The old man sends his daughter to Actor, and after some complications Actor, his helper Tong and the girl return to the castle, which has since fallen to some villain (of course, a former "classmate" Actor). Somewhere along the way, the heroic trio forgets the conspiracy and eradicates a worship worship of giant snakes for fun (not before some virgins are sacrificed). Just in time, before the madman finally loses his temper and slays the wise teacher, our heroes remember their duties, invent hanggliding and grenades and save the day. <br /> <br /> Included: terrible acting from all participants (especially O'Keeffe), incredibly hilarious special effects (you just have to love the snake fight scene, which should be a tribute to "Monster Bride "), poorly staged fight scenes, numerous errors of continuity (Actor flies in two different hanggliders during the climactic battle, observe her, just one example) and a total disregard of the concept of history (cavemen," civilized " , builders of castles, all thrown into a movie). <br /> <br /> If you're like me, dedicated to bad movies, this is the series to watch, you'll probably end up in ROTFL. For records: the third part filmed in Malta is actually quite watchable. Considering the other efforts of Joe D'Amato, this is probably his most entertaining film, since he certainly was not able to show horror movies or erotic watching. . But I have the strong opinion that this was completely by chance. <br /> <br />
