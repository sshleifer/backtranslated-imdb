This is a film with an excellent concept for a story, but that has been diverted, but a large number of subplots clich√©s, characterizations and performances portrayed, unrealistic and some, frankly implausible (and highly coincident and, not to mention, convenient as plot). aims to bring history to its inexorable end. <br /> <br /> The lack of anything that marked the lead as really gay, plus some coincidental references to the Crow Bar or that he is gay, was troubling. It would not hurt to really show him anything, even if it was just finding a friend to drink. <br /> <br /> Worth checking out and has its merits. There is not much, even now a few years after the release of the film, in the form of films featuring either a gay protagonist or a significant gay plot, and also about African Americans. For this, it is worth checking. I would not be too hard for it and would not waste my time looking for it. This is a rent, not a premium rent.
