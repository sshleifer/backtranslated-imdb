I bought this movie because I thought the cast was decent and I like Jennifer Rubin and Patsy Kensit. <br /> <br /> First, let me say that acting is not of a high standard. Stephen Baldwin makes his character seem almost retarded at times and at other times time consuming. Patsy Kensit is so, but not very convincing in some scenes, and the supposed poetry she releases in a private scene in her hotel room is mindless junk. Ms Kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy here, but lately I think Jennifer Rubin is by far the best in this movie. Rubins Character is the first innocent, then sexy, as she plays the character of Stephen Baldwin (Travis) to a fool. The supporting cast includes Adam Baldwin (no relation to his most famous names) and M.Emmet Walsh who appeared in many films, also noted Art Evans, who was one of John Mclane's allies in Die Hard 2. The film is decent and there are some nudity scenes with Rubin & Kensit, a bit of action, but this is certainly not a quick or smart thriller. There is a particular scene when they are in the car about to commit a crime and Stephen Balwin's character is wearing sunglasses and when you see him again, the area around his eyes is painted black, so the glasses reappear later when they are leaving the crime scene and the police are in pursuit, a very obvious error in the issue. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of either the ladies or Baldwin, then you may find something to like here, but others should stay away. This is a reasonable thriller but not worth noting and not worth more than a couple of dollars if you want.
