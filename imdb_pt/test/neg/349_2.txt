Yes, the video cover of this movie made me want to watch this movie as a kid. It was called "Screamers" on this particular cover with the slogan "Men turned inside out!". He still had this deformed skeleton on the cover, just as he made all sorts of bloody images go through my mind. Maybe some kind of movie about some weird virus that made a person's flesh burn, maybe a movie about zombie undead zombies more bloody than you usually get, an incredibly wrong scientific experiment and now men strangers with the flesh dripping their bones go in fury. Yes, all those thoughts went through my mind, one that was not fishy on some island with practically no blood and all annoying. This film is actually more like Dr. Moreau's Island than anything else and, frankly, this movie bored me too, it's a scientist and it's not enough to kill for my taste. These movies are a lot to discover things and not enough blood to my taste. Yes I know, I have weird tastes but I can not help, I like my horror movies or really bloody or fast moving and exciting this movie is really neither.
