This movie changed my life! Hogan's performance was incredible, and I have not yet recovered from his exclusion from the 1990 Oscar nominations. And as brilliantly as the Hulkster shines in this film, you can not ignore the brilliant writing and direction that transforms this masterpiece into higher strata of filmmaking. If you have not seen this movie yet, leave out what you are doing now and get a copy. I guarantee it will blow your mind. And if you do not like it, then I only have one question for you ... What are you going to do when the 24-inch pythons and the Hulkmania go crazy for you !!!!
