GOVERNESS is a grumpy timepiece, the winding story of a Jewish woman who, after her father's death, left for Scotland in 1830, posing as a Gentile to get work to support her family in London. <br /> <br /> Rosina - or Mary, as she is called in a symbolic not subtle piece - is an aimless child, a socialite with dreams of being an actress. She makes an alliance with her employer and, by accident, solves a crucial problem in her research with photography. Giddy successfully, they begin a hesitant and uncomfortable affair, while their lover's eldest son falls hopelessly (and inexplicably) in love with her. <br /> <br /> And as a child, she can not understand the consequences of her actions - in the end, cheating those she cheated in order to make a life for herself. <br /> <br /> Many claim that this is a kind of feminist manifesto, but I disagree. Whether intentional or not, this film only resonates with me if I think of it as a cautionary tale. In the end, Rosina's biggest disappointment is the truth - she lied, found a way to help a man she wanted to be both her father and her lover, and in the end contributed nothing but destruction. So the end of the movie gives me the impression that nothing she did, no one she used made her happy - and that's exactly how it should be. <br /> <br /> Did I need a movie for so long? and langorous to teach me this lesson? Not at all. On the contrary, if it were not for the excellent cinematography, the original soundtrack and my hope that she would get her approval, I would not have been able to hold out until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver fans will probably be disappointed by their uneven performance, but may want to see it anyway; I doubt that the young Jonathan Rhys-Meyers fans will be able to stay awake for the reward they are expecting, and I can not help but think that it contains few cultural details to interest, even for photography fans. The 3 points I attach to the film are just by their visual style and punctuation. On the strength of his other work, I assume that the performances of the actors are so disappointing because of a bad script and worse direction, but they are, in the end, not noteworthy.
