I should not have seen the same movie as the one the reviews refer to here. First, I think they should have serialized Ghost Story if they were to film. The truncated version they created was horrible. I felt the performances were good, and there was a great deal left of the story that the performances of masters like Astaire, Douglas, Houseman, and Fairbanks seemed a little difficult. Alice Krige was superb as Eve, however. Craig Wasson is a good actor, but he was only suitable as protagonist. The decision to climb Patricia Neal and truncate her role was not good. Imagine what Anne Bancroft would have done with this character! I blame the script, which was poor. The production values ​​were dark and the pace was slow. A disappointing effort, pedestrian. <br /> <br /> The book is one of the five greatest 20th century suspense / horror novels, IMHO. But the film was disappointing, despite being a great introduction to Krige.
