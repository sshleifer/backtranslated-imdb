If you want to see the worst movie ever made, look no further. Some miserable movies are watchable because they are unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, the American movie has no humor at all, there is no unintentional humor, only obscenities thought by its director are laughable. <br /> <br /> For those who liked this movie, I suggest you watch "Kevin Clerks". in tone At Clerks you'll find creativity, intelligence and fun - all on a tight budget. That should make you forget this hideous endeavor.
