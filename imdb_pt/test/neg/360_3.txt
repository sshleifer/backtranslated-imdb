This is the story of a maniacal cop who, for some reason, has a young university stallion and his companions. After denouncing him to his supervisor, who in turn suspends him, depending on the psychiatric evaluation, he finds an opportunity for psychology to torture him when, on a bet, the children enter the security of a department store and unlock the door. Only, they are locked in the store, along with the weirdo. Murder and clutter are in progress, and the kids are running around trying to survive until morning, when they can escape. <br /> <br /> The 'Dangerous Game' would have been a successful psychological thriller of cat and mouse, probably if it was set in a different location. The thought of a psychotic cop chasing a group of innocent teenagers in a department store simply did not work. Especially when he comes face-to-face with the prey quite often, and yet he does nothing serious often. There was no real confrontation, as would be enough for this kind of story, and might have worked better if you said, for example, that the teenagers were loose in the neighborhood and left to defend themselves against this weirdo (especially if it took a few days while he makes it increasingly paranoid ... although granted, even if it's clich√©). What a shame, too, that it could not have been a better thriller, considering a cast of young Australians. characters. Even a lightweight adventure, despite the madness of the villain interspersed through the image, may even have made it a more satisfying image. Instead, it started over again, and it sure did have a lot of action sequences, but it ended up getting ridiculous.
