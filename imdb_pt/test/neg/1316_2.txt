On the face of it, this movie seemed to be really good - it's not. <br /> <br /> The cast is very good, but most seemed ashamed of the whole thing. The real disaster in this movie is not the flood but the script. He tries to include all the clich√©s in the book, all done incredibly badly. The ending is very abrupt, but that is a blessing in disguise. Congragulations, if you get that far. <br /> <br /> All three major male actors (Carlyle, Courtney and Suchet) would surely agree that this is the low point in their careers. I hope they have received a lot of money because none of their reputations left intact. <br /> <br /> Special effects are very good, but the same thing was made for a much better effect on The Day After Tomorrow. . <br /> <br /> In short, a useless exercise. Do not waste your time.
