Have you ever had one of those nights when you could not sleep and just turned on the tube to see what was happening? That's how I ran through this gut. For me, I would have been better served and turned around for the 97 minutes I lost with this movie. In his attempt to be "real," the characters in this film come out as stereotypes so gangster that the story should have been the premise of a Wayans movie. The dialogue? Please! It looked like a white man was trying too hard to write this movie. <br /> <br /> The issue was horrible. One of my "favorite" scenes involved a car chase through a bunch of narrow alleys. Cut to the characters being chased, and they're driving through a park complete with baseball fields in the background. <br /> <br /> When any of our "friends" are shot in this movie, he miraculously bleeds through the clothes. which have no holes, which is more than I can say to the plot of that predictable charge of ... baking soda. <br /> <br /> Indie movies can be great even if they have low budget and effects, but they still need to have some cinematic integrity. If I could give 0, I would. If you watch, I hope it's cable, because even the cheapest rent would be too much to pay. Actually, 97 minutes was too much to pay ...
