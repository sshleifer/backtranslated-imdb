I completely understand the historical significance of Rocketship X-M, but that does not make it a good movie. For starters, the plot (or what's in it) is monotonous and lifeless. Five astronauts take off for the moon? they get off course and end up on Mars (huh?)? Martian-looking cavemen throw rocks at them? they return to Earth and find a burning death? The end. Believe it or not, but this description of the plot makes it look much more interesting than it really is. To make matters worse, the character of John Emery, Dr. Karl Eckstrom, finds it necessary to make long speeches about everything from the nature of man to the dangers of nuclear weapons. It's just an emotion per minute (intentional sarcasm). Looking at Rocketship X-M almost 60 years later, I would call the portrait of funny women if it was not all so sad and misguided. There are several examples that I could cite, but there is an exchange of dialogue right after takeoff between chauvinist pilot Floyd (played by the annoying Lloyd Bridges, with plastic hair) and Dr. Lisa Van Horn (the only female crew member). and the constant object of Floyd's often scary attention) which illustrates very well the film's attitudes toward women: Floyd: "I've been thinking, like a girl like you got involved in something like that in the first place." <br /> <br /> ?? Dr. Van Horn: "I suppose you think women should just cook and sew and have children." <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: "Is not that enough?" <br /> <br /> I think Floyd should have stayed behind with the cavemen!
