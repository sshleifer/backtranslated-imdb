Most of the films I really like are art and rarely appear on the top ten lists. That said, I found "Northfork" completely incomprehensible. I have no idea what that was. Writing in the New York Times about a different film, Stephen Holden once remarked that some people seem to think they can play anything on the screen and make it work like a fairy tale. I thought of this review several times while watching "Northfork." <br /> <br /> On a scale of one to ten, I gave her two.
