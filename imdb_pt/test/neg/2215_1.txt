There is something about the appearance of Doug McLure in a film that is a guarantee of misery. Its DG initials are like a special film certification, which comes somewhere before 'U'. Cushing, on the other hand, seemed to suffer from a dilatory agent and a bad judgment of his own. He did a great job in the Hammer movies like Dr. Van Helsing. I have seen him make a very reasonable Sherlock Holmes in 'Hound Of The Baskervilles'. And his magnum opus was probably Grand Moff Tarkin in the first 'Star Wars'. The only man but the emperor who could tell Darth Vadar to "stop fighting" and get away with it. But crikey! He made some turkeys. There was that deplorable 'Daleks' movie for one. And here's another. <br /> <br /> There is a machine that was kidnapped on Tracy Island. It is a cylinder with a bolt on the front and traction devices on the sides. I'm surprised that Jerry Anderson did not sue for plagiarism. Maybe it was bought. However, if the movie is a guide, they may not have paid you much. <br /> <br /> We are in 1976 and we are still playing with latex jumpsuits. <br /> <br /> It really is. Some movies have entertainment value in the category "so bad it's good". He does not even get it. She would not even entertain the children. Things from 'Crash Corrigan' from the 1930s have more going for it.
