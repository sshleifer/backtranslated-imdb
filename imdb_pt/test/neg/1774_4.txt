Casper Van Dien ... what can I say? I like the guy! His films bring a certain talent to them that in fact are not brought by the director or producer, but by him! Recycled graphics ... check. Ripped movies better ... check. Woodworking ... check it out. Not that Van Dien is a bad actor (he has been effective in Hollywood as Starship Troopers and Sleepy Hollow), he did not really receive a script worthy of his talents; and yes, he has a talent for acting as well as being attractive to the eye. This film offers a clue as to what Van Dien can offer, but he is bogged down by the production of it all. The script can be better developed (see Oliver Stone's U-Turn). The direction can be better used (see From Dusk Til Dawn, by Robert Rodriguez). The DP could have made the desert more exotic (see Russ Meyer's Faster Pussycat Faster Kill!). This script is weak because this is something we've seen before many other times, so double / triple intersections are expected. The direction is weak because it is not offering anything new and telegraphs many of the weak moments of the script. Cinematography sometimes paints a lovely autumn desert flavor for her, but at other times she does not take advantage of the scorching light and the initial sequence is horrible in cornflower blue. <br /> <br /> Now the acting. Van Dien shows a bit of grace and charisma to his Jake. He is not too methodical or too exaggerated in his role. A good balance, especially since the rest of the cast seems very distracted about how they should be performing in this movie (bad script or bad direction ... you make your opinion). The only other person worth mentioning is Bryan Brown's villain, as he offers the only real credit for acting in that film ... ambitious actors forget to try to learn green screen, learn to act in a horrendous script and take notes in Bryan Brown in this movie. It adds extra depth to his role and is a good part for the Van Dien character. Jake always seems to be a step ahead or controlling any situation, either out of his control. The femme fatale is weak (after all, it's a desert noir) and it's another nail in the coffin of the movie (you decide ... script or direction). The character of Rosalita should have been pushed forward in the film, instead of being pushed back into the ground later to make room for the real femme fatale. Then watch the movie for Van Dien and Brown; and for fun, try to jump a stone in the holes in the movie's plot.
