Rarely does anyone find a film so bad that it reaches the often-sought-after paradigm of having so little redemptive value that it's only worth watching. "Cyclone," I'm happy to report, it's such a movie. <br /> <br /> I knew there was something good so I found the video. I'm at least his fourth owner: he has a "Used Movie Sale! $ 9.95" sticker on the front, and a yard sticker for a dollar. I picked it up at a thrift store for fifty cents. <br /> <br /> The sale of used movies! the sticker covers much of the cover art, what I see is a really weird mix of the front of the super bike Cyclone, a car flaring over, and Heather Thomas, wearing Flouncy Eighties Hair with his mouth open in an expression that says, "I have a toothache." I saw this and thought, "Alright." The case, honestly, was enough ("no place to turn and no one to trust, Teri is plunged headlong into a maze of danger and deception"), but I was surprised to actually get to observe it. I always make time for the really bad movies. The Fight Club tape can wait. <br /> <br /> Meet Teri. Teri is an incredibly well-crafted character, as we can tell by her introduction, in which she and her friend do exercises that highlight her breasts and, later, her legwarmers. So Teri goes out to meet up with her boyfriend for the night that goes terribly wrong. Before she knows, Teri is taken "directly to a web of deadly crosses in CYCLONE." The VHS box says what it's like. Left out of the box summary - perhaps for some weak hope that actual copies of this movie would be sold - is how horrible the acting is. It could have been just me, but I kept thinking I could read the thoughts of the characters through their eyes. "That's stupid," thinks Heather Thomas. "I know," thinks Bad Guy with a wide mouth. <br /> <br /> A driving force (no pun intended) for the second half of this epic picture are the car chases. Those were actually very good, although I'm inclined that gasoline does not need training in how to blow up. What really impressed me is that in all the persecutions the streets were practically empty. It's as if there were only twenty people in this huge city. <br /> <br /> I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "Gee Wilikers! I have to see this movie!" The sad thing, however, is that you can not find it. Oh no. "Cyclone" is a movie you find. Just wait. Someday - maybe during lunch, maybe late at night, maybe "when military scientist Jeffery Combs ('Re-Animator') is murdered by hired killers" - you'll hear the rustling of legwarmers, and you'll know it's time.
