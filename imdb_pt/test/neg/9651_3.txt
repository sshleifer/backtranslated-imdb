I'm guessing the movie was based on a sturdy book. Given the number of characters and subplots during Katyn, I thought that the creators of the film, perhaps the writer or director, intended to create an epic movie. But there really was not enough time to spend properly on the development of characters or stories. Aggravatingly, there were many unrelated parallel stories that could have been edited. <br /> <br /> In reporting the events leading up to the mass murder of all these intellectuals and officers, I do not think the film has explained. any reasons why murder was necessary. Was it political? Philosophical? Revenge? The interesting part of historical films is to see personal motivations or emotions. Instead, Katyn's assassins looked like automata, controlled entirely by Stalin, who occasionally appears framed as a sketch of coal. The portrait of the Russians and Germans seemed entirely one-dimensional. (Are the Poles so angry with the Russians?) In addition to being poorly edited, biased or at least unrealistic, music and cinematography choices did not fit with each other and with the film itself. I do not think you can actually shoot an epic war movie or a war event on the handheld. (But if the director was a character-driven story, perhaps focusing on a single family, maybe the practical approach worked better.) And if you use really dramatic music, it needs to be more balanced with the type. of shots made.
