SPOILERS <br /> <br /> This movie was rented as a joke, and what a joke it was. The film is based on a dog hunter who is looking for El Chupacabra. Dog clothes are so ridiculous. It looks like he sewed the sticker on his hat and for some reason he shows off his "muscles" wrapping his sleeves. Throughout the film, especially at night, you can see just how bad the lighting was. They are in a car that is lit up and they are driving in black. Many times you can see the shadow of the camera man on the floor. The costumes are terrible, the lighting is terrible and the acting is terrible. This is a good movie to laugh about ... maybe.
