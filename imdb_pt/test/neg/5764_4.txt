A group of friends discovers the gold inside an old mine. But, taking the gold and thinking that they hit it, they wake up a dead miner who is the Hell Bent to protect his treasure. "Miner Massacre" is a colorful b horror movie in the extreme. You have all your family cliches, your group of teenagers with intellectual disabilities, characters coming out on their own to investigate strange noises, some scary, the mysterious sheriff, the old lady who everyone thinks is crazy (over) Karen Black does not less), and so on. However, it is done in a fun, non-pretentious way that makes the movie entertained in a "really bad, it's good" way. The characters and dialogues are what you would expect from this type of film - familiar, routine and unoriginal. All the actors do a decent job considering I actually saw bigger budget films of the worst performing type (I know what you did last summer, anyone?) And add a bit of credibility to the movie itself. The villain in this film (The 49'er) is obviously derived from the Jeepers Creepers creeper, all the way to the brown overcoat, hat, and long white hair. Like the creeper, he never speaks, and is too ugly to boot. Blood is a bit disappointing in my opinion. There are a couple of pretty awful moments, but a lot is off-screen and the death scenes are often laughable (Spoiler ahead!). There is a truly hilarious moment when a girl is beheaded by the villain and to achieve this "effect," the filmmakers hid the actress's body under the villain's coat, head out, and put some false blood on the neck . Seriously, you could see the outline of her shoulders! I think they could have done a little better there, even if the budget was low (And I'm sure it was, but still ??). Special effects are cheap, but effective enough, and for the most part moderately well-made for a low-budget film. Either the effects guys or the director seem to have a thing for explosions and fire. Almost every scene at the end of the movie has at least a couple of characters being burned to death (always filmed in slow motion) or something exploding, whether it's a car or an old mining cave. Seriously, no one has ever heard the term; "Stop, fall and roll!" "!" The "Mineiro Massacre" (or "The Curse of the Forties", whatever you want to call it) is corny and dumb, though entertaining, and as long as you have no expectations from the roof, you will be entertained enough. <br /> <br /> I'm feeling generous, so I'm going to give it a 4/10.
