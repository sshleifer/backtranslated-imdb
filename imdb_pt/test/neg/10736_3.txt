I think this movie does not have much substance, nor is it worth a discussion. <br /> <br /> At first, the package is really disgusting. Especially the stereotype filming and photographing. Certainly, Joe Dante's cinematic style was appropriate and interesting in "Gremlins" and "Small Soldiers," I mean the imaginative and visual story of a Spielberg-wunderkind (I really loved those movies), but in Homecoming it was a completely failed. Attacks of toy soldiers and hairy creatures are simply not comparable to zombie invasions (dead, stinking, rotten beings who try to kill the living - for no logical reason, just because they hate them). <br /> <br /> Zombie movies are characteristic of simple, direct, unconventional and brutal cinematography. Nothing to see at Joe Dante's debut. Another point is the annoying content: really stupid dialogues between the two main characters, a repulsive exploration of the "big brother dies and leaves the young person traumatized" and the bad acting. And by the way, "homecoming" is neither scary nor bloody - and even less fun. You see, it's not really a horror movie. Zombie movies in the decade of their birth - in the late 1960s / early 1970s - used to be revolutionary, provocative (especially through their horrible, explicit content) and the subtle social critic. THE ORIGINAL The movie Zombie was actually a midnight movie called "Night of the Living Dead" (1968). This was a low-budget film that covered so many controversial themes, it's hard to name them all: Hitchcock / Raimi's visual style, the American lifestyle of the 1970s, political indifference, the imminent discovery of black human rights, and racism even closer as a result of conservative Americans (remember the main black character shooting at the end of the movie). <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the creativity of midnight movies and want to learn more about the most important, I recommend "Midnight Movies: From the Margin to the Mainstream." <br /> <br /> Avoid "homecoming" and even so from the "Land of the Dead".
