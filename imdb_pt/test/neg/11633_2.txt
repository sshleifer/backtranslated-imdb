What a terrible sequel. The reason I give this film two stars instead of zero, because it is a film that has violence and blood and bugs, but it is badly planned. And this horrible sequel was made by none other than BUM-BUM-BUM-BUM !!!!!!!!! Mick Garris! The bonehead that brought you the remake of The Shining, which almost made Kubrick almost roll in his grave when he discovered that it was actually made. Garris is also the man who brought the sad sequence from THE FLY, THE FLY, which was a wonderful film, but Garris's film almost ruined John Getz's career. Anyway, if you really want to see the trilogy of low quality animals in order, do not. This is the mistake I made, rent the first or the third or, better yet, DO NOT STOP AT LEVEL! This movie was so bad I can not believe it, please, avoid this crap. Shame on you, Mick!
