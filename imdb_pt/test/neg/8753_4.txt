Yes, the film is not a work of art, but the first time I watched it I was 10 years old, my parents were away and I stayed home with my two brothers. It was in May 1970 (I know this because I found a note about the cycle of horror movies that a network had). It's one of the most vivid memories I have with guys. We finished it all in one bed and covered our heads! Our first horror movie! We kept talking about it for years and laughing about the moment. Those were scary movies. Nowadays horror movies are always the same. Or was it better when we were children enjoying without analyzing the plot and the cast and the dialogues? More sure that was it. But for me this is a great movie!
