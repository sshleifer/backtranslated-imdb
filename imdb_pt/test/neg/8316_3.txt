Many good things could have been done with this movie using essentially the same sets, plot devices and plot. For example, why not plant a seed of Erica's ability before the murder of her lover? Why not develop Erica and the police relationship slowly and convincingly? Perhaps it contradicts Eric's metamorphosis including some other post-event, relationship, etc. facet in his life that she now rejects? Why not make her hurt an innocent bystander to emphasize the error in Erica's actions. <br /> <br /> Instead, TBO explores the fantasy of revenge to its highest level, giving false sincerity to "do not do it at home." messages sent only to allow the movie to qualify as legitimate. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Jodie Foster. After seeing some films like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, NELL and one in which she plays the common mother of a child prodigy, Foster entered a succession of roles where she plays the same tormented heroine, overcoming evil. . That's good once or twice, but I'm getting too used to the close-up of "fighting the flight." TBO could have used a younger actress or one who more convincingly embraced being a woman in her forties (instead of Foster's 40-something years playing a younger woman). <br /> <br /> TBO is a movie with substantial actors, funding and resources that manage to get down to waste.
