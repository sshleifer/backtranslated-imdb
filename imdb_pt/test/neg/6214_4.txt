The film is not bad in itself ... until you see the original film Hitch (2005), starring Will Smith. The film is a direct copy, even with the dialogues of most of the film simply translated from English to Hindi! The plot in the original is executed with firmness. The Hindi version can not keep viewers interested. David Dhawan's type of comedy seems to have exaggerated when Govinda yells hysterically at all times ... sometimes, more time is spent in understanding the reason for this than the plot. :) <br /> <br /> If you know English, which I suppose you know, since you are reading this, see the Hollywood original. At least watch "Hitch" if you watched Partner to be able to compare. It is the least we can do to support the creative geniuses whose work, unfortunately, is blatantly raised by "inspired" people like David Dhawan.
