Renting this movie straight to video, I was not expecting an incredible piece of cinematography. (Not to mention just because a movie is in the movies, will.) Just very loosely following the story told in the epic poem, this film provides a unique insight into the tale of monsters and superhumans. General photography can be summarized as conflicting, with its blend of medieval and post-apocalyptic (reminiscent of Mad Max). With a soundtrack of rock and techno, you can feel a bit off. The fight scenes, though unbelievable, are fun, and Christopher Lambert has some of the most interesting combinations of weapons I've ever seen in movies, though often a bit ineffective. The special effects used for the Grendel monster are surprisingly effective and are one of the few highlights. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert offers an average performance like Beowulf. It will not be anywhere near as memorable as the Highlander, but at least it was not as poor as Fortress. The support cast is fairly neutral. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good story of action and adventure with a complex and engaging storyline, I would not suggest this movie. However, if you want a movie that is of little substance, full of exaggerated battle scenes and a somewhat predictable plot, find a copy of it.
