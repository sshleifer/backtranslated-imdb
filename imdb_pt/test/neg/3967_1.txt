How many versions of the student's English 101 of 1984 should America endure? "Well, that's a great book, but kind of bad, I know, I'm going to write one like this where it all works out." I'll also replace Orwell's old, worn-out political ideas of the 1930s with my insightful, the 70s. Think, think, political perception ... Politicians of Evil, I'm a genius! And there will be clones they make of themselves for some diabolical reason ... I'll work on it. , Bob Sullivan, writer of this story. That really is all you're to blame. You could have stopped them early and said, "Guys, with our budget and acting skills, I was thinking more of romantic comedy, or we could get serious and make an exaggerated spoiler of this family genre and tired of movies." "You did it though, Bob?" "No, you did not, and you were twenty-eight to think about it." "I do not want to be so spiteful." "I'm sorry, I yelled at you. live with that mistake much longer than I. Some guilt must be given to Ron Smith, who helped you adapt the script.He could have stopped you at any time.You were young and naive, and he took advantage of you. Now he twists the plots for video games, and you, bob, well, who knows what you do.I'm sorry if this sounds hard Bob, but that's the way it is.You've been sold upstream by Hollywood hotshots.As if Ron were not enough, Michael Bay also saw his movie, and without even asking for rights or anything, added some explosions to his concept and turned it into "The Island." Which I think is the most disgusting part of all, little eye drop, his screenplay could easily be good enough for a major Hollywood production, which I hated as much as this movie and did not feel sorry for you at all. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, things worked out for you bob. Ron and Michael walked over you, leaving you a parched bark whose height of writing movies will be a joke in the Mystery Science Theater 3000. Do not focus on this despite Bob, because Karma works in mysterious ways, and a day, they will pay for what they did to poor Bob Sullivan.
