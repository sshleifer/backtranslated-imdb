When I saw this movie, I think I was a freshman in high school and I still feel like charging Master P by the hour and 20 minutes or so he took out of my life that I will never go back. <br /> <br /> The guy who posted it is completely right. Master P is an aspiring mafioso. He, like all the other rappers in this country, has made his millions of rap CDs for impressionable young white men in this country. It is widely known that mob was not a black thing and blacks could not be part of it. Unfair as this may be rappers can not handle this. Does this movie paint Master P as a mobster named Nino? The script is terrible with acting to match. Completely unbelievable. While searching, I found a link or something that said he was planning to make another movie called "The Black Sopranos" !!!! <br /> <br /> Please save us and stay with Nickalodeon. You're not a white mobster, your not even a good actor, Master P, please keep your music for the benefit of those who hear it today ...
