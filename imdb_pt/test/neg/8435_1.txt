This movie begins as if it were a comedy. It almost seems that the actors are reading the suggestion cards, especially following the airport. William Smith plays the role of "Caribbean", a hunter, who is quite distorted and disturbed. Smith always seems to play villains as in "The Ultimate Warrior" (1975) and "The Frisco Kid" (1979), to name a few, although in this movie the villain role seems ridiculous. This is one of those movies where meaningless things happen just to fill screen time, like the girl's pursuit sequence at the beginning, and the long, silly motorcycle race. I give this film 1/10. I would like to see this movie in the "Mystery Science Theater" that would have been hilarious.
