This movie sucks. The problem was not with the cast. I think the cast was great, very good talent, great acting. But the script was TERRIBLE! It seemed to be just a painting job in which Steve Carrell could do his improvisation. And that's what he does best, but it just did not work out here. The script was difficult to follow, the story was not sensitive and the scenes were random and had no direction. In addition, much of the action was extremely artificial and poorly thought out. It was a good effort, but as Max says, they lost by MUCH! I'm shocked to see how many glowing reviews exist for this stink here in IMDb. Obviously, filmmakers are getting people to write a lot of positive reviews in their films and fill out IMDb entries. If you read the positive comments and compare them with the negative comments, it is quite clear what are the genuine comments from normal users. <br /> <br /> This movie was full of problems and jokes that simply did not work. I loved Steve Carrell at Anchor Man, and I like his comedy and style. But I will tell you that I never laughed while watching this movie. Yes, I had some moments of light, some laughter, but no real laughter. Nothing that impressed me. <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! A ridiculous scene was when Max had his hands tied in the plane and he went to the bathroom to try to escape. He uses his special Swiss Army Knife ... but instead of just using THE KNIFE'S BLADE, he tries to toss the rope with his miniature beast. And as the beast misses and shoots small arrows at him repeatedly (almost wiping his EYE), Max does not give up or tries the blade instead ... no, he just keeps firing on himself with the beast. What did he really expect to do with that beast? It seemed to be the worst option on the knife to try to remove the links. That made absolutely no sense. <br /> <br /> This is a good example of the typical circumstances in the scenes that make up this film. They were ridiculous, badly thought, badly motivated, and made of sheer absurdity. And that was really a distraction. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie was a big disappointment, and I recommend you avoid it. A Note to IMDb: You must do something about these false ratings that people are leaving. Degrades the authenticity of the site.
