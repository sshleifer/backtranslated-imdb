The last of the "Airport" sequences. This has Alain Delon and George Kennedy (who were in all the airport films) as pilots; David Warner (!!!) as a radio engineer; Susan Blakely as a newcomer targeted by death; Robert Wagner as a brilliant scientist (stop laughing!); Eddie Albert as president of airlines; Charo in a little "comic" terrible; John Davidson as a journalist (love how your hair stays in place even AFTER the plane turns upside down!); poor Martha Raye is humiliated; Cicely Tyson plays a mother who is flying a heart to her dying child (stop rolling your eyes!); Jimmie Walker as a clarinet player (what did I say about not laughing?); Mercedes McCambridge as Russian gymnastics trainer (OK, you can laugh at that); Bibi Andresson as a prostitute and Sylvia Kristel and Sybil Danning as love interests. <br /> <br /> Just pathetic. Filled with idiots and dialogues that will make you roar - watch Davidson get married on the plane near the end! The Concorde is taking all these people to Russia. They are attacked with missiles, escape, land safely in France and leave again the next day !!!! Do not you think the flight would have been canceled or something? Most of the acting is terrible - McCambridge is a sight to be seen in a red wig and a horrible fake accent. The only good performance is from Kennedy and Delon (who look fantastic) who give a very engaging performance. Still, that's not enough to make you sit down with this nonsense. Very long and bad special effects as well. This was a mega bomb and (fortunately) prevented Universal from doing more.
