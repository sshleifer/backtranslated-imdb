Naach would have won a Razzie for the Worst Movie in 2004 (it could also be overall) if it was global. When it comes to acting bad (also known as attitude / yawn / over (not)) Halle Berry is no match for Antra Malli. While the catwoman had a supposedly sexy actress in microscopic costumes and some action sequences, Naach had absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> One of those movies that makes me wonder why IMDb allows you to rate a movie as 0/10. Again, I think the movie does not even deserve a 0. It has to be something negative or less infinity. <br /> <br /> OK, and the plot outline? She is a choreographer full of attitude, arrogant and full of attitude, who knows a useless tramp, without skills, who aspires to be a tale of actor. The story is so short that if only one more sentence, IMDb can banish me by writing a spoiler. About storytelling? It's like a lot (sorry 2 people for the most part) of people moving in super slow motion. Do not try this movie if you bought a new DVD player. You would eventually believe that either the DVD is in poor condition or the DVD player is hit. It's not your fault. <br /> <br /> At the end of it all, you end up giving some credits to the director. At least he realized that both Antra Malli and Abhishek Bachan (at least at that time) can not speak convincingly about the dialogues, so there are not many dialogues in this film. So you can at least sleep your way through the movie, with some annoying noises from those Antra-Malli song sequences. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you are new to Bollywood Cinema. Once you have tolerated this movie, you can watch any Bollywood movie and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> There can be no torture worse than 3 hours!
