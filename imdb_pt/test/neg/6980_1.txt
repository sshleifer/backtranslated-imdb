I gave the film a chance just because it had good reviews. After watching the trailer I thought - what a bland movie full of clich√©s. But I decided to take a chance because the trailers usually do not portray the movie very well. What a waste of time ... The movie is worse than the trailer and after spending 2 hours watching, I could not remember a single line that made me laugh. The funniest parts of the movie were the CSI parodies, but that's also pretty much outdated. I could not identify with any of the characters, nor do I expect them to be together because I found them completely stupid. The plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive. Little clever comedy for people who are still in high school or feel that way mentally.
