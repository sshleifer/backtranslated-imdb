A bunch of teenage motorcyclists are in the woods walking in circles. They are having fun; Little do they know that nature is about to be triggered by an emo refugee from a Deliverance movie or Hills Have Eyes. He's armed with matches and lit a fire. And he has an eye that's bleeding or something. Why burn a park? Do not know. Maybe he does not like Smokey the Bear, or something. But he wears army / navy store uniforms, if that helps. <br /> <br /> Rangers send a single helicopter to fight the resulting fire; That's all you see except a lot of people on a base somewhere talking a lot about fire but doing nothing. Some cop or ranger or militiaman or whatever it is, falls from the helicopter on a defective rope. <br /> <br /> Everyone now rides a bike, as if they are testing for motocross. They always blow up wheelies, Evel Knievel jumps, spin around etc. They argue incessantly. Fire shots are as fake as a $ 3 bill; is the same footage from a dozen different angles, and the flame never grows or moves. And you have never seen fire-fighting equipment. <br /> <br /> SyFy channel movie that has about 0% science fiction attached to it. What you can expect from this: bad acting, cheap effects and a story that leads nowhere (as bikes and fire do not get anywhere). Cure insomniac laughable.
