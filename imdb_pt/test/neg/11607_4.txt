The big problem I had with this movie was that Lombard's character is, as another user says, "unnecessarily cruel." Lombard plays the role of Ann Krausheimer Smith, who believes she is married to David Smith, who played well with Robert Montgomery, properly dressed and still clumsy. The film has some funny moments, especially when the character of Montgomery makes a great effort to try to recover his "wife". Understandably, she's upset because marriage is not technically legal, but she only finds out three years. <br /> <br /> The character of Lombard seems rather cold with the sincere attempts of "husband" to conquer it. Although not very competent in this effort, Montgomery is visibly loving, and yet Lombard is as cool as an ice pillar. There are almost no clues suggesting any kind of reconciliation between the warring couple for much of the film, and it's hard to see any kind of comedy - even somber comedy - in that regard. To some extent, the film almost suggests a sadistic tone, with the character of Lombard receiving a "kick" of her husband's weak efforts. While this other type of 'Battle of the Sexes' movie may be considered, the reality is that it is a very unequal battle, if at all: the character of Montgomery, though certainly flawed, is not flawed enough to make him an exemplar typical of the male chauvinist / misogynist (an excellent example of this is Michael Douglas in 'War of the Roses'). In fact, the character is largely effeminate, as revealed not only by Montgomery's pointy dress (which probably owes largely to the permanently well-dressed actor) but also by his discomfort in trying - but not playing the role of an actor . bachelor womanizer. His only great defect is his vanity, but this failure does not balance with the excessive cruelty of the partner. And there is no suggestion that she is trying to instill any subconscious love of jealousy. That's what makes it so cruel and sad. The character of Montgomery simply seems weak. In fact, no wife would want such a weak man unless she "wore the pants" in the marriage. But again, a woman who wears the pants at a wedding would never try to be so cruel, because she has already stated that role from the beginning. So the whole theme seems strange. This film is neither a defender of feminism (Lombard's character shows some signs of the type of independent woman of the 1960s, but this idea is soon nullified and the character returns to the 1940s), nor a partial battle of the sexes the Montgomery character is really a cipher of masculinity and therefore a lost cause). <br /> <br /> This film is, superficially, a slapstick, but beneath this varnish is actually much darker with sadistic undertones. Whatever makes your resolution appear, well, weird. (Perhaps this oddity was the whole point?). In any case, the slapstick of this movie is not.
