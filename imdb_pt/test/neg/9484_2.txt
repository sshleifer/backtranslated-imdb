A stupid movie with a stupid plot. It seems they threw all the cliches imaginable in the blender. I particularly "liked" the part, where two teens get the French president to wipe the water. Because we all know how America is dedicated to conserving the environment. Kyoto, anyone? And the French chef, who has apparently never seen or tasted a hamburger ... That's why people think Americans have no culture. This, and the fact that we know their children when they come to Europe to "see the world" (ie eat at McDonalds in foreign capitals). They are not as dumb as the two preteens in this movie, but they have just about the same amount of cultural lighting and manners.
