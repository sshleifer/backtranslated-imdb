It is easy to say at the beginning of this film exactly what will happen and who will die. There are about 4 women and a man who is on vacation. This was done during the end of the ultra-Nazi years, when blond women were supposedly ultra-American survivors and all brunettes deserved death. <br /> <br /> This film, like the others of that era, tries to bring this. about, and the viewer knows it. There is no mystery or suspense. People fight, but everything is so predictable for the preconceptions of the time, it is laughable. <br /> <br /> The five people find two characters wild and go crazy. Everyone is crazy, so the writer-director's team can justify his Nazi propaganda. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the guy is attracted to the blonde, who is not really much to look at, and ignores a super hot brunette that any heterosexual man would go crazy. It should be remembered that in the 1970s, films were meant to attract women rather than men. <br /> <br /> Totally excrement and totally depressing.
