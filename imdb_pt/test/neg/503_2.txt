The operative rule in the production of this film seems to have been "never make a scene of 1 minute when you can do a scene of 10 minutes". This was a principle established from the beginning with an endlessly long portrait of the Harvard graduate from the 1870s. The point of this scene, I suppose, was to present some of the major figures in the story and give some of its background - which is somewhat effective when one compares the idealism of the Harvard graduation ceremony with the realism of life in Johnson County, Wyoming, but it keeps going and going, and that sets the stage for a movie that has repeated periods of mental numbness, I have found a significant amount of dialogue almost incoherent. In the end, I could not even watch in a session. I went through about half of that and had to put it aside for a few days before I could drag myself back to see how it happened. <br /> <br /> My reaction to this movie in many ways is a shame. because there are good points here. The performances are generally high caliber, especially Kris Kristofersson as Averill, Christopher Walken as champion and Isabelle Huppert as Ella. The basic story - interweaving as it is around this non-ubiquitous and tedious nothingness - is potentially interesting, focusing on immigrants' efforts to establish themselves in Johnson County and the efforts of a local cattle company to stop them by killing several of them. collaboration with the government and the military. There are also some absolutely breathtaking scenery scenes. Having said that, everything could, frankly, have been done in half the time - and it should have been. In the end, all these positive potentials are eliminated, again, by the numbing nothingness that the movie seems to spin around. Seriously - 2/10.
