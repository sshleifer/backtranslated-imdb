I never thought I'd get caught up saying this: but I think "Dog the Bounty Hunter" is more fun than this 90's crime drama. Walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the " High Octane "as CSI, CSI: Miami and so on. I'm not saying that all these shows are bad, but they're not good either. I like the karate chop action that Walker dispenses with the enemies of justice, and to the diverse cast of characters as much as the CSI series scientists. But there are some elements that I hate at a show like this. Stereotypes / Countertypes! That's right, stereotypes / countertypes! Unfortunately, this is a show for the moderates of Red State America, who refuse to get rid of the old prejudices of yesteryear, especially when it comes to crime. For example, there was an episode in which a psychically addicted kid ventures into Dallas, where he meets a group of kids in Goth / Punk clothing and they start harassing him. Now! This is exactly what Average America perceives gothic / punk culture. I mean, how often do people who dress like this rob and rob people who care about their own business. Whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot is always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood. OK! Not everyone who is a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime, drugs, poverty. Again, this is what the Red Half America sees in these people. Finally, why is Trivette the awkward partner, can not you make the sidekick an equal butt kicker?
