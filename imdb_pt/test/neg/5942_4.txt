This film captures the short moments between mother and son in rural Russia while she is dying. <br /> <br /> I'm so torn between being cool with the movie or declaring it to be a test of patience. On the one hand, the film is beautiful, with sparse dialogue capturing the essence of their feelings. There is really nothing to say, because everything that needs to be said is conveyed beyond words. The son shows so much affection, love and patience to his mother, which I think is a celebration of unconditional love for the family. It also reminds me cruelly that I could be in a situation like this, stuck in a place without joy, having to take care of a very sick person. "Mat I Syn" is a cruel reality. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Mat I Syn" moves very slowly. Do I really need to watch a train passing the horizon for more than 1 minute? With my previous experience of "Telets" and "Aleksandra", I'm so tempted to put "Mat I Syn" between them as a total annoyance. <br /> <br /> I think one has to be in the right state of mind to enjoy this movie. I certainly see the beauty of it, but maybe I'm not in the right frame of mind.
