Charles Bronson gave viewers many good moments on the screen. But this movie does not have everything a thriller / action movie should have. There are some action scenes in the movie, but they are really bad. And when the action scenes fail, does the story save the movie? No way, that's my answer to that. The story is even worse than the action scenes. It's very simple and annoying, and although I'm a big fan of movies, I almost fell asleep several times. I do not know how they created such a failure. Low budget, maybe? Regardless, it seemed like all the actors had no interest in being in the movie. When this happens, the result is very bad.
