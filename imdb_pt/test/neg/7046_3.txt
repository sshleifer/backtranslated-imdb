It's really a shame that there has been a lot of controversy surrounding this image (in other words, the infamous case between Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini), as this drew much attention to a very forgettable film. The story is incredibly slow, cheap and uninteresting. And to top it off, the film is filled to the brim with amateur actors who can barely speak English. I would have actually preferred subtitles - would have made the experience less tiring. Back to rotten acting. The neo-realist movement was great in Italy at the time this film was made. Many of these films are absolute masterpieces (such as Umberto D., De Sica, Children Are Watching Us and Miracle in Milan) because they have taken away a lot of non-professional actors. They behaved like normal people, but in Stromboli they act like normal people. TRYING to be actors and doing very badly - like children in a school play. <br /> <br /> By the way, ... if you're hoping the movie has a good ending (thus making your time commitment to the movie worth it), do not bother. The plot was totally non-engaging and silly - so much so that I actually thought I might have cared less about the characters. Like the island they all inhabit, the film is desolate and colorless and lifeless.
