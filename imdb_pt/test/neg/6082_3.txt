The movie was awful. The producing company must pay a fine for the waste of electricity that conveys this absurdity. There were many holes in the plot. Why would the DOJ send a murderer to assassinate a world leader? If they were not the Justice Department, why would they send someone they thought would not do the job? To quote Butch Cassidy: "Who are these guys?" Apparently, the director does not know either, because he never told us. <br /> <br /> The characters were unbelievable. They did not behave in any way that seemed to fit into what they were supposed to be. With the exception of the doctor, none of the characters was particularly attractive or pleasant. <br /> <br /> If you want to waste money on the electricity you need to watch this movie, feel free. Otherwise, run in the opposite direction.
