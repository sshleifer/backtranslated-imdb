My opinion: Even splendid underwater photography can save a familiar script and paper-like characters. <br /> <br /> For those who still do not have enough of the WILLY FREE photos, the FLIPPER can have a decent rental. Others are (strongly) suggested to stay away. Although FLIPPER is a harmless subject, it hardly presents something to the adult audience (unless it is the first time you see a dolphin). <br /> <br /> A remake of a 1960s TV show and movie, the FLIPPER might seem like a good idea: A dolphin enchants the life of a boy and a girl; they help the environment by first getting rid of toxic waste thrown into the shimmering waters of the Florida Keys while at the same time battling a salty shark and sailor who happens to be responsible for toxic waste and also happens to hate dolphins. But even for the 1990s, especially if a scary movie like FREE WILLY was a recent success, FLIPPER is just another harmless occasional empty movie for kids. Although the animals (in this case the main dolphin, a clumsy pelican and a realistic-looking hammerhead, typified as villain) and the spotless underwater cinematography steal the show, there is nothing FLIPPER can steal. <br /> <br /> The story is completely predictable, something that even today a child of 6 years may find evident. The (human) cast, led by a pre-LORD OF THE RINGS, Elijah Wood and an unemployed Paul Hogan, rarely has anything to do but stand and look pretty. Your acting skills, whatever they are for this movie, are rarely revealed on screen unless you consider the "acting" talents of the merry Bottlenose Dolphin. I do not think trying to recommend FLIPPER as meaningless family entertainment will not be fair, but anyone over the age of 10 (No, that 8) is better off renting or buying something else. Also, the movie takes about 95 minutes at the most. This can give you enough time for something else without worrying about your children. That alone can be worth the lease. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
