Steven Seagal's films in recent times have not been exactly good, but this is by far the worst since The Patriot. The plot makes no sense what ever; it is never clear what are the relationships between the characters, who works for whom or who is doubly crossing who. The film is completely disjointed, each scene seems to confuse the story more than take it forward. Even the action sequences are uninspired and difficult to follow. Most of the blame must be at the director's feet for not understanding the fundamentals of cinema, but Seagal does not do well, since one of the producers of this film, he must also share the blame. Oh, and I did not even mention how horrible the acting is, even by Seagal standards. Even being straightforward for the fodder video, this is not even worth it to Seagal fans. Give ample space!
