I am one of those gluttons for punishment when it comes to sitcoms these days, I still go see them from time to time. My observation is that most of them are not very funny, even those in large networks that are getting high ratings, I just do not understand who is amusing. While some made me laugh, none of them made me laugh loudly, I usually change the channel after a few minutes. Now, on the FOX network, they launch new programs like changing underwear, for some reason, they think they can make a good sitcom, wrong, wrong. They beat this dead horse so bad they even got to the point of hiring anyone they could find to write a low-quality driver with a bad dialogue and just resell it. Let's take a quick look at the last piece of junk that Fox produced called "The War at Home" <br /> <br /> I watched about 5 minutes and that was generous. In this particular episode, the daughter is speaking to her parents doing the I'm an adult now reticent. The father gets tired says to him "OK well, go ahead and do what you want, if you ruin is your problem" to that she responds, "Well, I think you're crazy, but at least I did not have AIDS" (hint of laughter, no way a living audience can be, unless they've been paid to applaud such rubbish) about not having AIDS to be in such bad taste. Well, at least I do not have to watch that crap anymore. Give a tip FOX, stop wasting your time with sitcoms.OK well you have the Simpsons, but now it's getting very old and tired too.
