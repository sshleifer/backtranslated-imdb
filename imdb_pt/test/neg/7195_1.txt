This appeared on a DVD that a friend of mine bought for me. They had listed it as "The Savage Guns," which was a totally different movie. Obviously, the people who packaged the DVD never bothered to see what they were recording on the disc. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is as bad as they come. The soundtrack is a combination of Batman TV / Early James Bond / Spaghetti western. Lots of galloping around this song. It seems like the guy has to gallop between the scenes to burn some time and give the people of the soundtrack something to do. <br /> <br /> English is dubbed over Italian and really shows. I wish it had been a little worse, and then have some of the extravagant feel of the Ed Wood movies. As it is, it's just awful.
