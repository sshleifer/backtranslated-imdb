Is this movie as bad as some claim? In my opinion, yes it is. I was not going to comment, noting that some comments have already been made, ranging from 'awful' to not so bad ... '. However, I can not resist. <br /> <br /> What do you make of a movie you have, on the DVD cover. the phrase "the actual story of" Ma BArker and his children ...

As I have seen it is 1/10 that I should vote.
