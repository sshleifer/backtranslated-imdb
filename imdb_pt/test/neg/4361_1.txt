...the first? Killjoy 1. But here's the Killjoy 2 review: <br /> <br /> (contains spoilers, so watch out for the readers) <br /> <br /> Oh my God. My, my, my. I'll start by saying that I had no hope that this movie would be good. Considering that Killjoy (the first film) is undoubtedly the worst film of all time, the sequence was not very promising. <br /> <br /> As expected, it was not delivered. <br /> <br /> The deaths were even weaker than in the first film. There was absolutely no eye drop, and each dressing seemed so false that I would not be surprised if they had a kindergarten class to do them. <br /> <br /> Look, I do not even know where to start. Hm, for starters, the film did not even have full length footage. It was only an hour and eight minutes long (68 minutes), but again, finishing it early was really a relief. In fact, that's the only reason this movie was not as bad as the first, because the first one was longer. Generally, I do not give spoilers in the reviews, but since I do not want any of you to go through the torture of watching this film waste, I'm going to screw it up. Not that there is too much to ruin. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the ending. KILLJOY IS THE MOST PUSSIER KILLER. Explosions, incendiary bombs, weapons, etc. are necessary. to kill all normal serial killers in horror movies. Guess what it took to kill Killjoy? A F *** ING GLASS OF WATER. No lies In the end, a girl took a cup of water and threw the water on Killjoy's face. Then Killjoy started to scream, and they tried to make it look like his face was melting, putting dry rubber cement on his forehead. So he stayed there, and the people went to sleep. <br /> <br /> Now let's hit the action. VERY TERRIBLE. Not even one person was believable at all. I do not even know what to say, other than looking like they just hired some hobos living on the streets to play in this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I honestly doubt they have spent more than that. Total $ 100 to make this movie. They had nothing. Most of it happened in the forest, which would have cost nothing to film. The actors were not giving in to any effort, so it's clear they were probably "working" for free. They did not have any special effects or good props, and probably used ketchup for blood. Hell, who am I kidding? They probably did not even spend $ 100. They probably spent $ 3.29 on a bottle of ketchup and that was it. A f ** kin movie made with a budget of $ 3.29. <br /> <br /> Because of Bob, they could not even rent a police uniform. In the end, after Killjoy dies, the girl wakes up and says "Where is he?" and the chief woman replies, "He is gone." Then, suddenly, some fat, silly guy with scars on his face pops out of nowhere with a cell phone saying, "You have a phone call." The girl responds and says "Oh, hi mother!" and smiles. Then the fat guy walks to reveal that he's a cop. However, he is wearing khaki pants and a regular button green shirt, with a badge on the front pocket. Hell, it was probably the badge the director got when he was on security patrol in 3rd grade. Then they all went into a beige blazer and left while the credits rolled. They could not even get a police car, so they just bought a brown blazer. F ** kin 'lame. Killjoy did not even have the ice cream van he had in the first film. <br /> <br /> Killjoy is arguably the most extravagant gay of EVER. If there was a slasher who wore pink spandex and carried a rainbow flag, he still would not be as gay as Killjoy. Killjoy is not funny either (and believe me, he tried to be). <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is an extremely weak threat given by one of the delinquents. Someone makes a comment to some kid about not going through the third year, to which the kid replies, "I'll show you the third grade!" threatening. This has to be the worst threat I've ever heard. "I'll show you the third grade!" <br /> <br /> This movie does not even work on a "so bad, it's good" level. It's filth. Unless you've done something bad and you're feeling so guilty about it that you want to punish yourself severely, DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Remember; if a flaming homosexual clown with a huge black afro tries to bore you to death with gay jokes (and try to kill him at the same time), just throw some water at him. Case closed. <br /> <br /> FINAL CLASSIFICATION: .1 out of 10
