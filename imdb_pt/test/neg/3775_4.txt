Veber is not recognized for his excellent driving skills. In fact, no one cares as long as he has had the laughter, very few to be honest, scattered throughout the process, thanks to Depardieu's characterization and the dialogue that Veber puts in his mouth. <br /> <br /> But that is not enough to make a great comedy, since there is no film outside the usual premise of Veber: a tough guy is doomed to join a very naive character. In L'Emmerdeur, La Chèvre or Les Compères, there was a real story going on about the fire vs. water process. The Le Diner de cons, although it was a play, managed to create a real suspense about the next catastrophe that Pinon would cause. In Tais-toi, the background story about revenge is redundant and too weak to arouse our interest. In addition, the heavy ones are lame both on the screen and in the script. <br /> <br /> Now, what's wrong? Veber closes this without creating action, without rhythm. Instead, he systematically uses overlapping ellipses (perhaps he met William Goldman in Hollywood) and the 'music' really emphasizes the lack of courage and a backbone in the story. <br /> <br /> So, you will have to be content. with the performance of Depardieu.
