You have to disagree with people saying that this is a terrible horror movie with good acting and camera work - I would say it's a risky horror film for a shockingly bad acting and lousy camera work - watch 'Ju-on: The Grudge to waste your time with this crap. The main idea behind the film is quite unique, considering the abundance of scary festivals based on killing dolls that have been foisted over the years; unfortunately, the story is treated with all the subtlety of Michael Bay's latest actioner, with a cast of characters that are uniformly unpleasant and played with a perfect precision of actors presumably interpreted by Korean soap operas of the day. It's not scary and can only cushion your expectations that the next Korean horror film sets in. Oh well.
