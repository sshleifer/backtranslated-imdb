Since he played a fool in Lone Wolf McQuade, actor / stuntman Kane Hodder has been busy. His film, Hatchet, received all the publicity last year but still makes a few more movies every year. He should have skipped this one. <br /> <br /> Hodder seems to be the king of slashers. he played Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th to Part VII: The New Blood (1988) to Jason X (2001). He's working on a new movie that looks like a remake of Halloween. He is very much what I would call a serial killer with his methodical and inexpressive thirst for blood. <br /> <br /> However, there was not much blood in this film and very little action on the camera. I felt like I was watching an episode of true law enforcement at A & E. <br /> <br /> I will not put the blame entirely on Hodder's shoulders, since the rest of the actors did not contribute much either. Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes, The Devil's Rejects) just ran his mouth until Gein shut him up. Adrienne Frantz ("The Bold and the Beautiful") was cute. Veteran actress ("Three's Company") and Pet Penthouse, Priscilla Barnes did a credible job. I'm sure there are other favorites to terror, but everyone seemed to go through their roles.
