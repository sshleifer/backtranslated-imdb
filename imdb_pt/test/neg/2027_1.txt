I found this DVD in the store and realized, why not support some indy movie and watch a cool horror movie. Please save your time and money and pass this on. The acting, the script, practically everything with this film is insignificant. There is not really much history and there is character development. I found myself not caring what happened to the people in the movie, as long as something happened. Everyone should be college age, but everyone seems to be in their thirties, except for the woman who plays a mother who seems to be pushing 40. In fact, the worst part of the movie is that all scenes are shown in a master shot. There is no editing, no cutouts or close-ups. Do yourself a favor and skip it.
