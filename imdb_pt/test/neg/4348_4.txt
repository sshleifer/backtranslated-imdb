It's a shame to throw such a good idea out. The main idea of ​​the film is to travel to past lives which - fortunately - is not a time travel, but a journey into the man who has nothing to do with the past or the future. (Maybe they should not be called past lives in the movie now that I think about it ... Another less, I guess). It's all in the present, in a different space ... Very interesting without causing much religious affliction. <br /> <br /> However, the music is totally repetitive, melodramatic, sentimental and out of place (not to mention!) There should be more variety and more thought about where there should be music and where there should not be. romantic flashbacks take up a lot of space and time to run and are totally unnecessary. The acting is not bad, although the language has prevented me from understanding it better. <br /> <br /> I believe the idea needed a bit more reflection , development and unfolding.Inner scenes could have better background settings because in many cases they seem unrealistic.Accordingly, I would say that this movie leaves a lot to be desired ...
