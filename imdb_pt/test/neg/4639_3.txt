The new celebrity deathmatch is terrible. They kill popular people and make low-budget celebrities win. I mean ... Andy Milonakis? Lil 'flip? Lil flip and Lil Wayne of both died. Lil 'flip sucks. the fight between Lil 'Jon and Lil' bow wow and Lil flip was MAD tacky and short. They should just kill them all. Why did Tobey lose to Jake and Christian lose to Adam? they are better actors and superheroes. They also spend a lot of time talking instead of fighting, which can annoy viewers. Everything seems rushed for some reason, can not they just make a long fight? the old deathmatch is much better.
