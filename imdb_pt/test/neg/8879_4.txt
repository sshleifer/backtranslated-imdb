Having watched this film several times, I came to the conclusion that Milos Forman made a very bold decision to make a muse for Goya, when the artist took what he would consider to be a stormy and passionate life while the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era raged . across Europe, certainly one that would have enough drama to draw. Although I really understand that Mr. Forman was reporting in the microcosm of the tragedy of Ines's life the devastation of the world at that time, I felt that there was much of what Goya left out of both his humanity. The strongest and eloquent point of this film was that, because of the fallen nature of man, each of us is a potential villain in the stream of life, each of us has evil within us, that we must fight with help God's. How eloquent when Goya says that he should have helped Ines more, as it is true for all of us! We must defend and protect the innocent. The superbly ironic scene in which the arrested priest once condemned to die pronounces the sentence of death in Lorenzo, that condemned originally it is thing of genius. I wanted something more when the credits rolled. Perhaps less of the unrealistic coincidences and more of the inner life of the characters.
