I remember seeing a clip of that movie on HBO when I was a kid and it scared the lives of everyone outside me. When I met, I watched. I wish I had not. The movie was not scary. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around an old woman running the castle. She feeds this horribly disfigured person in the basement of a 12th century castle. She continually beats the poor boy every day and feeds him. Well, that day she dies. Then, a few months later, a family moves. A father, a mother and her blind daughter. The father was involved in a horrible car accident that killed his son and left his daughter blind. <br /> <br /> After the movie, the daughter hears sounds, things break, etc. and everyone is not worried about anything. at all. That's until some people appear dead. Apparently, the creature in the basement has freed itself and is killing people. How this thing survived in recent months without food or water is impossible! Every time I saw the creature, it gave me goose bumps. The creature goes on a bloody killing and the police blame the father for the killings. <br /> <br /> I was a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 stars out of 10 Scary not scary!
