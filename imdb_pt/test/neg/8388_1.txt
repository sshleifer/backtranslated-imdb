To this day, this is still the worst piece of crap I've ever seen. So annoyed I even complained to Blockbuster to stock it. I and some friends rented them after we looked at the back cover thinking we were in a good horror movie. The plot seems to change during the film and there were many irrelevant fills. The movie ended abruptly, I think they ran out of film. The sound quality was terrible and the first female character had a very thick Spanish accent, although she uttered total nonsense anyway. The guy gave a brief glimpse of his bizarre assassination attempts. After wasting all the time to discuss in depth the workshop and its many power tools, he chooses to put a plastic bag over his head. All in all on second thoughts I think you have to watch this movie to really believe it exists.
