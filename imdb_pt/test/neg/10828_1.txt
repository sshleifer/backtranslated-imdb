Right ... then you have a dam, tons of water (which seems to flow very slowly) and a small town that happens to be right down the path of dam destruction. Play in a profitable glutton, a seemingly mentally unstable and disgruntled architect and your son, and then to spice things up you add a weak plot and poor acting. In short, when looking at this movie from the point of view of a paying customer, I would feel extremely irritated if it were a pay-per-view movie. If you want to laugh ... then you really need to watch this movie.
