I used to think it could not get any worse than "Army of the Dead", but this load of crap makes the movie mentioned above look like "The Godfather" !! Special effects are HORRIBLE (makes original Nintendo graphics look like HDTV). When it comes to acting, I put it this way, I went to a play with my 6-year-old niece and she gave a decent Oscar performance when compared to those D-List (and that's nice) actors and actresses. So basically, if I had a gun on my head and head to choose between watching this movie again or cutting my own arm with a dull knife, that's a tough choice! You know what, who needs two arms anyway?
