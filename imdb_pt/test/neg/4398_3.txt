jeez, when I heard this movie was a national LAMPOONS I thought it was going to be awesome, but I really have a say that was a disappointment. I've seen the most movies they've done, from Christmas holidays to van wilder, and this movie is the worst movie in its name, really bad actors and a very intense movie. this movie is probably good to watch if you're watching with a multitude of people crafted and the ability to laugh at it, but if you like good comedies like I am, I do not suggest this movie, I'd rather watch Van Wilder a second or third instead of watching this movie ... you've been warned.
