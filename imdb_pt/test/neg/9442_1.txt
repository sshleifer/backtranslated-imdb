I can not believe anyone is giving this movie a good rating. Besides the terrible plot, fine story line (nonexistent?) And slooooooooow pace, this would be the movie to watch if you were really trying to fall asleep. The writer's brain and director must have been fried eggs to have invented something as disgusting as this. Based on the plot summary in the case of the DVD, the premise actually looked promising. But in the first ten minutes I knew it was a lost cause. If you want to see an idea of ​​Area 51, check out the remake of "The Hills Have Eyes". Dreamland will soon disappear like all his pathetic movies. NEXT!!!
