The story is derived from "King Lear"; the setting is a farm in Iowa. Here's a test for that sort of thing: If you ask yourself, "Why did so-and-so did this," and the answer is, "Because that's what happened in 'King Lear,'" you know the movie failed. Well, that's what happens here. The father figure in this story is not living his own life, he is imitating a fictitious one. But there are more things wrong in the movie than that. <br /> <br /> Jocelyn Moorhouse is ambitious - far more ambitious than I imagine she realizes. She is trying to get the story of King Lear and completely change the scenario. This is a task in itself. The most likely outcome is that the transplanted history will die, and no one will be able to figure out why (although there are successful transplants such as West Side Story to make it worth a try). But she is also trying a revisionist rereading. In the version of "King Lear", she wants to create, Reagan and Goneril command our sympathy, and Cordelia is a villain. This is also a task in itself. <br /> <br /> Success in any task is difficult; succeeding both at once is impossible. In fact, getting as much as trying the other is impossible. If we want to look at the same events from a different moral perspective, then the events must be the same events - which means that there can be no adulteration in the configuration. If history is to be transplanted, live, in a different setting, your moral heart must continue beating all the time - which means there can be no adulteration of ethical perspective. Moorhouse was bound to fail not only in one, but in both his efforts. And so she did. ... Of course, it is possible to try both tasks, to fail in both tasks, but by some chance added to a work of art that is good for independent reasons. I mention this because I have not read Jane Smiley's novel, which, as far as I know, is good for independent reasons. But the movie is not. If there was nothing else wrong with this, there would still be no getting around the fact that it is so completely, painfully DULL. Corn fields themselves are even more boring than they would be in real life - which is not necessary, since in my head I can think of four films ("The Wizard of Oz", "North by Northwest"). "," The Straight Story "," Kikujiro ") in which the corn fields are not boring.
