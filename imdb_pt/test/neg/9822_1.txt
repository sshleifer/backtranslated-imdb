Where do we start with an offer like that? I almost said cinema, but that would go too far. The only hellish thing about this movie is that it's certainly a marriage made in hell, between nothing and the absurd, nonsense and balderdash. These films should have a physiological health warning to not hinder the spirit, to the point of believing that all the good filmmakers left the planet and their resources were handed over to the dunderheads who made this classic banal garbage just as if it were the sister-in-arms " League of Extraordinary Twaddle ". They are neither science fiction nor facts, fun, thought-provoking, humorous or heavy, but in a twilight zone devoid of all the accoutrements that induce people to give up their precious time, sit in a dark room and are generally more illuminated, animated. or happy at the end of it. If we could assign "Turkish" points to movies like this, that would be a turnip, as we passed through the turkey, ham, potatoes, cabbage, sauce and all the other ornaments before reaching the bottom of the well.
