As a writer and orthodox Jew, I was terribly disappointed with this film. The dialogue is banal and wasteful, the characters, also involved in lines ranging from prosaic to incredibly melodramatic, can not expand to genuinely textured individuals. The soundtrack of a trick tries to compensate for the softness, plunging abruptly into the silence to shake the viewer and the script of a prolonged catatonia. As a teenage revolutionary with an arrogant tirade, this movie is carried away by the wisdom of its revelation - patriarchy is wrong - and it completely exhausts its energies, hammering at this point. The resulting artistic crime is a complete lack of imaginative development; Moral crime is the reduction of human beings to caricatures: martyrs and grotesques.
