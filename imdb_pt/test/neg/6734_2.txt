Being from Norway (one of the ten richest countries in the world), it was really fun to see how we used trucks from the 50's and lived in medieval houses. And since we have very strict laws when it comes to revolvers, it was fun to see how many guns there really were in Norway during the five minutes of the shooting there. Mr. Direct-to-video even managed to put his muffler on short notice, so he must have powerful friends at the customs. <br /> <br /> Please do at least some research before heading to an "exotic" country, guys - you can hurt the feelings of the old fans. <br /> <br /> Sverre - old fan with heartache.
