This is truly a reformulation that should never have left the stable. There are two casts that are acting in completely different layers. At the top of the game are Joan Plowright and Maximillian Schell. Every nuance of the Franks is in plain sight. At the bottom of the pit are Melissa Gilbert and Doris Roberts. I can not imagine how Schell and Plowright can play so well when Gilbert and Roberts are working on their anti-magic. Gilbert ruins all the scenes in which she is. It's like the Father Knows Best in the Ghetto. She's Ann Frank's light. His run on Helen Keller was lean, but not horrible. This is sacrilege. Doris Roberts makes Mrs. Van Damm just annoying. She is a completely inadequate choice to play the sexually hungry woman whose flirtatious and unsatisfied presence has caused so much trouble in Het Acherhuis. This needed to be played by a woman who could convince us that she at least remembered how voluptuous she was. Your weight is not the problem. Joan Plowright could have played this part beautifully. Roberts was on a high career when this was done, getting plenty of press and lots of opportunities. Her performance here shows her weaknesses as an actress shamefully. James Coco and Clive Reville, have most of their scenes with Gilbert and Roberts, and as strong as they are, they are completely unable to undo the damage. done by your partners. Reville is a cunning actor capable of the iconic performance type given by Ed Wynne in the original film. He does not receive support from Gilbert. It drains the color of all scenes. <br /> <br /> I read with consternation the comments of those who grew up watching this version, full of attachment to these performances. It's a lesson in how the first version you see is attributed to you. It makes me reconsider my connection to some inferior products I loved in my childhood. I encourage you to see the original. It has very few weaknesses and it's head and shoulders above this mess.
