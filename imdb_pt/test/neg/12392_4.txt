Grosse Pointe Blank was actually a well below average movie. His hit man theme is very dry and is more like a romantic comedy than a hit thriller. The acting is very normal. The performances are extremely embarrassing at times with many characters looking very eccentric and this really bothered me. The whole meeting and the 'Wow, I have not seen you in 10 years!' The element is extremely extravagant and many scenes simply creep in, especially near the end, when they are at the actual meeting and the characters are going through each of their former colleagues one by one, greeting them. Everything seemed very tacky, useless and badly executed. <br /> <br /> The role of Dan Akroyd as a 'rival' killer is very meager. It only seems to appear once in the beginning and soon in the end in a 'final show' that is extremely sensational, but that does not deliver anything. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also very mediocre. . Most of the songs that are in this movie are from the 80's and, with the exception of two or three, are very bad. Listening to duff songs throughout a duff movie only increases the negativity that surrounds this movie. <br /> <br /> I could go on and talk about how boring things were and were very bad, like the few action sequences. that came and was very fast, the lack of development of the character and how badly everything was built in that department, the way that half of the time you forget is that the character of Cusak is up to a murderer, since the element is so nonexistent < to the way comedy finds it funny; but it is not. I did not laugh once during this movie. Of course, I may have smiled once in a while, but my only REAL felt good when I realized the movie was almost over! <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time on 'Grosse Pointe Blank', despite the relatively high (but incorrectly misdirected) rating of IMDb. I've seen movies that are better than this movie that has lower rating on this site, which says there are better movies out there. Just do not bother with it.
