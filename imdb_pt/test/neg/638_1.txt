What do you get when you put Lou Diamond Philips, Todd Bridges, Barry Corbin with a bad wig and an alien on a train? You get a really bad movie called "Alien Express" or "Dead Rail" which would be more fun in the old Comedy Central series "Mystery Science Theater 3000". You name it, this horrible movie suffered in areas of acting, plot, plot and special effects. In fact, the external passenger train shots seemed like the production team wore a standard HO scale model in front of a painted bottom! The rest of the special effects goes down from there. The plot is very predictable and is similar to two 1970s films called "Horror Express" and a disaster film called "The Cassandra Crossing". At least "The Cassandra Crossing" had a better cast, a captivating plot and real train scenes. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh and make a movie of lying at a "B movie" party, then look at this; otherwise, "Alien Express" derailed long before leaving the station!
