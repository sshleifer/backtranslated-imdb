I have noticed that many films that were featured in the "Mystery Science Theater" received a ton of low ratings on IMDb. However, some of the films featured in the films were not so bad and it is not fair to evaluate a movie that received the "MST" treatment - with the hosts making funny comments during the film. Now I'm not saying "The Girl from Lover's Lane" is a great movie, but it's not bad enough to deserve your current IMDb rating of 2.1. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Bix and Danny meeting. Bix is ​​a veteran tramp and Danny a younger guy who seems to have no particular reason to be wandering around the country. Once they explode in a small town, Bix needs to rescue Danny again and again because Danny is quite naive - a good way to say he has the intellect of a tomato. <br /> <br /> Along the way, something happens to the self-assured Bix - he meets a nice young woman and finds the pull of standing up pulling him. And in a weird subplot, Jack Elam plays a super-creepy wacko wandering around town, scaring everyone - yet strangely, the cops do not seem to get along very well, and no one on their own does anything about him. . Ultimately, however, when Elam puts the moves on a girl that Bix is ​​falling in love with, things get to boil. <br /> <br /> Overall, although not quite a big movie, there were many interesting elements in the plot. this movie - enough to deserve a score over 2.1. The biggest negatives are a simplistic conclusion to the mystery that occurs near the end as well as Danny's total stupidity too often. Considering the tiny budget, however, it is a small watchable film.
