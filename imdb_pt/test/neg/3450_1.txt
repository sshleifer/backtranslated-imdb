This was one of the worst movies I've ever encountered. Cinematography was monotonous, with long boring takes (such as a camera on a tripod filming a play) interspersed with "dramatic" angles that made little sense to the content on the screen. The editing was terrible, scenes combined with the delicacy of a butcher. The plot depended on the viewer being familiar with the historic night in which Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein. The acting was forced, with the kind of character development that left you with an intense interest in seeing each of them die horribly (the sooner the better).
