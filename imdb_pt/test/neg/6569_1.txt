Leonard Nimoy directed Star Trek III, which was not bad at all. Maybe William Shatner thought how Nimoy did what he could. After seeing this movie, he should have reversed that decision. <br /> <br /> Star Trek V The last frontier is the worst of the series. The acting of everyone involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and faded and makes them look as old as they seem in real life, the special effects are cheesy like when Spock has to rescue Kirk in a jet pack when he falls to down a mountain. <br /> <br /> The attempts at humor were lamentable and the story is so horrible that it does not tolerate thinking about what basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find God (seriously) I just do not care about any one of those movies and oh, not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract the male guards. She seemed to be attending a Grandma competition. If they wanted to make it look sexy. They were wrong. She looked grotesque. <br /> <br /> How it began to be produced or even written ... well, no use thinking about it. The only good place for this movie is in the trash. The worst of the series.
