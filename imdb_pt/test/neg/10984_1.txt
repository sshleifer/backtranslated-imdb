There is a good scenario to look at here if you can keep your eyes open long enough to see anything. I'm a big fan of life movies, but these people are just plain bland. Although there is nothing political. here the entire film can be seen as a political statement in that it shows how communism destroys the individual, making everyone the same dull animal who only spends his life sleeping, eating, and occasionally making love.
