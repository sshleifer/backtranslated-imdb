I hope that Matt Dorff's original screenplay for this is much better (there are signs of this - dialogue that should happen well before large f / x scenes (introduce characters) that would make sense much earlier, is arrested later in time - Maybe the original script has been for a long period of time, but perhaps not - in any case, it stinks.Every character is uninteresting, and everyone speaks expository passages as if they were speaking the word of God.รก characters that are fully expository - Dianne Wiest's "secretary Abbot" is simply awful, explaining things to her assistant (and by chance us) in endless speeches that NOBODY would tell anyone in real life (when she is not explaining things to her assistant that she already knows, her assistant explains things to HER that she already knows._ There are characters that are entirely one-dimensional - the evil power company guy, the pilot who just DOES NOT SPEAK under re your personal life and focus on your work. The well-intentioned hacker-superdooperuber of an energy company that can lock everything in Chicago (including the phones) - and then gives the oh-no-what-have-I-made speech do not leave the back door?). The crusader reporter who abandons his principles with a hat fall? The shift supervisor at the energy company who leaves his post in the midst of Chicago's worst crisis since the fire - with no consequences? Hospitals abandoned by doctors and nurses during the crisis (I'm not joking, that's in the movie) <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, and it's full of Hollywood moral cliches - usually women are good, men are bad , unless influenced by a woman (the latter is the punk with the weapon - deprived of the influence of a woman, he literally goes crazy); a stupid act of evil (like what the reporter did with the hacker-bozo) is fine, as long as you 'mean' well. ' Evil men die, evil capitalist men die as terribly as possible, everyone lives (well, except for Randy Quaid). And I heard someone say that nuclear power stations had to shut down because there was no electricity to operate the security systems (think about it)? There is a ray of sunshine (if you forgive the expression) - Randy Quaid basically plays your character from "Independence Day" (you know - "Hello boys - I'm baaaack!") - this time as a storm chaser with an infinite range of SUV and superdooper batteries for their camcorders. However, they kill him - especially, it seems, for the public to appreciate that tornadoes are very dangerous things (kind of shallow, that). <br /> <br /> Give this one a pass.
