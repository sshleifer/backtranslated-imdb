This movie does not even have the saving grace of being so bad that it's good. It is truly shocking. It's closer to an ironic parody than a disaster movie, but unfortunately, they meant it. Made for TV, but not worth it. It contains all the cliches and brute moments you can imagine. Oh will he save the city from the flood? Will your wife admit that she still loves him? Will they escape before the flood drowns them? I can not explain how bad this is. Terrible predictable plot that makes you shudder is so tacky. Bad effects (though, to be fair, I have seen super-imposed bubbling water). Bad script Lamentable performance. Horrible. So bad you should probably get drunk and watch.
