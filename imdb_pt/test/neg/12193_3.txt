What could have been an excellent hostage movie was totally ruined by what apparently looks like a bored director ... there were so many directions the film could have taken ... a vampire festival was not one of those !!! The last 45 minutes. or so it results in the film being an absolutely ridiculous waste of time. ... and sex machine? ... You must be kidding me! The acting talents of people like Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel (not to mention George Clooney) are completely wasted in this senseless movie. The director ... Robert Rodriguez, known for his other bloody movies, including Mariachi, a desperate, once in Mexico, and the very recent sin city ... really holds your attention with the well-executed first half ... which leads you to believe that you are at a fun time ... but apparently for no reason, and without any provocation, the madness begins ... there are even fragile attempts at parody and comedy . .. truly exasperating !!
