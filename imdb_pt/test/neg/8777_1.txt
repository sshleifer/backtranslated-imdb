I think it was not entirely the filmmaker's fault. The film suffered the unimaginably stupid decision to tell Clayton Moore (who had played the role in the 1950s and was the Lone Ranger with whom his parents grew up) that he could not wear the mask in public. Now remember, the poor bastard was not making that much money, and it was not like he was going to take anything from that movie, but the whole thing looked ... gratuitous. <br /> <br /> The other thing that the movie suffered (besides a protagonist whose voice was so horrible that it had to overdub) was the fact that the West was not so modern in 1981. John Wayne was dead and we had just been subjected to a long trip of liberal blame for a decade on how the West was built on the genocide of Native Americans. (That and Blazing Saddles sent the whole genre!) The Hollywood scene dodged the Western, because science fiction was cool then. <br /> <br /> The only scene he pointed out was when after rescuing the drunken President Grant (and seriously, I would have let Grant get the bad guys in. The country would have been better!) Grant asks Tonto what should be his reward: "Honor your treaties with my people." Yeah, right, like this was gonna happen!
