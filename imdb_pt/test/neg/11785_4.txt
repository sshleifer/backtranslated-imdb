I think Walter Pidgeon was poorly rated in this movie. It just is not credible on paper. Barbara Eden was beautiful and acted well with her. No one else was memorable. <br /> <br /> I remember the TV series that came out of this movie when I was a kid. I even think I had a plastic "Seaview" that would submerge and was great for playing in the tub. A long time ago. <br /> <br /> As for some of the other criticisms I read about this film: It is certainly unfair to judge the special effects or scientific knowledge of four decades ago by today's standards. The effects were OK for 1961. Not good, but okay. As for science, that was ridiculous even in 1961. There is no excuse. Also, the sub was terribly spacious. I understand that the Navy has refused any help for this film, so maybe the filmmakers have no idea. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie bored me. (And I'm a science fiction fan.) I can not recommend this. Grade: D-
