The word "boring" is played many times when it refers to exactly how bad a low budget horror movie may or may not be. I've seen a lot of B movies. A lot of horrible and terribly inept B movies. Some with a production value of a few hundred dollars. Does ineptitude, poor acting, worse continuity and embarrassing budgets really make the film unacceptable? Some, no doubt, yes. Most are probably a big fan of The Matrix. Well, I hate big budget movies, so I say no. The evil can sometimes be funny (Blood Freak), sometimes even mind-boggling (Troll 2), but boring will always be unattainable ... Hey, like Bloodthirsty Butchers, which reminds me, I'm writing a review for this stack of books. junk ... Uh, yes, anyway. This is one of many alternatives of the late British director Andy Milligan to sleeping pills. This one is based on Sweeney Todd ... Great. Milligan takes a boring story, and still gets "butcher". Hey, this is very funny, I said bu ... sorry, I keep distracting myself. This is not exactly easy. Come to think of it, I'll make things easier. No blood, no fright, no entertainment, just nasty and annoying people having incoherent conversations. This is bloodthirsty butcher. Oh, yes, and it's about a barber killing people and something about meat pies. I do not know, it's not important. <br /> <br /> For something a little more gratifying than Andy Milligan, there's always the only other one I've seen, the rats are coming, the werewolves are here. Yes, you heard me. But the more we forget about this Milligan guy together, and we get something sweet like Sick Girl or Teenape Goes To Camp. Whatever you decide, just know, the Bloodthirsty Butcher is a drug, possibly even more so than any other version of this already dull tale. And this, fans of B movies, is actually saying something. 2/10
