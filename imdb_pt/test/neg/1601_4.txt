I was eager to watch "Wirey Spindell" since it happened in Schaffer's "Fall." Unfortunately, I found "WS" a bunch of wandering, uninteresting and boring claptrap, along with what is apparently the signature of Schaeffer, a mixture of story, narration and poetry. The film recounts the sexual experiences and other experiences of a Manhattan man about to marry through self-narrated flashbacks. Like beads on a rope, apparently Schaffer tied up every little experience of sex life, while neglecting the beauty of the necklace. The result is an incoherent and disjointed story about a boy who can not engender empathy and leaves the viewer disconnected, dissatisfied and with a bad taste that stains the end of mechanical well-being. A mediocre indie and a step back to Schaeffer.
