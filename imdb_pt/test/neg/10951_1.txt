First of all, I'm a big fan of bad movies. Note B is always good for laughing. Unfortunately this movie is just plain bad. I dressed zombie for a party and my makeup looked better than the ones in this movie. Especially the big one at first, it seemed like a child had drawn his face with wax chalk. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that I do not need to comment on why. The effects are also extremely amateurish, with obvious blood tubes firing a jet of blood through the backs of the zombies when hit. <br /> <br /> It also seems that many people commenting on this movie are trying to increase the rating. No one without a finger on the pie would rate this movie above 5/10. Frankly, it's a shame that the people who worked on this movie are increasing their own ratings. <br /> <br /> I suggest that everyone avoid this movie, it's not worth wasting the 90 minutes of your life. <br /> Absolutely awful.
