As much as I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones, I wondered one more time, why redo a good movie? This version did not have the tension and passion of Mostly Martha. It was a plain steal. Maxime Foerste was more convincing as a suffering child who healed with love. I could not believe Abigail Breslin. Martina Gedeck had this role. Unfortunately Zeta-Jones should have found another that she could own (she has other roles she has). Sergio Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but happy Italian. Aaron Eckhart looked without passion in comparison. This version was nice but bland. <br /> <br /> The love between Mario and Martha was perhaps predictable, but satisfying. The therapist added some interesting color that did not seem important. I liked it when in the end he said he would come back, but the movie ended before he returned. I have Mostly Martha at home. From time to time I revisit it.
