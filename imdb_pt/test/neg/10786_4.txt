Jeremy Irons and Forrest Whitaker are good actors. But this movie was poorly written. First of all, during the abduction scene, Irons sits comfortably in his chair ... he seems to be reading something, and quite calm too! Maybe the director shot the actor between the shots? In addition, the violence in the kidnapping was a big disappointment. Slow, flying bullets - as your wife and daughter are dead is not so interesting and the tension is lost. Her mourning then wasted another 10 minutes. So he decided to "take revenge" and talk to all his fellow journalists and industry ambassadors (he's a journalist for the annoying Economist journalist) and behold, they really give him tips on where to find the bad guys! How do they know? But what really made me turn the film off was when Irons finds his way into a warehouse where thugs are leaving - BUT NOT THE BADDIES THAT KILLED HIS WIFE - and expels them anyway. so he's just a killer. he walks away and, well ... I close it. I mean, I could not figure out how his friends knew about anything, and I also thought he was after the two remaining guys in custody who were the original hijackers. Instead, he goes after his friends, I think, or anyone in warehouses and leave automatic guns nearby. The suspense was simply totally conventional and the dialogue was lame ("It's alright son, crying helps", he says to the son. Son says "no, no" and father says "You're right ... no") Irons takes on questionable roles - like that dragon movie he made. He was excellent at Brideshead Revisited, which is a completely different animal from this lukewarm thriller.
