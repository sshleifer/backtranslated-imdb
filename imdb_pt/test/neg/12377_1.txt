I wish I had voted this movie in ten, it's funny. If they meant to be so funny, I'd give it ten. I have to give a 1, but it's the funniest one you'll want to watch. See the giant flash on the screen! Where did you come from? What is it? It flies, it terrifies, it's electrifying, it's on the ropes! This bird has real personality. I was about ten when I first saw her, and when Big Bird showed up on Sesame Street, I was sure they were one and the same!
