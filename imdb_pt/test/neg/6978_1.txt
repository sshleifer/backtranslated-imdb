This movie is an abomination of everything that is worthy in the movies. The main actor surprises his audience by not acting. We have to watch almost two hours of his dull face. The jokes are all lame I never laughed once it was Saturday night there were 5 of us having a beer all to laugh at and then we put it on and you can feel all the heat and color being drained from the room. The movie was over and the weather was ruined, so we were all separated, ruined the night! Ok, so pros and cons Pros Beautiful scenery in Hawaii, looks good on Bluray. Cons worse acting always; you can tell everyone involved that you are only thinking about payday. Predictable poor installment. Zero character development. Jokes forced to fall on the floor. Many penis shots from guys who to be fair act better than him and have more charisma. Let all the creators of this movie hang their heads in shame and keep their flabby manhood cheap.
