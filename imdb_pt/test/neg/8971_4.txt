This seems very much flamboyant and patronizing to a great extent. The whole plot is extremely forced - especially the "gallant" effort to save the college from ruin, and the moralistic tone (especially of the protagonist) rages a little. <br /> <br /> But there are one or two comic books. moments that help ease the boredom, and the dancing is a lot of fun (especially for the supposed amateurs - ha ha!) <br /> <br /> The owner of the store and the young man doing spectacular tap dance were particular highlights. And I also enjoyed Peter Laughton's impressions of Charles Laughton and Ronald Coleman.
