This movie proves a theory I've had for some time - in Australia, as long as a movie deals with the right theme, it will be a success, no matter how terrible. Aussie Park Boyz could not be worse - the acting is beyond terrible, the plot is basically a poor imitation of Warriors, and the filmmakers clearly have no idea about ethnic gangs in Australia (an Irish gang in the 21st century in Sydney! that Irish gangs were in Australia about a hundred years ago at the time of the repairs!) But, as it is ethnic rivalry, one of the four topics guaranteed success in Australian cinema (along with struggling families, minority groups). and the biography of a famous Australian) won several Academy Awards. I have always suspected that Australian critics will absorb any rubbish that deals with these problems, but part of me thought, or at least hoped, that they would have their limits. This movie proves otherwise. So for all aspiring Australian producers out there, do not bother thinking about your movie or picking people who really can act or even understand your facts - just write a screenplay about a poor family trying to survive, or someone from a foreign race coming to Australia and having to deal with racial prejudices and stereotypes, or, if you want to take a leaf out of these people's book, some ethnic gang fighting against some other ethnic gang that is not really plausible in the period in which the movie is set, and your movie will win five Academy Awards, no matter how pathetic it may be!
