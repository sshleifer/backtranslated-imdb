This movie is fun if you like movies from the poverty line, public domain of the first half of the 20th century, or are fans of amateur films. The film unites public domain thrillers together with newly filmed scenes in which the "actors" (with the sole exception of Redfield making a near-dead in Lugosi rip, all the performers are simply terrible!) Try to interact with the footage stock. "New" footage is covered with digitally added film scratches, as well as some precarious old images (?? !!). As close as I can discover the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers being gathered on an island for a read will (?) This movie, boasting a creative premise ala 'Dead Men Do not Wear Plaid', is a technical and creative disaster. In a terribly long and wounded tide on a ship describes an aborted trip to 'Fog Island', whatever! The "flashback" then incoherently links old scenes from completely different epochs and totally disparate movie quality. Bela Lugosi Finds a Brooklyn Gorilla (1952) and a few other poverty line productions. The unrelated scenes from 'The Lost World' (1925), The Most Dangerous Game (1932), White Zombie (1932) This is done through an incredibly bad voice over which seems to take up too much space as if the audio had been recorded on a cheap home video camera. The filmmakers seem to think they are paying homage to the great actors of the past, giving the characters the surnames of famous actors (Carradine, Zucco, Ouspenskaya, etc., etc.). This tactic was done smartly as well as subtly in 'Final Destination' here it's just nasty! Bizarre, painfully bland, jokes about Spider-Man, Dracula and Superman are plentiful. Even the old dirt like "Dewey, Cheetam and Howe" lawyer's reference is used here, this was old and tired when The Three Stooges used it in the 1930's. The stock of movies and audio did not combine scene to scene, and dozens of different sources are used for Lugosi. The end effect is that he seems to be getting older, younger, older, leaner, heavier, younger and older, minute by minute. Strangely, the film did not use this as a comedy subplot and wasted a good comedy chance. <br /> <br /> True, though, it was so much fun to see that late at night in bed. Maybe that's what they wanted it to happen!
