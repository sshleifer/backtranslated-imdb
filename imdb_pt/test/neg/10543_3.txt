I liked the first "Toxic Avenger", but the sequence just did not work. There are some funny jokes in the opening, involving house members for the blind, but after that point I was simply bored. The sequel is also filled with a lot of quirky, low-brow humor. Only this time is not funny! Many of the gags revolve around crusty Japanese stereotypes. Almost every Japanese character seems to be chopping fish. Does everyone in Japan chop fish? Troma's movies are known to be more than a little irreverent, but if you're going to use humor involving racial stereotypes, at least make it fun. I can not laugh if I get delivered the same crap I've seen a million times before! One thing I have to give credit for is free nudity. There is even more free nudity than at first. But overall, I was very disappointed, and the film ends with a tedious chase scene that left me panting and snorting, dying for the movie to go away. At least there's a hilarious line from the movie that made me laugh. After the villain says a phrase from Shakespeare to one of the local citizens, the citizen (an elderly woman) responds by saying "F ** k you - that is by David Mamet". <br /> <br />: 3 (out of 10)
