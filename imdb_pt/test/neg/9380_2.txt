The only good thing about Persepolis are the shadows created in the animation style of German Expressionism and a hint of history. This movie bored me. It was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture that tries everything and then goes back to her roots. Here she finds a great discontent once more and finally leaves to finish all the others in her country discover the situation and what they will do now that she is not there to support them. It comes to no conclusion and leaves us with the feeling that this woman has no loyalty. Remember, it is divided between cultures and does not have enough background, it seems to find out what is important and real. She's hearing so many voices and will probably end up being a world citizen of some sort who has ties to her culture native to Iran. The only thing I got from this movie was anguish.
