Crazy director .... Yeah, you need to be crazy to make a movie up close. Rob Lowe was bad at his character, Ice-t is always bad and Burt Reynolds had nothing to do in the movie. Crazy six is ​​an unknown film with some known actors ... this is very strange. A bad movie with some good actors. It seems that the bad movie influenced his performance ... That's what happened! Crazy people ..... I give you * and a half off *****
