Hey, if people thought the wood was a bad director, then they did not see that movie entirely. I mean, there were holes in the wide-open plot and underused cast. Special effects of poor quality. I mean, I can not believe this movie came out of a Hollywood studio. A high school theater club could probably come out with a better product. I mean, they had Erika Eleniak, who is beautiful Casper van dien and less qualified. Your agents must be shot to ask them to sign this dribble, they do not read scripts. I still can not believe that the little lister was a survivor in the movie that I was beating his head all the time why he is not a descendant of van helsing being the last man standing. I'm a fan of vampire movies and this is by far the worst they should ever wager so he never see the light of day.
