I watched the screening of this movie. Travolta came to do a question and answer session after the movie ended. It was a small projection room in Tribeca. Out of courtesy to him I did not get out of what I wanted to do. This is the worst movie. For starters, the script was poorly written. The writer writes in a voice. The dialogue was blistering and clich√©. As this writer / director managed to Scarlet Johansen, John Travolta and Lions Gate Entertainment to support her about it is the only brilliant thing she has accomplished in this fiasco. <br /> <br /> I actually recommend this movie to all aspiring writers. , directors and filmmakers. Because when you are told you are wasting your time and it will be impossible for you to reach your goals. Hey ... look at this crap and tell yourself ... if they can do it, then anything is possible. <br /> <br /> PS- Travolta had a great Q & A session though ... he was at ease, spoke freely and was a good boy down to earth. The director / writer stayed on the sidelines. When John tried to wrap her in the conversation, she pulled away like a piece of wood and never joined her. I looked at her and thought ... how could this person be able to "arm" with successful agents, studio executives, great talents? ... when she can not open her mouth at a screening of her own film. The conclusion of some of us present was that she must have strong family connections in the business. <br /> <br /> After watching this, you should follow Guy Ritchie's zero-star masterpiece, "Swept Away," with the most unintentionally funny and worst-performing wife of Madonna. She's so bad and it feels so bad in this movie that I think this was his way of getting back to her for all the abuse he takes from her at home.
