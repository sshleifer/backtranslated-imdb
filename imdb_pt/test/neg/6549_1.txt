The only positive thing I can think about this garbage is that now I finally have a good answer ready if anyone asks me what the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It took a little effort to make it more watchable ... a lot more effort and it could have been brilliant indeed. <br /> <br /> Why would anyone want to produce such waste? <br /> <br /> I refuse to believe that a director could be so ridiculously untalented. <br /> <br /> Making a completely intolerable movie must have been the point. <br /> <br /> Anything else just does not make sense.
