As a useful warning to others, I believe that "Skeleton Man" is actually worse than "Raptor Island". I've been using IR as an example of the worst original movie featured on the Sci-Fi channel, but SM is the most ridiculously incoherent and ill-conceived movie I've ever seen. Yes, I watched almost the whole thing, arriving in about 35 minutes. It attracted me with her pure ineptitude. What was Sci-Fi thinking? Once Skeleton Man and the surviving leader of the platoon (or whatever it was - I am not good at military unit terminology) arrived at the chemical plant, the film moved into a zone of impossible absurdities that was almost hypnotizing . I had the same idea of ​​another viewer who wondered if more than one movie had someone being edited to create a terrible whole.
