It may be unfair not to like a movie for what it is not, not for what it is, but I approached it in the hope that, finally, a filmmaker would make a film about gays and rural women from small towns. Instead, the focus is mostly on outrageous fanaticism (big news!) Of the locals (and those in outlying areas) and the horrific torture / murder of a gay young man. So much time spent for stupid people chattering about AIDS, sin, fire from hell and perverts. So much time dedicated to the ghoulish preacher complaining about the Bible and gays getting what they deserve. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see more people who came to the "gay small town bar", not those who opposed it. Moreover, the young man who was murdered is not even from this city. <br /> <br /> The whole movie acts as a warning and not as a celebration, and is very suspicious.
