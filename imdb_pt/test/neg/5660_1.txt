The first performance is so terrible, except for the actor who plays Spencer. Mirinda Cosgrove does not deserve her own show She must have Dick with Drake and Josh. The only person I like Beyond Spencer Is Nevel Hes Super Bad @ $$ He Kicked Carlys Crews @ $$ And I liked it. > The Episode I Hate It Very Much It's Imyourbigesstfan I Hate It Young Icaly Fan It Made Me Almost Kill Me False It's A Good Word To Describe It Please Do not See This Nothing On TV It's Good To Go With Classics Like Family Affairs Good Show Ban Icarly Vamos all back to Doug Nick Version Only Please do not see I hate Icarly Oh too Nathan Kress is a wannabee Fredie Highmore
