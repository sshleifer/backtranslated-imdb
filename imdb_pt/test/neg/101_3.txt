I gave this a 3 out of a possible 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Unless you enjoy wasting your time watching an anorexic actress, in this movie is Carly Pope, behaving like a ditz, do not bother. <Br Carly Pope plays Sara Novak, a young university student, who is intrigued by a puzzle game that takes her underground tunnels under the city - a dangerous thing for a well-armed man to enter. There are several intrigues in the film - a strange classmate who is apparently chasing after Sara, a cynical merchant who runs some sort of unusual establishment that seems to be located. in a ghetto alley, an idiot nerd hanging in the cynical shop, and a woman named Emily Gray, who is back in prison. <br /> <br /> Sara's father is a lawyer who is taking care of Emily. Case of Gray. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, Emily Gray tried to drown a 12-year-old boy. Emily was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for 5 years, and for some reason, they let her out again, even if it's obvious she's still dangerously disturbed. <br /> <br /> The only explanation Emily gave for her crime is: I never sinned. <br /> <br /> It's all part of the design. <br /> <br /> Well, my friend, do not expect to get a better explanation than this, because you will not.
