AWiP tries to be funny, scary, tense and romantic ... and fails in all respects. The acting is at best, but mostly stupid. Special effects are not enough to compensate for the stupid devices in the plot, and the chemistry between the * ANY * character is juvenile. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to be angry with yourself, do not pay money to see.
