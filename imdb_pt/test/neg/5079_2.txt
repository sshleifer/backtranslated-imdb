I went to see this because of snipes / statham, but honestly, Chaos is terrible. This movie has absolutely nothing - it should not have been done. <br /> <br /> Do not read this review if you do not want to read spoilers, because I will address many plot-holes here. <br /> <br /> First - the opening scene. It's the big event that made the two semi-leading characters (Statham and Snipes) crooked. But it's boring and mundane. Just at the end we can see what really happened and when you do not care anymore. In addition - all this event, where a thug and his hostage are killed, is not enough news to fill hundreds of newspaper articles, as is mentioned in the film. <br /> <br /> So work on the bench - it does not. Do not leave the floor for a second. The bank robber makes some unnecessary references to chaos theory (which has nothing to do with the whole story, by the way). The way Statham is summoned is very "Hard to Kill with a Vengeance", but more annoying. So the things that happen in the bank are strange and meaningless. "What about the safe?" There seems to be some plot unfolding there, but then it does not. "Why go through the trouble of tying two people when it leads to nothing?" It involves a lot of preparation and is used for nothing! "Why does not the SWAT leader listen to the officer in charge when he tells them to get up?" <br /> <br /> And that's only the first 10 minutes. It keeps getting worse. <br /> <br /> The whole romantic / love story (with the comment that he was not just a better cop, he was a better man to finish) is painful to watch. It's just useless - Why would Statham's character point to the change in camera position in the bank's revised footage? This essentially leads to finding the "virus" that will give you all the money. "Why go to the trouble of forging some guys and killing him, but DO NOT kill the guy who can identify you." <br /> <br /> I could go on for a long time (seriously), but it's like this movie was ... nonsensical. The whole script is a mess. The "clever" references to chaos theory are actually laughable and pathetic. The plot 'twists' can be seen from miles away and the main characters seem to be making mistakes all the time. It's really painful to watch a movie like that in which the audience is taken as dumb and dumb, which the director hopes will not see all the holes and the ridiculous script. The "explanation scene" at the end only increases the insult. Not really a good movie. Anyway. <br /> <br /> People who come to see an action movie do not understand what they are looking for. People who come to watch a police movie do not understand. People who come to see a clever thriller do not understand this. In essence, everyone gets the same - a big disappointment and a waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
