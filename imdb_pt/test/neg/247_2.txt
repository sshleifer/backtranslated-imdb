Oh, such an original title for a really bad movie. The dubbing is hilarious, since the voices and mouths never seem to match. As a result, I had no idea what was happening as I watched this confusion unfold. There are flashbacks within the flashbacks and no real time occurs until the end. The Aztec ceremony made me laugh. I rewound twice and got the best ab training ever. The Aztec lady singer is a natural comic and the dancing and costumes are a joke. A guy has a face full of acid, there's a lot of fighting, you have no idea who any character is (not that I really care), and it's a noir mess. Oh, and the real fight does not happen for some time, so during the movie feel free to get up, take a nap, take a trip. You will not miss anything exciting.
