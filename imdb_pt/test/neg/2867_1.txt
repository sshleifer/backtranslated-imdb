I could not bear to watch that much crap. This is their standard rubbish that certain annoying women love the old English drama with many costumes and cliché characters that seem to be plucked straight from oliver twist or some other dickens romance. This uses the usual clichés of the Victorian era. Some stupid people really think that all the emotional torture of this culture being so repressed is somehow fascinating and romantic. That is sap, pure and total junk and boring as watching the grass grow. As such, it is perfect for women who yearn for some kind of romantic drama in a Victorian setting but for this man this movie is nothing more than cruel and unusual torture and punishment to watch a lot of monotonous scenes with non-original characters talking in that place. miserable forced and false English accent.
