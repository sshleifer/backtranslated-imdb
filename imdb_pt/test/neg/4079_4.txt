EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, sequel "to" BRUCE ALMIGHTY "with Carell's anchor, Evan Baxter, leaving the TV to start his season as a Congressional representative who is busy when God (Freeman reprizing his sacred role; Jim Carrey wisely avoided the" calling ") demands that he builds an ark like Noah and the hilarity follows (or should). Godforsaken's sitcoms script, Steve Oedekerk, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow, is absolutely lame and only Carell's kind person transcends his vain Evan into something The final result is a bunch of bird poop jokes and general swelling (supposedly costing $ 175 M for the CGI F / X) Sykes steals the show as Evan's sarcastic assistant.
