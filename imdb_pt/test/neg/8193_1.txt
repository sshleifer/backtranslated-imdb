^^ Contains spoilers ^^ This movie sucks. Do not watch. <br /> <br /> There is no one in this movie to cheer, or even like, except the wife, and she wins by default. Everyone is selfish, and many things happen that do not make sense. <br /> <br /> The acting is mediocre at best and everyone breathes too much into everything. No one can even cry with credibility. <br /> <br /> If you leave the room for a second, then something totally out of the left field will happen, and it will not make any sense. <br /> For example, I left the room for a second while the character of Jennie Garth was sleeping with her manager. I come back, seriously about 4 minutes later, (I'm also sure there was a commercial somewhere there) and she's sleeping with that Berko guy. <br /> <br /> I gave up on this movie at a time when Berko was being an idiot with his fiance in the car because she did not want to cancel the marriage. <br /> <br /> I've wasted 2 hours of my life. You should not.
