'Bloody Birthday' is a strange and sometimes humorous low budget horror film in the lines of 'Mikey' or a less intelligent version of 'The Good Son'. <br /> <br /> Set In A Little Californian In the city, three babies are born at the height of an eclipse, where planetary alignment means that they somehow are born without emotions. Ten years later, our three little psychopaths launch themselves to slaughter, ending up with parents, siblings, teachers, and anyone else who annoys them. Only a teenager knows the truth in order to stop them. There is no explanation why babies born in the world at the same time are not so twisted, but there you go! <br /> <br /> For a horror movie, it is very tame in terms of violence and violence, which I suppose highlights the problem of escalating childlike characters as the killers, as there is so much that you can expose to the young actors . Instead, it's fun and a little disturbing to see three ten-year-olds plotting murders and carrying out their plans using firearms, knives, and crossbows. The main reason it is not quite ridiculous is because the child actors are very convincing in their roles with the way they maliciously interpret the little innocents in front of disenchanted adults as they show their dark side to the girl who knows the truth. "Bloody Birthday" is rather mediocre as a horror movie, with few scares and little blood, but because it has the shock factor of having children as killers, it's a bit unique in that sense. . One to see if there is nothing else.
