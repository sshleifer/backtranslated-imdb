Like most, I rented this after hearing universal praise. And despite countless bizarre and unexplained moments along the way, I was very interested and entertained for 100 minutes of the movie. So the two women went to the "show" late at night. The rest of the movie (which is over 40 minutes by the way) is up to WEIRDER than the first part AND contradicts completely and turns out what I had already seen. Then the movie ends abruptly. <br /> <br /> Confused, I went to my computer to see if I could buy a clue about what happened. Nothing made sense, and I'm a very smart guy. None of these other user comments makes sense, even when they say "SPOILERS." I still have no idea what they're saying. Someone's dream? Unreal? So what's the point of a 2-hour, 30-minute movie if it's not "real"? Or is it real? I'm forced to make a choice. Or: <br /> <br /> [a] The film is genius work on a level MESSAGE and I'm just too stupid to understand it. <br /> <br /> The movie is weird as strange and simply does not make sense. Everyone who loves this is trying to save face and pretend to "catch" it. <br /> <br /> I choose [b]. Screw you guys I'm going home...
