Zoey 101 is such a stupid show. I do not know if that's because the snob Jamie Lynn Spears is his star or what, but I just know the show sucks. It's about a girl and her brother going to a boarding school. The jokes in this show are extremely dull and boring, and I hate every character except Chase and Lola. Heck, the jokes about this show are so bland that they make Jack Black look like Monty Python. This show is undoubtedly one of Nickelodeon's worst shows, right there with Avatar and Danny Phantom in the pit of shame, and if this show were a person with any honor, he would feel ashamed. <br /> <br /> 1/10
