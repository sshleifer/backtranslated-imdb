I can not remember when it was the last time I was so disappointed in any movie. Probably I expected a lot to happen (in a way you can expect action in dogma style movies, of course). But there is nothing happening here. Luckily I was watching at home and could change channels whenever silence and stupid faces began to kill me. And that was very frequent! It is not really a pleasure to watch ugly people who do not speak and move slowly, caress pigs and kiss French men, not to speak of ugly bodies having sex explicitly. If only that made sense ... the whole murder situation is ridiculous; It looks like it was created just to show one more vagina since zero characters are able to actually solve the crime. Having only four pseudo-developed characters and a movie going nowhere, it is soon obvious who the director chose as a killer. And that does not make sense either. Despite all the boredom and suffering, I must admit that somehow it touched me in an inexplicable way. Maybe you should take a look at yourself, though I do not recommend it.
