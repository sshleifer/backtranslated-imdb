Typically crafted, HBO production with a first-line cast, a rich little-town atmosphere and some nice narrative vignettes, graced by above-average production values. <br /> <br /> But, and this is a huge 'but', the various subplots, populated with some pleasant caricatures, most of the time annoying, are paper thin and pass from side to side for more than three long hours. <br /> <br /> The often foolish story between the melodrama, without much entertaining, and personal drama, without being profound at all. <br /> <br /> A shame, because some scenes really shine. Two or three, that is. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 Paul Newmans Dirty
