My first impression of the trailer for Saikano: Live Action (visible on YouTube) was "Wow, this may be perhaps one of the few live action anime adaptations." <br /> <br /> This time I was just wrong! Simply put, the Saikano live-action film was a puzzle missing a number of pieces; gather just enough to get the vague picture of everything. The story of the movie loosely follows anime and manga, but the story of the movie is just the picture of a car, rather than a complete car . It seems that many parts of the story originally in the anime were left out, altered or completely altered. In fact, the ending is completely different from the manga or anime finals. <br /> <br /> Characters especially; many left out or had a different feeling. The connection between Fuyumi and Shuji is reduced to that of Shuji knowing her because she owns the video store. The character of Chise was already very strong and only uttered the infamous I apologize a few times in the film. The same can be said with Shuji. We lost the shy but tall man, the music he hums and his frequent action of calling Chise a fool. Other characters such as Tetsu and Akemi had a different and subdued feeling for them. Maybe the fall and fall of other characters would focus much more on Chise and Shuji, what happened. Too much. Expecting many action scenes like those in the trailer? Well, do not do that! Those in the trailer plus a few minutes, is the only amount of action you will get. A lot of the movie is talking about that while I was browsing through the movie before watching it all, I thought I had gotten a regular Asian romance drama. <br /> <br /> The pace was too fast. In the film, we see the famous scene of Chise armed with small wings and an arm of a chain gun, in little less than nine minutes of initiating it. There is very little time to get to know the characters and connect with them. What they should have done was divide it into two films, or even a trilogy. If it were not so many things would have to be changed or discarded. <br /> <br /> But again the film behaves like a painting. The anime was more of a complete automobile, because even if all those little details are so small, they can really add up. <br /> <br /> * PRODUCTION * -Visuals- Visuals were disappointing. Much of the special effects turned out to be quite extravagant, especially the CGI. Unfortunately, they were like those found in Sci-Fi channel films. They are bearable and this movie is not for the purposes. <br /> <br /> Music-Music was average. Much of it was orchestral background music, except there really were no themes. The movie dropped the addictive music that Shuji in the anime was always humming. A notable part of the song is the final song, heard in the trailer. It's not a bad song and a little pretty. It's a pity that he has not been integrated into the film as himself or an orchestrated version of the song. <br /> <br /> The cast of -Casting- Saikano was also more or less. The main star was actor Chises Aki Maeda, who is most famous for his role in the films Battle Royale. The actor who played Shuji was very good, but they took their glasses off the original character. Oh, yes, and Tetsuo looks like Lupine, the third. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what I've heard from a few others, acting in the Saikano live-action was not so bad. I feel guilty about the way the story was cast and putting the series into just a two-hour movie. <br /> <br /> * What can be learned from the live action Saikano: * <br /> - CGI- I really wanted the CGI in Saikano had not been that bad. But even with that, we could have gotten some more fight scenes! Probably the most anticipated adaptation to the live action anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion, will probably not suffer as they currently have WETA Studios assigned to make the effects. <br /> <br /> -Modernism- Fuyumi owned a video store. Chise used an audio cassette player to listen to music and gave Shuji a tape for her birthday. Because? This movie is made in 2006! Not only that in the reality of the cinema they can create something like the Chise, so it can not happen in the 90's! The future is an era of CDs, DVDs and MP3 players. I hope in Evangelion, Shinji will have a Sony Walkman MP3 player. It is NOT the one that plays cassette tapes. -Story & Pacing- As mentioned earlier, Saikano's film changed very quickly and forced the story to drop many details. It was a smart move on ADV Films and who else, to make Evangelion into a solid trilogy, thus allowing more time to retell the story as true to the original as possible. <br /> <br /> -Characters- Leave most of the character designs alone and let the classic quotations be said! And if Evangelion's live action did not have Asuka "What are you, stupid ?!" or Shinji "I should not run away!" Sometimes, as small as they seem, these frequent quotes add and are who the characters are. <br /> <br /> * CONCLUSION: * In short, the live action movie Saikano had potential. It really did. Those who are not fans and see this movie: you will be reluctant to start the anime or manga (so do not watch the movie first!) People who have seen and liked anime / manga do not wait for you. in this one. Studies show that you will probably be disappointed. It was still fun to see the anime come to life in the live adaptation, but it could have been so much more. <br /> <br /> Reluctantly, I gave a 2 for the live-action Saishu Heiki Kanojo (Saikano) of 5. <br /> <br /> As Chise says, "I'm sorry" <br /> NekoTakuto
