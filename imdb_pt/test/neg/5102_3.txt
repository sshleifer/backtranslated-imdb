This was a very good concert for the first and only MJ. The choreography was excellent and the costumes were decent. The vocals were fine. I have to admit that his vocals were crap in Human Nature and Billie Jean. You could not hear him in half the time. The other songs make up the song. The highlights of the show are: Jam Smooth Criminal I just can not stop loving you She's out of my life Thriller Billie Jean (The Dancing Not The Singing) Black or White Man in the Mirror The show was almost perfect. If it was someone, but Mj would have been a 9. It's a must see. I wish I was born so I could have gotten a ticket for the best show of 1992.
