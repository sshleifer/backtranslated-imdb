Stephen Seagal plays the role of a guy who is convinced to drive a car armored by a bank and address everything that comes his way. However, the police appear to be on the scene very quickly and Seagal smells a rat that warned the police. The story goes into many twists and turns and the waiting money has disappeared and no one knows its new owner. Poor Seagal gets a little framed in this situation and of course he's looking for the person or people who are trying to push him away for a long time. In this movie, Seagal tries to be a good guy, but the forces of evil are against him. Unfortunately, this is not a great movie and rather annoying and very long.
