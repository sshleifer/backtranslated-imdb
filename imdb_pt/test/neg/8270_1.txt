Ohhhh MAN this movie is horrible !! <br /> <br /> This kind of crap is what gives Canadian cinema a bad name, or no name. Well, to be fair, I think most Canadian films give Canadian cinema a bad name. <br /> <br /> Beside the characters (there's a couple who's the most annoying in movie history), the most annoying thing is editing and pacing the movie. It's like a drunken snail making its way to die. <br /> <br /> Thank goodness that Melanie Doane is cool to look at. She's the only thing that kept me watching. Unfortunately, the rest of the film continued interrupting. <br /> <br /> Good to laugh, though, if you are having a bad night in Canadian movies. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Melanie? Doane The only positive point (pity they did not have the good sense to keep the camera in it for more than one wink at a time). <br /> <br /> Another addition to the Canadian Hall of Stinking Movies.
