I actually entered this site simply to write about this movie. I was sitting in my living room and this movie came on one of the local channels. I did this about an hour before I just had enough. Curious to see what the general public opined about this movie, I searched on this site. I was absolutely shocked to see that there were huge numbers of people who thought it was great. I needed to get my opinion, and here it is: This movie is absolute rubbish. It was a difficult task. The "jokes" were uninspired re-creations of other programs and better movies, and Leguizamo's manic portrait of this unpleasant character should only appeal to the age of ten and under. This really can be a stretch even for that age. I am all ridiculous, but there is not even a slight hint of intelligence or cleverness. I have an idea, let's take obvious jokes without inspiration and play them twice as fast. This is funny. Ha Ha. Monty Python's Sense of Life, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut. Movies that you should see that take humor silly and add comic and comical originality: The Night at the Opera of the Marx Brothers , ... and the list goes on. Do not waste an hour and a half of your life in memorable crap. <br /> <br /> By the way, I can only assume that the reason that David Bar Katz (the other writer) did VERY little in the movie after this movie is because it was instantly blacklisted. I'm really impressed that Leguizamo was able to recover after this mess.
