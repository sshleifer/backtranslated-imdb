Esther Williams plays a water ski secretary who does not like anything and wants to stop "walking on the water" and be the wife of some man; Van Johnson and Tony Martin are your possible choices for a husband. Despite the beautiful aquatic sequences filmed at Florida's Cypress Gardens, this romantic comedy is terribly rancid. As directed by director Charles Walters, everything here is meant to seem intentionally innocuous, which does not give the image too much power. Even Esther's great moments in the water do not reach the hypnotizing heels of her other swimming vehicles, although they are preferable to the men's apart, both colorless. Carroll Baker, in her film debut as Martin's disgruntled ex-girlfriend, is the most lively of the group. Fragile things, in fact. * 1/2 of ****
