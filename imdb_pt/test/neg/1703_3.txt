MacBeth, I always found, is the most accessible of Shakespeare's 'Great Period' pieces. Compact, focused, with much violence, it should have been the most open piece of screen adaptations. I'm not aware of a very good rendering of the story, however - the best effort is the vigorous version of Orson Welles. For the list of MacBotches, we must add the Connery / Baxendale effort. <br /> <br /> (It seems that it was not a cinematographic adaptation, but a television version that was released in a theatrical version, posted by Luhrman's Romeo). + Juliet and Hamagh of Branagh. That may explain some of their flaws, but I do not apologize.) It starts well, with a lively battle sequence with pleasantly creepy witches watching. Poor Gray Malkin and the Paddock are cut off from the opening scene, but they are not alone for long. In quick order, they are joined by the bloody Sargent and his account of the battle, the betrayal of Cawdor's Thane, the unfortunate master of the Tiger, even MacBeth's encounter with Duncan when he is invested as the Caehdor. All these had virtues that plead like angels trumpeters against the somber condemnation of their sending, but cast out they are. These are not the only cuts either. This is MacBeth hastily. <br /> <br /> From the opening battle, we are thrown directly into MacBeth's encounter with the witches, which is well done. Brian Blessed, curiously, directed the sequences of witches, and he has much fun with the special effects like MacBeth and Banquo are informed of their destinies. Jason Connery as MacBeth is clumsy, obviously not knowing what to do with the verse. Graham MacTavish as Banquo, on the other hand, is capable by making his lines natural and easy. After a few minutes of Connery's grunts, the viewer feels the desire to see the roles reversed and MacTavish in the title role. No wonder MacBeth felt he needed to kill him. <br /> <br /> These first few minutes mark the highlight of the film. From there, we moved to Helen Baxendale receiving the news from her husband. She is as lost as Connery, and denied the beard he can hide behind. Her invocation of evil to "Unsex me here" is embarrassing, not disturbing. There are some reasonably clever touches - "We'll Talk Longer" by MacBeth is not a sign of his hesitation in the face of his wife's perverse ambition, but his attempt to silence her as he throws her to bed. <br /> <br /> The performance of leads is the biggest disappointment. Connery's method is to look glazed over the screen as he murmurs his monologues through narration. Baxendale seems nipped and neurotic. An attempt to do something interesting with "This is a dagger" - the fantastic dagger is a shadow cast by a cross on an altar - falls due to Connery's poor delivery and careless steering, which spoils the entire production. We accompany Lady MacBeth back to the murder chamber, where she manages to stab the Duncan relic, but the effect is comical, not dramatic. Big scenes are flawed - Banquo's appearance at the party is rendered incomprehensible through attempts to blend the subjective representation of MacBeth's illusion with what those around him see or do not see. The second encounter with witches is even less coherent and the prophetic visions are confusing. The timing seems to be an issue here - Banquo's banquet is the centerpiece of the play, but the movie moves quickly to completion later, giving it an unbalanced and unoccupied feel for the complexities of the puzzles that MacBeth gets caught up to be appreciated, or by his descent into folly to be convincing. Another crucial cut is the scene in which Malcolm tests MacDuff and MacDuff learns about the murder of his family. This steals his revenge from most of his emotional strength - and the character of much of the time on the screen. He is a virtual stranger when he appears to kill MacBeth. <br /> <br /> A point to try. The Banquo of MacTavish wins another. The first few minutes are different. But that's all. From there it is sound and fury blah blah blah.
