After reading the book, Heart of Darkness, the movie did not do it justice. The film leaves the book ashamed and anyone who has not tried the book would disapprove of the story and plot because it was portrayed so poorly in the film. In the film, the characters and the set were just a few of the mistakes that occurred in the film. The director left out so many important and interesting aspects of the book that made him one of the best literary works ever made. <br /> <br /> Of course any book is better than the movie, but these were not comparable. Joseph Conrad, as a writer, was brilliant in the vocabulary and intelligence of the written word. The movie does not even begin to show any of this. Some of the very important and influential scenes of the book were completely left out, such as how Kurtz was not on the boat when he died. Also, when Marlow went to deliver the news to Kurtz's intention, she reacted differently to the film instead of the book. Another big difference was that Marlow saw the picture of the lady who was blindfolded at the end of the film, not at the beginning, like the book. This was influential in how the audience perceived Marlow, and the film spoiled everything. <br /> <br /> The book was as in tune as all the places looked, but the setting in the movie was a disappointment. There were a lot of fake funds and praise, a lot of bad actors to accompany him. There was an exception for the terrible actors and it would be Isaach De Bankol√© who played Mfumu. Your character has been described as the best. Although the film was not so good, I would still recommend it ONLY if you have read and understood the book very well. That way, you can see what the differences are in the film and in the book and contemplate them. If you have not read the book, I do not recommend the movie because it is a boring and lifeless mess. I loved the book, so you should definitely read and enjoy it.
