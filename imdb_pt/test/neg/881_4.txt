Richard Gere and Diane Lane star in a girl romance with the kind of ending that I get really angry ... let's just say it's not my cup of tea, just like the dime store novels are not my cup of tea. <BR> <BR> The plot has a doctor stopping at a hostel and meeting a woman with whom he has a brief but profound affair. He goes out to meet his estranged son and she comes back to his life. <br /> <br /> Well represented and well made, the filmmakers forgot to get a real plot. This is the stuff of novels that make women faint and men shake their heads in disbelief. I would not be as adverse to the movie as an irrational novel except that the film takes a turn in the last roll that is so off the left field that it's completely unbelievable. Why do certain types of movies do stupid things like that? It really ruined me. <br /> <br /> If you like romance take a chance, though wait for the cable.
