This was a horrible short film that tries to be funny in an obscure way, but that was not funny at all. Say it at a film festival in Chicago. It really is what the title says and I just did not participate in it. The bad narrative was what happened. If you rewrote it and re-filmed, it "might" work. This attempt fell into the "hole." Horrible cinema.
