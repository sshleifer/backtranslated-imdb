A low budget can be an excuse for a bad acting talent and a fake and pathetic appearance. However, it is not an excuse to write badly. It is a talent to be able to write dialogues without making it sound forced and mechanical. The dialogue in this movie went hand in hand with most of the instructional videos shown to the fast food team in training. <br /> <br /> I also understand that you need to make some exceptions when it comes to talent when you only have $ 20 to spend on it. With that being said, no serious director would have looked at these scenes and said to himself, "this was perfect." I see better character acting on Canadian television. <br /> <br /> This film had a fine plot of paper, poor acting, poor dialogue and has no clever idea. This simply proves to me that some independent films are like that for a reason. If you are looking for a quick scare, rent anything else. Even Cable Guy was a scarier movie. After watching this movie, I think it would be better to watch a new run on the X files.
