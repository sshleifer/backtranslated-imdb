At the beginning of the film, Rammopal Verma says that "Sarkar" is his tribute to The Godfather. This seems more of an insult. It pales a lot in comparison to Coppola's classic. Although no one expected Ramgopal Verma to fill Coppola's shoes, the film generated much anticipation and excitement. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan plays "Sarkar," a character automatically making instant comparisons with Supreme Bal Thackeray of the Indian political party Shiv Sena. Abhishek Bachchan plays his son Shankar, who returns from the outside and gets caught up in Sarkar's home policy. Just like Al Pacino in the original godfather. <br /> <br /> Since most of the recipes, incidents and characters of Bollywood are overtly simplistic and devoid of any kind of solid foundation. Quick links and flash ads transform the movie from one direction to another. Abishek leads to the obscure nexus of Mumbai crime politics as a duck leads to water. Amithab Bachchan as Sarkar is supposedly magnificent and powerful, he ends up looking old and clueless. Most of his acting is centered around constantly looking at different things around the set - the actor in front of him, the ground or in some other random direction. <br /> <br /> However, Kay Kay performs very well as the wronged son Vishnu. So does Zakir Hussain as Rashid, the Dubai-based drug smuggler who wants to settle in Mumbai. This actor has incredible screen presence and can send shivers down his spine with the look of him. The moment he enters the screen, you want to run and hide under the bed. <br /> <br /> Despite all its obvious flaws, the film did well at the box office. The buzz and the big star obviously help. Also Verma manages to retain his interest, albeit mildly for the second half of the film. He's actually making a sequel to this one that I'm sure will be more of the same fare.
