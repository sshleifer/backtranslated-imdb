In essence, this is a revenge fairly typical of the West, heavy on spaghetti, and if you follow it as such, the protagonist has been successfully defeating the main villain. However, there is so much going on that has nothing to do with the story that you have to wonder about what the filmmakers were thinking. I'm referring to things like the way Miss Ms. Rosie appears out of nowhere and the boxing match in the middle of the city. OK, they have a loose connection with the influential villain Mash Flanagan, but why suddenly he appears with a pseudonym - Mr. Donovan. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I thought it was very groundbreaking as the camera footage showing the sight of the wounded Wallach's trail could have been filmed by someone with a bullet in the shoulder. And was not it great how Donovan's girl uses the old headache routine when he gets a little playful? Do not let me forget the great stunt work of the boulder thugs while Wallach shoots them as part of the end. <br /> <br /> Even so, there was one thing I did not mind, and I kept waiting for the whole movie for that. What happened to that trio of hoods that Flanagan / Donovan hires near the beginning of the photo? You know, the Martel guy that a funeral home wanted to hire for his gun prowess, the devil's henchman Mitchell with the rifle and the Lincoln Tate knife shooter. Each had a five thousand dollar bounty on his head, and they should protect Donovan from the guy who survived the opening scene massacre. They were never heard again! I like to think that maybe Donovan has just killed them and saved the 15K for himself.
