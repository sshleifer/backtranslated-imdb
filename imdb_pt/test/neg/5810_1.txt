It's hard to know exactly what to say about this little tasteless, boring movie. The story is predictable when not completely laughable. It is all a matter of "obedient gestures" which, as presented here, carry absolutely no conviction. Yes, MGM's "production values" are beautiful, but Mrs. Lamarr was exquisitely beautiful, but she and the great Spencer Tracy have absolutely no "chemistry" together - and that's the only thing that would make this stop of clich√©s in all effective ... It is my understanding that this film received bad reviews when it was originally released; the passage of time has not improved.
