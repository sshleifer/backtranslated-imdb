This is the worst movie I've seen in my entire life .period.this movie goes beyond ridicule, it's like the director wants to be sued by the actors for unfairly misrepresenting their roles as the four fantastic, I believe the movie should have been released in comic shops so the only u should say this, desperate geeks who can not get tacky enough and want to see more and more crap movies. In conclusion of my paradox statements and theses, I believe this movie had major drawbacks to the future of cast collaborators, with the exception of the jay underwood character, in which I believe it was his best performance, considering roles such as not very human movies in which the story is told in a way that it has no character. he can not act, and people have made good decisions not to go see his movies, which is why he probably will not play any huge role unless he ignites his career in the most rare but interesting way.
