Do not be taken because the premise of this movie is good. Yeah, but that does not make a good movie. <br /> <br /> Comedies require a sharp script and a masterly direction. Unfortunately, this poorly executed movie has neither. Leconte, a good director of other genres, does not indulge in his comedic farces (the Les Bronz series is another example). <br /> <br /> The comic timing is terrible. Some jokes are telegraphed. Some are re-hashed from other movies. Others just sit there as if they are giving you time to laugh. The plot has messy subplots (the allergic daughter, the lesbian coproprietary) and simply does not develop or involve the viewer. It's not funny and it's not believable for a second. <br /> <br /> Compare this to any comedy by Billy Wilder (Some Like It Hot, A Foreign Affection, etc.) or Leconte's compatriot, Francis. Veber, a true GENIUS in French comedy (Le Diner de Cons, Le Placard, Les Comperes, La Chevre, La Grande Blonde, etc.) and you will see the difference in your comic scripts, acting and timing, with every joke leading to the next. <br /> Watching Mon Meilleur Ami twice would be a cruel and unusual punishment, not a good sign for a comedy.
