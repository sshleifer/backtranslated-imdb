And I can be being generous. The overwhelming majority of the film consists of looping footage ... the staggering monster, two women exercising, the staggering monster again, a bunch of people in the pool, the staggering monster again, nothing worse to wear, despite being injured. You get the picture. I kept myself from yelling "GET ON IT ALREADY" on several occasions. <br /> <br /> And it does not help that the images they used were poorly produced. The sound is disconcertingly out of sync with the picture. And in the only scene in which they attempted to become "artistic" with lighting techniques and camera, the face of the lighting, holding the lantern that provides the only illumination of the scene, is clearly visible in the photo. <br /> <br /> The hope is that the production has been the victim of some horrible disaster in which the original soundtrack and most of the footage was destroyed, but they decided to release it anyway, in memory of the heroes crew who gave their lives trying to save the real movie - the one with the interesting plot and dialogue. Unfortunately, there is no proof of this, and I am forced to conclude that in the immortal words of Joel and the Bots, they simply did not care. <br /> <br />
