This was just broadcast here in the US. Others commented on fidelity (or lack thereof) to the novel; the 1983 BBC version is far superior to this and all other counts. Given the scope of the novel, it should not have been condensed in 85 minutes. The main sections should be rushed or alluded for or omitted; there is not enough time just to get into the chronology of events, so the character's development has to be sacrificed: we can not have much sense of who the people are, which robs us of what makes Austen so great. <br /> <br /> A big negative for me was the cinematography, which I thought was just awful, and quite literally disgusting. The camera is constantly doing ultra-close-ups and spinning in circles. Maybe in a small TV box everything is fine, but on our 40 "high-definition screen it was so dizzying that both my wife and I had to look away from the set several times (my Dramamine stock was over). distracted from the somewhat dull performance that I'm just reading what's in the script (isolated scenes are well done, but not enough to save things). Adding the score so far in Complete JA Sweepstakes: would rate "Northanger Abbey" as a success, because of superior direction and production values ​​(and history lends itself better to a short treatment), "Persuasion" OK (though not similar to other versions), with condensation again being to blame), both far ahead of this attempt. I'll wait for better in the two remaining novels in this Reader's Digest TV Jane Austen, like the others, I am thankful that they left P & P alone!
