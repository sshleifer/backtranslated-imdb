"I remember waiting to be born ..." <br /> <br /> "Seeking vision that was the American West." <br /> <br /> "We were a psychic ..." <br /> <br /> "I'm sure their first reaction is that it's crazy" <br /> <br /> " The place is haunted ... "<br /> <br />" I think there is another dimension right here. "<br /> <br /> An artist (Marta Becket) and her husband for many decades left agitation and culture of New York and moved to a city abandoned by God with a population of 10 people in Death Valley. There, they renovated a theater - painting is a very homely and folk way. And, once finished, she began to do dance performances for practically no one. In many ways, it is very reminiscent of Werner Herzog's film, FITZCARRALDO or FIELD OF DREAMS - though BITTER is a documentary of a real person - not a crazy mythical like Klaus Kinski or Kevin Costner. Her husband ends up leaving - largely, apparently because of the lifestyle she chose. So today she lives with her ten cats and a sanctuary for donkeys, eventually along with her new companion, Tom. <br /> <br /> What you think about this documentary depends on your prospects. If you are into New Age ideas and are open to such sensibilities, you are more likely to enjoy the film. She talking about how she remembers her birth, ghosts, visual and psychic searches frankly made the psychology teacher in me shrink and that would definitely be the case for many people. In addition, his donkey sanctuary and attempt to preserve horses in the wilderness will likely attract PETA and many other animal lovers, although with my experience in environmental concerns and biology, I see the donkeys and horses as a plague that would destroy the native. plants and animals. So, in two different accounts, I often think the opposite of Martha - who is more a "sensitive" and "sensitive" individual. Depending on how you feel about all of this, your opinions will be clearly colored - and I'm sure most people will think it's a genius or a nut! You just have to guess what I think. <br /> <br /> Now, despite all this, the film is interesting and Marta's life is definitely not boring - especially since in recent years, people have started to travel to the desert to see her introduce herself . There is a definite following for her and her unusual little world. While I may not be as positive as most reviews, I too can not be as negative as the only criticism, as there is definite merit in this strange documentary. I like movies about unusual people and Marta is certainly unusual! I also appreciate her love for her art and happy life - this is a rare gift. <br /> <br /> I teach psychology at an arts school and it would certainly be interesting to show this to the staff - where I'm sure we would have a strong positive and negative reaction to the film - probably depending on whether the teachers taught the classes of arts or basic curriculum! Surely it would be interesting. <br /> <br /> By the way, and I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but when Marta's husband was having affairs, with whom did this happen? After all, they lived in the middle of nowhere and I kept wondering where he would find partners. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you would like to see her perform and / or stay at her hotel, she can be found at www.amargosaoperahouse.com/. The site is in English, French and German and the hotel rates are reasonable, as are the ticket prices.
