I really enjoyed all the characters in this program from the beginning except Reba herself. She comes out as a saint of what you say and, frankly, a great bully. And that stinks because she's in all the scenes and all the episodes. In recent seasons, Van also becomes unpleasant, like a parody of his former self. and Kyra walks disdainfully and being unhappy. The first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good if you skip Reba. In the end, it's pretty dark .. In basically all episodes Barbara jean She's been going around being dumb, Reba is being mean to her, but poor Jean Barbara desperately wants Reba to like her, which results in Barabara jean telling Reba how amazing is each episode. I think it's pretty clear that Reba has self-esteem issues and wants to be seen as a forgiving saint. It's a shame too because, beyond it, the show had that potential.
