I absolutely can not believe my fellow reviewers of IMDb. All the praise about how "original" this movie is, it's like they've never seen "Ring" or the million imitations that have come out in the 10 years since the movie. And some of them claim to be fans of horror movies! I think not! "Shutter" is fine. Average, I would say. I give it 5 out of 10, but there's no way to be original and great and "the scariest thing I've ever seen" as one reviewer said. Puh-leeeze, people. This is simple. It is predictable. <br /> <br /> I swear, if I see another ghost movie where the hero traces the ghost's past to find out why she's so angry and after them, I'll scream. "Original"? Give me some time. You need to get out more. Or at least stop calling themselves "horror movie fans."
