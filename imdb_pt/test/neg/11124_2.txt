Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito), a "crypto-zoologist" (a fancy term for one of those self-deceived losers who likes to study extremely rare animals - read: nonexistent) - and his team of hunters manage to trap a Chupacabra, a large, scaly, indescribable swift beast. To get to the mainland, they smuggle it on a Greek cruise ship and some idiots open the crate that contains it, although it is specifically instructed not to do so. I think the strange growling noises from within were not a good deterrent either. The monster then makes the monster thang; (John Rhys-Davies), a special agent of square chin pretending to be an insurance salesman for some reason (Dylan Neal), a blonde instructor Tai Bo (Chelan Simmons)) , a lot of guys with machine guns and others try to stop it. The main victims (who I think should be comic relief, but it's hard to tell) are a rich old bitch (Paula Shaw) with a yippy terrier and a gold explorer snob (David Millbern). Apparently, the monster can be knocked out with a single tranquilizer dart, but can live through dozens of bullet strokes. The design of the Chupacabra is acceptable (though not original), but the rest of the film is devoid of suspense, surprise or interest. An "original" movie from the annoying Sci-Fi channel; they made dozens of movies like that with almost interchangeable characters and plots, but with minor changes in the creature. Enough!
