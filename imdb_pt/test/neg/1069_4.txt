I'm sure some people will like this, and find it powerful, or have some kind of personal connection to the characters and the story, but from an unbiased point of view, it's not very well done. The film revolves around atypical teenagers, each playing a different stereotype, making us believe that this is how it is to be a teenager. We were able to see a little of each teenager's lifestyle, but the whole project came out as pretentious to me, be it the constant low-angle taking of tree branches in the wind, or the black and white "interviews" with students , there was nothing new or original shown in this movie and nothing I needed to see. Yes, he deals with some strong subject, and the dramatic scenes are played and act well, but the whole project seems unnecessary, especially when it seems almost an exact replica of Van Sant's "Elephant" (one dealing with suicide, the other with a shooting at school). As I said, some people will probably like this, and the director / writer clearly had some kind of inspiration to make this movie based on the death of a close one, so it's cool that the movie was made with some heart, but I feel like is incredibly ineffective, and when dealing with material it can be easily clich√©d to do something original with it. I would not recommend this movie.
