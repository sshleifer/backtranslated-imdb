Zeoy101 ?? Really, this has to be one of the most idiotic attempts to attract people into the attention of my age group. It's about a formal girl named Zeoy and her friends who attends boarding school. BORING!!! All she does is complain and act like a spoiled idiot. I remember that this show came out in 2005, I was 13 years old, and until then I thought it was useless. The only episode I always liked was when the boys hid a camera in the girls' dormitory. THAT'S IT. Anyway, I just do not understand why Nickel-Oh, my evil-Nick feels the need to distribute this excuse sorry for "entertainment." seriously this decade is becoming a joke every year and it gets worse and worse. What is with this generation? <br /> <br /> In any case, R.I.P. Nickelodeon 1979-1998? / 2005?
