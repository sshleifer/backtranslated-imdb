After having come across this horrible 82-minute excuse of a movie, and having wanted to tear my eyes out after watching another James Toback-directed mess called "When I Am Be Loved," I came to the conclusion that he has the best agent in the world. How else can these horribly written and painfully directed pieces of garbage be made? <br /> <br /> I like Robert Downey Jr., but maybe being in that movie has led him to substance abuse. <Br> Heather Graham has to be ashamed of her buzzing performance. Half the time the camera is on her, she's just staring in a trance. <br /> <br /> A script so bad. Get ready for plenty of Hollywood names (example: five minutes of winding discussions about Denzel Washington's acting ... etc.) <br /> <br /> There is a great character in Joseph Heller's novel Catch- 22, called Dunbar. He spends most of his time in the skeet shooting novel, which he abhors. When asked why he shoots skeet all the time, if he hates so much, he replies that he does the CREEP time by, and he will have a longer life. Well ... if you really want to feel the time go by, watch this movie! I swear ... the 82 minutes are going to look like more than a 4-hour epic by David Lean. It continues and continues and continues ... <br /> <br /> I hope to never watch another James Toback movie. If I could give this on STARS, I would.
