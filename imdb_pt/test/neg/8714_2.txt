A terrible mistake: controversial film, Teddy winner in Berlin 2003, A thousand clouds of peace turned out to be a fiasco. The actors are all reciting (well, they are not exactly actors); the film tried to be a high bet, but ended up being a dubious bet: it remains in the superficiality of two kissing faces and a guy whose lover is gone; has no purpose: nothing to do with homosexuality portrayed in other films (eg, Julian Schnabel's Before Night Falls). Technically, the only thing that works is photography; otherwise the camera is placed at odd angles (to make it more "art film") and the entire film runs in a black and white atmosphere. The film is so pretentious that it bothers. I mean, it's good to be pretentious when you have the talent to support him. Or maybe it's so art cinema it's incomprehensible. The story flows slowly, slowly, slowly. For me, more form than essence. Superb editing? Was good. Superb direction? Do not think like this: the movie is weak. It was an interesting project. It's a shame. It's a failure. A star of four.
