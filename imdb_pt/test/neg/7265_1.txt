In short, this film is a declaration of artistic bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> Almodovar is easily the most important European filmmaker of the 1980s and 1990s. No other living director has shaped the style and content of present-day European cinema more than he has. So it's not easy to say that his last effort is not just another disappointment after two films without a sparkle, but a complete and complete disaster confirming that he ran out of ideas, no humor, and, worst of all, empathy for the characters. he creates. <br /> <br /> This is not due to the complexity of the story. All of Almodovar's films are almost impossible to summarize. This time it's actually quite easy if you're familiar with his previous work. "Broken Embraces" is a remake of "Law of Desire", but this time the director is direct and the envious lover is a millionaire. <br /> <br /> For those of you who are not familiar with this movie, I am summarizing. If you do not want to know a lot, skip this paragraph. A blind man, who used to be a famous movie director, seduces a sexy and sexy woman by reading an article for him after a casual street date (yes, really, that's how it starts). Only then does he receive the visit of his agent and best friend. He mentions to her that he learned from the role that a certain millionaire died, which takes history 14 years ago. He can still see and is about to direct his next movie. He stars the inexperienced lover of the said millionaire as the leader, as he is immediately in love with her. The millionaire discovers his case through silent videos made by his gay son, which he dubbed by an interpreter (some great scenes: Cecilia Roth). After violent quarrels, the mistress escapes with the director to a seaside resort where he discovers that the millionaire who produced the film cast him in the worst possible editing, destroying the director's reputation. The couple decides to return, but has an accident in which the director is blind and the alleged actress dies. Back in the present, he discovers that his agent preserved the film negatives and began rebuilding it. <br /> <br /> As in "Bad Education", there are several subplots to reinforce this rather thin story, and as in "Bad Education", the result is more confusing than satisfactory. For example, the agent's son, who works as a DJ, has an accidental drug overdose - which is completely unnecessary for the plot, and is also interpreted quite wrong. <br /> <br /> For the most part, however, the actors should not blame, but the way their characters are written. Blanca Portilla as the agent has so many skeletons in her closet that not even a brilliant performance can save the character from ridicule. Lluis Homar is the dream of a protagonist of an old man, living in an artificial world where an English pseudonym and some sweet words can seduce any supermodel. And Penelope Cruz is the embodiment of this old man's sexual fantasy. Your character is completely lifeless. It remains completely incomprehensible why she would go from an old man, who at least helped her family, to a man a little less old, who is not charming enough to convince as much as a romantic hero or a passion. <br /> <But all these shortcomings would not make this movie so horrible. However, Almodovar does the worst thing possible for a director (or any kind of storyteller) running out of ideas: he quotes himself, something he has done more and more, and with very little benefit. The film within the film, which "Broken Embraces" uses as a plot device, is actually "Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown" (1988), only this time is called "Chicks and Suitcases". This rather unimaginative title may give you a hint as to how this classic sweetheart is treated here: while the dialogue that composes the final ten minutes of "Party Hugs" is a frantic and exaggerated exchange of short sentences in the original film. , here is a tough business meeting, colorless, pesky. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is the DOA idea of ​​an exhausted creator of wonders of the past, almost as dreadful and disappointing as the last resort of Indiana Jones. Maybe not as many people agree with this, because Almodovar used to be a genius. I would rather offer my respect to your accomplishments by humbly asking the reader to watch "All About My Mother," or "Tie Me," or "High Heels," or "Matador," all testifying to the unique character of Almodovar. and unparalleled talent. A few more films like this, and his legacy may well be destroyed forever.
