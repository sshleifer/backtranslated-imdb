Seeing this movie for the first time twenty years after its release, I did not quite understand. Why was it such a success in 1986? His amateurism drips from all the scenes. The jokes are weak and predictable. The sex scenes are exploitative and exaggerated (this does not mean that Miss Rudnik does not have beautiful breasts!). The corner is "schrecklich". The only genuinely funny scene is the big shootout when the gangsters die dancing break, a trait that dates the film firmly until the mid-eighties. It is really very intriguing to me as I am unable to understand what evoked the enthusiasm of applauding audiences in 1986 (and apparently still today, reading my fellow IMDBers comments).
