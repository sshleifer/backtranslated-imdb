A British teenager who turns around a girl (Justine) accidentally raising her dream man (Jake) with the use of a virtual reality machine, there is only one problem (well, not just one) she gets stuck inside her body with a geek as the only person who knows the truth and the only person she can trust. It looks a lot worse than it is, I found it more watchable for the reason that Laura Fraser was starring more than the content of the movie, in fact she looks impressive throughout especially when she wears a lycra red dress to impress Jake, WOW !! , if I had a virtual reality machine ??????
