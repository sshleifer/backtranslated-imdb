If you watch the extra documentary, you will notice that the director is totally inexperienced and was actually a co-worker of Quentin Tarantinos in a video store. Put two and two together and you realize that Quentin is doing a favor for his old friend, though the bud is a bit untalented. Was that hard? Well, watch this movie and you'll realize it's not. Very slow in the beginning, very tasteless in the middle and very slow to finish. This sums it all up. Eric Stolz & Delpy were the only ones who showed charisma. And Kemp really put in an OK performance. But the rest was very bad. An example of plot stupidity was when "lead thief" accidentally leaves his mask during the attack. So what happens? Well, the other thieves decide they can also remove theirs! What a great thought. The violence was ruthless and insane. But not in a "cool" way. Rather ridiculous way. I wondered if this was supposed to be a comedy. Fooler Tarantino for having his good name attached to this garbage. But cheat me for watching.
