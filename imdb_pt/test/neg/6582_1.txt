I know most of the other reviews say that this movie was great, but I have to disagree. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a good book! It was actually one of my favorites when I was very little. But this is not for cinemas. Maybe for a brief half-hour break, but I do not see how they can turn a small children's book into a full-length feature film. <br /> <br /> It's a cute movie, but I would only recommend this for really small children. Older children will have no interest in this. Adults can have a little more interest if they watch the younger ones. But anyone aged 7-adult will have a snoring-fest. <br /> <br /> Sorry if you do not agree with me, but this is my opinion. :)
