Terrible terrible movie for the television. Once again Lifetime brings us the predictable triangle; plotting a malicious woman to stay with an ignorant and stupid wife of another idiot husband who has no idea. <br /> <br /> I get nervous when I see these movies. You may ask: why do I watch them then? I have no idea. Usually by mistake. And the movie is so bad I can not get away from it. I wait for the bitch to take her up. And generally I'm not happy about how she gets her desserts. <br /> <br /> Now, if you can believe our shrew, it steals embryos from the clinic, and how do you do that? No blood tests, DNA, consultations and recommendations. She continues to kill the real estate broker, Gabrielle Rose, who is on top of her in broad daylight in the front yard of a house for sale and nobody sees her? She kills her mother, Susan Hogan, and you can predict that assumption when the mother mentions that she is allergic to peanuts and that the pills to combat this allergy are in her pocket book. Guess what? I will not continue with this. <br /> <br /> Finally you are left alone with the wife and the bitch alone. Good good triumphs poorly, but very slowly. Victoria Pratt as the girlfriend of evil is adequate on paper, looking a bit shaggy and obvious. Tori Spelling stares blankly most of the time. She has those big, big eyes of Bette Davis that seem to be coming out of her head. I liked her better in TRICK. And Tahmoh Penikett plays the husband turning around, ensuring that his wife has nothing too, he and his ex-girlfriend, although he is seen all over town, getting kinda naked with her in his house when he sent his wife to the house. to spend the night. However, he continues to deny the novel. <br /> <br /> Life never disappoints viewers with their plots and futile stories about women and their stupid husbands. I wish I could give this chestnut a "0".
