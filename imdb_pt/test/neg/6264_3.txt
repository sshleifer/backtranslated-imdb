The Slasher sequence (fourth SLUMBER PART MASSACRE movie) concerns a group of nubile cheerleaders stranded in a snowy mountain hut being slaughtered by an insane killer. Typical slasher elements for hardcore slasher fans, gore, beautifully free, no-tangle female nudity. Although it ends up being well received eventually, even in its short period of time. <br /> <br /> The original star Brinke Stevens plays a special part, which only seems to be there to include it in the film.
