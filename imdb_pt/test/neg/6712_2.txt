Why the hell do five Americans keep repeating this? the title really says it all: the plot is as clear as a book read in a language you have never heard of and it resembles nothing. <br /> <br /> You'll see ninety minutes of ever-changing places, most of them will be blown up later in the movie. Right at the beginning you see a small farm typical of Berry, who is in the film and is approaching Paris, but does not survive very well to the "transport" to the Ile de France: it explodes 1 minute later. there are also two gangsters who have no tongues, as if that made sense in the world of SMS and the internet, let alone pencil and paper. <br /> <br /> This goes on like this, nothing makes sense history. my only credit goes to the cameraman, the camera is excellent.
