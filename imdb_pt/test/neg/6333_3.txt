The unpleasant genre of "home invasion" can be traced back to Wes Craven's first sleazefest, "Last House On The Left," with unpleasant scenes like "I Spit On Your Grave," "Wrong Way," and "The Visitors ". in the footsteps of this movie. Here in this early 80's, the Italian offering the same plot is regurgitated once again, with the difference that this is set on a continental train. "La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto" ?? known in English-speaking countries as "Terror Express" ?? begins surprisingly well, but about twenty minutes becomes worse, as the sex scenes begin to take precedence over more serious action and suspense. <br /> <br /> David, Phil and Ernie, three rich young men who risk terrorizing and humiliating others, embark on a trans-continental express in Italy. The train is full of other passengers, among them prostitute Juliette (Silvia Dionisio), who often rides by train and makes a deal with one of the porters to act as a kind of pimp, persuading male passengers to separate their money . a night of passion in his sleeping compartment. The three cretins quickly began to bother passengers with their aggressive and drunken behavior, but things get more serious when they take control of an entire car on the express and barricade themselves from the rest of the train. Very soon, they are enjoying their temporary control. a young wife (Zora Kerova) is raped by two of the young men in a tight compartment; Juliette undergoes a prolonged sexual attack; and then the odious trio forces the male passengers to throw a dice to decide which one will rape a 16-year-old virgin traveling with her parents (a concept doubly insipidated by the fact that her father is one of the men forced to play the game). The only passenger who seems prepared to retaliate is a convict who is being escorted to Germany, but what hope has a man against three armed bandits? <br /> <br /> La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto has a decent start. Several intriguing characters are introduced, and the three thugs are shown to have a genuinely disquieting influence on travelers. Although the story is clearly the material of the exploration, the opening scenes are carefully constructed and the film seems to be rising above the common level of the genre. Things collapse during a horrible scene in which Kerova is sex-sandwich in a bathroom cubicle by two of the bad guys. Is the scene filmed and the effect does not seem to generate sympathy for the victim or hatred against the perpetrators? instead, we are being asked to feel excited. This is sensationalism at its worst. Following are even more humiliating rapes, but the rape sequences involve a lot of prolonged camera work on oral sex acts and the female genitalia. A sequel to the 16-year-old is on the brink of hard core and feels particularly "wrong." At the end of La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto, it's easy to forget that it was conceived as a thriller, because the final hour of the film is dedicated to pornography, not suspense. Lovers of sleaze will revel in this; others may want to look elsewhere.
