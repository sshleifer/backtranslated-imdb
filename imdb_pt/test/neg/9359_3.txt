I had heard of good things about "States of Grace" and came up with an open mind. I thought "God's Army" was fine, and I thought maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film began with an unstable performance and I thought, "Well, maybe it will get better." Unfortunately, this never happened. The picture begins with the presentation of two elders - Mormon missionaries - and it seems the public will meet them and grow to care about them. Instead, history degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting the blatant disobedience of missionaries (something that undeniably exists, but rarely at the level Dutcher portrays) and becomes almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Only the Dutch success in this movie is their successful alienation from their target audience. By portraying the life of Mormon missionaries in an unreal and imprecise way, Dutcher does more than irritate his predominantly Mormon audience. The film does not reflect reality. Missions are nothing like what Dutcher shows (having served a Mormon mission I can attest to), and gang life in California certainly contains language much more explicit than occasional moderate vulgarity. <br /> <br /> The conclusion, which I suppose should touch the public and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all, was unbelievable (come on, the whole mission comes together to see this old man sent to home - and mother and girl are standing next to each other!) and cheese. Next time, Dutcher, try making a movie that SOMEBODY identifies with.
