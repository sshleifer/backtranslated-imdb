I can not believe I actually bought this movie! Sucks! ... Where I Live Mexican Movies Mexican movies are never advertised, or even available ... you can not find them at the regular rental locations ... so I had to buy them ... I really like movies mexican They bring me closer to my roots, and to my people, and they are very different from what you normally used ... but this one was so predictable !!! You can guess what would happen ... It's not a horrible movie! Just not worth what I paid for it! haha ... but if you have time and are really bored, then yes, you should watch it .. but if you like Mexican movies, and love theater itself, then do not watch it will be painful! I laughed a lot
