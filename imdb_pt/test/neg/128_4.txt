The opening of "The Jungle" promises us a safari adventure with a science fiction element, but mostly what we have is a travel diary with lots of pictures and upholstery (and the strange leopard attack). The movie is leisurely when you want it to be exciting, and it tries to inject interest in the proceedings with poorly staged matches among various wildlife (I had no idea that lions and wild boars were natural enemies in nature, you know? but apparently the producers knew better). <br /> <br /> As for the actors: Cesar does his usual great job of rocking his mustache, and Marie Windsor is fairly believable as the daughter progressively thinking of rajah (nice eyebrows, btw!). However, Rod Cameron is only watchable as the returning hunter as the sole survivor of his expedition. I'm sure he was in demand on his day, but here he comes out as a Rent-A-Center Bogart: look rough, but with no Bogey time or interval. He passes the film back and forth from stoic rage to furious stoicism, and every time the script tries to create some romantic sparks between him and Windsor, you just need to laugh. That gnarled, knotty face is not a good vehicle for tenderness. <br /> <br /> The script is not totally without merit, although it makes some strange choices. At the beginning of the first act, the script makes a point of spending several moments in which the heroes decide to bring the obligatory and intelligent mascot of the boy and the monkey, but basically ignore them until *** SPOILER *** the monkey in some way seizes a live hand grenade during the mammoth scene and accidentally plays near Windsor. This is how Cameron can prove his bravery by plunging into him and saving her life at the cost of himself. *** END THE SPOILER. It is possible that the Indian version of this film (which I understand worked better than two and a half hours) could have given the boy and the monkey more to do. Another thing that makes the movie show its age. SPOILER is the issue of woolly mammoths (the plotting device that puts the safari in motion first). When they finally appear, the way the scene is filmed, it is obvious that "mammoths" (obviously elephants wrapped in fluffy carpets) are not really "attacking" anyone, or even moving so fast, and yet Cameron immediately tries to eliminate them with hand grenades. Nowadays, the idea of ​​destroying the last known specimens of a species thought to be extinct would be unthinkable, especially when all they seem to do is roll through the jungle at a good pace. *** So, IMO, four stars, is very good for a production of Robert Lippert (usually Lippert's hack works rank two or three stars at best). It's not a train wreck of a movie, or anything; moreover, seems to mean well with the daughter of the Rajah arguing for the improvement of the more repressive aspect of the "traditional ways" and the elements of the "mestizo" novel that was quite progressive in 1952. And there is a pleasing scene and an exotic spectacle. See if anyone offers to show it to you for free, but do not expect too much except an interesting historical chapter of fantasy cinema.
