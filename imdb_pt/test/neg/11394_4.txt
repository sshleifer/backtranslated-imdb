The recent documentary "The Adventures of Errol Flynn" is a deep look at Ultimate Hollywood Hero. Bogart, Cagney, Wayne and the like were basically blue-collar types in their canvas pictures, but Flynn was an aristocrat in his style and ways, the younger son out to sculpt his own fief for a sword, thunder and romance analogy that ironically he found If he had not been under contract with Warner Bros, he would have been perfect in the role Cary Grant in Suspicion: the charming good-looking whose thousand-watt smile blinds him to the fact that he is a predator. And he could have starred with his best ladies sister Joan Fontaine. This was Flynn's problem, he was the Ultimate Screen Hero until his own habits and bad weather hit him. Grant and Flynn are somewhat alike, but Flynn was the sexiest of the two, you can see Grant as Captain Blood, but Flynn in The Philadelphia Story. Mr. Blanding Builds your Dream House, or Monkey Business, or Operation Petticoat. I have turned these papers into his collective ears because he is very secure in his feet and the sexual tension that he would have brought naturally would make the story lines falter. But this vacillating biography is only a laminated vision of Flynn and his time. There are times when I sort of expected a laugh band or an audience to be "Ahhh" sometime. It does not go deep into Flynn's life only on the magazine's screen. He also does not plunge into his struggle to be considered more than a practitioner. Like the clean biographies of Lon Chaney (the father, not the werewolf, or Lenny "of mice and men) and Buster Keaton made in the 1950s, this is just a time killing a piece of fluff
