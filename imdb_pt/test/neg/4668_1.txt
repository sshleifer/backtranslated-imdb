First of all. I do not despise Americans. I know many people who are intelligent people from the USA. But this movie is so bad I just had to comment on it. <br /> <br /> First of all ... The movies are far from true. This movie is no exception. Many scenes are incredibly fake. For example, the departure of the two space ships. You see them leave the tanks full in space. Just a short distance from each other. Remember what caused the space shuttle to explode in the past? Just a turbinated part that came out. Here it is common to leave fuel tanks as large, if not larger, than the whole vessel. What idiot would let 2 spacecrafts get up and do this at the same time ??? Second, the Russian station is a piece of shit. I hate to bring this to you, but nowadays the astronauts go to Russia. Since your equipment is much more reliable than NASA's. The space shuttle is retired. And NASA only uses to pay the bills. And there is no better alternative for that. And the whoppers list goes on and on. This is really an insult to people who take space travel seriously. And I know half of what these guys do. But the most annoying part (read: the whole movie) is the propaganda and the crappy patriots with which you are suffocated. MY GOD !!!! I thought I was looking at a CNN commercial for an hour. The actors solve their small problems by shooting each other, giving the middle finger to everyone they come across, start fights, ignore the police, etc, etc ... But when it comes to their love for their country and sacrificing their lives , suddenly everyone is in line to commit suicide for this (bomb detonator)? Maybe I do not have the feeling of being a true "Patriot", who can sing the national anthem unlike in Swahili. While riding with George Bush behind the wheel of a golf cart, driving in circles until the battery was empty. But this movie was too much for me too. And when I finally got hold of it and pulled the flagpole and the American flag fabric out of my hiney. I realized that I was happy that this movie was finally made. I do not know why so many good actors participated in this narrow and stereotyped propaganda film. But I pity them. This represents a country where you can get rid of murders if you have money or power. While "Uncle Sam" thinks you're a good patriot. Where everyone is happy, as long as it is another devastated country, no one cares.
