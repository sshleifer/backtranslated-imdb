people, have a clue! I mean, the writers do not have one, so I'd expect you ... this show is a pale imitation of the '60s show that you can laugh about it! and the sixties show is the one with cheap special effects, and it's in B & W fer Chrissakes! However, the humor and writing in the old program are THOUSANDS ahead of this nonsense. Get HiP kids! if 98 Degrees or Brittany told you to watch, you would! Do you know! Just ignore them and tell all your friends that you were 'IN' with the 'scene' BEFORE you become really cool!
