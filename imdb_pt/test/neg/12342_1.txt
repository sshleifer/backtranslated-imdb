This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Unless you are in masochism, never see it. It was an unbearably long movie, meaningless, damaging to the eyes and depressing, and will always be at the top of my list of bad movies. Who wrote this movie is a sadist. I almost cried in the end, that's how bad it was. I would like to give zero stars, but since this is not an option, I give one.
