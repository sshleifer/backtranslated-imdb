... "Flight of the Living Dead" sports production values ​​that belittle director Scott's precarious script "I'm a producer, can not you tell?" Thomas and two hacks that will remain nameless because I'm sorry they have to attach these non-names to that turkey. Apparently really filmed on film, this direct release to the DVD has almost nothing you have not seen or heard hundreds of times. <br /> <br /> Despite the presence of a number of recognizable characters actors such as Richard "Three O'Clock High" Tyson, Erick "Stargate" Avari and Raymond J. "Little Children" Barry, and a host of others not so recognizable, "FoLD" is predominantly populated with cardboard, most end up drenched in unconvincing false blood. There are a few (precious) jokes that work (the umbrella and zombie stuck in your seat come to mind), but most scripts are stupid for pedestrians and comics, and I'm here to make sure we're talking about pedestrians it's stupid. You'll never believe for a second that "FoLD" is anything but a cheap cash-in movie with cool pretensions. God forbids him to manage the continuance of his promises of stupid purposes. <br /> <br /> Strictly free viewing, depending on how precarious your local library is, and otherwise suitable for insomniacs and just indiscriminate.
