I should know better. I've seen many of Rob Lowe's early works to expect something good from this movie, even if it's about hockey. <br /> <br /> Here we have, once again, another sporting theme tired. Kid has potential for greatness, has the apparent to go far, if his arrogant attitude does not ruin things. And, boom, he comes out of it like that kind of helluva champion. Is all that can be said about sports movies? Of course, there must be other feats that athletes perform. <br /> <br /> However, this movie has to be one of the greatest cheeseballs. Everyone's interactions are just silly, not funny and stupid. And I can not think of any auxiliary qualities that might stimulate my position. Not the actors (certainly not Swayze, who plays Lowe's reluctant mentor), not the story, not the music and very little of the skating sequences. <br /> <br /> Normally, I'm a sucker for 80's movies, even though they tend to be a bit suspicious (like North Shore, Karate Kid), but that's not quite good trash of the 80's . For a good 1980s sports movie, check elsewhere. There are many of them out there.
