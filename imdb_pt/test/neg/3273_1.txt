This is really the worst movie I've ever seen. For a while, I created the habit of watching bad movies, including "Battlefield Earth," "Delta Force Commando," and "Starship." All of these films are cine gems, compared to Ironheart. <br /> <br /> There is not much sense in summing up this piece of junk; I think it's more beneficial to summarize my reaction to the film, which is this: I get furious and want to take the tape from the VCR and record it after (approximately) 80 minutes of play. <br /> <I classify this movie as 0, but the IMDb does not let anyone rate a movie under 1. I give it a 0 knowing full well that I'm saying that any movie that has any score above 0 is infinitely (indefinitely) many times better than this - it's really how bad it is.
