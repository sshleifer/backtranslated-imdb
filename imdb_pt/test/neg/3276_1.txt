I saw it on sale - NEW - at my local store for $ 6 and said "Hey! An action movie with that Bloodsport guy and Enter the Dragon, run by the guy who got into the Dragon - and it's cheap!" So I bought it. Oops! This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some doozies. <br /> <br /> Do you know how movies that are intentionally exaggerated, such as Evil Dead II and Dead-Alive, are AWESOME? Do you know how movies should be serious, but they are so terrible that you have to laugh out loud, and seeing them again, like Lionheart (an old Van Damme movie) or John Carpenter's Vampires, are cool? This movie, Ironheart, manages to be NONE of those. I do not know what the filmmakers were thinking, but it looks like this movie was made with no time to film, no budget for anything, and no script to speak of. (While I'm on the screenplay note, I must point out that Bolo Yeung has no line in this movie - the only reason he gets the first billing in the box is the fact that he's the only actor in the movie you've ever seen recognize (unless you're a fan of Jackie Chan, in which case you'll recognize the thug - and you'll want to call him Giancarlo!). <br /> <br /> What is also sad is that this movie is from '92. At that time, T2: Judgment Day was out, so you know the era of the '80s camps was over ... but it was not quite like that. After that, you'll think that Chuck Norris' 80s movies, high school comedies, and Jason / Freddy sequences were pure genius works. <br /> <br /> Things to know: <br /> <br /> 1) No one in this movie can act for the beans. The closest you come is Richard Norton looking appropriately rich and arrogant, and Bun Yeung looking appropriately means ... and arrogant. Everything else is terrible. <br /> <br /> 2) The martial arts scenes are forgettable - just many examples of white guys with lots of muscles pulling their shirts, screaming, running in Britton Lee, being kicked by Britton Lee, being punched by Britton Lee, then falling. Even the final showdown against Bolo is disappointingly short, and as creative as the design of my racing socks (and equally stinky). <br /> <br /> 3) The rest of the action is also pathetic: the guns look like they came from the K-Mart's toy department, and in fact they shoot with the sound of a hood. When someone takes a shot, they leap a little, then stand still with stains of brownish red liquid on their clothes. Britton Lee is apparently shot in the side, but you do not see anything, so later that day, you see the wound ... I had paper cuts that were worse than that! <br /> <br /> 4) Of course the girl wears the wound, so they kiss, then the next thing you know is that they lie in bed talking after sex. There is? What? The believable development of love interest, as well as any kind of character development, is completely ignored in this film. Remember how Bruce Lee's characters do not need to have sex with anyone to be cool? <br /> <br /> 5) The pursuit of cars is by far the worst I have ever seen. It looks like the director was sitting at the curb with a handheld camera while the two cars were winding down the road doing, ah, I do not know, about forty miles an hour? Do not try this at home, children, these people are professionals! Hah! <br /> <br /> 6) Writing really bad. Here's a scene for you: Lee is being followed, so the girl follows the followers to "warn" Lee, but her car is too slow. Then, by the time she reaches, Lee and the bad guys are out of their cars and there is a shooting going on. Lee killed two thugs, but the third one is shooting at Lee when the girl almost runs over Lee, so the thug runs away. (Huh?) So the girl's car stands still and she can not start. She tells Lee that she is involved now and comes with him. He points out to her that they can not leave her car there because the bad guys will trace it to her. She somehow convinces him that he must decide how to handle this problem - so he throws the gas tank and blows up his car. (And remember later on the same night they have sex.) 7) If you look closely at more than half of the nightclub outings, the dancers are very out of sync with the music. The dancers are also very coordinated with each other (apparently in the 80's all people in dance clubs took dance lessons). There's a girl in the DJ booth with a microphone, but she never does anything but dance. Security guards tell people they are struggling to "take it outside" - without moving their lips. In one scene, the only ones the bouncer Lee and Stevo pass are just inside the entrance, but with their backs to it! Also, apparently, if you're an important character in the movie, you can go straight to the front line. <br /> <br /> 8) Lee realizes the first time he is being followed, but he does not. Do not notice the second time - even though it's the same guy in the same car. The girl, however, realizes. The thugs are followed twice, but they never realize. <br /> <br /> 9) Lee is worried that thugs will track the girl's car back to her, even though they have already seen him appear where she works twice. The girl continues to leave her son at work in the care of a friend while she does not have sex with Lee. DO NOT learn about raising children with this movie! <br /> <br /> I can not think of any more complaints now ... you have the idea ... Ironheart is so bad, it's not funny, it's sad.
