I never understood the controversy and hype that this movie caused. Especially in French and neighboring countries (in Belgium, where I am located for example), "Baise-Moi" was heralded as the most shocking and thoughtful social drama you could experience. Okay, right! It may be a bit shocking, maybe (how often do you see someone being hit in the ass?), But the weak and meaningless plot certainly did not make me think too much. "Baise-Moi" is one of those films that "blame everything that goes wrong in society" and are generally not very convincing. About 99% of people work perfectly well in this society, so why would you blame the very same society for the vile and hopeless acts of two crazed ninja? The two main characters and their miserable lives are presented separately and in flashes. Nadine just killed her roommate; Manu shot his brother and the two meet at an abandoned train station, late at night. They decide to travel through France together, leaving a trail of sex and blood behind, wherever they have made a stop. Although we are constantly exposed to pornography and violence, this film is very annoying to sit on. As the girls are indicating themselves all the time, the dialogues are lame and the people they come across (and kill) are very uninteresting. If people want to make porn movies, that's okay with me, but please do not pretend it's making movies. If you leave out the name-calling and hip-camera work, all there is to see is (not so) excite pornography. Soundtrack cool, though!
