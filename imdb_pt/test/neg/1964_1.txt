Jack Frost 2 was a horrible, awful and pathetic excuse for a sequel to a great movie. The original was a low budget horror comedy about a murdered man who was turned into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste. And the snowman went around killing people and avoiding hair dryers like the plague. This, however, was far from the quality of the original. It looks like this had a smaller budget because, for some reason, after an hour in that movie, I still had not seen the snowman. Some revenge he's getting if he's always in the shape of ice cubes with a tacky voice and a little shaking of the cooler in which he rests to give animation to the character. Disappointing to any belief, even to a bad movie fan.
