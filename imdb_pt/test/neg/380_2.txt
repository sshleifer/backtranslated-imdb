This type of film is like an earlier 1987 film, "Masters of the Universe," based on the cartoon "He-man." Basically, you have a great old world and they, for some reason, need to have almost all the action of the movie in modern land. Well, I do not think the land is so modern now and that it is an old world now of strangeness and a den of good old days. Well, I guess I can imagine why they actually put almost the entire movie in modern times in this and that movie. To save money on costumes and scenarios. It is much easier to recreate what is happening in the present than a strange world like Eternia in He-man or an ancient world with cults and strange pyramids, sacrifices and strange creatures that embrace him to death. This film is forgettable and not very entertaining, its first clue that it will not be the best movie in the world is that Robert Z'Dar is in it. The only thing that this person has in their favor are the animals that are not as prevalent in this as in the past. Marc Singer is back and it's sad to see him in this state, the guy was a good actor reduced to trying to make a sequel to a movie that really did not need one, and even if it happened five years late.
