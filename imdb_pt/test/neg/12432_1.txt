Starts as a very serious social commentary, which quickly makes you think of other Clark films such as Kids, Bully, etc. But, similarly, it quickly unfolds in a directionless mess. Who is the main character? Is this a serious movie or a bit of Gregg Araki-esquire about the top goofy movie? Is it a skateboarding documentary with moments of dialogue inserted? I have no idea. I found myself looking at the clock and wondering when that shit was going to end. I kept thinking there would be a great climax of shock that never came. I cut a good 20 minutes out of the movie, moving quickly through the senseless skate scenes. Yes, it illustrates the changing landscape among those who do not. I got back in the beginning. Kids and Bully was done in such a way that I really felt like I was watching the realities of this group of friends. Wassup felt very staged, poorly constructed and acting worse and worse. The teenage cave man, whom Larry did not write, but drove, was terrible. But at least it seemed like it was a terrible movie that did not take itself seriously. Wassup Rockers was just plain bad.
