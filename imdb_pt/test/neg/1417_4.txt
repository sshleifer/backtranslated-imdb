I saw a screening of the movie last night. I had high expectations but definitely was disappointed. Within 5 minutes of opening, Williams is already campaigning for his presidency. And he becomes president in the first 40 minutes. So goes all that aspect of the movie. The first half hour is hilarious. Do not get me wrong, the movie has its moments. But after the first half hour, it takes a turn for the worse. It becomes less of a comedy and more of a suspense / drama / love story ... which is useless. the film does not lead to anything and stands still for a good 30 minutes. there are laughter interspersed here and there, but the consistently funny part is at the beginning and only at the beginning. At one point, the greatest joy I heard in the audience was when a person in the audience shouted 'boooo' during an emotionally confused scene. Williams gives a great performance, even along with his comic style. Walken also offers a strong supporting role, as only he can. I think the only character that is underestimated is Lewis Black. Consistently vulgar and political, it's funny to see him downgrade to a PG-13 rating. Overall, I would not pay to see the movie. After all, I saw it for free and was even disappointed. The first half hour is solid, and it's all downhill from there. Not fitting into a category, the film realizes that it should have been nothing more than a central special one-hour comedy. 4.5 / 10
