Documentary that attempts to examine science fiction films from the 1950s and how they affected (and reflected) America. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Ridley Scott and James Cameron are interviewed and Mark Hamill recounts. <br /> <br /> Very terrible. The insights that are given are not new - for example - the Cold War and the threat of nuclear war affected a whole generation of children. Well, duh! They try to cover all the different sub-genres of science fiction films from the 1950s - the big buggy movies, space invaders, etc. etc. That's fine, but they choose the most obvious movies and have been analyzed to death. already. It was cool to see clips of "Rocketship XM," "Moon of Destiny," "Forbidden Planet," "The Thing," and "The Day the Earth Stood Still," but everything the directors said was so incredibly obvious to any viewer which is offensive. Even if it's less than an hour I was completely bored 30 minutes in. That gets a 2 for some of the clips, but nothing more.
