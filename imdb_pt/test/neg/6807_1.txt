In an unsuccessful attempt to be taken seriously, and move to "adult" movies, Hughes gives us this movie about a young couple. True, there's every clich√© in the book, silly fantasy stuff, and more, but more importantly, there's Elizabeth McGovern. <br /> <br /> Clearly the best actress who has ever appeared in a John Hughes movie, she lends a weight to it that lifts the sometimes silly stuff. Kevin Bacon (and his hair) is very good as a husband, but McGovern steals the movie with his true moments of honesty. The fun 'teen movie' that worked so well in other Hughes movies falls here - like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9 but still say when you're 15 and would like him to find some new material . . But I keep coming back to McGovern performance because it's truly exciting. Mr. Hughes's most interesting films for me have real actors in them (Some Kind of Wonder, Breakfast Club) and when his stuff comes up with real talent, some wonderful things can happen. If only he trusted that it does not have to be mixed with the silly stuff of fantasy.
