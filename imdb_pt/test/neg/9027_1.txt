Vicente Aranda made a terrible historical film. It shows the poor resources of Spanish cinema. In the film, an unreal script shows Juana only as a ninomaniac, in front of Felipe, concerned only with sex ... but sex with others not with her. The technical errors begin with the wedding ring that shows Isabel de Castilla - No one noticed that? -. So the voice sounds like a documentary, movie actors and actresses sometimes laugh - look at the sequence when Juana comes to the council that wants to keep her isolated -; the castles are almost broken when at the time of the movie they were built recently, the crowds are just "four" people, the lights are misplaced ... Compared to Amelie Poulain, the French film for the oscars ... it makes no sense Talk about a bad movie like Jane the Mad.
