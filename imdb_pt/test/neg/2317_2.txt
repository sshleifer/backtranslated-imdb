This small cheapy is notable only because it is the worst film that Abbott and Costello ever made. It's horrible in every way: crunchy music, awful choreography (check out the awkward main dancer), special effects and extravagant sets, wooden actors (the leaders barely in high school in their profession and were unknown later), and a script without a single laugh. Better times were ahead for the comedy duo. Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd is much preferable, as is the television series, which was sometimes inspired. But skip this one.
