Stumbled on this movie on Amazon.com. I had never heard of its release but the three reviews gave five stars and praise so being a lover of German films I bought a copy ... I have to say that I was not impressed. The production values ​​are cheap, the story is derived, the characters are less than engaging and for a comedy it's surprisingly short on laughs. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this, but I thought it was dull and dull. Or maybe I expected more from independent German cinema than a gay version of The Full Monty and a cast of stereotypes. <br /> <br /> There are bits in the movie that make no sense at all, like one of the Leather Bear movies. trying to get Ecki in a sling - as if he had looked at him twice? Or the vindictive ex-wife appearing in the game, but eventually cheering for her estranged gay husband? Bunkum is not the word! Well, at least explain the title of the film in the UK, I suppose ...
