I almost slept through a display of it. From a boring story that seems to last forever, it follows several days in the life of a prostitute who falls in love with one of its tricks. After a heated affair, the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they can not be together and how they should follow separate paths. The male prostitute then follows in a self-destructive downward spiral trying to find his "one true love," repeatedly returning to the same places they frequented, searching for more clues or signs of where he could locate his love . <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, he connects with an ugly guy (who I thought was also a prostitute), a gay gay, and a guy who ends up having a "three-second sex session" with he's in an alley. <br /> <br /> It never ceases to amaze me how movies still depict random sex acts as scenes that can occur in a matter of seconds, as in this case where the trick barely has the pants unbuttoned before thrusting thrice and experience the orgasm miraculously! <br /> <br /> All these random encounters end with the sexual partner asking him to call them, to whom he discards his phone numbers. <br /> <br /> There is a brief secondary plot involving the main character visiting his busy mother who seems to have no time for her lifestyle. There is also another brief plot involving some random conversation with a young woman who noticed him repeatedly standing on the bridge of his window. And there is also another brief parallel plot involving him showing the letter to a male acquaintance, but the public is not advised of his relationship with that person. <br /> <br /> None of these things really connect with each other. , just to show us how lost and confused this young man really is. He seems to be living life as a ghost. There was a good scene throughout the movie that involved him rolling a yard sale looking for a particular album with the saddest music in the world. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this movie seems to last forever. Filmed in black and white, it may seem very dreamy, but sitting in the theater for almost two hours watching this conversation will seem like something more like a nightmare! <br /> <br /> I thought the ending was confusing since I was not sure if the young man died and went to heaven? That would have been a good reward to end the misery that both the audience and the main character had to endure in this senseless troupe. But since this is an "independent film", films with endings such as these should encourage you to "use your imagination". <br /> <br /> For those of you who are looking for nudity, there are only brief scenes and most of them are filmed in such a way that anything suggestive is artistically hidden within the shadows. In other words, do not waste your time on this. My rating - 2 out of 10
