Despite the potentially fascinating premise, Series 7 is a weak attempt to attack the reality show. In addition to their basement production values, which feature a 10-minute monstrosity, the overall tone of the film is wrong. Several critics have attacked the acting in the film, but I think the real problem is this stupid attempt to turn the film into a farce. Besides the fact that the jokes are not funny (a pregnant woman swears a lot, a young woman takes a lot of weapons), it does not match the general tone of the film. If the creators had really made the series 7 have a striking resemblance to the real reality of the TV - still empty editions, sound effects, camera shake-perhaps their point was more solid or at least more palatable. Instead, the Series 7 snakes through the already tormented world of death and the game show. You can imagine the director slapping his back for saying the obvious.
