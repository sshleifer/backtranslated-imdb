This is my first comment about a movie here. I have to say that of all the bad movies I've seen, including Braindead for example, this is really WORST! I promise. Do not even look at it. It's annoying, bad acting, bad script and plot, bad effects the whole movie is a big piece of crap! If I could, I would give 0 stars out of 10, but as the smaller is 1, which is horrible, I need to vote for it. But I would say the movie is worse than horrible. <br /> <br /> Do not get hurt seeing this movie and hoping it gets better because I can tell you now, it will not! I hoped there was a single scene that was worth watching. There was no good scene. <br /> <br /> What an excellent piece of shit. <br /> <br /> And what about Coolio as a vampire? I LAUGHED A LOT! LAUGHING A LOT! YARGH!
