This is a cheap movie by Al Adamson - a man who may have been the worst filmmaker of all time - possibly worse than Ed Wood Jr. Adamson specializes in horror films and low-budget skins in the '60s,' 70s and the 1980s and with titles like FIVE BLOOD BLOOD, BLOOD DEVIL OF HELL, SATAN OF SATAN and LASH OF LUST, it's obvious he was not doing Shakespeare !! His films all had rotten production values, sensations, gore and amateur acting. Here in BLOOD BRAIN, several actors of Adamson's stock (like his wife, Regina Carrol, Zandor Vorkov and Angelo Rossitto are together for the tour and had appeared in the previous film of Adamson, Dracula VERSUS FRANKENSTEIN . This is fortunate because the previous film was so terrible and so poorly executed on all levels that the blood brain can not help but look good! Of course, the makeup is laughable, the plot is stupid (it involves the ubiquitous scheme and the acting is Z-level, but it's still better than his last movie! <br /> <br /> The only positive things about this movie are the supporting actor, dwarf Angelo Rossitto actually had a part better than usual - with more dialogue and a more important role in the plot - and there's actually some sense of danger and tension. As for Mrs. Carrol, she still looks like a stripper and the rest of the cast limp through this movie But it's bad enough. nte to make a good display by fans of bad movies - you just need to see makeup on the guy with acid burns, just like the lightning gun that seems to be made from an old flashlight!
