That was bad enough. I really hope there is no sequel. Maybe that's giving part of the plot so you know it's open to possibility, but no, actually it's not. <br /> <br /> There really is nothing special about this movie. Well, the special effect was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. There were some hotties in her, especially Elina Madison and Alexandra Ford, but nothing to see people. PG-13, definitely is not R. This also says that the slasher aspects were less than spectacular. The shovel in the head was the only thing that was unusual. <br /> <br /> Tranquility of fear.
