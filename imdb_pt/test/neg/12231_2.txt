For the record, I hate fake movies. Except for Mel Brooks and AIRPLANE! because these are classic and ridicule the clich√©s, not the films themselves. I think fake movies are the bottom line for comedy and film. I particularly hate things created by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the "geniuses" behind DATE MOVIE, EPIC MOVIE and MEET SPARTANS. <br /> <br /> I decided to take a look at THE COMEBACKS. Since Friedberg and Seltzer had nothing to do with production, I was as objective as possible. It was like one of their movies. Basically, all of the sports movies were mixed with sly kindergarten jokes and disturbing images of bodily injury that supposedly made me laugh and fail. Only someone from above would laugh at these jokes. Toilet? Who write this? an 11 year old? I was surprised to see that this was the creation of the producers of WEDDING CRASHERS, which was actually pretty decent. But the parody genre was as funny as a burning orphanage. The only reason I gave these two stars (when I clearly deserved one) was because Friedberg & Seltzer had nothing to do with it.
