Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Pathetic in almost every respect. <br /> <br /> I threw the DVD right into the trash - I did not think it was fair to deliver it to the local store. <br /> <br /> The effects are beyond a joke. The dam's control room looks like cardboard. The water seems out of scale with the backgrounds - nothing works. <br /> <br /> Then there's the flaccid plot - as deep as a Scooby Doo drawing. <br /> <br /> I could not. I hope everyone drowns.
