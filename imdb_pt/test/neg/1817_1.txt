I felt that last night's episode was slow and kind of annoying at times. I honestly do not think I have to do anything with writing. Because I know the story was well staged and I tried to keep things in place. I thought it was not too bad, but overall, I did not like it. The biggest culprit has to do with the director of this episode - Stephen Williams. I always hated the direction of Stephen Williams. If Jack Bender continues with this episode of the season premiere, he would have kept up a good pace and kept things floating to keep things interesting. I'm happy that Jack Bender is directing the episode next week and it's going to be so much better and I'm glad he's directed the first episode of Syaid and am curious to know what he's going to do since Stephen Williams directed many Syaid episodes before. <br /> <br /> I always think Stephen Williams needs to be thrown out of the show. He does not even do anything interesting with the show. <br /> <br /> Why does the opening have to be done with a target while in the helicopter? It was so annoying! Bad perspective of camera work too!
