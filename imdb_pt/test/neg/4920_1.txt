Well, at least that was the last sequel I could find on Blockbuster, because this movie was just awful. I mean, I can understand how hard it would be to get rid of an evil home. We are talking about starting a horrible fire, demolition, flood, etc. But a mirror? How difficult could it be to get rid of a mirror? This was the most horrible movie that could put the Amityville title in the picture! <br /> <br /> Well, a group of friends who are practically from the start, is a bunch of crazies. One of them is a photographer of some sort and buys a haunted mirror of a homeless guy, teaching me a valuable lesson, do not buy stuff from a homeless, weird guy. Of course, the horrible deaths and chaos follow this group, though I can not imagine anyone missing them. <br /> <br /> Please skip Amityville: The New Generation, I already have some complaints about my generation, so I guess this was a premonition. Does not sound so crazy. : P But believe me, this is terribly acted out, not well thought out, and not even scary! I feel so bad about the original writers of The Amityville Horror, they must be crying every time a person witnesses this movie. <br /> 1/10
