11:11 a.k.a Hell's Gate (2004) is another bad horror movie that tries very hard to be something it is not. A young woman has an imaginary playmate. One day, while in the fields playing with his friends, some fugitives visit their parents and kill them for no apparent reason. The young woman runs away and hides from the bad men. Years later, the girl grows up in a woman in trouble. The losers in his school (looking like repressed homosexuals) flaunt their masculinity in front of her when she rejected one of them. Girls hate her and life in general is miserable to her. A secret from your past returns to visit you. Who or what is it? Why does everyone hate her? What is your Guardian's problem with her? To find out, you'll have to watch Hell's Gate. <br /> <br /> The new title makes absolutely no sense. I do not know why people get paid to make such bad movies. This movie is not good enough to make fun of. It is a headache inducing mess that confuses anyone who tries to make any sense out of it. Not worth your time. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
