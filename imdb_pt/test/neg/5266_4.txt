This movie is really very strange. Certainly certain * events * portrayed identify the main protagonist as the Dublin criminal known as "The General", but almost everything else is simply wrong. We are not talking about a distortion of ancient history ... but a complete distortion of documented and irrefutable facts. The question is why? The garda is shown as the last day Keystone Cops, his gang as non-threatening, and the man himself as ... well Kevin Spacey. Fiction almost pure anyway, why bother to try to give a look of realism? Having said all this, it is a * bad * exercise * way you want to look at it. Not worth a second of anyone's time.
