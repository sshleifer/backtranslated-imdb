New Year's Day. The day after consuming some martinis and cosmopolitan vodka mixed with a lot of sparkling at midnight, my wife and I discovered that the local cable TV company is offering free digital specialty channels for the month of January. We had a choice - do we use the free channels or do we start to watch the eight seasons of X-Files on DVD we received from our daughter at Christmas? <br /> <br /> We have chosen for the digital toast since the DVDs are going nowhere and we need something like ten twelve-hour days to watch all the X Files beginning to end. The Drive-In Channel featured a classic three-movie horror marathon: Asylum (1972), House of the Damned (1996) and The Pit and the Pendulum (1961). The asylum is well reviewed here and the Pit and the Pendulum arrived too late for us to watch, which means that we could just be properly critical of the House of the Damned. To be honest, we've tried to take the film seriously, since its stars have reasonably good acting credentials - Greg Evigan (exaggerated William Shatner's Tekwars) and Alexandra Paul (Baywatch's only baby) who could act even though he had the body of a ten-year-old boy). Unfortunately, it soon dissolved us into laughter under the influence of a little dog hair as each one shouted the names of the movies that this dog lent his scenes to: Poltergeist, The Illuminated, House of Hell, House On Haunted Hill , Ghost Busters! The performance, especially for Evigan's real-life daughter, was not all that bad considering the silly script with which they had to work. The CGI for 1996 was hilarious - at its worst in the final scene, when it should have been the most horrible, it was so bad that my wife and I laughed. <br /> <br /> General: Performance 4/5, Script 2/5, SFX 0/5
