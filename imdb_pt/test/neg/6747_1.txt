Only in the world of Hollywood visual fiction could anyone, including FBI agents, be so incredibly stupid. The good guys are stupid enough to take everything that interests them, answer phones, climb stairs, all in search of a demolition expert who's out to get everyone. Oh yeah, and then we got the Hollywood SUPERVILLAIN. He can be shot, even if he has a vest, and then fall on a long flight of stairs and still have the edge over his stupid pursuers. Every clich√© you can imagine in thriller movies was used. I just watched because Yuki Amami is so HOT. But, yeah, it's great to see how this FBI agent is morally superior when he's sure there's a bomb in an opera house, and it does not sound the alarm. Who writes these scripts ????????????
