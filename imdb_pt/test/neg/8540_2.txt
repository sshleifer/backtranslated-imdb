Good old Jess Franco! The director's always dependable choice, in case you are looking for lack of skill, blatant exploitation and 200% gratuity. Jess once again really overcame herself with this totally useless piece of jungle "adventure." Let's face it, this movie is basically just an excuse for actress Katja Bienert parading around topless (and underage). In fact, it's a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16-year-old girl had to walk around a set of nude shots in front of a whole team and particularly in the face of Franco's perverted looks! And it was not even the first time, since the pair already made "Linda" together. Anyway, just in case you ask yourself: YES, "Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro" has a plot, albeit a lot of moron. During the opening sequences, a plane carrying a rich Scot and a girl aboard crashes into an African tribe of vegetarian cannibals. I say vegetarian because they never at one point in the movie try to consume human flesh. The scandalous Scot declares himself the Great White Leader and the girl becomes the beautiful and poorly dressed white goddess. Several years later, an expedition arrives in the middle of the jungle to take the girl back to civilization and ?? even more important - steal some of the legendary diamonds of the tribe. This could have been an attractive and action-packed adventure film, but Jess Franco obviously could not be bothered. Why filming chase sequences in the jungle or bloody cannibal rites when you can easily aim your camera at a hot young girl sitting naked in a tree? Most jungle settings just seem to be filmed in someone's garden and there are huge amounts of Geography footage from National Geographic to fill in the gaps in continuity. The back of the DVD describes "Kilimanjaro Diamonds" as an ingenious, feminist, and adult version of Tarzan. Yes, they put that phrase there because Katja Bienert's character rocks from one tree to another using a couple of times.
