This episode just aired in the UK. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. The heavy touches of humor were misjudged, childish, and spoiled what could have been a good plot. I can not believe Jerry Bruckheimer allowed this episode to happen. I've seen all the previous episodes of this show, and even the episode where Jack played his own older self was well ahead of that episode. The lesbian kiss was pathetic sensationalism. <br /> <br /> There was also no continuity of the previous episode. There was nothing in the plot investigating Martin's dangerous behavior or possible drug addiction. There was nothing explicitly written about Jack's growing relationship with Ann. Usually without a trace is very good in this kind of continuity. <br /> <br /> The next episode needs to be a considerable improvement.
