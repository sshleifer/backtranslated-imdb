Attention, possible spoilers <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that it becomes funny. The director has put in all the cliches that have already plagued B movies. The stupid bimbo being caught again and again by the bandits, the boss villain and revealing his plans before they happen so they can be ruined and who of course bullied / killed the hero's father in an obscure past, a side kick in the person of a policeman - small, bald and whose only preparation for the last battle (another clich√©) is returning his baseball cap back etc. . <br /> <br /> The end of the movie really outweighs this. After the boss villain dies when the hero Paralyzed Stoneface Jack or whatever throws him from the roof of a ten-story building, they leave the building. Which, from the outside, looks only three floors and much like its regular city hall. <br /> <br /> When they leave the building, the side kick can not walk, and the right leg seems to be injured. Like, no one can say: ten minutes before, he fell shot in his shoulder and his feet were fine. There is no further explanation for the inquisitive mind of the viewer, who would be curious to know trivial things like "Where is the body of the villain who should be near the building?" and "Why are not there police or even curious people gathered around that body?" <br /> <br /> I could go on forever with the list. Why does another of the bad guys claim to have invented martial arts when he gets his butt in no time? Why do bandits in general make silly moves when attacking? Why does the hero look so drunk? Is there anyone really thinking "yeah, these characters and this plot makes it a movie to remember"? And the actors are terrible. Our hero and savior of the day wears the same expression on his face. The whole movie. That disgusting - trying to be an arrogant smile must be some copyright exploit of it. <br /> <br /> In addition, thinking that until now 12% of the people who rated this movie gave a 10 makes me full of fear inside. They may have been serious and then we are doomed.
