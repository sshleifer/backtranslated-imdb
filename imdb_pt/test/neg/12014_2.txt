The only good that any of the Problem Child films caused was reuniting Amy Yasbeck and the late John Ritter. In addition, movies are as demonic as the hero. In this largely unnecessary sequel, newly separated Ben (Ritter) and his little junior gunner (Michael Oliver, who never needs the screen again) move to a new city infested with unwed singles. Ben eventually chooses Lawanda (played by the most underused original, SNL-er Laraine Newman), whose tendencies of Blanche DuBois do not match with Junior at least. To add to Junior's torture, it seems that this town already has a little girl-shaped girl with Trixie, who coincidentally has a single, sweet mother played by Yasbeck, the same actress who played the first horrible mother by Junior's adoption. You can see where the plot goes from here. Searching for my favorite scene is like pulling teeth, so I guess I'll go with the "Cherry Bomb in the Bathroom" gag that James Tolkan, from Back to the Future, one of the many adult victims (that guy is always representing the authority of school). figures). Jack Warden and Gilbert Gottfried return as their parts of the first film, but unfortunately, there is no Klansmaer appearance of bow tie, I mean Killer (Michael Richards) that made Problem Child even more fun. On a serious note, I'm sure those movies, whether abusive parents saw them or not, did wonders for America's redheads. Let's also welcome these proud American films for their fantastic promotion of adoption. Oh, and dog poop jokes - have to make dog poop jokes ... Shmucks.
