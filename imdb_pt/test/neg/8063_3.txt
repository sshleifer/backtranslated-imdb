I bought this used thing in the "trash" of a video game store. I wanted to feel this guilty feeling that something I was warned about is too intense to watch; I wanted the shock value. I wanted to feel guilty and bad for watching a "forbidden movie". I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Cannibal Ferox does not work because it is so overdone and false. Most of the time, the camera does not show the "shocking" blows, the chops, the slicing - you just see the consequences. (They show a chest hooking on details). Special effects are just OK. Nothing here that says violence is real. The "cannibals" are obviously poor people from Central / South America, who dressed wild in the jungle and were told to act badly. These people were obviously all over the scene to get a little money, or food, or both. Again ... just not convincing. <br /> <br /> However, as everyone else has said, there is a real killing of animals going on here. This is the extent of realism. For me, that was more shocking than any evisceration, scalp cut or castration, and yet the animal deaths are not so bloody - maybe just sad.
