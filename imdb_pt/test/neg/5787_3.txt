The contemporary chapter of the elite US underwater demolition team is called to do ... what they want, apparently. <br /> <br /> Charlie Sheen was made official. The plot is unbelievable. Michael Biehn is his immediate, but he keeps Charlie on a fairly long leash and one of the guys pays for it at first, being killed thanks to Charlie's patented stupidity. The rest of the team spends their free time committing martial cuts offenses. Primarily an exercise in random shooting and fine ethics like paper, these particular seals may be better suited to serve as collision test dummies. <br /> <br /> Some good action scenes counteract the silly process.
