Such a dumb movie should never see the light of day. The acting is lame, violence is just everywhere, the sneaky end is just stupid. <br /> <br /> It's all about a lawyer who saw a murder done by R.I.C.C.O. platoon. No one has ever seen him, not even the murderers themselves. Then he and a beautiful lady are fleeing trying to find the leader of this R.I.C.C.O. before they find them. <br /> <br /> So the film continues with a romance, shooting and voodoo. Now, how the hell did voodoo come to that? Never watch this movie if your life depends on it. Trust me!!!!!!!!
