I tried to like this show, I really have but I can not find a reason why anyone would like it. The story lines are weak, the acting is weak and unbelievable. Every member of the cast seems to have been randomly picked up from the street. And it seems to me that the whole show is just a vehicle for Jamie Lynn Spears to be able to go to the movies. Each episode shows Zoey as the girl every girl wants to be her best friend and every kid wants to date. She is always perfect and nobody is like that in real life. How can people relate to a character who is just a Barbie doll? Jamie Lynn's acting is fair, but she's not an actress strong enough to have the lead role in a series. All fans of the program are just young girls who know nothing better. I'm sorry if you think my comments are too harsh but if you can find a meaningful and deep moment in this series that is not quickly geared up for a beach party - please accept my opinions and find something worth watching.
