The idea that anyone could have invented such a banal, clich√© and yet comical and unseemly movie is shocking. The last 20 minutes of this movie are a comic glory; with six men digging enough trench in 10 minutes to light the runway with gasoline for a 747, while a supposed 'bigger' landed to perfection the 747 in a 110mph crosswind - prompting one to question the improper name of calling this CRASH movie LANDING ... <Some of the dialogues amounted to rubbing sandpaper in my ears, while the only aspect that saved this film for a 1 was the plethora of attractive women occupying the screen for most of the time. Not exactly a consolidation for that pathetic excuse of a movie, but my mute button has finally received a workout. <br /> <br /> See at your own risk! 2 out of 10
