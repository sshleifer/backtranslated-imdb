in this quagmire of mediocrity? You're way better than that. <br /> <br /> Simply put, Frostbite is useless. Bad acting (and I use that term loosely), minimalist "plot" humor, and somber snowboarding. There is not even a sufficient display of female attraction to arouse the lascivious interest of socially inept males, but of red blood. <br /> <br /> Top Gun had spectacular flight sequences to look at. Days of Thunder had breathtaking racing action. Even Point Break had skydiving scenes to its credit. Frostbite does not have any of that. It's not worth your time, my time, the time of Traci Lords, the time of Carmen Nicole, nor the time of someone involved with this destruction of celluloid that would have been perfectly usable in something worthwhile had it not been wasted in this forage to the recycling center. The world will be a better place when we forget that Frostbite existed.
