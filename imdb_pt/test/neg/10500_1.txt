I do not usually give "1" movies. Although I am a heartless critic, I try to find anything that makes the movie worthwhile (ie watchable). The main thing I'm looking for is a coherent plot. If you have it on your own, I can watch it! Let me start by saying, this does not even deserve to be called a movie, this is more like a primary school project ... it has gone terribly wrong! And I've seen all the specials from science fiction movies that have already been made. <br /> <br /> Many times I read critics of professionals who say crap like "This played like a Made-for-TV ... (etc, etc)" and I kept saying "Oh, come on, I I wish they would think of a REAL criticism. " Well, that's worse ... much worse! This is really the worst "thing" I've seen that lasted the duration of a movie (if I considered it a movie, it would be my new worst movie ever), and I've seen all the movies made by Uwe Boll! This movie makes Uwe Boll look like Francis Ford Coppola! :) I'd rather watch Jaws the Revenge all day and see it one more time ... up to 5 minutes of it ... there was a good scene and it was the END! P OK enough basing the works of Ron Hall, now for serious criticism. The script is poorly written, the dialogue is delivered in a wooden way, the effects are more cheesy than those in a power. The Rangers show, and do not even get me started on zoom transitions onscreen (ugh). Did anyone really watch this thing, edited it and said "ok, let it go"? I would have burned it before I released it! At closing all I can say is "Thank God, DVD and VHS have a Stop and Eject feature!" My advice ... do not rent it, if you do, you'll be glad you stopped and kicked out too! :)
