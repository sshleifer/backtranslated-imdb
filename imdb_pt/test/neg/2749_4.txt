As powerful as Phoolan's true story is, this book on which this film is based came out before it was released from Prison itself and given a chance to tell. <br /> <br /> It's supposedly based on her diaries, but she's illiterate. How does it work? <br /> <br /> That said, some areas of the film are accurate and the acting is not bad, with some sensitivity being shown. <br /> <br /> Really, this story needs to be old in a TV series. Away from much happens to cram in a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> Read her autobiography. Highly recommended. It's a fantastic story.
