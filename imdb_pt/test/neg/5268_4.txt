one of the worst excuses for an Irish accent I heard. of a great actor too. is a bad Irish accent not to mention a Dublin accent (which is completely different) anyway the film is loosely based on the history of the ganglord martin cahill and is much better with brendan gleeson in the lead role in THE GENERAL
