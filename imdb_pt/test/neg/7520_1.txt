This movie sucks. From start to finish it was predictable. There was absolutely no chemistry between Pearce and Mumba's cub. The plot came to nothing, floating in oblivion. All of this made the film very hilarious in its stupidity. And I wanted to strangle Orlando Jones, the guy just needs to leave.
