This movie is the first AVP movie across the Aliens and Predator franchise. <br /> <br /> They are horrible, misinterpreted, badly scripted and terribly directed. They seem like a desperate attempt to make money from the good name of the aliens and movies from original predators, but instead of producing a well thought out quality production, they come with the predator. The original Alien / Aliens / Predator / Predator 2 movies were great, they redefined the horror / suspense genre by inventing these insane (yet believable) creatures who took on the role of serial killer 'as opposed to a human. <br /> <br /> These films are just milking the franchise and do nothing but darken their name. <br /> <br /> The Aliens vs. Predator comics were brilliant and had a great story. They were true to the Alien / Predator mythology, they did not hide the original stories, etc ... Why did not they turn comics into a big movie? Because Hollywood are idiots, that's why.
