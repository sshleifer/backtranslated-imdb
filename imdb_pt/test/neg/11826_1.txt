Much of the commentary on this forum revolves around debating the validity of some comparison with R DOGS made on the cover of the DVD. Forget all this ... This movie - er - home movie is absolutely horrendous. How can someone with an ounce of credibility claim this as 10/10? There is no plot, none. I could not believe that I spent money to rent this (more on that later) and that I had been fooled into believing that this (based on the art of a box cover and some sort of movie fest award) had potential . The only thing I really remember is that, incredibly, one of the annoying main characters was supposedly knocked over with a bullet in the head ... and he ends up surviving the wound and getting to the final live credits. Wow. And look, Killers has a sequel. Double wow. <br /> <br /> True story - Actually, I was so denied that I lost my money and my life force in this rent that I kept the videotape for six months. I kept telling myself that it never happened. The video on the TV was an illusion - a mental symbol of my self-loathing. After someone said that it was in fact real and that I needed to control myself, I decided I could not just leave it there. I thought, "How many others have I denied the suffering of sitting through the visualization of this masterpiece, accumulating Killers just for me?" I had to do the right thing and return it back to the hell where it came from. <br /> <br /> So, as I imagine most of the populous of IMDb would do in a similar situation, I created a great deal of courage and went to the video store ... at 2 in the morning. After making sure no one was around, I got out of my car (still running, of course), put the film in the deposit box and booked the hell never to return. <br /> <br /> I guess I was hoping some Hollywood Video corporation henchmen would come looking for me (the account must have hit something like $ 1,238.66 by then) so I walked away from the area. However, coincidentally, much like the Killers story, nothing happened.
