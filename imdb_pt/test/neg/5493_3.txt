Better in the middle, when most of the characters get excited and go after someone they did not have before. It is around that point that we can see the majestic breasts of Susan Sarandon (even though through a veil). Strangely, Beverly D'Angelo, who is not ashamed of nudity, shows nothing while Aida Turturro? of all people ?? does. At the other end of the spectrum, the less talk about Walken playing a homosexual, the better. The movie itself has little plot; the play dialogues and the "normal" dialogs happen frequently and it's not the kind of thing I would consider a good idea. Life in the theater: who cares? Occasionally, the dialogue has something going on, but the film drags itself in snippets.
