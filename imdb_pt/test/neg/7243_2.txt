No direct budget for video tale of foreigners in Arizona involving the military and convicted fugitives. <br /> <br /> It's not bad as such, instead it suffers from the cast and crew type to go through the rhythms instead of trying to sell it. It's like they knew they were in a z-grade movie and they want you to know they know. Then again, maybe they could not be together. <br /> <br /> A flaw in a z-grade movie that might have been something if someone cared-and had the ability. Why do low-budget filmmakers insist on not trying to do something good instead of just making a product? <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 because nothing comes together
