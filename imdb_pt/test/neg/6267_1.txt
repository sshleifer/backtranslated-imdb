I usually end all the movies or books I start, even if they are poor, just because I hate giving up on them. This was so badly done, I was in disbelief. <br /> <br /> I'm not just looking for Spielberg's magic - I rented foreign films, and rented really old sci-fi (more recently Soylent Green - it was worth it). rent). I like both Hollywood action and slow character development. Different films need to be approached differently to be appreciated. I did not find any redeeming element for this ... The action was so wooden that I was not at all on edge. The development of the character was practically absent - you do not pity anyone, or identify with him. Finally, there were so many pieces that simply did not add up. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time - it's better to see paint dry ...
