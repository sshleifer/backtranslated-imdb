Guys, what can I tell you? I am Bulgarian. I do not remember how many times I talk to Americans let alone that they have no idea where Bulgaria is, but they say things like, "There's a war going on there, right?" or "I never imagined that in a place like Bulgaria people have Internet" Go watch "The man with the screaming brain" by Bruce Campbell. I was curious about this movie because 1) I am fan of Bruce Campbell - "Evil Dead" trilogy and "The Adventures of Brisco County Jr." 2) The film was filmed entirely in Bulgaria, the second after "Alien Apocalypse", which is also almost impossible to be seen. 3) I like good movies B Well ... The film presents our country as an endless gypsy city, where they attack your car, wave with illegal weapons, and you can be killed at any time. time . And Bruce's line, "Bull $ h1t Bulgaria", is more than offensive. <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi and Stacy Ceach make a great team, Bruce makes his special. Nothing else to see here. Peoeple gives this movie 10 just because of Bruce's cult status but deserves no more than 3. Film waste.
