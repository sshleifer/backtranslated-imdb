The peculiarities of Jack Brooks are, at first, a little charming and lend to the deliberately exaggerated feel of the beginning of this film. <br /> <br /> I caught myself getting angrier and angrier when I was fooled to see this movie to the end, hoping the reward would be worth the super tedious wait. <br /> <br /> The climax can not begin to compensate for all the preparation time. <br /> <br /> Normally, one can expect superficial characters of this genre. But the fact that the waiting-time index before the action is so high should mean that the average time would be devoted to some interesting character development. <br /> <br /> It's not like that. <br /> <br /> Although not without its initial charms, this movie infuriates and disappoints. <br /> <br /> I wish I could recover all the setup time, reinvest it into something that pays off.
