I was surprised to find that Michael Moore or Bill Maher were not involved with this "movie". A leftist American list of axes to grind, with a distinct shortage of Democrats in Hell. Mao Zedong and Karl Marx did not appear in Hell, but is Ronald Reagan in the same room as Hitler? Maybe we'll have to wait for these doctors from California to sniff Paradiso so they can show all their silly pet political figures. <br /> <br /> Cheap shots at religion, right-wing politicians, corporations and their lobbyists, Fox News, even SUVs. All radical leftist points of contention were completely covered - while ostensibly omitting references to offenses on the "other side of the corridor" - not to be a conscious effort. The only exception I noticed in an hour and a half is that JFK has to have sex with Marilyn Monroe for all eternity: the symbolic inclusion in these pieces of propaganda in a pathetic attempt to appear non-partisan.
