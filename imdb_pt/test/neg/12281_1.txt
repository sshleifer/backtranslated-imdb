I had to write a review for this movie based on those who are saying bloody, non stop action, great movie .. These people were obviously watching a different movie. Honestly sucked word kill go !! I waited and hoped that this movie would improve and it did not help. Some have said that this movie was brutal and others said bloody, but I can not find any of these adjectives really appearing in this, I mean hell, there are so many scenes with people being shot and there is no blood at all, it's not even funny! ! I think the best way to summarize this is probably should have been classified as PG by the 1984 standards and now in the year 2010 there is no doubt that this would be PG !! Bad, BAD not in the cheesy movie fun "B" variety !!
