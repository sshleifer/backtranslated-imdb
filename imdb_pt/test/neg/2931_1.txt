I believe this movie was a terrible waste of my time, and I'd like to know after watching it 5 times in class. this movie does not show what absolutely happened perfectly during those times. nobody can really say that these things happened to the letter. If anything, the only good part would be the actors, even though they really were really crap. They were reading the blank script. Very boring. I'd rather watch them play at school. so I definitely would like to never see this movie again in my entire life. is a complete waste of time, unless you want your time wasted and you would like to see an unrealistic view of what happened in 1981.
