Even by the standards of most B movies, this movie is by far the worst I've ever seen. The graphics are so bad that a man in a monster costume seems more realistic. the effects of ocean water are especially laughable, including the only scene in which they enter the mini-submarine, and the "water" seems to be frozen in place. The problems with this movie are so numerous that I will stop here with the details. Needless to say, I'm not joking when I say that even Uwe Toilet Boll could do a better job. Avoid this movie at all costs, there are other films of class B that, although they are horrible, are at least a good way to pass the time.
