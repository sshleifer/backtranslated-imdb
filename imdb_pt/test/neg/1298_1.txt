This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen; I gave it a star simply because it is the lowest score possible. Who thought Flood would be a good movie? The director and the cast should be ashamed, and then I realized that this could all be part of a scary tactic. Advertising alone could be so bad. <br /> <br /> Flood's redeeming feature is that hysteria and the stereotypical plot of meaningless make it funny. If only the characters had the same depth created by the flood itself, they would still gallop from a sound bite to a sound bite with no emotional response. <br /> <br /> The sad thing about this movie is that it could have been so much better, informative, imaginative and tense. Flood has the amateurish tendency to find in many recent British films where a more focused use of funds would have contributed to better entertainment. <br /> <br /> Where was Smithee?
