"You can survive anything." Anything but an idiot horror movie. The director could not even decide whether he wanted a demon or just a serial killer of the past. You can not have both. It's as if Michael Moore tried to have his cake and eat it too (or, in his case, 1500 cakes), making his charlatan brand of "comedies": they should be hilarious and funny, and yet you also want to treat them as truth-based, devastating and compelling documentaries. Some genres can not be mixed. <br /> <br /> "Everything can happen to anyone, anytime, anywhere." (Translation: this is the horror genre, so we can do any kind of nonsense we want.) That does not sound much like something "wise" found in a role of a Chinese luck cookie, but more like the creed of all bad horror movie director. We received this farce from a statement that was sent to us early on as a preparation / justification for the absurd buffet that is to come. <br /> <br /> "My phone is not working!" Well, of course it is not. There is a much greater chance that Sean Penn's brain will start working (after decades of catatonic apathy) than that of a horror movie phone. The most monotonous and predictable horror cliché of the last decade. Why say that? We know that help will never come through a phone call, so you foolish bastards may just not mention it. The last 50 horror movies I've seen use this plot device. It's getting embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "You always have to wait for the unexpected." The final turnaround was pretty amazing, I'll give them too much ... However, a lot of nonsense on the way there. <br /> <br /> Check out the elaborate traps that the heroine rides with the speed of a drug-up lab rat-in cold, wet, and almost totally dark conditions. I love the realism of horror movies ... <br /> <br /> When a bloodthirsty demon begins to try to be funny ("shshshing" his victims), then you know that your pleasure of seeing horror is in doubt . The less said about the old "cracking wise" old man, the better ... Another stupid cliché served by a tired, lazy, uninspired director. <br /> <br /> What are the chances of being attacked by your husband and then by a demon that hates the eyes - the same day? "Expect the unexpected". They might as well have squeezed themselves into an event where she survived a plane crash, and then another where she finds aliens who have tried to investigate her ... The fast-forward button needs of a temple or a sanctuary built in his image.
