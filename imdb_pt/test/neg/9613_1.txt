Hailed with derision by most critics when it first appeared, 'Frenzy' recently made the rounds of UK TV. I remember seeing it at its original release and thinking that if Hitchcock wanted to parade some kind of screen confession about his ingrained misogynist, he could not have found a more unpleasant little vehicle to do so. <br /> <br /> But time changes perspective, and then what was nauseatingly bad in 1972 could, all those years later, be worth revaluing up. <br /> <br /> Maybe. . . but not. 'Frenzy' is scum. The scum of an elderly director who desperately wanted to exploit the artistic freedom of 1970s films without seeming to realize that freedom imposes its own obligations - especially the need to bring integrity to work. <br /> <br /> none here. And there is not much evidence of the steering's former brilliance-the shift from the prickly implant to the odious explicit is not shocking nor, to a supreme, fashionable stylist: it is only banal (the scene of prolonged murder is precisely this: prolonged, with no purpose other than the cheapest of directing desires to appear as a contemporary artist as, let's say, that acclaimed acclaimed cheap saucy practitioner, Michael Winner. <br /> <br /> And it goes from bad to worse , with dialogue that defies any human provenance (no less in the ridiculous detour to the Home Life of Our Dear Wood Inspector, and in the kitchen of his wife). <br /> <br /> Perhaps the scene that best sums up 'Frenesi (and endures as the most explicit accusation of Hitchcock persona) is the truncated exchange between two lawyers in a bar where they discuss the serial killings and then agree that at least the women had fun first being raped <br /> <br /> I remember my disgust in that scene in '72, and it's still not erased, because it was not Hitchcock being smart, or sarcastic, or trying to make some universal point (great themes, great truths, were not Hitchcock's forte, nor personal preference). just Hitchcock, allowing a reflection of his own distorted mirror in life to shine through the texture of the film. Calling Hitchcock's last great masterpiece is to betray little or no understanding of what Hitchcock actually achieved in terms of cinematic cheats, cinematic thrills and dazzling cinematic mastery. <br /> <br /> "Frenesi" is, therefore, now what it always was: a cheap, nasty movie with a fist that did not do anything. any of those involved, or the memory of a filmmaker who really was, in his Hollywood days, one of the greatest that ever existed.
