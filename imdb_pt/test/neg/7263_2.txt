Roy Rogers (as Roy) and Helper Raymond Hatton (as Rusty) join Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders. Soon, they are suspended to "Round Up" the killer of partner Eddie Acuff (as Tommy) throughout the US-Mexico. border; they discover scary gold corridors in the process. Notice how, even when suspended, Mr. Rogers is able to get the Rough Riders to participate in his Round-up! <br /> <br /> This is not one of Roy Rogers' best westerns. The fight scenes look like choreographed dances. Rogers sings / yodels "Ridin 'Down the Trail," one of two relatively common songs; and a highlight in general.
