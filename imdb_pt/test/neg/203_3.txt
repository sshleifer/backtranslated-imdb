Armored The best part of driving an armored vehicle is that if some homeless man approaches you at a red light asking for money, you can shoot them in the face. <br /> <br /> And while the armored guards in this thriller are not using their protective power to purge the population, they are using their position to protect their employer. <br /> <br /> When newcomer Ty (Columbus Short) gets a job with an armored trunk company, he feels as if he has found his luck in life. Unfortunately, however, when he learns that his coworkers (Matt Dillon, Jean Reno, and Laurence Fishburne) are plotting to bring the $ 42M shipment to himself, Ty must strengthen himself? and the funds? inside an armored truck. <br /> <br /> A tedious sassy with a lugubrious plot and phone calls, Armored is an absolutely forgettable movie. <br /> <br /> Plus, if you really want to make millions of dollars, it's much simpler to disguise yourself as an ATM.
