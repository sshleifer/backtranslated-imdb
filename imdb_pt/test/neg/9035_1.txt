I just watched this movie while it was on TV and I had nothing else to do. We went here for the IMDb too look at the trivia page and went on to look at user comments. It is what I think? Every dumb ass raises this movie to heaven! I would not even have written anything, but when no one else had time to spread the word about this fucking movie, I thought I might. The acting was sucked from practically everyone in the cast. . The worst of them was the guy who was playing Brian Wilson (I think I got the name right) as he was exaggerating, especially when he was stoned. The rest was not as bad as he was, but no one was good either. I am no expert at the beach boys though so hypocrisy really complain in history that much .... except it sucked though. No motivation for any of the character's decisions most of the time, but hey, maybe they were idiots in real life. And what I thought was worse was that I thought it would be a movie about the beach boys, but you really could only understand some of the characters. I hate it when they do it in movies, same thing on the doors, even though I like this movie more. You do not have the energy to write anymore ... it sucked! do not buy or watch!
