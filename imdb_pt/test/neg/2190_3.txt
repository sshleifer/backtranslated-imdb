Los Angeles doctor Tom Reed (Vincent Ventresca) survives a tragic car crash but ends up going to jail in the upper California desert. When his time is up, he lands in a small city, swept by the wind, called Purgatory Flats. His first stop is a bar where he quickly hits a beer and is hired as a waiter. So much for ex-cons having difficulty finding work. This is the first of a long series of absurdities that make up the plot of the foolish attempt by writer / director Harris Done in the modern, noir desert movie. <br /> <br /> Your first night at work. Sunny (Alexandra Holden), who walks with a family of bad boys: the Mecklins, consisting of Uncle Dean (Gregg Henry) and his two nephews, drug addict Owen (Kevin Alejandro), who is Sunny's husband. and the soldier Randy ("90210" s Brian Austin Greer). After your turn is over, there will be a shooting and Dr. Tom will be around. He agrees to treat one of the injured and, most importantly, not tell the police. I'm not sure if it's a good move for a guy just out of the pen, but this script (co-written by Diane Fine) has very little to do with logic. <br /> <br /> Tom makes a series of bad decisions that make him more and more entangled in the criminally inclined Mecklin Boys, including stealing medical supplies and jumping in the bag with Sunny. Everyone in the theater is yelling, "Do not do this! Go away," but Tom does it anyway. In a classic noir movie such as "Body Heat" or "Double Indemnity" we hope for and empathize with William Hurt and Fred McMurray as they get sucked into the web of bright and sexy fatalities like Kathleen Turner and Barbara Stanwyck. It's not their fault. We would probably be tempted by all that money or that particular lady as well. But Dr. Tom seems to derive from stupidity rather than circumstance. Sunny is sexy but not a very attractive character, and there is no money to tempt him. Are you wondering if he attended the same medical school as Dr. Nick Riveria's "The Simpsons". <br /> <br /> The foolish script would make you believe that a country man's country house has almost everything you need to deal with. a shot in the stomach, and that wounded could easily catch the eye and effectively participate in a fight. That gives us an implausible car chase with one of those "The Club" things stuck behind the wheel. Oh, that tanker that just blew up - no one noticed that. <br /> <br /> I wonder how such a ridiculous script turned green? Maybe Brian Austin Greer is more successful than I gave him credit. It is obvious that he took on Randy's relatively small role - a hot-headed murder - to show the producers that he had more acting than he showed in "90210". <br /> <br /> It's kind of sad to see Nicholas Turturro playing a stereotypical Hispanic drug dealer. He deserves more than that. <br /> <br /> If you have an IQ above 50, "Purgatory Flats" will make you shake your head in disbelief. I'll give 3 stars for the unintentional laughter and scenes with the sexy Miss Holden running in her red panties.
