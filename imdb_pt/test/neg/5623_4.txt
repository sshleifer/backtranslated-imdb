Quentin Tarantino's partner in crime Roger Avary (co-author of "Pulp Fiction") ventures on his own (this time, QT exec exec.) For this super-boiled French thriller. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz is Zed, an extraordinary safe cracker who moved to France from the United States at the request of an old friend. There he joins a heterogeneous team of drugged hippies who, with little or no planning, think they can knock down a bank vault full of gold bars on a French national holiday. <br /> <br /> Avary reformulated Rob was wrong theme that Tarantino developed so well in Reservoir Dogs, only "Killing Zoe" is not good enough to survive on the strength of this alone, so Avary played in a distraction quite beautiful Julie Delpy is Zoe, a student named Zed who entertains Zed on her arrival in Paris. An impressive distraction, it certainly is, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> I think our director wanted to add a different angle to this basic theme, but unfortunately the move did not help add to the depth of his superficial plot so desperately needed. There has never been a story in this idea, which was no more than that, an idea. Even the surreal journey in the decadent dives of Paris is uninteresting. I think someone would have to admit that there has never been much of a movie in the history of a bunch of gangsters shooting at each other because of a jewel theft, until you add intricate characters and a sulky dialogue. "Reservoir Dogs", "Killing Zoe" did not. Stoltz's strong interpretation of the dubious Zed and the crazy portrait of Jean Hughes-Anglade of the obsessive ring leader does nothing to lift the proceedings. In short, Avary tried, unsuccessfully, to conjure up entertainment from scratch. <br /> <br /> Friday, September 15, 1995 - Astor Theater
