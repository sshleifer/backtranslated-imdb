Very clich√©. Rather tacky. Acting gets worse as the show continues. Do not believe anything people say about the "realism" this movie should portray. It's just a shoot'em up. Interesting turnaround in which the VC surrounding the base was given a human face and were not portrayed as evil incarnate.
