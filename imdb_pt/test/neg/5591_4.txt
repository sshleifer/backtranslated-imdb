This is another one of those movies that I knew I'd hate, but it turned out not to be as bad as one might expect. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of T & A in it and even the DVD menu is shocked Full of woman's chest. The first scenes of the movie have lots of sex and nudity, and I was beginning to think there would be no story just exploring nudity in order to make money with a popular 8 million prequel. <br /> <br /> As I continued to watch, there was only more sex and nudity and main characters I could care less about, but then the story began to unfold and I started to see a point for all of this, and Breakfast was a bit better. It is about a man who is engaged is the daughter of an Ambasador and they all have a promising future until naked photos of a sexual act menage a trois appear and blackmail is on the cards of the senders. The man and his fianc√© must now get to the bottom of who sent the photos and how to shut them. <br /> <br /> The movie first of all has nothing to do with part 1, it does not even have anything to do with 8MM, it's about a sex video, so I can see the similarities, for less than can be. <br /> <br /> The acting is not good, nor bad, it's just nobody playing parties could someone do. The value of movie production is in the middle of the road and its pure drama yawns. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed going along for the ride to get to the bottom of the blackmailing motives. I was anticipating answers that is a lot more than I could say to the first one that I consider junk. This movie has some twists that are always welcome. <br /> <br /> It's not great, and it's very slow, but it just entertains. I was not at the limit of my place and I will not rave to my friends that this is a must see, but hey if you watch many movies and always look for something new, this can entertain you for 90 minutes.
