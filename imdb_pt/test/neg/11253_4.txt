Firstly, I'm critical of this movie because I really had high hopes and instead, this movie sucked. <br /> <br /> * possible spoilers * (if you have not seen the TV series yet) Where to start ?? ? Well, let's start with the quality. The film was little better than the original TV series and the two fighting scenes were very well crafted. However, the CGI was awful. <br /> <br /> Then there are the plot holes and issues that still remain after the whole movie has been said and done. This movie does not close as a successful conclusion to a very wide universe known as FMA and only returns to expand the universe more before leaving us with nothing beyond our imagination to decipher what would happen in the future. <br /> <br /> And then there's the biggest flaw in the stories. Adding WWII and Hitler ... WHY? The series was perfect ... and did not need Hitler. He did not even need Germany. Overall, the whole movie was raucous in what could be an FMA movie, and if I were the directors, I'd discard CoS and make a new, more "ending," ending.
