I was 12 when I saw the original movie (I lived in Italy and the Italian title was "FBI, OPERATION CAT!"). It was a fun movie and not just for kids. This horrible remake is pathetic even for 5 year olds! Which has led Disney to ruin its reputation and the memory of a lovely film I do not know and I just can not believe it. Even the title song of the original film (both original and dubbed version in Italian) was extremely cool and created the mood for the story. In this remake, the title song is even worse than the movie itself. It was cool to see Dean Jones, even if only for an appearance, he was a regular in the big Disney movies. I can not honestly see anything else positive in this redone movie.
