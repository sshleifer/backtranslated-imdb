Four elementary school girls witness the murder of one of their classmates during what they considered an innocent game. The killer is a strange boy named Milo Jeeder. Sixteen years later, the four survivors of the event meet in happier circumstances in the same city where it happened. They believe that Milo drowned in a river shortly after the murder, but soon discovers that the demonic assassin Milo also returned, still a boy, unchanged even after almost two decades. <br /> <br /> The cover of this movie makes it look really cool (but I still hoped a bad movie would come out of it). When I put the DVD in my device, the menu appears and makes the movie still look cool. Unfortunately, this movie is not all that excited me. The movie is a common attempt to make a horror movie, and when I say mean, I mean like all those other low budget movies that have never been received with open arms by most members of the horror community (I'm talking about you , the horror fan). In other words, you could walk up to any horror fan and most of the answers would be "this sucks." <br /> <br /> What mistakes did the movie make? Firstly, the art of the DVD cover makes Milo look really dark, but they show everything by showing their face in the film in many different scenes. He had the potential to be a very weird character. Second, the back cover tells Freddy, Jason, Chucky, etc. to pack and move on because Milo is so much better ... why the hell would you like to say something like that when it comes to a non-name , low budget movie that obviously failed? I mean, it just raises your expectations about the movie, making it harder to impress you. In a last effort to attract attention, it says (in very large letters) "From the creator of Anaconda". It just shows how low they will get as much attention as possible to the movie. <br /> <br /> Blood in the movie sucks, the director gives you some hideous angles when Milo attacks someone. The music is not that bad and I never slept during the movie (Congratulations). I'm still trying to figure out what Milo really is. My best bet would be that he's a zombie, if anyone knows, tell me. Rest assured, I will not lose sleep thinking about it.
