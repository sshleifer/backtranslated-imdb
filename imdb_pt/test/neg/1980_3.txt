I was dizzy with girlish joy when I discovered about this movie soon after seeing Spirits Within. <br /> <br /> After years of anticipation, they gave the November 2005 release date. Well, November has come. And it was. Followed by December. Oh, look, today, January 31, 2006. No US release so far. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, I'm so happy to have a friend with a captioned copy of piracy. ; D Well, CG was great. Not as good as expected but almost perfect. I cringed, however, with the unnatural movements made by the children throughout the film. I thought we'd been through this. Also, I do not really care about the anime look given to their faces. I was under the impression that they were filming for a realistic look at the movie, and yet most characters have bigger eyes than normal ones, especially the female characters. They had personality, though, I'll give them that. <br /> <br /> Even though I'm not a big fan of anime, I have to say that I was impressed by the wild fighting scenes. They were animated beautifully and hung me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Over the top two. <br /> <br /> And therein lies Advent Children's biggest flaw. It's mostly just a bunch of hyper-stylized fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> An FF7 sequel of epic proportions has been promised for years. Instead, they gave us a cute piece of CG with just one plot to excuse their execution time of just under two hours. <br /> <br /> Where Final Fantasy is famous for its intricate stories, this movie falls short. You really do not know the characters. The only way for you to have some understanding of most of what occurred in the movie would have been if you had played the game. We could barely see them before they fought any current threat. <br /> <br /> What hurts the fans even more are the terrible appearances that most of the FF7 characters received. They were nothing more than Cloud's: "I'll call if I need you, but I probably will not" backup singers. And to increase their hurt, they had each individual character playing Cloud higher and higher. This little part here was so tacky that I almost hung up. I would have been much more impressed if he had simply jumped alone, bouncing off the walls to get up. <br /> <br /> It hurt even more when they reduced the Turks to less than just comic relief. That was good for the game, but this is cinema. People do not act like cartoon characters in a tough battle. They took away their dignity: And, spoiler (yes, right, most of you probably already know, anyway). Who remembers Darth Maul being excited about SW: Episode 1? Now imagine that, but with Sephiroth. That's right. He had maybe 5 minutes of time on the screen. Maybe that. End Spoiler: P <br /> <br /> If this movie was made for fans, then go to Square. If this is any indication of the direction you are taking the FF series, I doubt you will be seeing much of my money. I played his games for the wonderful story and the excellent characters. <br /> <br /> You had the chance to do something epic. Something really beautiful, a masterpiece that challenges all Disney movies in CG. <br /> <br /> Instead, you gave us a beautiful piece of meat with almost nothing to hold it. Very well. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure if the rest of the fans stop for a moment and try to pay attention to everything except the CG, they'll know what I'm talking about. Well, I'd rate this on 5/10, but after thinking about it while fixing this, I'm giving it a 3/10 because they could have done better. They did better. And that is simply sad. <br /> <br /> If they're going to redo anything FFVII, they need to do it first.
