Stealing is a crime, and these guys, Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen, seem to be getting away with it. I have not even seen this movie, but not only do I know it sucks, but stealing the story from another movie, or 2 movies, is bullshit (and if IMDb allowed swearing much more than bull shit) that I get angry and feel that I should throw myself out the window and end it all. O.k this is a bit much, but stealing is worse. <br /> <br /> Ever seen Pontypool? It was this little zombie movie made in 2008, this radio host comes into action, and then this zombie attack happens. We only see what's happening inside the radio station, and the only guess we have about what's going on out there are the occasional calls from your eyes in the sky Ken Loney (easily the funniest moment of the movie in my mind) and the BBC asking for an update on the situation. Of all the reviews I read, and the conversation I had with my friend (who has watched this movie and Pontypool), this movie was just like in the story, with little tweaks here and there. So throw originality and creativity out the window. As for the zombies, or the infected ones, whatever you want to call them. They are exactly the same thing, just because they were infected do not change the fact that they walk around without thinking, and have an endless end to the flesh. They are zombies. ZOMBIES !! <br /> <br /> ZOMBIES !!! Ok, one for many, but back to this low quality movie. The zombies I've heard are very much like those of 28 Days Later, another better movie, with its insane rage and even more insanely flesh-eating sensation. It's where zombie movies define themselves, the story does not matter in a zombie movie (as long as you do not get the idea of ​​another movie). Of course, a zombie movie can be enhanced by history, as in the case of Pontypool, but zombies have to be, to some extent, original. 28 Days Later started the furious insane Zombie. Pontypool I can not even begin to explain these guys without ruining the movie. The Evil Dead, I think all I have to do is type the name again because, by any chance, it's The Evil Dead. Romero is the master, and he went through all the different types of zombies, from face zombies painted in Dawn of the Dead to Zombies in Diary of the Dead, and he did each with his own style. So after talking about other great zombie movies, I think it's time for me to explain why I hate this movie without even seeing it. This film just below steals the original sketch of the story for Pontypool, which I think is called plagiarism and is illegal in this country and many people are expelled from school for doing so even in Hollywood is allowed, and apparently approved. This is not the only film that takes the sketch of another film, and just tries to say it differently. The 90's is like the worst period for movies of all time, it sure had some jewelry, but what the decade does not do, and it's because all the movies were exactly the same. My favorite, crime movie with such a twist that you'll never guess until the end. They force the feeding of a suspect, make it seem impossible that there is no one else besides him, so, bam, all this time was this guy, you just had to look at the scenes where he was not there and then when he would mysteriously go appear out of nowhere, say "hey, what did I miss?" OH! YOU DID NOT COME TO GET DONE NOW! Well, I'll leave a cliché as my final statement. This is a movie that you will surely want to miss.
