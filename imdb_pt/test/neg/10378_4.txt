The controversy at Cannes is remarkably esoteric, or is it that we Americans are so insensitive and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines again? In any case, with much careful analysis, "Falscher Bekenner" never seems to live up to the sensational controversy he allegedly brought to Cannes in 2005, an intriguing, monotonous and aimless film that lives up to its American humor. -title ("Low Profile"). <br /> <br /> Based on familiar themes of Bourgeois anguish and subsequent sexual liberation (kind of), it is certain that it is a film with no surface-level interests. It starts with a shootout while a haunted photo of a deserted road off the road focuses on an indecisive teenager who finally goes through a totalized car where supposedly a brutal hit-and-run left the driver dead in a bloody mess. Stunned, he does nothing but pick up a piece of the remaining engine. <br /> <br /> Out of school, the homeless turns out to be Armin Steebe, a product of the German suburbs with the least ambition. Persistently pressured by his worried but somewhat annoying parents to find a good job, he supports interview after interview with every arrogant interviewer, all with the same unsuccessful outcome. Getting quite weighed down by this, his already mentioned road encounter soon provokes his first act of rebellion: to claim responsibility for the crime he did not commit. <br /> <br /> Pretending to fill more requests and go more and more bizarre job interviews at sunrise, he participates in roadside sexual fantasies and petty vandalism after sunset. As the days get shorter and the nights get warmer, he continues to live in his suburban neighborhood as if he's not doing anything out of the ordinary. <br /> <br /> If you seem confused about what exactly is going on, do not worry about being the only one: this is as far and consistent as history. The storyline seems rather simple, and perhaps because of its seemingly straightforward purposes that is why "Falscher Bekenner" becomes unnecessarily complicated, becoming passionate about endless false conclusions, dream situations and explicit sex scenes to try to clarify a story with no clear logic for a vague argument (supposedly the soul-numbing effects of the modern suburban desert, or something about the fascination of youth with crime.Hey, it might even be a movie coming out). in hand. He spends a lot of time creating numerous symbols, both tangible and surrealistic allegories, but they do not seem to be really symbolizing anything of interest. <br /> <br /> The most fatal flaw, however, is how filmmakers paint all the characters in a harsh tone of vanilla. There are almost no distinguishing traits to help understand their purpose, and as the secondary characters (especially the confused relationship between Armin and his normal family - perhaps too familiar) catalyze the "difficult situation" of the already undeveloped main character, in focus. How can we identify with the rebellion of this almost adult youth with little notion of the world in which he lives or the prominent figures around him who help him to understand? <br /> <br /> Many people enter and leave the film (including Armin's girlfriend, Katja, and a strange and rich visitor who, for some reason, takes pleasure in seeing the protagonist eating brownies) and seem to exist for No there is no reason at all. They end up looking like an extension of an already thin story with meaningless subplots that continue to prove that the film is drawing a blank on where to go next. <br /> <br /> And even a movie that supposedly plays with reality (especially with Armin's nocturnal exploits), he ends up with a literally almost moralistic one that seems to interrupt the questions for a "story" that does little, but puts the viewer in a hopelessly exhausted state of perplexity. <br /> <br /> Without color, it is impossible to shade anything vital.
