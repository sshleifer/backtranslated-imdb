I can not believe I actually spent almost three hours of my life watching this. This must be one of the most unbelievable, predictable and extravagant television movies I have seen in a long time. I was hoping for some good special effects and action, instead I spent all of the time rolling my eyes and shouting "OH COME ON !!!" on the screen. The dialogue is superficial and obvious, the acting forced at times and as the story progresses, it is not funny how everything happens at the same time ... Not to mention the obvious and nauseating end ... Now I have seen more than the my share of disaster films, I'm a big fan, actually, and I think they often get totally unrealistic things as long as they are done in a fun way, but definitely not that. That's just an insult to smart viewers everywhere. What were they thinking when they made this movie ?????
