Although this film has a slow pace, almost like a dream, almost hypnotizing, and an interesting, though perhaps not entirely accurate, description of the criminal and personal investigation practices of the French rural police, I find it impossible to ultimately recommend. I think this movie is simply a setup piece to advance a person - the director, he presumes - disgust with heterosexuality. Of course, human sexuality in all its forms can have its revolting moments, without denying it! But choosing evil evenly at the expense of good, as this movie does every moment, suggests a distorted sensitivity at work. In short, if you like to see homo-eroticism disguised as compassion and the depiction of heterosexual sexual act and female form in a hideous and degrading light - then this movie is for you. I do not know and it was not.
