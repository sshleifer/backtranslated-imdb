Despite all its wonderful images, despite all its good intentions, this turns out to be another disgusting, one-sided, super glorified advertisement and self-promotion. <br /> <br /> The message is simple: "All the Japanese The fighting on Kokoda's track was sadistic and malicious, who liked to destroy the whole of the last Australian troop, cutting their throats before beheading them. takes the only flaw of "Gallipoli" (which the enemy is faceless, nameless and apparently inhumane), but can prove the contrary of Weir's masterpiece. Instead of giving us a perfect movie with a flaw, we have a mess horrible with a redeeming feature. <br /> <br /> Let's start with this: we are, without any comfortable accommodation for the characters, introduced to them. <br /> <br /> Apparently, very laid back, two-dimensional people with whom ever ... ALWAYS sympathize. We are kept so far apart that even when we relate so easily to the characters, they find a way to keep us away. That alone is a sickening feature, because it takes us away from the plot, helps the horrible rhythm to us leave a lasting impression, and makes it much easier to see the contrast between an overtly sentimental ending and an otherwise dull body. In other words, it drags us through a painful journey (not only for us, but apparently for them) and, as it should end, we are thrown into another eye-roller of a skirmish that ends faster than it began. Then to the still STILL uninformed: when it should end, it resumes, only to end when we expect more. S ***! It's just a confusing and agonizing rhythm! <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the ultimatum: this is to educate us about the events of Kokoda's track. It does not come close. He not only details a small and insignificant part of the campaign (sprinkling a bit of "friendship" on top, in an attempt to make it relevant), but manages to do the only thing a movie as important as it should be, Care. <br /> <br /> Honestly, my eyes were constantly glued to my watch all the time. The audience all around me, all proudly Australian, fighting as they arrived about how big the movie would be, moaned, moaned and whimpered in disappointment as each of the painful ninety-five minutes echoed (for a short time it looked like Apocalypse Now : the difference is that Apocalypse Now was a good movie and deserved the three hours he got) and reached the point where suicide could be an alternative if it were mandatory for this film to be seen. <br /> <br /> Although considering how much TV has advertised this junk, I would say it is mandatory, in a subliminal sense of the word. <br /> <br /> See if you like beautiful pictures. Although you do better watching The Constant Gardener or Gallipoli anyway, since they have a superior cinematography and REAL plots. <br /> <br /> General: *
