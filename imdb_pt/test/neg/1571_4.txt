The movie was disappointing. I saw on Broadway with Bernadette Peters and she was excellent. Perhaps, as she grows to the end of her musical career, her desperate condition puts her in the role she bears, reinvents and triumphs as herself. Bette's singing is always wrapped, always flat and without showing her skill as an actress. To be entertaining, this performance was dying for stronger leadership and a stronger cast, so the others were memorable in Bette's absence. Another criticism: she smiles directly at the camera every time she starts to sing! I know it's a musical theater, but please leave some sociale - Middler can not perform like Liza or Streisand on a retrospective tour - out of character and out of context.
