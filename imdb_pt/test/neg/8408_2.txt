The first movie is good for me, I liked it for the most part, but I thought it was nothing special. However, when compared to this mess, it looks much better. Why they felt the need to make the film is beyond me, but they should know that it could not match the performance of the first film when they could only have Ruth Gordon back to reprise her role. The story follows Rosemary's baby and other things, but in reality it's kind of a mess, it does not help that the movie is a television movie and the look of the television shines very well. It has a more comedic tone, which makes it very difficult if they really felt the need to make a sequel that should have made an R rated movie that had some nudity and gore in it. I'm sure it would still have been pretty bad, but at least it would have been more watchable and fun than this movie is not, although it tries to be funny. I saw this on Monstervision and Joe Bob had nothing really good to say about it in the intro and I did not have much to say either. I have to say it was a sequel that should never have seen the light of day.
