Honestly, I have to admit that I'm going to see some stupid movies based on the hype they've generated or are currently generating. This dumb resource of Salman Khan & Govinda is one of those stupid movies. Ok, now we've all seen 'Hitch', starring Will Smith as a dating doctor trying to help strange people find it true. So why do we need to see Salman Khan reenact this? There lies the question of the $ 64,000. If you're wondering, Govinda plays the eccentric in search of the love of his life (an unreachable socialite) performed by Katrina Kaif. <br /> <br /> Lara Dutta is about to play Sallu's Eva Mendes and Sallu's reality. Kaif's life love practically interprets his character as every role you see in her so far without stretching is not necessary to act. And for almost three and a half hours we are tortured with parodies of other Bollywood movies and characters, or better yet, we are treated to low performances from previous hit films. Rajpal Yadav co-stars. F
