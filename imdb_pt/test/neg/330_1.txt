Dude, this movie sucks. There seemed to be seven different plots happening at the same time and everyone made little or no sense. The special effects, fantasies, and all these things were beyond horrible. The acting was particularly bad. Everything seemed so forced, especially the woman's lines with huge eyes and the little boy (his "Noooooo" when he is buried is so unenthusiastic that it is laughable). A good part of this movie is pretty funny anyway. The death of a woman where she puts a knife into a toaster is electrocuted and magically becomes the cutest skeleton in the world. My friends and I laughed for a good ten minutes. <br /> <br /> If you like watching really horrible movies, look for this one. If not, run for your life.
