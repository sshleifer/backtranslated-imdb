Until around 1970, Lucille Ball was a great comedian. She was such a perfect clown that I just wanted more people to see Bob Hope in "The Facts of Life" because she could also do dry dry. as well as clowning. <br /> <br /> Yes, Lucille Ball was wonderful. . . until "Mame". Trying to see Lucille Ball in "Mame" is physically impossible because there is so much vaseline in the already filtered lenses that you need Windex to see Lucille Ball in some scenes. So even if you see Lucille Ball in "Mame", you can not really see Lucille Ball in "Mame". What a blessing. <br /> <br /> This is the best thing I can say about "Mame," the movie from the movie's musical part (this may continue, but it started with a funny book way called "Aunt Mame"). Giving this a bad rap is like hitting a sponge. Therefore, it does not matter if the song is sung rather than sung. Most of the songs were not much, anyway. There is no difference in the first three. "It's Today", "Open a New Window" and "We Need a Little Christmas" are the same song. Celene Dion should make an album with them, they are so big and bland. The murderous ballad "If It Got In My Life Today" needs a confident and beautiful voice (Edyie Gorme won a Grammy for doing it in 1967) that poor Lucille Ball did not have when she made this film. (It's true that Elaine Stritch can not play a song in a bucket either, but at least Stritch can play a song.) <br /> <br /> If you still feel your life will not be complete unless you see the musical movie "Mame", notice how there is dance in it, but whenever Lucy / Mame starts to do anything but a paralyzed shuffle, the camera cuts, returning when the number ends and the star poses with the dancers. Again, also good. Jane Connell was able to reprise the role of the pathetic Agnes Gooch after Lucille Ball made Madeline Kahn fired to ensure that no comic originality surpasses the star. Connell is a stage performer who, like Carol Channing and Ethyl Merman, can not reduce her performances to movies, so she joins Lucille Ball being embarrassed, albeit for different reasons. <br /> <br /> The luxurious dresses are by Theadora Van Runkle (Van Rugas?) and they provide the missing color in all but one of the cast. <br /> <br /> Bea Arthur as actress Vera Charles, Mame's best friend, ignores everyone and makes her own fun. If she was in more scenes. She's too old for her role too, but at least she does not mutilate it.
