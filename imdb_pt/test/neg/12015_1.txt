"Problem Child 2" was a complete waste of my time. The original movie was not very good, but it's a classic compared to this movie. The first film was exaggerated with his scenes of a diabolical child destroying the lives of everyone he is around. Here, it goes even further on. And a scene in this movie proves that theory. That sequence of the carnival ride was too much for me to stretch. It's awful. This movie should not have been made. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (of four)
