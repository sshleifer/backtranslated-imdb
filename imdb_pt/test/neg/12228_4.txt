It was only a matter of time that a parody would be made of sports movies! And there are many movies to watch that are fun. But the biggest problem I had was the fact that he gets the movie recognition. The director and writers of "The Comebacks" somehow forget to be creative. Although I must admit that I laughed at certain scenes, "The Comebacks" could have been a lot funnier. The actors forget to deliver their lines seriously and have a serious face throughout the film. A parody demands this and that's the main reason why silly jokes work in movies like this. Because of the cast's failure, the jokes never hit their mark. Some scenes last forever and usually in spoofs that need not be a problem. Take "Naked Gun" for example. Yours is always something happening on the screen. In "The Comebacks" they did not even bother to let things happen in the background. Only a few factors make this movie worth watching! It's still fun to identify the movies that are fun. And Jermaine Williams as Ipod. His parody about Cuba Gooding Jr. as Radio was hilarious! He seemed to be the only one in the cast to have an idea of ​​what a parody is. Not totally bad!
