Folks! is a "comedy" about a man whose parents implore him to kill them because they are getting senile and want to be exposed to their misery. Several times he tries to kill them and then changes his mind, saving them from their deadly traps at the last minute and losing one part of their body each time in the process. The film seems to hate its main character, which makes it even more painful to watch. There is also the usual love interest and predictable end. <br /> <br /> This movie was also the first time I saw Tom Selleck without a mustache, and I remember his scraped upper lip looking strange and making me feel a bit slippery. But that may have been just because of the terrible premise and the execution of the film.
