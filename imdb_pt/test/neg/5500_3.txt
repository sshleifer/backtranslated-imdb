this movie had a lot of potential - it's a great story and has the potential to be very scary. but of course Tim Burton does not make scary movies, he does wacky cartoon movies. and I usually like tim burton stuff. but I thought this movie was really weak. the best thing about the movie (and worth seeing it for just that) was the art direction - the film has an incredible intangible quality. the script was not good. it was annoying in parts and confusing elsewhere, and there was no character building. I never really cared that people were having their heads cut off by a headless being. I thought Johnny Depp had a good thing with his approach to the character, but since the script was weak he could not go very far with it - and I was very annoyed with the attempts of a slight accent from him and from Christina Ricci . parties. <br /> <br /> Anyway, unfortunately it's not a great movie and it's not worth seeing unless you're interested in art direction.
