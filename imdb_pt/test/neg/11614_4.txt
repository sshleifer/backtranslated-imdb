After an intriguing start, this little drama quickly falls into the ranks of pure mediocrity. The beginning of the film shows two women (Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner) meeting while they wait for their boyfriends to return home after their vacations. Natasha Gregson Wagner is an adorable actress and plays Louise; a beautiful girl whose beloved boyfriend is a whole artist; music, movies you name, it does. While she is telling the other girl, Carla (Heather Graham) all about her wonderful boyfriend, it soon becomes apparent that the similarities between her two male friends are too much ... and it is obvious that the two girls are dating the same guy . Oh gosh. Enter Robert Downey Jnr, the bag that has two girlfriends, while some poor guy somewhere has to go without one. Downey interprets the kind of face women like, but men find it repulsively annoying; he is basically a mummy boy. The worst kind too; on the phone touching her mother all the time, continually taking her girlfriends with ambitious (though empty) promises, etc. It's enough to make a normal guy sick. <br /> <br /> The film consciously rips off the love triangle of three-way top films like Jules and Jim. This movie does not work though; mainly due to the fact that the story is so unbelievable. Seriously, if two women had just found out they were dating the same guy ... they would not have a conversation out there to talk about it. Another reason why it falls is that it is so turgid. There is no end to possibilities for the outcome of the situation that this film presents, especially with the claustrophobia of putting everything in a small apartment; but all the film does is get lost in big dialogues; poorly written and poorly delivered dialogue, that is. The film is also excessively massive; it simply is not believable that people would act like they do in this movie after they find themselves in this situation. Robert Downey Jnr is one of the many things that are wasted in the movie. With Natural Born Killers, he proved that he could give brilliantly entertaining performances, and that's something this movie could do. The two females are not wasted because no one expected anything anyway, but Downey definitely could have been better used. In general? A waste of time. Do not bother, see Jules et Jim or Natural Born Killers. This is my advice.
