You know, after the first Chuck Norris movies, I managed to say that a film was produced by Golan-Globus, even though I was tuned in the middle, never looking at the credits or the title. What else I could say was Golan-Globus within a minute of time on the screen. Something about the structure of the story, the bizarre relationships between the characters, the polite dialogue, the acting of wood (inaccurate with the occasionally terrible performance), the stage times and rhythms that made Albert Pyun look like John McTiernan, the fine, is ready for fight choreography in prime time ... Golan-Globus has been incredibly consistent over the years in style, subject and point of view. <br /> <br /> What you can say, should work for them, since they have produced literally dozens of movies. You go to one of your productions and know exactly what you are getting. And it's not brain food, people. <br /> <br /> "Ninja 3" is another piece of work on a long line of products from the GG sausage factory, and offers the typical pleasures limited to moviegoers. palate You have a Bad Ninja, hacking off cops and criminals and anyone else that hinders you. You have a good ninja, you promised to stop him. You have a Westerner in the mix so that we Americans can identify with him (or in this case) and make sure that "we can still defeat these oriental irritants at their own game." You have a Love Interest (which is usually also the worst actor / movie) surrounding the Hero. You have your endless sequence of assaults, murders, and prolonged shots of men gurgling in agony while an arrow or throwing star is out of your eye, neck or chest unconvincingly. You have your Beefy White Guy / Bodyguards in Suits by calling a Ninja from 'Son of A B * tch' and punching the roundhouse, just to get his * ss delivered to him. You have a final confrontation between the good guy and the bad guy who lasts for 20 minutes and a half that stops like a RoadRunner cartoon instead of reaching a climax or a resolution. <br /> <br /> Ninja 3 is a bit different, as the plot revolves around a clumsy athletic type being possessed by Bad Ninja, so she ends up killing many cops and criminals and White Bodyguards and Bonuses in suits while under his spell. But all the other elements are there, as formal in form as a play on the Kabuki or a Noh drama. <br /> <br /> I really thought that Lucinda Dickey was very kind in this movie. She is very muscular and curvaceous, has big cheekbones and a little athletic movement for her movements, and you can really suspend the belief enough to accept that your character could do some of the feats she does in the movie. She can almost, but not quite, carry this thing. An extra start for your participation and good energy. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sho Kusugi is here, and he pretty much dominates the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. And just to show you how GG movies from 3rd and uninspired are, the director and editor intercalated the last fight between Kosugi and the Bad Ninja scene with countless photos of reaction from Dickey and his boyfriend watching the battle of life and death with an expression of slight confusion. I'm serious ... for all the excitement and reaction they show to the process, they could be looking at a sea turtle in an aquarium in Marineland. I can only imagine how Dickey must have felt when she saw the final product - she probably wanted to run the editor with a real katana, because those reaction photos make her look like a complete idiot. <br /> <br /> A pleasant waste of time ... but it is definitely a waste of time. Maybe if you're a fan of Sho Kusugi, or even a fan of Linda Dickey, you think it's worth it.
