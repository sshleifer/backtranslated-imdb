Man, this sucks. It does not deserve much comment, so to summarize, Rebecca DeMornay is a highly disciplined police psychiatrist who falls in love with Latin Banderas Antonio Banderas in a wine shop, horse-tail and jail-house tats. When she lets go, she really lets go. In addition to this torrid case she's having (and we must admit the case has her quick beats) she's a pretty cold fish. She broke, sick father shows up for the first time in years and she rides him out. She is also adept at keeping her upstairs horny neighbor (Dennis Miller) at bay. And there's the prisoner Harry Dean Stanton who's trying to get her to give him a multiple personality disorder diagnosis so he does not have his privileges stuck on the wall for the serial murders he's committed. <br /> <br /> All these people and maybe more are immediately suspicious when strange things start to happen to her. Someone sends dead flowers. Someone does nondescript things with your pet cat. (The next time I see a pet appear in a packet or stuffed in the cabinet or boiled in a pan, I'm going to vomit.) So, who's doing it? Think. No power on earth could force me to reveal the ending, but maybe a tip will help: childhood abuse. <br /> <br /> The excuse of abuse is an interesting business in itself, much more interesting than the film. What does "child abuse" mean? Do we mean sexual abuse? Physics? Both? How about hitting a child in the back with a wooden kitchen spoon, strong enough to break it? That's what happened to me and my brother when we were kids, just like things happened to all the other wandering boys in the neighborhood. Sexual abuse? This has never happened to any of us, as far as I know, though I'm not sure that I would have been rejected with some degree of encouragement. In the village of Samoa, which I studied for two years, there was one case of a teenager found sexually playing with a much younger girl. The girl's family beat him up. The boy's own family sent him to live with another branch of the family in another village, an exile that lasted two years. By the time he returned, the incident was forgotten by everyone, including the child. (By the way, the little girl we see here is less than five years old, so she's unlikely to remember Dad's nocturnal visits in any case, since long-term memory is not really established by then.) DeMornay's experience his mental disorder may be called the "social construction of trauma." It is not there unless we put it there. No more psychiatric talk. That will be fifteen cents. <br /> <br /> Do you want trauma? I'm going to give you trauma. The film forces us to identify with Rebecca DeMornay's character from the beginning. So when she has her first date with Antonio Banderas, and the soundtrack of Pio Donnagio is beating the eroticism in our heads, the camera shoots us over Antonio's shoulder naked and crawling over us with his hairy chest. Now this is traumatic. It makes any male viewer feel like he's on the floor of the California Men's Colony Laundry in San Luis Obispo. Do not misunderstand me. I do not like Antonio Banderas. It's just that I'm not in love with him. There are not enough nude photos of Rebecca DeMornay's elf body across the universe to make up for this kind of anxiety. <br /> <br /> Here's an interesting way to survive this movie. Instead of just sitting, try to choose the scenes that were filmed in Toronto and separate them from those filmed in Budapest. It is a challenge, indeed, and can, for all we know, preserve its sanity.
