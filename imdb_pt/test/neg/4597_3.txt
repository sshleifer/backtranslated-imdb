After Matt Dillon's phenomenal CRASH performance, most likely will rush to get a copy of FACTOTUM to see if Dillon is real or just have a good fortune for a great screenplay. <br /> <br /> Well, the Factotum certainly its moments, but the clarity of ... everything will probably divert the viewers. However, nothing should be taken from Dillon. His performance is wonderful and full of excellent humor, proving that he is a solid actor with significant skills; it's just a shame about the direction and script. <br /> <br /> The story is about Henry "Hank" Chinaski (Dillon) and his refusal to settle for anything that resembles normalcy. He resigns or is fired from jobs in a few minutes, only to find himself back in a dark bar, finding women even weaker while trying to write a non-conformist novel. We never really know what romance is all about, except it involves "everything" (cancer, movies, you, me). <br /> <br /> Jumping from the workplace to work and constantly returning to Jan (Lili Taylor, THE HAUNTING), a lost girlfriend who is as daunting as him, Hank tries in vain to find out what his life must have for him. If he ever learns what it is, it's for interpretation. Some may say that he never does, while others may argue that his life is simply a path to obscurity. <br /> <br /> Regardless, there is not much substance to Factotum even with the good performance of Matt Dillon. History snakes through Hank's life without much thought about where to take the audience. And this is a shame. Dillon's performance would have shone even brighter if he had a decent script.
