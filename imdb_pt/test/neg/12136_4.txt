Can someone please help me I missed the last moments of view and I do not want to pay the money to see the whole movie again. I got to where they are in the train carriage and she says, "What about that drink now?" and smiles. What happens after that? Is there more dialogue or action? Surely it does not end there? I was a little bored in the movie and kept hoping it would get better. I love Kristen Scott Thomas does anyone remember the UK TV series that she was talking about some nuns? I'm wondering the name. Sean Penn was brilliant Madonna devoured her heart! all others, in fact, the film is somewhat predictable, was a 'spot a cast of stars'. the end caught me by surprise I actually thought she had burned her boats ..... if you are a fan of any of the stars worth watching.
