Doug McClure has already performed on some of these genre adventures produced in Britain and this has to be the worst of them all. I KNOW THAT THE LAND THAT FORGOTTEN has its critics, but at least please, the movie had relatively good rental footage and production values. This is the problem with this movie - The production values ​​go far beyond "So bad that they are good" affectionate territory and become "so bad that I think I'll see what is in the other channels" <br /> < a case in point is the first scene with the intrepid Cushing and McClure encountering a monster. It is painfully obvious that the monster is a medium-sized man dressed like a rubber monster being made to look more than twenty feet tall through exaggerated rear projection. It becomes even more painfully obvious that our heroes are trying to escape the monster by running on time. Did I mention that this is one of the most convincing pieces? No, actually, it looks like it was filmed in someone's living room with the left over leftover DOCTOR's budget that year. Even the former DOCTOR WHO Peter Cushing is insipid and what should have been a funny phrase: "You can not hypnotize me - I'm British" is delivered in a very flat way (a very similar phrase is spoken by Cushing in HORROR EXPRESS). a script devoid of characterization, plotting and memorable dialogue. It is not only the fact that dialogue is unmemorable it is also rare and rare since the monsters do not speak. It would not have been better to have the main humanoid thugs as in WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS, so they could explain the plot. Does anyone here know what the plot really is? <br /> <br /> A very tedious British film that even the twin talents of Caroline Munro can not save. All the humor in the film is summed up in the final sequence with two main police officers
