There are certain horror directors for whom I have built so much respect and admiration over the years that they can not let me down, they know what rubbish they decide to put on film. Lucius Fulci is certainly one of them, but damn he is trying to disappoint me with his subsequent efforts! You can easily afford to skip most of the films directed or produced by Fulci during the late '80s and simply watch "Cat in the Brain" because that title gathers and repeats the best and most absolute scenes of no less than seven Fulci. -flicks, including the strings of sickest murders featuring in "When Alice Broke the Mirror." As a whole, this film is definitely among the weakest and pointless achievements of our director. The script is incoherent as hell, the basic premise is totally implausible and a bit stupid and there is absolutely no suspense to enjoy. I love the title, but it's actually pretty nonsense. There is a character named Alice in the story, but it's just a supporting role and she certainly does not break any mirror. I suppose she could break things simply by using her voice, as she is an opera singer, but she does not. The plot revolves around a middle-aged playboy and gambling addict who spends his days seducing rich widows and killing them for their money. Lester Parson slays the ladies (as well as unwanted witnesses) in horrifying ways, makes steaks of their juicier parts and feeds the remains to their cat. There is also a silly psychological plot in which he thinks his own shadow is responsible for the murders instead of him. The difference between "When Alice Broke the Mirror" and some of the greatest horror films of Fulci ("The Beyond", "City of the Living Dead", "") lies in the fact that he does not bother creating a horrible movie. The characters, including Lester, are colorless and boring and the killings are usually described as if it were the most common thing in the world to put a woman's head in a microwave or repeatedly run back and forth over a human body with a car . The lighting is bad, the super-ugly cinematography, the awkward and amateur editing and the acting performances are frankly miserable. If I did not know better, I would think Lucio deliberately made a bad movie to protest against all the harsh criticism. critics who do not like his repertoire no matter how much spirit and effort he put into it. The obvious element to take advantage of here is simply outrageous bloodshed and bloodshed because even the attempt to mix black comedy does not work properly. swings around her chainsaw and cuts off women's feet, "When Alice Broke the Mirror" is a less demanding piece of horror entertainment, but besides, there is not much to recommend.
