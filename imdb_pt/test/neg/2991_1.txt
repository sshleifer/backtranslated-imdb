Do not get me wrong: I like art films, low budget movies, character studies and foreign films. Unfortunately, I could not take advantage of this - glacial pace, complete lack of plot and characters that you may not loathe enough to hate, but you can not tolerate enough to like it. <br /> <br /> Distant was like watching a reality show shoot - all the scenes considered too uninteresting, which would not normally make the final cut, were the only scenes included. A camera in my apartment with two of my friends strolling for hours does not make an interesting movie. <br /> <br /> Distant certainly makes the observer feel this way - long stretches of dialogue (almost 10 minutes before the first word is spoken from the credits) can be made to work (2001 comes to mind), but for me, something more convincing has to happen to attract me. <br /> <br /> If you're the kind of observer who can sit through a movie and settle for movie review, it might work for you. However, if you are someone who chooses to watch movies to relax, expand your mind or have fun, you should probably look elsewhere.
