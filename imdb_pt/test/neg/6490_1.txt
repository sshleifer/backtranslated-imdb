Charlie (George "Norm" Wendt) and Rhonda ("Just Say", Julie Brown) are a couple of merry and deadly aliens who get stuck on Earth and face a tiny western town. They become deputy sheriffs and distribute a lethal form of justice to speeders, assassins and others, while on the bad side of some of the sites (led by Wayne Grace). Meanwhile, her sexy alien daughter (Anastasia Sakelaris) arrives in a small, shiny outfit with her black human husband (Christopher M. Brown) to meet them, and TV reporters and government agents appear to fill the time. From what I can tell, this is a deliberate attempt to cover all possible genres (comedy, science fiction, horror, western ...) in a movie, and what an idiotic and bland mess, despite the fact that energetic performance of the two stars. The script is frankly atrocious.
