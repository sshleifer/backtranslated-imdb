This film is an example of small budget, ineffective star cast, weak plot and bad entertainment. This type of film is made for commercial breaks and not for any entertainment of die-hard Bollywood movie fans. I went to this movie because I thought the first gangster was tolerable, so this is too. The only thing I appreciate is how the new actress puts herself in the film in a very daring way, she looks a lot like the nandita's bollywood actress. she is good, sexy and acting well. she definitely goes in her career. Our mithunda was all good time at his work. At least he has some good for the movie. I did not like Imraan for his role should advise him to improve himself now as he has made many films as a new actor and he has been seen as established actor This movie has nothing except the bold scene made by the new actress Never try this movie
