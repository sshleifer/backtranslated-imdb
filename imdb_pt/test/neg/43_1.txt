I was completely bored with this movie, melodramatic for no apparent reason. Everything becomes so serious and people are cursing with really idiot expressions. Then there's a serial killer who apparently can kill a person to get the title of serial killer. Well, the serial killer likes butterflies and is illustrated by sound effects that you can hear in the dream sequence of most modern movies; <br /> <br /> Why, why? I have no idea. It really wants to be scary, but I think in this scary universe it's the same as talking a lot and adding dark ambient noises. Just for the record, this is by no means a horror movie, it's definitely a thriller. Really filmmakers nowadays need to do their homework before making horror movies or at least call it a "horror" movie. it makes me say (in words also ironically) "acolytes, it takes you an eternity to say nothing".
