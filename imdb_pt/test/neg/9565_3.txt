I rented it thinking that it would be great only for the cover of the movie. Judge and Jury began a good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a motorcycle with a cool gun, but that movie got progressively stupider as it went on. David Keith is an incredible actor, especially when he plays a role like that, the movie was crap that really wasted his talent. Judge and Jury was very dumb I gave a 3 should have given a 2, I gave him an extra star just because David Keith's weapon was legal.
