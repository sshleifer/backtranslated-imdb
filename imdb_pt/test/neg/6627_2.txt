Or at least forced retirement! This movie is horrible, horrible, terrible, rotten, rotten ... well, you get it. DO NOT under any circumstances watch this decomposing piece of garbage unless you have a death wish, because it is certain that it will kill you. (I just survived because I lost the first half hour.) Carrot Top is a bad comedian and an even worse actor. I can not believe he has someone to fund this huge waste of time and money. This only serves to show that some people are unscrupulous if they think they can make a buck or two (literally ... I can not imagine that this made more than $ 2!). <br /> <br /> And someone, please. tell me what possible motivation Courtney Thorne Smith (a decent actress, certainly above that) had to sign that stack of steaming dung. Was she bored during that 3.5-second period between Melrose Place and Ally McBeal? Or does she owe some kind of karmic debt to the Most Irritated Person on the Face of the Planet (also known as Superior Carrot)? <br /> <br /> I give her a 2/10, and that's probably too loud. I try to save my '1's for movies that make me vomit, and since I have not seen all of it my stomach content has happily stayed contained. I do not think I'll be watching again to find out if it's really worth 1!
