Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the last 10 years. The script for James 'Jimmy' Trivette, Walker's partner, is as pathetically written as Wesley Crusher on Star Trek TNG, and is touched with such conviction. <br /> <br /> In this program, people do not respond to how people react to things in real life - everyone is polarized - everyone is a completely good guy or a completely bad guy (unless Walker himself has a 2 minute conversation with them and they change instantly). This is not how life works, that's not how people are. This show does not happen in this reality. Plot lines are as realistic as Murder She Wrote, a show in which an arrogant old woman can simply enter people's homes without her getting angry, and she can demand that the cops do what they want. she wants them to bow to her. With Walker, everyone on the show, including the "bad guys," act like he's the kind of hero myths and fairy tales are made of, and time itself bends to their whim. The lines that sometimes come out of people's mouths at this show are beyond ridiculous. It's as if Wesley Crusher's screenwriter (for "serious" parties) and Bob Saget's funniest home-writers (for the humorous parts) got together and wrote all the scripts for that show. <BR> This show is for people who think that good always prevails over evil. It's for the elderly. It is for desirous thinkers. It's for people who always want to have a happy ending. It's for people who want to get away from oblivion. It is for people whose drug of choice is television. <br /> <br /> I shrink every time I see even a commercial for this program. My opinion is that it's the worst television show in the last 10 years. I used to like Chuck Norris, but this show always tainted him in my mind. I can not even watch your old movies without thinking about this show.
