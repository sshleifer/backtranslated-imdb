This is one of the most ridiculous westerns Hollywood has ever done. Gary Cooper plays "Reb Hollister," a former Confederate officer wanted by law. He meets an idiot named Weatherby, played by Leif Erickson, who is an American marshal with no knowledge of firearms. Weatherby is on his way to Dallas to see his fiancee, Tonia Robles, played by Ruth Roman. Mr. Robles, Tonia's father, has many men, but it seems he can not watch over his cattle, which are regularly whistled by the Marlow brothers. Will Marlow, played by Raymond Massey, financed the loan at Robles Estate, making things completely absurd. He still has the power to ask for mortgage payments before maturity simply because he feels that way. Since Weatherby is a Boston boy he can not fight, since he only became a marshal so he could visit his fiancee, Tonia, (just one more example of more meaningless plot. that you just have to go through a written test to get this job? Wait a minute, this guy could not pass the written test as well.He changes identity with Reb Hollister, who is obviously an experienced gunslinger.Reb takes the liberty to greet the Weatherby girl with a passionate kiss, while Weatherby looks like an idiot.Golf Cooper, Hollywood's number one stallion, is in good shape here as Reb. Before the movie is over, he not only catches Weatherby's work, he steals the bride too, and Ruth Roman as Tonia, falls so much in love with him and so fast that she gives the newcomer Leif Erickson the brush before the movies just over half. There is not a bit of credibility in the plot throughout the film, so , despite the bo m cast and lush photography, the film is a failure. And Cooper's character is a complete jump to boot. The film also stars Barbara Payton as the girl of Brant Marlow, a beautiful and talented actress who has wasted her chances, sadly, making many headlines for the wrong reasons. I strongly suggest that you go through this.
