*** SOFT SPOILERS *** Dear Inman, Kind words are hard to find to describe the movie I just received. The problems are long and painful for me to tell. . . I still feel I owe, just to keep others from suffering the same anguish as I do. This is not a movie for anyone under 50, it's sloooowwwww, soooooo slowwww, and when the big meeting of Ada and Inman happens. . The biggest and most important scene in the movie, NOTHING happens, is an epic disappointment. Now, as the director should have done, I will keep my words short and end with this warning, his film is disjointed, boring, has no flow and Jude Law is tragically mis-cast, he showed more emotion as a robot in AI - Be warned, the movie must be renamed. . . Mountain Bored. My love, Ada.
