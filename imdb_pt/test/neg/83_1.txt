Now I understand that it took two months to shoot. Same? I'm sure my team could do it in less than a week. This movie was so bad that I could not even pay much attention. Just another proof that women boobas can not always save you from horrible writing, acting and direction. Now I understand that it was a no-budget effort, but there is also no continuity and no real reason not to turn it off and watch infomercials or foreign news in a language you do not understand. Oh, there are some decent females that show the goods. Still, there are not enough sexy women to justify showing this farce in the film industry. One of the longest 80 minutes of my life. I tropked away with the help of my old friend Jim Beam. Do yourself a favor and prepare your weapon because you may want to use it after that job. Lastly, the guy (idiot) who left a comment before my thought this was a great movie and loved it. Just another proof that the brothers should not create. Oh, burn it !!! - Captain J
