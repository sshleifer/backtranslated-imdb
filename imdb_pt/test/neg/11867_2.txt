Meh, Sum all for me really. BAD history, insipid dialogue, monotonous action scenes (HOW do you do something like a fight or a boring shooting? Do you really have to TRY to do this?), No real characters, etc. Snipes is a talented actor and physical performer, but none of this has surfaced in ANY of his work on DTV, when there is an opportunity to give the public a far more superior product than it used to be. Imagine a decent script with some solid characters you care about and some explosive action, fights, shootings, etc. How can it be so difficult to deal with? My personal opinion is that the main actors in the productions simply do not care. There is no evidence of enthusiasm for what they are doing. Look at Snipes in the first 2 Blades, Passenger 57, Rising Sun, New City of Jack, Demolition Man etc? Impressive, intense performances complemented by decent scripts (if not always outstanding), good supporting castings and evil deeds. <br /> <br /> None of this is evident in any of these releases so far, which is a tremendous shame. Distributors stamp Wesley's face on the cover, knowing the audience will have fun with them, as they have not yet realized they have not seen him in theaters for nearly two years. <br /> <br /> I would love to see Snipes work with someone like Isaac Florentine who really knows how to get the most out of a DTV production, and work with Alpha Stunts, who are simply some of the best action guys out there. Together, everyone would make an incredible team and a Snipes action vehicle that we would all be proud to see. <br /> <br /> Detonator sucks. Not as bad as The Marksman, who chews, but still sucks.
