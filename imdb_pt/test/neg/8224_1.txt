OK, so I have to start this review saying that I was really hoping to see this movie for months, I used to watch their trailer and I think it looked pretty cool .... bit I knew the only cool thing about this cliche- O trailer was precisely his trailer. <br /> <br /> In the movies, I watched the first 3 pictures of this movie, and yet for myself "no way this movie is so bad, do not be an idiot, give it a try! you only saw 3 minutes "while I rolled my eyes in shame. All these pictures showed .... take this .... a guy with a poker face (because he feels nothing ... that's deep) looking directly at the camera in the middle of the picture. In the second or third, he stays awake in his perfectly made bed (because he sleeps like a dead guy ... because he feels nothing), and his father calls, and says "John Garden State, it's me, his father." ... Oh come on! I saw a bit more than a couple flicks to hate clichés like the "I'm your parent," how the hell should I react ?: "Oh, he has a difficult relationship with him" .... uh .... yeah, it's exactly how I should react .... <br /> <br /> Man, this is a low quality movie ... <br /> <br /> Anywho, as the movie continues , we learn things about his friends, of which everyone is an alternative movie. For example, one of his acquaintances is a guy who works in a medieval-themed restaurant that speaks Klingon (bizarre characters + pop culture = his standard American indie movie). Then we meet the character of Natalie Portman, who is a copy of Alissa Jones (from a movie that kicks GS butt, Chasing Amy), Amelie and that girl from Eternal Sunshine ... you know, clever, original (not really ), cultured, beautiful and ... in touch with their sexuality (!). She listens to a band from the '70s called The Shins and gives ... what? Are they from this damn decade? So why do they sound like that? Oh, they have no personality, OK ..... so she delivers her CD player to John Garden State and he looks at her with a dumb face (you know, love). As the music played, I heard your lyrics saying "you're going to love this soundtrack, it's so cool and cool, you're going to love this movie, it's going to define you and your generation even if it's an ideological photocopy of The Breakfast Club, Ghost World, and all the other teenage smart movies of the last 20 years, you're going to drink coffee and read books that you do not understand "... So far, not really original sh! T begins to happen. ... he does not care if he dies in a plane crash (because he's already dead ... and he feels nothing) and he lets us know in a scene idea taken directly from an unfamiliar movie called FIGHT CLUB! !!, it's a cool scene but, oh, did I mention it appeared in the trailer? ....... then at some party, and only when you think this guy is really deep and asexual he gets a bimbo .... then oh, he's not such an emotional zombie after all ... intelligent character development or just a sh! tty ...... well let's look at this scene, present it sitting motionless on a cou ch with everyone moving at very fast speed ...... idea of ​​the scene taken straight from an unknown movie called REQUIEM FROM A DREAM! ...... then just a movie sh! tty, sh! tty ... Then they find more eccentric characters (cliché, actually) and finally one who lives next to a big hole in the ground. John Garden State says some crap like "good luck exploring his infinite abyss" and the guy says ... and now I wanted to choke, "You too" ............. .and then we they say Neo is Jesus ... oh no, wait, that's another stupid, obvious, repetitive, overrated, and cliché of crap. <br /> <br /> Finally (finally !!!), some more crap happens and he enters the great showdown of the warehouse to neutralize the bombs: he has to talk to his father that he has not seen in the last zillions of years because he (FINALLY COOL SPOILERS) killed his own mother. .. (you see, he killed his mother, then he too is dead ....... and does not feel anything ... this is deep). Now I really expected only clever and moving Magnolia-like dialogue between a father and a son ...... but that's Garden State, so that's pretty much it: -John Garden State: Dad, I forgive you, you didn I do not know what you were doing when you drugged me for a zillion years, but I know you love me - the cute director's father: no! Not!!!! I'll say a few simple things because I'm not really that deep of a character anyway, like this whole movie, then no! -John Garden State: No father, we should get along because we are equal individuals ..... I mean different people - the director's father: No! Not !!!! ............ OK, you convinced me. <br /> <br /> And he gets the girl (because he's not dead anymore, you know) and the movie ends and I go and like a piece of chicken that makes my day .... <br /> This movie made for the trailer sucks.
