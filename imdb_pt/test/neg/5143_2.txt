The plot of the film seems to have been constructed from a disjointed dream. There is not enough realism to keep the viewer interested. The Vermont Farm scene was a failed opportunity to show how the farms were set up and the farm families lived, which would have been interesting and fun. There was little or no research on the whiskey smuggling trade of the period. The Canadian outfit looked like something of the French Revolution, totally unbelievable. The violin was fine and over the period of time, but Chris's movements, while supposedly playing, were unbelievable. The owl's appearance was a mystery never explained and the train disappearing into the air was too much. I could not understand how a live trout was frozen in the ice and why two men in the desert without food would release the trout, a good source of food.
