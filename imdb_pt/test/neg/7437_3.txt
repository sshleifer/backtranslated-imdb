That was good, but really a bit disappointing, because I expected more laughter. Considering the plot and the lead actor (Bill Murray), it should have been a lot funnier than it ended up being. Only a part of it made me laugh, as when Murray lost control of his semi and was accelerating on the road at an odd angle. (You have to see, to enjoy it.) The support cast was everything but kind people. Just look at a sample of the names: Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yes! McConaughey's role here as "Tip Tucker" was simply annoying. He was the worst. <br /> <br /> Other than these people, the movie had some lovely moments, but overall not recommended. It is another failure of Disney.
