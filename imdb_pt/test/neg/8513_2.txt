In my opinion, this movie is not good. I hardly find a good thing to say about it, but I'd still like to explain before concluding that it's just another bad movie. <br /> <br /> I decided to watch it because Costas Mandylor is starring, and that was the main reason I watched until the end. I like action movies and I understand that these films are based on action and not on history. I know they do not go into detail when it comes to the credibility of history and events, but even that does not explain why some scenes, simply because they lack the sense of reality, seem ridiculous. In the beginning, the film looks quite promising: a strong and handsome expert and his not-so-tough but smart and funny partner should do a job, which turns out to be a bit different than expected. The story takes place on a cruise ship. A disaster happens, the ship is delivered and only a few are left alive. During their fight to survive, they have to escape a shark, a professional killer and the rising water. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film is quite violent. The main weapon (next to the disaster that has already destroyed most of the passengers) is the weapon, which is used successfully in many cases. I personally missed a good man for man (or woman for woman, if you prefer) to fight. Family fun? I do not think like that. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think this movie was shot in a hurry, without a real vision of what it's trying to say. Made from the usual tricks of the action movie, with a little something called love, and without a real meaning, it only results in a bad movie.
