Even though this was set to be a showcase for some kickboxing and swordplay, "Vampires: The Turning" (VTT) could have sucked in addition to that. Because it does not even claim to be a good vampire movie, the VTT fails to give any blow it may have tried. <br /> <br /> Using the idea of ​​an 800-year-old Thai vampire was interesting, but the progeny story that she mistakenly brought into existence (and now must end) really reminds me of Gizmo and his situation in "Gremlins" , and that's not a good thing when it comes to a vampire movie. Stephanie Chao is attractive and serves as the "good" vampire very well, but her lack of accent is annoying when you realize she is an 800 year old vamp. Added to this, when she tells Connor he is "a young soul," she does not deliver the line with much of the weight you would expect from an "old" soul. Attractive, but not believable. Meredith Monroe was more believable in her role, but for a Dawson's Creek student, you'd think she'd have more time on the screen. The question of whether Amanda succumbs and "turns" is the most compelling reason to keep watching this movie, and you never understand it. You start teasing him, but you never really get any kind of character development for that plot device. It's an inexpensive way to touch your audience, folks. <br /> <br /> If you want something that is a good vampire movie, go find Lugosi's Dracula, and if you want a sexy vampire movie, you have dozens of Hammer Moves with far more strength than This one. In the end, whether you want good or sexy, this is not the place. This is just forgettable.
