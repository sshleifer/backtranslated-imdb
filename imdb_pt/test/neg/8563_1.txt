I can not believe they even released such a movie. The only good acting came from the water in the movie. This has to be one of the worst (if not the worst) movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only scary part of the movie is the bad acting, I'm giving this movie to me, this movie deserves a 0. <br /> <br /> The plot, and if you can call the movie plot, seems to have been written by a high school kid. Ofcaurse you have to wonder if he could have been better with better actors in it. Do yourself a favor, expect it to appear on TV. <br /> <br /> And even so, watching, it will be a little time.
