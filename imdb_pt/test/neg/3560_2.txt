I saw this movie with the strength of the only positive review and I can only imagine that this guy is a shill. <br /> <br /> The acting female protagonist is actually very good, but the whole movie is so painfully annoying, I could barely stand to sit. This is the very definition of stupidity. <br /> <br /> So far, this movie is rated 8 out of 10 on 7 votes. That should mean the director, the director's girlfriend, the producer, the actress and the drinking buddies gave their own movie to 10. <br /> <br /> For the rest of you who simply want to have fun or enjoy a good story, avoid This man on the street should give a 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> FDA Note: While this film can be used as a helper to get a good night's sleep, no medicinal value is implicit or offered.
