This was intolerable. (SPOILER # 1) The protagonists avoid the senseless revelation of agonizing truths for their loved ones, so that they do not renounce the status and take on the role of Antagonists. (SPOILER # 2) Writers want us to believe that the transgressor's exposure of multiple transgressions poses a threat and triggers a retaliatory response from the main victim of the transgressions. (SPOILER # 3) Until the last 15 minutes, I was anticipating a score of 6 to 8 out of 10; instead, it was like discovering Lieutenant Columbo's dog is the real killer. The story was simply not credible, and I do not think the best director in the world could have saved without massive editing.
