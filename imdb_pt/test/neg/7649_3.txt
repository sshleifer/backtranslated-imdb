I did not really consider myself a conservative, so I was not personally offended by this film, but it was clear that the plot and characterization of this film were secondary to the message. And the message is that all conservatives are evil or stupid (or both). The characters are one-dimensional - good, freedom-loving Americans, or brainless, greedy, and evil conservatives. There is nothing clever or creative, just anti-conservative. I really do not care about political prejudice itself, but it should not be the only purpose behind the movie. And clearly it is. On the plus side, the cast is wonderful and the impression of Chris Cooper on W is funny the first two or three times, but after that it's just the same old joke that is told and so if you really hates the conservatives, you'll probably like this movie, but if you're looking for something with realistic characters and a less black-and-white story then you'd better watch the other thing.
