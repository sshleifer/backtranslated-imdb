This story begins at the end! So the film's opening credits advise us. Unfortunately this is not true since we are treated with about 70 minutes of a typical science fiction B movie from the 1950s. The story is sad; the plot is very weak and was clearly filmed on a low budget, as was often the case in those days. <br /> <br /> History could have covered any situation where people are taking shelter in an isolated house and being threatened by someone from outside. It has just been adapted to fit a science fiction story. <br /> <br /> The scenery consisted of some stones, shrubs and smoke. "Oh, yes, there was a pool of water, too. Someone wore a rubber mask with a beak like face and what looked like feathers. <br /> <br /> Written by Lou Rusoff, who wrote several science fiction stories at this time, including The She Creature and It Conquered The World. was completed in a matter of days, not allowing the actors to have time to develop their characters for better use. Low budget constraints also prevented this movie from reaching its potential. It could have been a much better movie than it turned out to be. <br /> <br /> Mike Connors and Richard Denning brought some life to the film, but even they could not get this movie to the category where you could say - 'I liked this movie'. Richard Denning's acting career began in 1937. He starred with Gregory Peck and Deborah Kerr in An Affair to Remember and later became best known on television in the Hawaii Five-O series and The Flying Doctor. Directed by Roger Corman, who has many films to his credit, both as director and producer. He made some good movies and he's still doing it. He became well known for his film directing of the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, often starring Vincent Price. He also made other low budget movies; some were good and fun for one reason or another, and most were much better than that. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone. <br /> <br /> Darnmay <br /> September 10, 2007
