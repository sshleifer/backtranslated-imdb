Martin Lawrence could be considered a talented man, but those days are gone. Runteldat shows a man who at the same time tries to play the sympathy card in his situation, but takes responsibility for it whenever he thinks it will benefit his ego. The sad truth is that at this point in his life, his best days were behind him: his half-funny show was dead in the water after his co-star departed and to this day he faces a dubbing career and horrible action movies. <br /> <br /> One gets the impression that this film was not meant to give Lawrence's career a fresh boost after his humiliation but rather a childish attempt to wipe the air for both trying to pathetically safeguard what was left of your life. and somehow distort him into something to be proud of, some decisive moment in which he turned out to have "conquered" his fame. Unfortunately, the show is no more than a husky voice Martin trying incoherently to be funny, invoking pathos, and then claiming that he does not care about this because hardcore. The sad truth is that this is the real public embarrassment for Lawrence: the way he wanders in invoking a sad pity laugh makes you wish he just stripped in his underwear on stage, waved a gun and just relived it all over again . There is no real perception of its performance. Much like the children's title, Martin is trying to make his last moment of truth his own and fail miserably. He would have been better off waiting for E! True Hollywood Story instead of running on a stage and making a fool out of it for the second time. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the saddest thing about this concert film - or rather, career praise - is that Martin did not put any thought into it. What would this movie supposedly prove? Unfortunately, his fame was fleeting, it was a flash in the pan before the underwear incident, and now that the only way to get work is by hitchhiking on Will Smith or a Pixar production. They could also call this 'Tombstone' concert because that's what it is. Martin Lawrence dies on stage here and with that, what could have been an interesting career. Now? Just a pathetic side note in the story.
