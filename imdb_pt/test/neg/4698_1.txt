I liked Half-Life. I'm still a fan. It was scary, clever and challenging. I do not tell any news is one of the best FPS ever made. Maybe I am a very hardcore fan of Half-Life, but the so-called Half-Life 2 is not Half-Life 2. <br /> <br /> And I have a question: is this the next chapter of Half-Life? Maybe the creators - Valve - think so, but I do not know. Where are the clever foes? Where's the scary atmosphere? Nowhere. I believe they wanted to do a little different from Half-Life (rather than another research station story), but they did not do a different one, they did something that has to do with Half-Life, such as Quake makes for Doom. The whole game is so unpleasant and unreal that it is almost helpless. <br /> <br /> Although physics is really great and has some good levels to play, the idea of ​​making revolutionary physics-based gameplay has completely failed. When you take the Weapon-Gravity, which can move objects, you can expect with rights to use it as a weapon - that would turn the schematic gameplay of the FPS upside down. The truth is you can not use the weapon of gravity as a real weapon. Because? Because the best you can do is play boxes and barrels that do not cause much damage. If you want to keep an object in front of you to protect it, you can drop from about 3 shots. If you want to cast a barrel exploding to your enemy, it can explode in your own "hand". The gravity weapon does not work like a weapon. The best use is to solve some physical puzzles. I ask Valve: Why? The truth is that you should use your schematic and boring FPS weapons to the end (except for the last level). Guns are not what made the original Half-life a classic. If the gravity weapon were always like the last level - a real weapon - I'd admire what Valve did. But not that. This is disappointing. <br /> <br /> So if you want Half-Life, then you're looking in the wrong place. Maybe you like it, but I repeat: that's all but Half-Life and not even a faithful continuation of it. This is the biggest disappointment of all time. Valve has shown that it can also make terrible games. They did it.
