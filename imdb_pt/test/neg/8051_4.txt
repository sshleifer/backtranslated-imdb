Kindred opens up for photos of a Porsche running along a highway, he reaches an old pickup truck and gets stuck. As he speeds up the game, the driver (Benjamin J. Perry, Ben Perry) shouts obscenities and horn. Distracted, he does not notice an obstruction at the front and locks his Porsche. He is quickly released from the wreckage and taken to the hospital. On the way, the Paramedic (Randy Harrington) trying to save him suggests that he probably will not. Then the Ambulance is attacked and forced off the road by a van. The driver of the van, Jackson (Jim Boeke as James F.Boeke) beats the paramedic and steals the patient. The ambulance driver, Harry (Charles Grueber) makes no attempt to stop him. Once the injured man was placed in the van Jackson turns his attention to Harry, who seems to know himself. Harry asks Jackson not to hit him because he broke his jaw "last time". Jackson smashes Harry on the ground and throws a lot of money at him. The film then makes it perfectly clear that we are in San Francisco, showing a photo of the Golden Gate Bridge. Sharon Raymond is awoken by a call from her boyfriend Dr. John Hollins (David Allen Brooks) to inform him that his mother, Amanda (Kim Hunter), who recently had a heart attack, regained consciousness. Hollins works for a company called 'Geneticell Corporation' and is delighted with the news and heads to see her. Once there, she asks him to go back to his old childhood home in a small town called Shelter Cove and destroy all his notes and experiments, especially the "Anthony Diaries" of which Hollins has never heard, she also claims that he has a brother. called Anthony. Back in Geneticell, Hollins talks to Dr. Phillip Lloyd (Rod Steiger) about his mother, since they both worked together before they disagreed with each other, and questions him about their research and whether he knows someone named Anthony. He claims he does not know anything. When Amanda dies after a visit from the sinister Dr. Lloyd, Hollins decides to carry out her request for Mothers and try to find out who Anthony is. While giving her last greetings at the funeral, a woman named Melissa Leftridge (Amanda Pays) introduces herself to Hollins and says she was a big fan of her mother's work and research after helping her. Because Melissa seems to know a lot about her mother's work, he invites her to the house as she may be able to help find some answers to several questions he has. Hollins, Sharon, Melissa and three lab assistants, Brad Baxter (Peter Frechette), Hart Phillips (Timothy Gibbs) and Cindy Russell (Julia Montgomery) plus a girl with a watermelon (!) Called Nell Valentine (Bunki Z, parents thinking!?). They immediately start working, but find little interest. For some reason, no one at the moment thinks about looking in the basement, which is as good as there is something down there, something big, slimy and with many tentacles. First kill Duke, the dog. Then it moves to a larger prey. When Hart is attacked by something in a barn, Hollins decides that he must destroy all traces of his mother's work and whatever Anthony is. Co-written jointly and directed by Stepehn Carpenter and Jeffery Obrow, Carpenter also served as director of photography and Obrow as a producer. This is a very poor movie in my opinion. The script is credited to five (!) Writers, Carpenter, Obrow, Earl Ghaffari, John Penny and Joseph Stefano and with five people working on it I would like to think that they could come up with something a little better and more coherent than that. Nothing is explained so well, why did Amanda create these monstrous marine hybrid human beings? What is the interest of Dr. Lloyd and his motives? Why does he steal bodies from Ambulance's back? Why does he have a basement full of mutants? Why do not any of these so-called genetic scientists think of checking the basement? Could Melissa act even more suspiciously, even if she tried? Why do not any of the characters get any background? Why do people keep mentioning a substance found in sea creatures called Hemoclinein when 99.9% of the audience will not have a clue what's going on? There is also a serious lack of blood and blood, only one person dies on the screen, only one! And all scientists survive on an inductively vomiting "happy ending." This is a personal horror movie, all we want to see is that slimy monsters kill and eat people in various bloody ways. Death on the screen is actually pretty cool, someone has slimy tentacles inserted under the skin, in the ear and even the nose in the movies just decent horror sequence. To try to improve the bloody speech there is a scene in which Dr. Lloyd is experimenting with a skinless animal, but lasts only a few seconds, and in the context of the rest of the film means nothing. Melissa also turns into a fish, do not ask. There is no nudity too, which is not a surprise. The film looks professional enough with decent production figures but is so monotonous and shaking at a snail pace, we did not even get to see the giant monster in the basement until 15 minutes before the end, which is too little too late, when it makes an appearance, the effects are acceptable and this makes it even more of a pity that it has not been used anymore. Overall, I was very disappointed and I was expecting much better. A horror movie with only one death on the screen and only three in total, how is the world?
