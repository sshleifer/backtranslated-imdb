Brooke Shields - in a departure from her duties as "Susan Suddenly" - plays a bitter divorcee involving three girlfriends on a "girls only" weekend in Palm Springs. The problem: Brooke is "detached" and lurking while all her friends are involved. Hence the implications of the title and the emotional repercussion that his "amoral" weekend causes. <br /> <br /> Despite a few laughs generated by Dan Cortese ("Victoria's Closet") and MTV "relationship authorities" Adam Corolla and Dr. Drew Pinsky, this is a somber thing only for women. D.B. Sweeney, Virginia Madsen and Jon Polito co-star.
