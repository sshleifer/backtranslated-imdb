Honestly, I really did not have high expectations for this movie, but at the same time I was hopeful. Being directed by Albert Pyun - one of the best-known b movie authors - did not exactly raise my hopes. I mean how many Albert Pyun movies look so good? Yes, exactly ... but the movie was still announcing a decent cast. Rob Lowe, Burt Reynolds (pre-born stardom), Ice-T and Mario Van Peebles. <br /> <br /> All this amounts to squatting, since the film is so annoying and moves so slowly that the energy seems to drain out of me the longer it lasted. It lasts 90 minutes, but tells a story that could have been told in 30 minutes. I do not know what Pyun was going here. I mean, the movie drips artistic style, but sometimes it's a blur and maybe I'm an idiot for expecting more from Pyun this time around. Here he seemed to really have a budget and a potentially large cast for the material, but it's all lost. Crazy Six is ​​not much of an action movie, it's not much of anything really. <br /> <br /> I think the saddest thing here is the fact that I found the final credits to be the most entertaining part of the movie. The score is actually kind of decent with some soft female vocals as well, but the rest is a complete waste and the less the better. Avoid.
