I have to start by saying that I love watching bad movies that are fun. This movie offers 100%. It's by far the worst movie I've ever seen. It is full of stock of random material in a city (people walking, traffic, skyline, etc.) that does not attach to anything. Then there are the sex scenes that are too long. These involve many caresses and frequent friction of socks on the bodies of one another. These are not at all erotic and are the closest thing to the horror you'll find in this movie. This is especially true for the shower scene, where two of the so-called 'cool' girls, who could not be over 40, are spraying each other with blood, but there is also a crew member squirting blood from outside , while one of the girls continues to smile at him. No one had to memorize any line for this movie if they are not clearly reading the cards, so they have a magazine in front of them that they watch as they struggle through awkward dialogues. Then there's Mr. Creepo. He plays the name of Ed Wood as if he could somehow compare, but he is far from anything of that quality. He walks around a graveyard chattering about random things that went wrong in the movie, which really helps the complete lack of flow that the movie was already underway. We could not stop laughing during this movie (except during the sex scenes where we were dissatisfied and occasionally horrified) <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 1/10 for going so far above and beyond all my expectations for a horrible movie.
