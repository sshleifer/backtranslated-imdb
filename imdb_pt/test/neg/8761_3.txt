"Revenge of the Zombies" is a zombie effort very weak and hardly passable. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Traveling on Bayou, Larry Adams, (Robert Lowery) and Scott Warrington, (Mauritz Hugo) are told that a friend has died. Meeting with local Dr. Von Altermann, (John Carradine) he repeats the notion that they have mysteriously died. While they stay there, they realize that the help consists of zombies, reanimate dead people who are doing their master's bid. As the bodies pile up, he reveals that he has made the creatures for use in various experiments and everyone tries to stop him before it is too late. <br /> <br /> The Good News: This here is very little correct. The opening is easily the best, as it has several great notes. From where it begins, with the frightening silhouettes walking in the dark to the revelations, this is a wonder, both for the mystery and for the great imagination. The big one is actually a scene in which the creature emerges from a coffin in a long, slow and scary shot. These are all made before the opening credits and are a fun sight. The scenes in the middle where the creature awakens inside the coffin is pretty creepy and looks really great. The last big plus is the really fun ending. With the kind of ending that seems reminiscent of so many attempts of Universal, this one fits in that style. From the frightening resuscitation to the actual action involved near the swamp, this is fun and really works with others to give only positive realities. <br /> <br /> The bad news: This one only has some flaws, but they are important. The first is the biggest boredom of the movie by inactivity. Almost nothing happens here, mainly due to the tendency to do everything with speech, rather than anything else. There are only intermittent scenes relegated to the zombies, but there is nothing here that devotes any action to the film. This simply has no action, and that's what hurts the movie. It rarely generates scenes that hold interest, and sometimes this makes it look much longer than it really is. The last flaw in the movie are pathetic excuses for zombies. Those who have grown accustomed to more modern meals will find it difficult to get any fear of these creatures, and they really only serve several scenes. This does not treat zombies as threats, making them even less scary. Little time on the screen, non-threatening nature and non-modern behavior of these zombies really destroy that. These are what really hurt the movie. The Final Verdict: With bad zombies and almost nothing worth watching, this one is a curious endeavor. Those accustomed to modern zombies will find little interest in this and will come out the same as this, while only classic horror fans are advised to try. <br /> <br /> Today's Classification - PG: Mild Violence
