It's incredible that this cliche-based yuppie anguish film was made in the first place. The characters are so weak, and the acting is so uninspiring, that it's impossible to worry about any of them - especially Brooke Shields. The temptation to move quickly through the slow parts is almost irresistible. If you like this genre, it would be best to rent "Singles" or "Bodies, Rest & Motion".
