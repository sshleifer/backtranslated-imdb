I do not understand the many good reviews here. I found the photography and scenery beautiful, and the two main actors appealing, but there is little else here to recommend this movie. More annoying are the false southern accents and poorly written dialogue. These do not sound like real people to me. While it is encouraging to show men that they explore various forms of sexuality without the usual stereotyped character traits and labeling, most of the story is unmotivated or logical. The only thing that makes a lot of sense is the responsibility Griffith feels for his mentally ill aunt, grossly exaggerated by Karen Black. Lee is an interesting character who would have been more attractive if the dialogue he made to speak was more natural and his motives clearer. Yes, I understand that he is a hobo, but his actions while the film comes to a hasty conclusion make no sense at all. This movie is worth it, mainly because it has a nice atmosphere but is slow and deeply flawed. A serious rewrite and a better edition may have saved her, as the premise and outline of the story is promising.
