I think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet paper. No respect for the many important details that intrinsically make the film. For example, the names of some Serb terrorists (I remember) are Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What kind of names are these? Certainly not Serbian! By the way, Caradan Maldic !!! What a name, I laughed for days thinking about it. Probably an implication in Karadzic and Mladic. Secondly, there have never been any cases of Serbian terrorism. A journalist as the main character should know that. Thirdly, the actors who play Serbian terrorists are neither Serbian nor Serbo-Croatian. All this aside, this film is solidly acted, but the story is paper thin and full of holes. Sometimes it does not make any sense !!!
