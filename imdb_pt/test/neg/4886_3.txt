From the late teens to the 1920s, Stan Laurel was a solo actor in films. During this period of time, Laurel was definitely not among the top ranks of the talent and her mood is not as good as the contemporaries like Lloyd or Keaton. However, for short second-line comedies, he has created a decent niche. As for the quality of the films, they varied wildly. Some, like DR. PYCKLE AND MR. PRYDE, were great, while most were from average to below average in quality. <br /> <br /> Frozen hearts is a strange movie. Like many of the films he made for Hal Roach and distributed by Path√© during this period, the costumes were absolutely top notch and the film looked very good. However, despite this and with the support of people like James Finlayson, one thing they forgot to include in this movie was the humor. None of the jokes seem to work and the film seems almost a drama, not a comedy. Only really silly title cards betray the kind of movie it's supposed to be. <br /> <br /> My advice is to try to see all of your Laurel and Hardy movies and then watch the movies solo. In addition to DR. PYCKLE, try to see THE SOILERS and MUD AND SAND - two of their most tolerable solo shorts.
