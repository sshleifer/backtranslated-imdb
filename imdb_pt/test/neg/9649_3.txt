First let me say that I am not someone who is usually scared of having to think while watching movies, I love Tarkowsky movies, for example, Berghman is also a favorite ..... but this? The good points can be summarized easily: photography is splendid and the music is perfect ... makes a good movie? I used to think so, but this is a perfect example of one that (for me) does not do it ... maybe it's because I'm so dumb? Tarkwosky, for example, also used very long shots, but what he never did was shoot 5 minutes of the exact same image of two people walking (and I just mean their heads, because in this movie has lots of photos, but sometimes it is effective), the overall result is clearly boring, even with the clever tones (which are done in a way that, though clever, is above all very pedantic) you are always feeling that the director is making some of the plans not for the aesthetic, or symbolic effect, but only to save on the budget .... I am very I was disappointed in this film, because I really enjoyed the first 30 minutes or so, but it continued non-stop, even without keeping the same level as the first scenes ... <br /> <br /> As I read him praising the comments on this page a lot, I also have the feeling that some people just try to see a lot more in the movie than about it ... when a film is slow and artistic, it does not need It means that it is very deep ... yes, it is an allegory of musical theory placed in the context of a small town, which is quite interesting in itself but it does NOT make a deep movie ... except for people who absolutely want to do some kind of intellectual masturbation, but it's not what you find in the movie, but what you find in yourself ... an exercise that, in the my opinion, can be done much more effectively while watching "Stalker" or "Solyaris" than Werckmeister Harmonies, which owes much to Tarkowsky, but the taxi never equals its level ....
