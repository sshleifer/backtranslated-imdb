I do not agree with Dante portraying the zombies who support the Democrats as creatures with an average IQ of 23. I believe their behavior should reflect an IQ smaller than that, something in the order of a Pelosi IQ ... A single digit figure , please The MOH series is quite uneven, and this is the worst episode. Dante, another liberal liberal of Hollywood (or an apolitical nerd who sucks the leftist establishment to re-ignite his lamentable career?), Must have finally realized that his searches in the direction had been maintained at low speed by almost two decades. now, therefore, arose with this leftist and sudden "satire" of the Bush administration, the Republicans, and capitalism. Maybe he thought he had not been openly political before. He would not exactly be the first non-talent to use political propaganda to promote his career when everything else fails. The creator of turds such as "Piranha", "The Howling" and "Matinee", Dante has been as useful as contributor to the horror genre as Adolf Hitler had been for world peace. TH uses the humor of lowest common denominator, cheap and predictable jokes that even the bluest of all members of the syndicate would not have trouble understanding. Or have you seen an intelligent, subtle and intelligent liberal satire? Populist manure has the most basic of all messages, hence the language and manner in which this message is communicated has to be as simple and basic as the name of Sean Penn. And what better people to send that message to the sheep that chews on popcorn than a couple of Hollywood losers who have fallen so far that they are forced to write for TV ... I do not want political propaganda, either Left or Right, in any type of movie. But putting it in horror - of all genres - is a testament to the endless stupidity that reigns so supreme among the anti-intelligentsia of Hollywood. So insipid was Dante that he even failed to notice the hilarious suggestion that zombies would vote for Democrats ... (This is what you get for completing a film school: it is not a source of wisdom or useful knowledge in any stretch of the imagination ).
