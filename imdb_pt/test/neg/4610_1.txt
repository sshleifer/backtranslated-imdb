The nicer parts of this movie were the clips from the original movie. The acting was poor and the premise of sex tokens was revolting. The effects were marginal at best. There were no outstanding performances, Amy Irving was placed in this movie to try to get a public part of the Halloween H20. The original was much more enjoyable and rewarding. I am sorry to say that this is not going to be one of the 10 best years ... so far it is at the end of my list. Do not worry about these folks !!
