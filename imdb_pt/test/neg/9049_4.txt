Eaten Alive is a poor rehearsal for the next year's Cannibal Ferox. The characters are universally mild, locations are criminally underused, there is no attempt to create tension or suspense, physical effects are ridiculously bad or blatantly stolen from other films, and the ubiquitous tribal scenes of rape are hardly worthy of a PG. 13 Even scenes of animal "cruelty" are more tedious than normal. The only slightly shocking scene involves Jonas crazy, getting a little Goldfinger, wielding a dildo drenched with blood; a scene that is simply bizarre rather than graphic. My beloved wife, she from the 'Collector's Edition of Romeo and Juliet', watched this movie without a bit of disgust! And it's called a cannibal movie! All in all, a beautiful effort that completely betrays the cannibal tradition. Cannibal Ferox, the accompaniment of Luci, is a far superior example of the genre.
