I was delighted to discover that TCM was showing this, as I love the 1992 version with Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Joan Plowright ... This movie had a luminous Ann Harding, a wonderful performance by Frank Morgan, but the performance of others The film more than a farce, then the wonderful unfolding that the later film. Reginald Owen's Arbuthnot is painful to watch and you can not understand why your wife loves you. I discovered after watching the movie that was based on the play where the 1992 movie is based on the book. The original movie also looked like a fragment from a larger piece and seemed incomplete. Too bad it was a disappointment.
