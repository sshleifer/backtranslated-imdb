Well, to begin with, I must say that here in Russia, a saga of Geralt of Rivia is known and loved. Andrzej Sapkowski - a talented writer, or perhaps even a genius of some sort - has created one of the most realistic, honest, cynical and God-fearing worlds of fantasy well written in a history of literature. And when such incredible material hits the right hands, watch the RPG game "Witcher" and you'll understand what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> "Vedmak \ Wiedzmin" is an excellent example of the opposite result. <br /> <br /> Lack of budget. Lack of direction. Lack of a good script. <br /> <br /> These three whales from the Disgusting Movie made the movie sink, they ate it alive. Acting is good, sometimes even more than good, but for the love of God can not save this project. <br /> <br /> I still have a little faith. I still hope that one day new Vedmak movies will be created and the whole world will see the overwhelming magnitude and splendor of Sapkowski's books. p.s.but before that, a Uwe Boll must be eliminated. Just in case, you know
