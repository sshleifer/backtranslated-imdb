Coming from Kiarostami, this visual and sound art exhibition is a surprise. For a director known for his narratives and keen observation of humans, especially children, this foray into minimalist cinematography raises questions: Why did he do it? Was it to keep you busy while on the beach? <br /> <br /> "Five, 5 Long Takes" consists of, you guessed it, five long takes. They are (the names of the titles are mine and the times are approximate): "Driftwood and waves". The camera is almost stopped looking at a small piece of wood as it is moved by small waves that splash on a beach. Ten minutes. <br /> <br /> "Watching people on the boardwalk." The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon and a boardwalk. People go through the frame of the camera, their faces too distant and blurry to make them interesting. Eleven minutes. <br /> <br /> "Six dogs at the water's edge." The camera is still looking out over the ocean horizon with a stretch of sandy beach nearby. Far from the water's edge, six dogs are not doing much, just relaxing. Sixteen minutes. <br /> <br /> "Ducks on the line, bunch of ducks." The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon near the water's edge. Dozens and dozens of ducks circle in a single row from left to right. I assume that Kiarostami released them gradually. The last two ducks stop in their lane and suddenly a flock of ducks roll silently from right to left. I assume that Kiarostami collected the ducks and re-released all at the same time. This is not the first time he has dealt with the contrast between organized and disorganized behavior. Eight minutes. <br /> <br /> "Symphony of frog, opa, I mean cacophony, for a stormy night." The camera sits on a lake at night. It is dark except for what appears to be the reflection of the moon in the rippling water. It is a stormy night and clouds rush to cover the moon. The screen is dark. What we have left is the cacophony of frogs, howling dogs and, eventually, morning roosters. Hit me in the head if this was done in a single outlet. I saw this segment as a sound composition gathered in the editing room and accompanied by a simple preview. Twenty-seven minutes! <br /> <br /> Except for the slightly amusing ducks, this minimalism exercise left me cold. A film not essential to Kiarostami's admirers. <br /> <br /> I thought about classifying "Five" for five, but four is what it deserves. <br /> <br /> The film is dedicated to Yasujiru Ozu.
