I found this movie in a discount rack for DVD for $ 10. It was not worth it. Some of the camera work and dialogue look and sound like they were made by a film student. Sandra's performance was a little believable, but the film was predictable and the action was uneven and drawn. <br /> <br /> One thing I'm going to give you, though. Unlike most action films, the people in this movie ran out of ammunition and searched for new bodies and ammunition.
