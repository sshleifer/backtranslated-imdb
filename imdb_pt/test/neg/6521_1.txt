This movie is by far the worst movie of all time, The plot is weak and never shows what happens to people after the 20 have been left hands. That really bothers me. It drags on without any meaning, very annoying. The only good thing was the cast, WOW, many great actors and actress in it. But besides, it was horrible, terrible and repulsive, doing yourself a favor, not watching it. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 1 out of 10
