I like Arnold, and I love the subject, but this was a very disappointing movie. When I first saw the previews, they were dark and sinister, and Arnold's name was not even mentioned. But I recognized him, which led me to believe he was making a movie that had a more serious and suspenseful mood. That was not just another Schwarzenegger action vehicle (although I admit, most of them are very good!). He had, so far, avoided movies with any real religious theme. And I was excited. I was wrong. This is just another action, blast, gunfire movie. And it's too bad.
