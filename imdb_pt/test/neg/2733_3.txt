Terry Cunningham directs this Sci-Fi Network original. All is not well in Washington State and Oregon; volcanic eruptions and earthquakes threaten to topple most of the Pacific Rim in the ocean. Trying to keep the world from falling into ecological chaos, a team of scientists led by Dr. Jake Rollins (Luke Perry) picks up a huge land drilling vehicle called "The Mole" to dig their way to avoid the impending disaster. . The technical dialogue does not really help or accelerate this movie. The acting is lame, but Perry has always been relaxed. You can only blame him for participating. Others in the cast: Michael Dorn, Adam Frost and Michael Teigen
