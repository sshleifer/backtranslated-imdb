This is the sequel to the octopus. <br /> <br /> Pff ... OK. Plenty of footage, but very good. I'm surprised they actually had a gigantic robot octopus that actually did not look that bad! I was really surprised by that. <br /> <br /> The movie overall was just plain fun. He never explained how the octopus got so big, and it's not connected to the first one at all. But it was still fun. <br /> <br /> The end me and my friend laughed. Basically, after blowing up the octopus once, the two main characters launch a bomb and five blasts, most of the footage, appear on the screen! We joked that they went to the dollar store and bought a toy 'five missiles in one'! Believe me, it has to be seen to believe! Overall just stupid fun. It's worth taking a chance, buying if it's cheap.
