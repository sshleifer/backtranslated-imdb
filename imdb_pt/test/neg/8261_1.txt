Ru Paul plays a secret agent named Starrbooty. She joins another drag queen to fight the evil Annaka Manners (Candis Cayne) and retrieve her kidnapped niece ... or something. Seriously ... I had a hard time concentrating on the plot! The film is apparently directed by someone with serious ADD - fast non-stop camera cuts that make it impossible to focus on anything. The dialogue is incomprehensible at times and when you can hear it, you want it to remain incomprehensible! The acting is actually very good, except for Ru Paul, which outweighs to an embarrassing degree. In addition, the movie is full of disgusting bathroom humor that is simply revolting and not even remotely funny. After 30 minutes I had to leave because I was bored, sick and just could not take it anymore. I pride myself on sitting on anything, but that was beyond my limits! People are comparing this to John Waters' initial work. I disagree. Waters's work is sick, but good - that's just sick. Avoid.
