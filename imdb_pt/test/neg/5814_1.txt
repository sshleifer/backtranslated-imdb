I found this gem in a rack the local video store had tapes that are exchanged between several rental establishments. "The man who skied on Everest." Hmm ... I've never heard of it. The box says of a Japanese guy who always wanted to ski on Everest and actually did it. Sounds interesting. I rented. As expected, it was a documentary style. The first part can be summed up like this: "I always wanted to ski on Mount Everest." This is followed by some scenes of preparation for the event. Lots of preparation footage. Okay, I guess it takes a lot of preparation. Then we are treated to lengthy piece in the skier, the philosophy of Yuichiro Miura in life etc. More stuffed follows and I begin to know where the ski adjusts in to this spectacle. More preparation is shown and they begin to make the trip to the mountain. More philosophy is shown. Finally they get to the mountain and maybe, maybe, he goes skiing to escape the damn thing. Lots of climbing footage later, there is a description of the parachute device intended to slow down Miuras on the steep slope. Finally he ties up the skis and prepares to leave. <br /> <br /> He's out ... He skates about six feet and his skis come out from under him, he puts the parachute and falls into an inglorious packet for some distance down the mountain and that's it. History end. What the hell was that? <br /> <br /> OK, I can buy that he always wanted to ski at Everest, made extensive preparations and really tried with the camera crew in tow. It did not work and he eventually collapsed and nearly killed himself, so what arrogance would not the man inspire to cast a movie of him and call it skiing on Everest? Perhaps the title, "The man who has his feet thrown out from under him and he slipped on his butt down on Everest" was too long for the tape box.
