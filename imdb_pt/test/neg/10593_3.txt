I was not old enough to really appreciate the original Mod Squad, but I knew everyone thought it was cool. I have some of the "books" that were written based on the series in my screen collection for print, and they are very light so I did not expect much from the movie. That's a good thing, because this movie was bad on a long leash. <br /> <br /> I admire the risk of creating a film that is so true to the success of the 1960s. Film audiences, however, have gained sophistication in 30 years. At least I think so. I certainly expect something more than an hour and a half from the original Mod Squad concept, with (now old) car chases, (now considered poor) camera work, (tinny sounding) soundtrack and script (bad) and all, on the big screen. In the 1960s, we did not care so much because we had minimal expectations. An integrated police team of young people wearing something besides suits was enough. That was another exciting episode of "Ironsides" or "Password". Classifying this "episode" against usual theater releases, the story was ... well, I'm not sure if I should say because I'm not sure there was one. Are drugs bad? Whatever. The script was silly. When the characters are exchanging dialogues and advancing the plot with phrases like "I heard him say on the phone" and "I think I have a plan," we're really in trouble. No wonder the acting was terrible: no one knew how to say those stupid lines. <br /> <br /> If I were Claire Danes, I'd be going after my agent with a flamethrower right now. (Actually, I think everyone and watch the movie have the right to seek retribution.) And where was Mod on that Squad? I realize these kids just came out of the youth room, but no one had a velvet suit? "Mod" meant just young and integrated? What happened to go-go white boots? Maybe the costume department was brave, but all they got was dirty and gloomy. <br /> <br /> Since the film was completely faithful to the original series, and required a special behavior of actors, cameramen, stunts, etc., we should appreciate more. Unfortunately, I still do not like it. If I wanted to watch the crime drama of the '60s, I'd buy DVDs. No thanks.
