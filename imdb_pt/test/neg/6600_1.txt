I'm speechless, honestly, I can not understand how anyone could have agreed to a script like that, cast anyone in the film let alone direct it. The fact that I'm writing this review seems like an insult to my fingers, this movie should be thrown in the trash instead of being overhauled. I am disappointed with Flex Alexander for even thinking about accepting a BONUS EXCUSE FOR A ROOT, much less writing the paper. OMG! I think I just insult the word "rehearsal" ... uh yes I did. You know what, the less said about this meaningless nonsense, the better. You were warned, no one warned me that I had to experience horror alone. ATTEND AT YOUR OWN RISK.
