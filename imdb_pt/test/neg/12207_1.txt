This version of David Copperfield is terrible from start to finish. I knew we were expecting a wasted night when a little dizzy to the point of embarrassment Attenborough and Olivier camp like two thugs. It was all downhill after that. Aunt Betsy was adequate, but she did not have the eccentric talent she was known for. Worst of the worst was the producer's choice for Uriah. This was the version of the music hall of this personage, interpreted previously and admirably by Roland Young. And what was all this self-absorbed anguish of David? Dickens must have rolled into his grave to see his favorite son turning into a wimp crying in his beer. <br /> <br /> This was a time when Hollywood knew more than the old and gay England.
