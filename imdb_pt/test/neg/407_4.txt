In a way, you have to respect Arachnia. It's clearly a tribute to the big buggy movies of the fifties, and while the special effects look terrible; at least the film does not contain CGI. However, on the other hand; you can not respect the film because it's a load of rubbish. The acting is terrible, the special effects (as mentioned) are impossible to be taken seriously, and once you've seen a giant spider being blown up; you've seen them all, so get boring quickly. The plot follows a group of people who are unfortunate enough to be in a plane crash after a meteor shower. They go to the only house in the area; which happens to be a house where a man has a huge spider that he used to use as a circus attraction. Coincidentally at the same time, the meteor shower caused more gigantic spiders to rise from the ground. All the characters in this movie are bad cartoons; None of them have anything like a third dimension and they will soon begin to bore you completely. You have to feel for director Brett Piper as he clearly did not have much work with this film; but that does not make Arachnia worth it, and overall there are better giant bug films than that, and therefore Arachnia does not get the seal of approval from me.
