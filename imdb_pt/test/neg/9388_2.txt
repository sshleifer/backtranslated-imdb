On the positive, I'll say it's beautiful enough to be watchable. In the negative, it is tasteless enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of wasted life in front of the screen. Long, tearful and senseless. And I'm not saying this to be mean, I really wanted to like this movie, it seemed to have everything for it, it had the so-called "buzz", and it was a nuisance to track in addition. It would have been a little more effort on the side of the story, I think that would have been incredible. And I hope the team behind this will do a wonderful job in the future, they clearly have the ability. But I recommend waiting for your future efforts, let it go.
