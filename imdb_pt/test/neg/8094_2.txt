What can you say about a movie whose funniest episode sees a fat man struggling against a garden hose? The acting, particularly that of the chief man Jerry O'Connel, is embarrassing. The dialogue is so artificial and dull that it makes you cringe. The idea of ​​control is not really bad for this genre (adolescent comedy), but somehow the director manages to do the least of them. I rate it 2 out of 10.
