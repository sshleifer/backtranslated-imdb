I give this nonsense a 2 instead of a 1 because there is a worse show called Haunted Homes. But this boy and his friends conduct their investigations as total idiots. They assume that there are ghosts and if they find rational explanations behind the experiments, they have to be drugged and scream to admit it. But beyond that, the whole format of the show is incredibly annoying. Although very scripted, the college-educated kids who make up the cast barely speak English, but still insist on using "big" words they obviously do not understand. And the ridiculously important voices of principal investigator Ryan make me want to just play the TV out the window. (and he seems stoned all the time). In short, this group makes the TAPS guys in Ghost Hunters look like the MIT scientists!
