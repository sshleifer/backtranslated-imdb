I did not buy this, I did not rent it, I was on PPV and someone burned a copy and lent me, so at least I did not lose money on it. For someone who has done Darkness, the Nameless, Devil's Backbone, this is a very lame movie. It seems to have something to do with a group of girls who were in a convent in the past and now they are grown up and being chased and killed one by one by a nun coming out of the kitchen sink, the bathroom, and even negotiating the revolving doors in a hotel. And what makes that nun so wicked and disgusting (and wet?) I do not know, it was so boring that at some point in the middle of the way, I stopped, kept and observed something else. I was not even interested in finding out, really. Oh, sure, there are some lovely girls to look at, but hey, two of them are lesbians? I think there's a picture on the bedside table of a young lady's room, and what self-respecting horror movie would not be complete today without a lesbian couple? Yes, whatever. 2 of 10, if you want to see a nun-worthy horror movie try Desecration, Dead Waters, or The Convent (and this is the one with Adrienne Barbeau, by the way, not the one with John Malkovich).
