I saw this movie n can say that this is really a bad movie. The director has gone crazy ... of course ... he knows a lot about the army, but he sure is a cheap guy. There are a lot of technical flaws in the movies too ... Okay ... here's my doubt - in the end, when they rescue the family (including a girl who just got raped) ... why? they leave them out of their place? I did not see any ambulances nearby! There are many aspects to the movie that are real ... but then I just wish the Major had narrated / helped / helped some other good director make the film. <br /> <br /> Mohanlal certainly deserves a better director!
