This movie falls easily into the category of risible, if not more so, to actually insult. I mean, what alternative universe did filmmakers and studios think this movie would play? From start to finish, we bombarded with Quaids overcoming and ridiculous facial expressions, imposing a "thick loose cannon". Another point of choice I had with the film was the lack of a realistic story of events that would make you grow to connect to a character. I mean, in a scene where Lewis is playing in a bar before he gets big, there's this over-top, a completely absurd bar fight, which all the city's citizens apparently belong to. Then Lewis starts playing his version of "A Lump of Tremors" and everyone immediately forgets their differences and begins to dance wildly as if it were the most normal thing in the world. These types of scenes, which are numerous, coupled with the lack of depth in any of the characters, have led me to real laughter. So overall, this movie is not worth being seen by anyone who is not interested in mocking a filmmaker and his actor decisions for an hour and a half.
