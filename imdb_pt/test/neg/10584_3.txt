Is not fair. I was really hoping this was a fun and hilarious movie. I mean, I like Drake Bell from Drake and Josh, and Leslie Neilson is nothing to be spirited on since her early classics, Airplane and the Naked Gun. However, after watching superhero movie, I'm glad I did not even have to pay for it. It just would not have been anywhere near the $ 9 per ticket. More like a dollar and a few cents. Because that would sum up the hour and a few minutes. And as disappointing as this movie was, I'm glad the length of time has been short, if not minor. I just can not believe how incredibly vulgar, unnecessary and, above all, STUPID, some of the scenes were! And above that, I saw a better performance of a wooden dummy (without the ventriloquist). It's as if Craig Mazin purposefully wanted to make a movie that deserved his 3.7, if not inferior, and even try to be worse than "Meet the Spartans". Very disappointing indeed.
