This has to do with one of the most pathetic, predictable and misinterpreted movies I've ever seen. Clint Eastwood has never been worse, I've never seen anyone less convincing on the screen. I was laughing at him all the time. So there's this kind of romance between him and the beautiful Rene Russo, who was even more pathetic than Mr.Connery and Ms. Zeta-Jones in Entrapment. <br /> <br /> A IMDb user asked the question: What is there to dislike about this movie? I'm asking: What's it like? And the answer is: John Malkovich. He is an absolute genius and probably the best villain of all time (he even saved Con Air, you know). But that's it. <br /> <br /> This movie is called in the line of fire, but 'Bodyguard 2: the rip-off' seems to be a more appropriate title. Watch only if you are a fan John Malkovich. Otherwise, avoid at all costs. * 1/2 (in five)
