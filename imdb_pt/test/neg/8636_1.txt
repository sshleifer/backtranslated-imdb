Skip this version of Hollywood, a real piece of crap. A cheap insult to the brilliant original "Spoorloos", or by the title in English also called "The Vanishing". It completely misses the mark on the typical and grotesque fashion of Hollywood, usually due to a lot of untalented corporate bean counters who have no idea about anything artistic, they just look for the "success formula" and want it to be applied to everything. make a profit. Much like the terrible "The Scarlet Letter" made in 1995, it distorted both the original story to suit the MacDonaldsland crowd, which became a freak, not even a bastardization, but a pile of goo that was kind of shaped similar. but does not seem, feel or remotely remember the spirit of the original. Except that the movie at least had Gary Oldman, which is interesting to watch on anything he does. This dog has nothing in its favor, even the normally talented Jeff Bridges is an embarrassment. The great tragedy is not and should never be "the wellness film of the year," but rather one or more of the tragic and sad events of life and allows the reader / spectator to extract meaning and insight from the human condition. Do yourself a great favor if you're looking for a rental and skip this grotesque junk and get the original made in a Dutch / French collaboration in 1988. This is a great movie. This is a horrible mess.
