The director is sweet, as is his wife co-director Shira Geffen, but his movie sucks. There are moments (and some pretty girls), but there is a lot of everything: "Am√©lie" finds "Breaking the waves" and finds "Pauline on the beach". You walk away wanting to know more about the wedding photographer and about the girl you love best when nothing happens, whether it's in the movies or in real life. Instead, you have a suicidal writer, a neurotic actress, and an illegal immigrant working with a heart of gold. It seems like there is more of a truly touching story hidden in the script, but apparently it's a lot of worn-out stories and sentimental bullshit. Hard to stay out.
