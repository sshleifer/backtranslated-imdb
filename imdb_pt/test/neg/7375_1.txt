I absolutely could not believe the levels of ineptitude on display in this production. I honestly thought gay men tasted better than that. I know what I do. <br /> <br /> Most of the blame is not on the cast, but let's get them out of the way first ... the only one with real talent was Joe Souza (plus he had the best cast). He had a pleasant, clear voice in the theater style. Okay, and Jaymes Hodges' voice was like that, but he had an empty expression on every number. The rest could not hold a note in a bucket, though the music was obviously dubbed after the fact. It must have been really horrible to hear them live. They were also boy boys, except perhaps three. If I wanted to see naked WOMEN on the stage, I could go to the bust of my breasts. I'm not sure why anyone would choose to film LA production instead of New York. I imagine NY has a more readily available singing talent, although one might think of LA that they would be able to find better looking guys. Apparently no. <br /> <br /> But I disagree ... the real fault here is with the creators and producers. This score was the most banal and insipid complaint I've ever heard. It seemed that some theater queens would pick up all their musical CDs, play in the blender, and put the goo on a page. Unfortunately, I'm sure there are many who can not tell the difference between good writing and whatever. I mean seriously, I was laughing my ass off with the whole thing, but not with the bad jokes. I think the morbid song "my lover died of AIDS" titled "Kris, look what you missed" was the most hysterical thing in the whole show. Genius writing ... Kris / Lost ... wow ... they almost rhyme ... must be a good letter. And Jesus ... the END of that song ... "Oh Kris, Ohhh Kris, OHHHH Kris ..." More and more !!! My other favorite was "You have to be a Pumpkin Junkie Boy to be a Humpy Hunkie Boy" ... WTF ??? The whole show was full of the most arbitrary lyrics, just because they rhymed. Where did these people learn to write music? Apparently they overheard Sondheim and said, "It's not so good, I can do it" ... as evidenced by the delayed reference "Bobby, Bobby, Bobby" of COMPANY in a song. Another irk: why 20 and a few years are singing about Robert Mitchum and Tab Hunter? Obviously coming from the mouths of the lyricists and not from the actors ... again, writing badly. <br /> <br /> If you love torture and pain, and I know many of you strange fetishists, go ahead and watch. But you were warned.
