I own this movie. And it's awfully hard to find. It is a low cost single movie about a doctor looking for the perfect companion. It has the really humble budget feel, and the blood is surprisingly good for what appears to be a $ 500 budget. The director is claimed to be the blood master. I would not go that far, but maybe in his time he would. Overall 6/10 on the gore chart.
