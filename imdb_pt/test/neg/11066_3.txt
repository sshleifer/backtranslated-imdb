Monday, October 02, 2006 So I joined my father as I always do. We ordered some Japanese food, turned out the lights and played. I'm an avid fan of horror movies. However, The Cavern released on DVD in October was certainly a let down. It seemed promising to meet all the standard requirements of any horror-movie machine: starting with an antagonistic character present, a sex scene can not be omitted, and the pre-suspense very familiar (when they frighten him unexpectedly, but ends up being the idiot friend). Then, finally, when it came to the heart of the matter, I was ready for some real action. The director, I admit, was enthusiastic. Of course you would have to be to fill a total of 81 minutes with people running back and forth in a space of about 10 feet wide. It all starts when some college-bound "cavers" gather for another dive into caves. They all look like experienced, very serious and spiritual professionals about the whole experience of the cave. This time they bring in a new, annoying photographer very blinded by his National Geographic cover to understand the dangers of cave diving. As they descend into what they call "Hell Pit", they soon realize that they are not alone in the abyss of death. I'll politely leave out any spoilers if you're naive enough not to pay attention to my advice and avoid wasting your time. Although the atmosphere and background music were scary; and sure enough there was a lot of blood and blood as the moments approached to witness some real breakup, it was more like watching pornography without the full frontal. Camera work was intentionally dark and incomplete. I think the director used it for that purpose. I suppose my favorite thing about the movie was the moving characters. They deserved the Acadamy Awards for those who played scenes of fights. I almost shed a tear when they finally "caught" ... A tear of joy! If you like dry horror, soft porn, and you hated Braveheart. So this is the right movie for your next Saturday night.
