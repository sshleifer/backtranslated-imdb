On top of the fact that Skylar is a complete douche bag and his cons are unimaginative, his schemes require much preparation to make any of his punches worthwhile. Without distributing spoilers (as if that matters with this crap), its cons are a scam because it takes the day-and-days effort of planning, and the use of multiple accomplices and a whole crew of footage, etc. someone in a service that would cost less than a hundred dollars ..... plus if you read in the credits they re-enact some of the phone calls, etc, because they do not work ... The whole concept of this show is bunk because all his cons have the cost on both crew members and the effort of ten times the actual cost of the service he is trying to get for free ... what is the con?
