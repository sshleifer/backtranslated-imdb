If you are a Catalan nationalist anarcho-socialist with reverence bewildered by the mythologies of the Spanish republic, this movie may be for you. Two brothers, the real-life ones (one of them being Marc Recha himself), reissue a fictional version of a real-life journey that they did through the spectacular Catalan countryside, and history is evoked (pans of walls with bullet holes, artillery grows in the soundtrack), but it is not shown. There is very little dialogue, and most of it is incidental: the story is told in a third-person voice, the voice of an actress representing the real-life sister of the real-life brothers. The images have little to do with the plot that exists, which is not much. Many are stunning, hitting pans on mountains and arid and semi-arid rivers (think Terrence Malick or Gus Van Sant - there is not a bit of "Gerry" and "Last Days" here), interspersed with stunning still images and still pictures. These are best enjoyed within the superb natural sound environment of the movie and without the boring narration or even the occasional background music (some very good, some quite strange, but all free). The best of what this movie has to say is said in these sequences, with the occasional inclusion of power stations and dams without comment. <br /> <br /> The relationship between siblings is left incomplete and generic; a main character is a catfish that bites man, never shown. The more the anarcho-pro-independence Catalan-nationalist commitments of the director are suggested, the more the richer, implicit message of the film is subverted and the more irritatingly narcissistic the experience becomes. While the director said at the NYFF show that the film was conceived from the outset with its third-person narrative, I would like to see a version of it without narrative or music and only with the natural soundtrack and minimalist dialogue - the result could be more moving, and in any case it would not be much less disconcerting. <br /> <br /> However, this is probably the only movie you will see this year when a guy enters the frame with a cloth object (the swimsuit he was wearing?) hanging from his penis. This is one of the few moments in the whole movie where your interest is (sorry) stung by something that is actually happening on the screen (what is this? Why is it hanging there?), But as usual there is answers are provided. Very Warholian, very sixties, and not a bit tiring.
