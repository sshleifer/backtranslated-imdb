While Aeon Flux was mildly entertaining and a little better way to spend a Wednesday night than the pub, I left satisfied that I had managed to buy one get a free tickets. not knowing anything about the movie as I walked in, in fact I did not even know there was an animated series before reading this site, I was ready for anything, and as some other viewers noticed, the trailers showing a well filmed, interesting and interesting movie pulled me in the middle of the movie, although I was a little disappointed, it reminded me of the fifth element, but I also feel that I lacked a little depth and left me with the empty feeling to me. and enough of the senseless and rather boring weapons fights, if you do them, do it with some style, not just loads of blasts and inept guards falling. personally, I'd rather have seen a little more about the history and the people in the city or know more about how the president was being mined, than another long and noisy armed struggle.
