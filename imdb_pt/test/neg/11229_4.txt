If you're in the mood to laugh at a really bad movie (bad the way only Ken Russell can be), you should try this one. It can make you feel like you've just arrived in a porn booth, and you can smell the urine on the floor. Kathleen Turner wears a blonde wig to be able to "pretend" to be a two-bit prostitute (she really has good solid work in the garment industry and has been so hurt by men that this is the only way she can connect), and Tony Perkins plays a hysterical "priest" who may have murdered her (another film that ends with Tony Perkins in drag). Annie Potts appears and is not allowed to provide an ounce of her usual intelligence, which is reason enough to hate this movie. The eccentric will love the sex scenes, so rent the UNrated version in the RED box so you can see Turner giving a cop a taste of his bat (I had to pause the VCR until we stopped laughing).
