This was a disgrace to the FarCry game I had high expectations, but it all ended in a nightmare. In addition to the poor acting of visual effects, the plot even the mood used in the film was an absolute failure. The movie is not worth watching at all. The funniest part was when the girl came and kissed Jack to give him the key to the handcuffs. I think she got the keys to handcuff all the time. I hope some good director makes a remake of this fantastic game in a movie someday. And I will invest good money to get the right visual effects and the right scenarios as well as the right ACTING. But until then do not waste time trying to watch this movie because it will surely go crazy, especially if you are a lover of FarCry.
