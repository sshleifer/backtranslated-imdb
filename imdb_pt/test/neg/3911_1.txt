There is only one word that describes this movie: BAD !! I have no idea why this movie was made, or how they made Dennis Hopper star in this movie. Stuart Gordon is a better director than that and Hopper is a much better actor. The movie is just plain stupid. I liked the idea of ​​"square pigs" and there was an interesting love scene involving a cyborg, moreover, avoid this movie at all costs.
