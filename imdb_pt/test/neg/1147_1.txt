Why did they have to try to make a sequel to one of the biggest Christmas films ever? The movie is a train accident on all levels and should never have been done. The portrait of Randy Quaid's cousin, Eddie, is one of the caricatures of his later works as cousin Eddie. In addition, the character Eddie is not interesting enough to carry an entire movie. Even "sweet eye" Sung Hi Lee could not redeem this piece of crap on vacation. Please do not waste your time on this move, just watch the original again.
