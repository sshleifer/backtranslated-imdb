If you have described any of the scenes; nightmares of children murdering you in your sleep, your newborn daughter talking to ghosts, looking for your lost son in an abandoned mine at night, so petrified for fear that you can not move even if a victim's blood is dripping on you upstairs ?? so I'd say you had a horror movie. But somehow, 'Wicked Little Things' was not scary. I am a horror fan and I loved the location, the plot in the main and I enjoyed the three main ladies. I did not want to see them get hurt, I wanted the 'villain' to get their fair desserts, the rest of the cast is always simply cannon fodder, so I was indifferent, anyway, with them and all the clich√©s the book - even the battery of the torch fading into the dark field as you start here whispering voices approaching you. <br /> <br /> I would still recommend you to watch, but unless you're new to horror movies or under 12, you've seen it all before.
