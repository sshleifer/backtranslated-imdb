Although I'm not very religious, I still had relatively high hopes for this movie because it has the incredible Steve Carrell, and his prequel, Bruce Almighty, was in fact a creative and intelligent Christian comedy. However, Evan Almighty does not even come close to this originality and freshness that the original has, and can not decide whether it's a comedy or a sentimental movie about faith and family values. If you had chosen a clear path to focus on which of these themes, you could have lived up to your potential, but instead, the result of mixing the two is a film that has a very flat and dry sense of humor, tacky dialogue and motives that try to give depth to the film, but instead practically insults the intelligence of the audience, and also a very confusing and hazy presentation of the film's opaque message. It was very obvious that Evan Almighty was very poorly written, there are innumerable holes and elements in the film that make absolutely no sense. For example, although a wide variety of exotic animals from all over the planet boil for Evan as he builds the ark for his salvation from the flood, their inclusion is really necessary when the only "flood" that happens in the film is downtown Washington DC and a suburban neighborhood, which means they are not in danger of being eliminated? The filmmakers seem to lack the originality of modernizing the Bible's history, and instead it happened only at a present moment without changing anything to the plot, leaving many elements that simply do not add up to it and make the idiot motives obvious and writing inside the movie. Overall, this work is tragic because the talent of Steve Carrell and Wanda Sykes is not shown because of the insipid characters they depict, and it was so poorly written that it distorts and manipulates many of the themes tried by the film, and makes a mockery of first movie. Finally, Evan Almighty is also an insult to the brilliant actors and any half-intelligent spectator, insofar as it fails miserably both.
