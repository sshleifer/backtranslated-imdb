This was not a very good movie, the acting was very bad and the effects were bad most of the time. But there were some funny moments, but most of them were not supposed to be funny. The most hilarious part of the movie for me was the part where a little boy in a wheelchair falls (that's not the funny part of what kind of person you think I am) anyway the kid falls and starts yelling at his brother the older brother comes running and the way the kid runs is so funny that he's stumbling and really acting too much, I had to rewind him several times so I could laugh a little more. So if you are looking for something to rent but simply can not find anything, check this out and note the running part.
