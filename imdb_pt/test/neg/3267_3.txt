When I first watched this movie, I did not know the title of it. I realized I had Chevy Chase in it with the same name it had in Caddyshack so I had an idea it was Caddyshack 2. At the end of the movie, when I discovered it was Caddyshack 2, I was disappointed. They could have done better. Dan Akroyd I thought it was bad. The whole story was bad. Call this movie another title, but do not call it Caddyshack 2. You assign this great movie to a bad name. Jackie Mason's daughter when I first saw her was his wife. How old is this girl? Wow. How about making this movie a little believable? I thought Chevy Chase was good.
