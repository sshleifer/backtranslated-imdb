... I can not believe that there are actually people here who recommend this movie ... This is such a slow POS going absolutely nowhere. Oh, yes, that's fine, but you see it coming miles away. Acting: Really really bad, maybe the bartender was kind of OK. Edition: BAD! I suppose the editor was told "we need at least 90 minutes" because half of all the scenes could have gone in the trash. Music: Do not make me start with this, the worst note I've ever heard. Who's singing in the last scene to scream out loud? Direction: oh my, IMNSHO David Lynch sucks, but someone trying to copy it is even harder. Skip this one.
