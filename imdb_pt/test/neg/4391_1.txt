This movie really hurts to watch. Not only did not laugh once, I ended up having a serious headache. Sometimes I'm sorry for the actors involved. The best way to sum it up is that among sexual comedies, it's probably the least fun and least sexy of all time. I'm just sorry I can not cast a vote of less than one. To give a rating one is an insult to each movie that scores two or better. <br /> <br /> Now I see that they are filming a sequel. To hear that someone is actually paying these people to make another movie convinces me that there is a lot of money in Hollywood. INCREASE YOUR TAXES !!! Making a sequel to this movie may very well constitute a crime against humanity; perhaps an international tribunal should be convened, or UN sanctions applied to filmmakers. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a really bad movie. Serious serious.
