I watched about an hour of this movie (against my will) and could not finish it. I would rate it as a 0. The writing was bad, the plot predictable and what was done many times. The most annoying part of this film was the performance of Melody Thomas Scott. This part did not require someone to look snobbish, but she could, in every scene I saw, look like a snob (sour) or someone about to utter something extremely sarcastic or cruel. <br /> <br /> The two novels that seemed to evolve into something serious almost in the encounter with the couples were a little too much. <br /> <br /> I should know better than watching made for TV movies. If there is absolutely nothing on television and this is the only choice, read a book.
