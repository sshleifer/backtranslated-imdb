This mess starts with a real tank passing over a car, interspersed with images of a toy tank. This is followed by a family driving home from a birthday party without saying anything. The unexplained tank and non-verbal family occupy, I swear, more than 10 minutes of film. Finally, the family sees a car after having been in an accident and decides to report it to the appropriate authorities, only to find out that the citizens of the city are all hiding in their homes, and the police are hiding in the police station. Interesting? Almost. When the townspeople leave because of the presence of the family, we learn that both the writer and the publisher are plotting to replace suspense with incomprehensible storytelling techniques, hoping that the inability of the public to say what is happening will bring discomfort to the public. it works! ... but not in the way they thought it would be. I was very uncomfortable with how bad this movie was, but not afraid at all. The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense. Not in a funny way of David Lynch, but some kind of "I've been in the middle of the conversation" kind of talk. Over the next hour, we learn that filmmakers try to make us bored with fear by showing tediously mundane scenes combined with the above-mentioned "happening." type scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot involves something along the lines of delicate-looking people putting children in trance through the power of Satan and then bringing them to a party to play with toys, and one still more sinister intent, and it's up to a group of white men (everyone's white in the movie) pick up their guns and save the day, and a sexy woman who plays with the fall of a hat. They look for kidnapped children looking in random places and shouting the names of children. <br /> <br /> This is a great horror movie for anyone who has never seen a horror movie because that person is scared. I was thinking of Satanism, paganism, wicca or even Catholicism because of a lifetime brainwashing diet. Trinity Broadcast Network. This depicts Satanism as elders in Halloween costumes with candles as they mingle at a party in front of an Ankh. Filled with a priest doing whacks completely invented about Satanists, while calling them "Witches." The message that everything that is not Protestantism can be thrown into the same category for easy condemnation. About 30 minutes of filming are wasted to show mean mediocre actors awkwardly, babbling pseudo-satanic profanations exaggerated enough to make a teenager blush gothic, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be composed of words. <br /> <br /> Highlights include a guy laughing at the idea of ​​little green men for a solid 3 minutes, a family staring out the windows of the car without speaking for 10 minutes while listening to the muzak sound. A priest studying Satanism for 4 minutes with drawings of devils so scary to scare the crowd of the Lady of the Church. Random pictures of dolls. Random pictures of children. Paint instead of blood at every chance. Dream sequences of movie school level. It introduces unimportant characters who do not do anything before leaving. Sometimes they act as if the nothing they are doing is a big deal. <br /> <br /> The steering is sloppy at best. An example of the direction includes a scene at the beginning, where a man and a woman are kissing and the man moves away to look lovingly in his eyes and a dark red ink falls on his cheek. Looking up, they see that it is not blood, but droplets of a snow cone from a girl. The snowballs are ice and colored / flavored water, and would not have produced droplets of the same texture as the ink, not to mention the fact that their snow cone was a bright reddish orange. Writing hacked, certainly, but made worse by bad direction. She then cuts to an alternate photo of the man, woman and girl and shows that she is about a meter away from them, so that the snowy cone would not have dripped on the woman even if she had held her snow cone about the woman. face. All right, editor! Of course, the acting is blah. The performance of the entire cast can be placed on a scale and perfectly balanced between overacting and underacting. <br /> <br /> The director's most offensive technique is to not give the actors motivation and then go out for lunch as an unblinking eye. And finally, after all this, we came to an end that would have been great if it had been dealt with by competent people and not by Jerry Falwell. .
