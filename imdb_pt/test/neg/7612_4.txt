I found this movie extremely disturbing. Treadwell is delirious and disturbed, to the point of probably suffering from mental illness. The footage shown is him and not an actor, but is still showing behavior that ended in death. Is it appropriate to show real images of a suicide? Let's not measure words. The film shows scenes of behavior that led directly to his death. <br /> <br /> For those who think Treadwell is some kind of hero, think again. The footage he recorded is about him and not about the bears and foxes he claimed to be helping. He did not do any meaningful research on his habits or numbers and did nothing to actually protect them. All he did was run in the woods and convince himself that he was better than everyone else. The reality is, by helping to desensitize animals to humans, exposed them to great risk. His self-indulgent behavior did not cause his own death but also the death of his companion Amy and exposed his beloved bears and foxes to greater harm. <br /> <br /> But I'm also worried about Werner Herzog's actions in compiling this movie the way he did. <br /> <br /> A friend and I had a long discussion about this movie that loved this movie. He believes that seriously disturbed people create interesting subjects and he cites the film Downfall as an example. But in Downfall they use actors. We have not seen the real Madga Goebells put cyanide capsules in the mouth of their own children. <br /> <br /> There was something about the use of the actual footage in the Grizzly Man, which reminded me of that horrible tragedy at the football stadium where people were being crushed to death and the photographers who could have helped, elected to simply continue to record the horror. <br /> <br /> Herzog's film shows us that Treadwell's images are more about Treadwell. But Herzog did the same. His own personality and opinions are displayed in this documentary, which is supposedly about someone else. Scenes like the one in which he listens to the tape are not necessary. We already knew what was on the tape because the coroner had told us. We do not need Herzog shedding a tear with one of Treadwell's ex-girlfriends. You have not been added to the movie. <br /> <br /> The film showed us that Treadwell was very self-indulgent, but also showed us that Herzog is too.
