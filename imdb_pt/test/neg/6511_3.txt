Imagine if you want an alternate universe where someone has done SEVEN, where, instead of a talented cast and crew, they have created a politically conscious environmentalist and a standing comedian as the leaders. If your imagination can not stretch so far, just watch THE GLIMMER MAN as if it's the next worst thing! Bob Cole is a police officer with a hidden past and it is very ironic that he is played by Steven Seagal, since he is also someone with a hidden past, but do not tell anyone because it is top secret. Perhaps the biggest secret is how someone like Seagal became a movie star, first and foremost, since THE GLIMMER MAN remains in the vein of all of Seagal's other films, as it sucks. Look at the way he is introduced when his partner comes into his office "Yoi love man accounts.In you are in the wrong office" Steven responds with something that is splittingly witty side, or he would do if someone was able to understand a bloody word he said because for most of the film he just grunts. In fact, the only time I could see his dialogue was the scene at the school where he blew up the sniper holding the class hostage. <br /> <br /> "Do not make me kill you" <br /> <This is What would a police officer say to a suicide shooter? I'm just thinking that in another movie where Steven is not the hero (ie a good movie) the cop would say something like "Do not kill me, I have a wife and a couple of kids waiting at home." Either way, a suicide shooter will blow his head, but Steven saves his life by hurling the two through two sets of windows. Needless to say you should not try this at home <br /> <br /> As history advances Steven (I gave up calling him Jack though credit for the screen writer to give Steven a sensible name) becomes Involved in a plagiarism case where someone has stolen bits from other top films with serial killers. As Steven finds more victims, you can see him thinking, "What was the movie that starred Morgan Freeman as a cop?" While inspecting the bodies, oh and the action continues to return to the hero's domestic life only to know that this guy is good as a family man, this guy is very good as a family man it's a shame he's as bad as one movie star
