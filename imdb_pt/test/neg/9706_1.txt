I went to see suspecting that I would hate it, I did. Everything was wrong; It was as if they were filming a different book. Granted the sites and houses very lovely (if not a little miscast-yes, even the house was wrong for their parts) Keira was very modern, bland and frankly, I found it unpleasant to see her. If everyone sees Darcy as a sex god, the writer sees him as sexually frustrated and inadequate. Bingley was stupid and cranky (he's not meant to be) and the Bennett's turned out indigent and, for some unknown reason, farmers, this is incorrect and ridiculous. The very idea that Mr. Bennett would meet the door on his night gear with the rest of the family in their underwear in the middle of the night is stupid. They had servants. Mr. Collins was not repulsive and greasy, just stupid and unpleasant, Georgina Darcy was ugly and old, and Miss Bingley wore a sleeveless dress, which! It seems! It is historically inaccurate and to the end is unsatisfactory. I could go on for days. I hated it so much that not only was it nothing like the book, but I fear that for many people it will be your first experience with this great novel and it will give you the worst possible idea of ​​it. The BBC version is so superior that neither is funny and everything about this version is an insult to your memory. In short, if you must see this, make sure you have read the book first or viewed the BBC version otherwise, you will be taken the road deluded that is what it is, what it is not!
