I bought the DVD to pick up Julia Ormond. Well, I have this in spades. She was lovely in the romantic scenes; Too bad Bill Paxton was flying on autopilot throughout the effort. I almost missed my lunch when he took his big fat white off his flying suit jacket to say "get involved" with Julia. <br /> <br /> I noticed that Julia was very proficient in French while watching her in 'Sabrina.' I watched 'Sabrina' with the French soundtrack to see if Julia dubbed her own dialogue. They used someone else. In any case, Julia was chosen for this Dutch film about a native French speaker with enough English to communicate with the American pamphlet. Maybe they wanted at least one household name for the British / American market. To my strange eye, Julia's features might have been Belgian. <br /> <br /> The whole movie had a strange nature. It was a Dutch film about Belgium in World War II. I imagine that national pride would have required a theme of heroic Dutch resistance to the German invaders. The Belgians were much more passive during the period of occupation than the French or Norwegians. The most savage struggle of all took place in the Balkans, where Communist supporters of Tito gave the Germans restraints. <br /> <br /> I noted in another review that 'dbdumonteil' believed that Julia Ormond was an American rather than the actual British nationality. Maybe Julia's acting skills were great enough to make that impression. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie several times, it suddenly occurred to me how off-season the movie is. It is set on January 16, 1944, when the American plane crashes into the Belgian farm country. The trees seem to be in the middle of autumn with lots of leaves and the weather is warm. People walk in light clothes and the grass is still green. There is not the slightest trace of snow or ice. This must have been the mildest winter in Belgium. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie was a mess. Where to start? For anyone interested in the history of World War II, the film became a farce. The used reconnaissance aircraft was a huge 4-engine converted bomber. Such aircraft existed, but they would have required a huge escort of fighter to have any chance of survival. In fact, smaller and faster aircraft were readily available and would be much more suitable for the task. The movie's vital code books would never have been taken on the plane. The crew did not need this information to complete their mission, while the compromise of this information would have been a huge defeat of intelligence. Even with the premise of the movie, the first items to be taken from the aircraft would be the code books. They would be on their way to Berlin within 10 minutes of the arrival of the German troops at the crash site. <br /> <br /> The Daussois house, where 'Major Brice' took refuge, was a farm where no one had any interest in farming. The food would have been very scarce in Belgium at this time. The Germans would have required substantial quantities of food produced locally to sustain their forces. The family truck would have been expropriated long before the arrival of the American pamphlet. There would be no fuel available to run it anyway. <br /> <br /> The twist in the story in which Henri Daussois turns the American out of jealousy is pathetic. He would have to reveal everything he knew about resistance in order to live. He would have to function as a double agent to thwart any effective opposition. The woman with the secret radio would never have survived the war. 'Major Brice' got caught up in civilian clothes at the end of the movie. This made him a spy under the laws of war and responsible for execution without defense. He would not have given himself meekly to face interrogations unencumbered by the Geneva Convention. It's best to force them to kill you and spare your friends if possible. <br /> <br /> I have not read the novel on which this movie is based. If this film is a faithful adaptation, it shows a lack of abysmal development in the novel. Regardless of the novel, the writers could easily have produced a superior script that would not waste this opportunity to produce a much better film.
