You can always tell if I'm enjoying a movie because of the number of times I cross my legs, change position, make slight noises, etc., etc. The smaller = better. I've moved so many times throughout this movie that I've been able to bring down my gigantic tub of popcorn and get a massive thigh strengthening workout. Sobieski, a young actress who at some points in The Soldier The daughter never screams "gave some promise for his Thespian talents, played poorly in a poorly written part." Depressing fact number one. number three: Chris Klein had lines Number four Chris Klein played a class orator Woah Dummies from wealthy families come together Even worse, he actually tries to act but can only sound like a mentally disabled overactor in a separate version each more mellow of a Cecille B. DeMille movie.Returb your American Pies. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible in almost every way except for the light performance of Josh Hartnett as LeeLee's boyfriend Jasper.Fortunately, he refrains from trying to have many "moments," unlike all the other characters. Of course, that's why he's so much better than the rest and he really shows some guts here. h or are thinking of climbing a child who knows some things, he is their man. <br /> <br /> Hartnett is a sharp actor, but the rest no longer needs to be attacked. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (for poor Hartnett in this terrible movie) <br /> <br />
