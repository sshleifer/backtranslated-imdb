The only thing I had hoped this movie did not have was a smart and talkative motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This movie is just awful. I gave it a star, which means I enjoyed it tremendously. Bad acting, bad writing, bad direction, bad fight choreography. The only real actor in this movie is Martin Landau, who, of course, does a good job of playing the villain, even though the character is his evil CEO / Villain. Even the so-called "plot twist" in the end was not a shock. <br /> <br /> There was so much fun to do in this movie, I really liked it. And he had some awesome car wrecking maneuvers. Like bad movies? Check out this one out there. Want a good movie? Not here.
