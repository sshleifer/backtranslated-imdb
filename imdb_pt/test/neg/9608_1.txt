It's a shame that the IMDb does not allow you to give negative feedback. This is the most ghastly spectacle that has ever been foisted upon the American public by our generally friendly neighbors to the north. The parents are a troglodyte and a neurotic witch. He is as charming as a well-used hydrant, with the same standards of hygiene. She is a wax museum mannequin programmed with more neuroses than the entire cast of THE VIEW. Children are non-entities if feminine and repulsive beyond belief if they are masculine, especially the character-title. The boy is a serious candidate for most of Disney's insane, boastful, arrogant and vain male characters, which is saying something. This show was obviously conceived as the anti-BRADY BUNCH, but comes as anti-Christ. And why is photography so dark?
