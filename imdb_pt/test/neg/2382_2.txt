Ugh Unfortunately this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. None of the characters are remotely amiable, which makes this movie difficult to watch. They are all unhappy 30 year olds who do not take responsibility for their miserable lives. I only managed to spend half an hour of the movie, so there is a chance things will improve later, but I doubt it. I can not imagine five people as self-absorbed as they could be friends with each other for ten years. <br /> <br /> Three sex scenes in the first half hour were also disappointing as they had no relevance to the plot, and were clearly a gratuitous (failed) attempt to bring some life to this otherwise dull movie. <br /> <br /> Save your time and money, and skip this movie.
