Ed Wood is rolling in his grave. He could have made a hundred cult classics for the price of that hole. The worst screenplay in memory (makes "X-Men 3" shine like "Citizen Kane"); the most amateurish direction; pre-K cinematography; the more "special" effects (I'm talking about "Friday the 13th"); and launch a useless, revolting, and deeply disturbed maternal ward sequence. The lack of any talent or sensitivity that puts this garbage on the screen is impressive. The fact that the "industry" could reward anyone involved in this celluloid meeting with future projects should be a cause for serious alarm.
