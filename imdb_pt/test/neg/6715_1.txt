Sigh ... what can I say? <br /> <br /> Why would a horrible script like this one pass in the first place? It is not wrong to have a complicated plot, but it is not explained to the public properly! <br /> <br /> To have the wife explain the plot via flashbacks is pretty bad. Having such a tight edit for the fight scenes is bad too! Such a fanciful edition only appears in trailers. This wears out the whole look! <br /> <br /> And who are the Russians at the top of the film? Who's the guy being tortured? Is he with the CIA? <br /> <br /> This movie deserved not to be released in the theater. But it does not deserve to be produced in the first place. It's a joke to Hollywood.
