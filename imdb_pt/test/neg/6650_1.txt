This is one of those movies I was cheering for who could finish the movie faster. I wanted to see the cops killing Keaton and Garcia just to get it over with. Basically, this is the deal - Two cops have to die and a third has to have horrible burns on the face for Garcia's son to get a bone marrow transplant from convicted killer Keaton. Worth it? Not!
