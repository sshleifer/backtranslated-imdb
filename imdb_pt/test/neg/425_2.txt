Oh, well, I thought it should be a good deed, but it was not. Although Jeff Speakman stars there is nothing to watch. Only two fight for almost 1.5 hours, yak.A lot of talk and everything is so artificial you could not believe it. The plot is clear from the beginning. If you want a good deed, do not rent this movie.
