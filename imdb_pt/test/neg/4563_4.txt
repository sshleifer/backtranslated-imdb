This is an old dark house movie. A young couple hides around a strange mansion that they say is run by Satan, where they run from one in each of a ragged crew: a lady in distress, a monkey, a monkey man, a dwarf, several strangers. looking for people, and (for some reason) two Chinese. They end up in a throne room where the hero is forced to play a kind of "Price Is Right", involving a seven-step climb with seven illuminated footprints; hence the title. For my taste is much the same. The crawling through the halls of the fun house is fun for a while, then it becomes repetitive. Compared to Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton or Laurel and Hardy doing the same bit on two rolls, it's not really funny. Nor is it scary, and apparently it was not intended to be: the home is too absurd. Most films of this genre balance comedy with a genuine threat, and generally two - one that the characters are led to believe is real, and another to which it is a cover. Here the cover is not to be taken seriously, nor is it what is covered. Some moments of fun emerge from the mix, but it's quite fun. The novel on which the film was based was a direct thriller and I think it could have been played straightforwardly for better effect - and still could be.
