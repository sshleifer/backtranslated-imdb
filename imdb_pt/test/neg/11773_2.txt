I saw this one at Sundance, and I can not understand why it won the driving prize. It was painfully slow and literally colorless. It's the kind of movie that is only appreciated by movie snobs who think any movie that many people enjoy must be below them. <br /> <br /> This year's Sundance jury seemed to be making a conscious effort to reward the oppressed, ultra-low budget films. Okay, but this drag mess looks like a home movie. The mini-DV shot in a gray winter covered with snow results in a monotonous look at a monotonous movie. <br /> <br /> Certain motives (snakes) are beaten to death, despite the fact that they add nothing to the story. and do not make sense as symbols. <br /> <br /> Now, it was not all bad. Vera Farmiga is phenomenal in her role as a mother with a drug problem. She'll be going places, and she deserves it. His co-star Hugh Dillon also does a good job. Frankly, there are many good moments in this movie, but they just do not fit very well.
