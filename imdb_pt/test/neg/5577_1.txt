I carefully checked if there is another movie called like this, and there is! But I do not really think we all saw the same movie! There's no way ! How can you vote more than "1" for this movie? The idea of ​​this movie, let's say it's acceptable. Oh, and the performance of Dan Gordon (Chris) is very good. But these are the only two acceptable things in this project. Are the others ... horrible? It's a very delicate word to describe the acting of the other actors, the direction, the (so-called) "special" effects, to the way the crew was filming! I do not even like the way the camera operators were moving to shoot the scenes! This may be the most miserable movie I've ever seen. I really do not remember a movie lower than this ... Maybe there is, but ... I do not think so ... Ehh, what's done is done ... This is the movie and it's too late for Someone to change something. I voted "1", but my realistic vote starts with a "-" (minus) in front ....
