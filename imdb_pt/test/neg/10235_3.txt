Carole Lombard starred in this transition period film. This film is a typical example of a very old "talkie" (the first practical sound film was "The Jazz Singer", 1927). Overall, the acting in this film tends to be extremely wide and very melodramatic. <br /> <br /> The viewer can easily notice that the actors are still "acting" for a silent film, and this combined with the overly pronounced, overly serious dialogue (it seems that, most likely, a diction-elocution technician -drama was used extensively to teach the "silent" actors to speak the lines), creates some rather comical scenes that were not meant to be comical. <br /> <Later Carole Lombard's great acting capacity is almost unrecognizable under every gesture, melodrama and earnest interest. <br /> <br /> Mostly interesting as a historical curiosity of the period, and for being completely unintentional comedy. value of the camp.
