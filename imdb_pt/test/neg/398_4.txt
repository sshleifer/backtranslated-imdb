The opening of MORTE A VENEZIA resembles a Duran Duran music video with classical music and this is the highlight of the movie "In terms of what Theo?" <br /> <br /> In terms of everything, but especially excitement. I doubt there was a slower and slower film than this one. Yeah, okay, it's a European art film, so I did not expect Charles Bronson to massacre hordes of thugs, but still I expected some substance, if not a real plot. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the teacher Gustav Von Aschenbach visiting Venice. Gustav visits Venice and goes on a gondola, Gustav eats at an expensive restaurant, Gustav looks out of his hotel window and if it is emotion you want Gustav has a flashback <br /> <br /> Bad enough if that was the whole movie, but it gets worse because Gustav notices a handsome teenage boy. So you have a middle-aged scholar who covets a teenager he's seen, an old queen is getting obsessed with a stranger. Great idea for a movie? I also do not think so and thank God it was still a festival of yawning instead of some despicable forerunner of gay porn. <br /> <br /> I noticed that many people who praise this movie have tried to intellectualize it. I can only be monosyllabic and unpretentious in my opinion and say that the only subtext I could relate to was the physical and emotional disintegration of Gustav, but it was not caused by the adolescent beauty effete - it was caused by watching such a boring and ostentatious movie
