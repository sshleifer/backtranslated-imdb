After the exciting story of Kenneth Opel reinvigorated me back to the pleasure of reading during elementary school, I had high hopes for this series. The story of a bat traveling across the country to rejoin its colony captivated my imagination and resonated deeply with my imagination. Listening to this series, I started browsing the Bardel Animation website and liked what I saw. The character's design looked impressive and the fast-paced plot seemed to have been stretched respectfully throughout a thirteen-episode arc. Much was to my disappointment, then, when I decided to attend an early reprise of a morning. <br /> <br /> The opening episode shows our hero, Shade Silverwing, chasing a tiger moth in the deep hours of the night. Chirruping an echolocatory song, we see a nifty CGI effect, if gross illuminate the moth, and the chase takes on a frenetic curve as the little insect creates countless illusive copies of itself fooling its pursuer. As a biology lover, I had a decent understanding of the principles in force (moth-tigers can feel the sounds their predators use for echolocation and produce a sonic cover for themselves), but without such exposure I would surely have missed myself. A small complaint, I thought. Surely the director will fill us momentarily. I waited in vain. <br /> <br /> Once our protagonist falls in love with some of his comrades, we are treated to some of the most foolish dialogues I have ever seen on television. Chinook, Shade's childhood rival, begins to insult the diminutive hero with the most stupid lines I've ever seen on a show. I can understand the writers who are not producing Shakespeare, but one might think that they would have had some social contact in their lives - certainly enough to make communication appear natural. Oh, how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> Dubbing, though not horrible, was hardly a shining example of human achievement. "Oh Shade, you broke the law!" Shade's mother sighs. "You must come with me, young man." coaxa Frieda, the shrouded old man of the Silver Wing Colony. The actors try, but it hardly matters at this point, as the story becomes less and less convincing with each passing minute. <br /> <br /> While each episode deals with a problem of the week, as is typical of more television series, comprehensive story arcs pervade the saga, for better and worse. Although the main point of the story is Shade's reunion with his family, later episodes touch on other arcs of history, involving cannibal canes from the southern jungles and a fermented war between birds and beasts. The writers try to do a lot at once, struggling to pack as many promising ideas as possible, hoping that it will attract enough public interest to keep the bloody show going. Unfortunately, these attempts are futile for everyone, except for the people between the ages of eight and ten, in which this program is directed. <br /> <br /> While it's good to see the Canadian media perpetuate, it would be nicer if the fun of the series was not limited to the immediate family of animators or foam fans of Kenneth Oppel's books. There are worse things your kids might be observing than Silverwing, but much better programs are out there too. Pass the mediocrity and read the books.
