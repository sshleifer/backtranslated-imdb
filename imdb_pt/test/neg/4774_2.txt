It had potential ... it really did happen. But there is a lot about the movie that was ridiculous and laughable. I'm a horror movie and I thought it was stupid; as well as my 13 year old son! I was hoping to at least be scared. And, yes, the raw factor of vines squirming in people was there; However, the preparation to get to the ruins is just stupid, stupid, idiot. <br /> <br /> I really mean who does a walk ... in a jungle ... with a strange total. with some water and some snacks ... IN FLIP FLOPS, NOT LESS? Puh-lease! Better yet who goes to a foreign country and leaves the tourist area without an interpreter or being able to speak a little of the language? Are these people idiots? <br /> <br /> The German's brother is not heard and he does not ask for help? Who does not? Has he just met some Greeks and Americans to go on a little research and find?
