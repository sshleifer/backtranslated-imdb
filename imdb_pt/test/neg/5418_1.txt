One of the worst movies I've seen in the '90s. I used to use it as a reference when watching other movies; "At least it was not as bad as Dear Diary." Three absolutely useless segments, all with the director playing himself - and he's not that interesting. An entire segment about this hypochondriac going to the doctor. Another that introduces you walking through the field on your scooter. For three interesting minutes and another fifteen torturous minutes. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming factor was that the scooter scene was defined as 'Koln Concert' by Keith Jarrett. I asked myself to go home and rediscover that wonderful album. The best thing you can say about the director / actor / egotist is that he has great musical taste.
