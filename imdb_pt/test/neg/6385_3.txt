Well ..... horror this is not, but ....... !!! ??? A terrible low budget backwood-flic of the worst kind, kind of noisy ... so quite charming and funny to watch ... at least on my tv !!! A cross between Pete Walker, Herschell Gordon Lewis and ... let's say .... damn, I give up ... I just can not do any "prettier" resemblance to this useless movie. Everything is soooo wrong that I just have to enlist it in my collection of movies next to .... Death in Venice ..... Nekromantik ..... Blue Velvet and the good, bad, ugly ... right !! ??? People with some small talent to add bloody insertions or sexy happenings to film they buy offa other people should get this movie right away ... of course it's a fat gold mine waiting here, oh maaaannnn !!!!!
