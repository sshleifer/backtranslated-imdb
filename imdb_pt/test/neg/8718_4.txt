While David Lynch's version of Dune is unstable, clumsy and unfaithful to the novel, it is visually well-designed and well-represented. The best that can be said about the Sci Fi channel's attempt to turn Dune into a miniseries is that it is ambitious. In fact, this is pretty much the only positive compliment we can offer. The actors (with few exceptions) seem happy to recite their lines with the least possible emotion and less appropriate accents. The costumes seem to have been designed by someone with a large excess of Mylar fabric on hand and an unhealthy love for headwear that does not live up to it. <br /> <br /> In part, this miniseries suffers from living in the shadow of Lynch, well known. effort. However, he takes elements of Lynch's film that were not present in the novel and copies them almost wholesale (that is, the guiding sequence of Guild Steersman), and this only encourages a negative comparison with Lynch's film. One for the effort. D for just about everything else.
