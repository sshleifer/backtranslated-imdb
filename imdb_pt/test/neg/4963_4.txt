Think of this movie as a fan service, a wet dream for the admirer of the slasher genre. We start with a bloody prologue that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Go forward nine months and get the real meat of the plot: the virginal Mandy Lane is coveted by all the athletes and nerds of her school and is invited to spend a weekend at a ranch for three guys who think they can get lucky, and two bimbos obsessed with their weight and size of breasts. So ... you have a lot of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night who do not want to do anything but have sex, drugs and drink. The only other company is a ranch hand that may or may not be suffering from Gulf War Syndrome. Hmm ... maybe potential future suspect? <br /> <br /> So, as you probably know, all the guests of the house end up being slaughtered in various bloody ways and, for a change, the black man is not the first to die. There are a few conventions that still hold, such as the half-naked baby being chased by a car in a field. Or the lights fading mysteriously at night, while our "heroes" recklessly separate to solve the problem. Even with such a shocking turn at the end, the film is like an old horror of the 80s, updated to the nineties, and in that question he is successful. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he also inherits a lot from the movie. problems of the films of the time also, that is, the fine characters like paper and the predictability of the whole company. People are cut, shot, beaten, etc., but because of their innate hatred of the public and stupidity to put themselves in such situations, it is difficult to care when bodies accumulate. Someone is murdered, one of their friends goes out to look for them alone, BANG they are brown bread. Rinse and repeat. Maybe one day we'll have a script with plausible, intelligent, and friendly characters who make rational decisions but who are eventually fooled by a murderous genius. Until then, we have to tolerate teenagers with the I.Q of life in the pond being caught by a demented sweater. Oh well .. 4/10
