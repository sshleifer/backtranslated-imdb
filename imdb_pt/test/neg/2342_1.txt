To me, this movie is just a teen party movie very lame with all the normal cliches and boring stereotypical characters (Nerds, Jocks, popular girls, Sleezy guys, etc.) but with an underlying anti-drug / drinking theme. <br /> <br /> If you have the unfortunate chance to see this movie, keep an eye on all the references to responsibility and keep it real (I do not know how to say it) I think the only thing that had to do this cool movie, it would be if they played TV was on fire. That, or DVD, exploded ... 1 out of 10000 - Watch Animal House instead.
