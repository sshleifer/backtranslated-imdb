This is a family movie set in rural America of the 1950s about a boy whose uncle presses sheep accusing his dog Drum, starting not only a family legal dispute but also a community discord as his city begins to take sides. <br /> <br /> This is the formula movie that tries to be very touching and sweet. His biggest weakness is that the only people who could really act were Scott Bakula (defense lawyer), Ron Perlman (father / drum owner) and the dog. (John Shuck and Kathy Garver, "Sissy" from the original "Family Affair" as Uncle and his wife, were fine.) The kids were not so good (basically they seemed to be acting) and that's a problem when the movie really revolves around them (Aaron Fors, who plays the bully Donny, makes me wonder what Russell Crowe must have looked like as a kid, just untalented but with a lot of ham). Preferred line (spoken by the prosecutor after the closing speech of Scott Bakula's trial): "We'll be lucky if we do not get lynched." Favorite line spoken by Ron Perlman (after his son punches the bully): "Now making him your friend, that will be the difficult part." <br /> <br /> Beautiful enough to rent / buy used.
