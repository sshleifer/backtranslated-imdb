Maybe James P. Lay knows what to do in the sound department if a principal oversees him. <br /> <br /> In 'Dreamland (2007)', however, he can accomplish nothing as a writer or a director. There's absolutely nothing in this movie, no story, no character building, no event, no atmosphere, no plot, no twist, no performance worthy of that name. <br /> <br /> In any of these departments this movie is billions of light years behind any short film that has some real thought, even a minute. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with any of David Lynch's works! I really think it could be used as mental torture or negative propaganda material against the West. <br /> <br /> Tell only your worst enemies!
