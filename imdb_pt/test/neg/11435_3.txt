I was told that Jon was for some time in spiritual experiences. I think the movie is going to be interesting. Actually, it's nothing like that. It's not too deep for such a subject. "eternity" endless life. Experiences after death and "dejavu". The movie is not like a comedy, but it's not funny, at least not to express yet. It's so naive. Lovely movie but naive movie. A must avoid. The sequences of the Middle Ages seem to come directly from the fairy tales and is not at all. Eileen Davidson is so charming and Voight is doing the best she can. Normal is co-producer and screenwriter of this film. The movie was released directly on video, so I discovered it at a video store. It's a shame because I know that Voight was seriously involved in spirituality and the film is not as profound as that.
