This film is so copulative, clich√©d, clumsy and laborious, I find it astonishing that someone does not feel cheated by the experience of sitting through it. Here's the range of idiot cliches, ridiculous psychology and narrative simply impractical in this "hard-to-beat" high school performance: The tough guy is really a homosexual. The student is unhappy because his father pushes him and, in some way, that makes him commit incest. A teacher is bad for a student who dips his pants in class. A girl who is going out with the athlete mentioned above is really in love with him and "just wants a family". <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only saving grace is the student advisor scenes that are vaguely interesting, but most of the devices in this movie are so heavy that it's hard to believe. <br /> <br /> This movie does not show me anything about teenagers and I will not be surprised when it bombs, especially with teenagers. People who like this movie seem to be parents worried about their teenage children, and the boy is barking at the wrong tree if they think this movie will help "understand" teenage problems. I mean, what's the moral of this movie? "Hey guys, let's all look at each other and hug each other" GIVE ME A BREAK. Anyone who thinks you can reach a 14 year old with that kind of message needs to think back. In the 80's we watched the Kentucky Fried Movie, Xtro, Porky's, Evil Dead, Terminator, etc. This movie will fall on deaf ears. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is up there with another Australian "independent" film, "One Perfect Day", which was just as bad as this turkey movie. Thank God, no taxpayer was spent on that money. <br /> <br /> AVOID !!
