This was one of the worst movies I've ever watched. The story was about a female prisoner sent into space to try to save mankind, but what really happened was that the prisoner was actually put aboard a spaceship with a nymphomaniac lesbian commander. The whole story was about having sex over and over again. There was no need for all these images - just to create a pornographic movie. Of course we had to see the heroine of the movie having sex for about 2 minutes. I do not know what all this has to do with the real plot of the movie, unless I suppose the men watch it. I gave only 1 in 10 because there was no other lower rating. Do not waste your money or time - this has nothing to do with science fiction, but rather a movie for teenage boys to watch to see you. The creature was shown only over half of the film and looked like the alien in the movie with Signorney Weaver. Sorry for the entertainment.
