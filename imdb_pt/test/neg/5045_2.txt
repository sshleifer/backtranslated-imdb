You know that buccal antiseptic commercial where the guy has a mouth full of Listerine or whatever and he's trying really hard to avoid spitting in the sink? This is a great metaphor for this movie. I kept watching, even though it was very difficult. But keeping the mouthwash in your mouth will leave you feeling fresh. This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I should have spat when I had the chance. <br /> <br /> The premise is corny enough to be fun. For the first time in a thousand years, Gargoyles returned to Romania, and all the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things were dead long ago. It's up to Michael Pare and a few other undercover agents to get to the bottom of things before the Gargoyles go mad. Unfortunately, the premise is completely lost in poor dialogue and less enthusiastic action by human leaders. The best performance is done by the CG Gargoyles. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie looks like a Van Helsing from a poor man. If you check your brain at the door, this can take you through a bleak Monday night. Dei 3 out of 10 stars.
