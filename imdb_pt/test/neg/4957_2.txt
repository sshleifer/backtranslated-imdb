Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) is a college student with some serious anger issues. His family was brutally murdered when he was a child by a monster, and now he takes away his rage from everything and everyone. <br /> <br /> So when his teacher (Robert Englund) begins to show signs of monstrism, he learns that he has to control his anger and use it for good rather than evil, and fight against the creatures who have haunted their nightmares since that fateful night. <br /> <br /> Really earns your B-rated rating, but what was cool about it that did not focus on low quality CGI graphics. In fact, 0% of the film was CGI. The monsters were decently put together, and although the plot was missing, it was a bit watchable ... if only for once.
