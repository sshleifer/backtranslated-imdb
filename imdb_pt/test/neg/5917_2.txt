In the 1930s, Hal Roach Studios was at the top of the comedy world with stars such as Laurel and Hardy, Charley Chase and Little Rascals. Most of these films are exceptional and have stood the test of time. However, a lesser known Roach product was the pairing of Thelma Todd and Zasu Pitts (later Todd was paired with the equally untapped Patsy Kelly). As hard as I try, I can not stand these pictures - they are not funny. Besides, unlike Laurel and Hardy, there was not a shred of chemistry between Todd and his two co-stars. Before you think I'm an eccentric, understand that I've seen and reviewed several hundred Roach movies, as well as many other comedies, so I'm well acquainted with the genre and within that genre, this team is among the worst. Part of the reason I think I'm right about the team is that as a lower-level team at Roach, they got all the scripts that no one else wanted. If Stan or Ollie hated a particular plot idea, she was often given to Todd and Pitts / Kelly - and usually showed it. <br /> <br /> In this film, however, the team is at its absolute lowest level. It's hard to imagine a comedy with less laughter and a more artificial plot. The film begins with Zasu on the jury and Thelma as a defense lawyer. As for Zasu, she's a completely boring idiot. NOT the lovable kind (like Stan Laurel or Lou Costello), but just a totally annoying and annoying person who is pushy and nasty. As for Thelma, as usual, she is the "straight man" and as such has little to do, but reacts to the coarse behavior of Zasu. <br /> <br /> The plot involves Thelma defending a client who is accused of selling blasting. diet pills. Considering that the pills are highly dangerous, when the lawyer asks Zasu to try to swallow one, it seems stupid. And while they were called "pills," they were more like gigantic black bubbles that were bigger than golf balls. Swallowing them just seemed artificial and did not make sense - even for a low brow comedy. When they find out she swallowed the pill and it's really explosive, everyone panics and runs like idiots by the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Like I said, I'm not a fan of this team. However, even for those who want to like the movie, there is a legitimate laugh all the short! When I talked about this review with my wife (who also saw the movie with me), she thought my score of 2 was overly generous !!
