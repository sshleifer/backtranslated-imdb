While in Madrid I was able to see a copy of the film. Wow!! Gallo is incredible at that. Very unusual performance he gives. In addition to the genius of Gallo, the film however is a boring film that I have seen in my life and sometimes it is so poorly done that border on laughing. I'm also a fan of Val Kilmer, so it was part of the reason I made a big effort to see the movie. The problem is that Val is really only in one scene. Having your cast as leader is an insult to my intelligence and the rest of the cast. I just saw Stranded from the directors other movies. Both films are far below average, but both contain very interesting performances by Vincent Gallo. If you are as much a fan of Gallo, then I see this movie regardless of how bad it is. If you do not like Gallo then there is ZERO to love.
