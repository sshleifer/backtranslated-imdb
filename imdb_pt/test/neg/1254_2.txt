Having just read "One of a Kind" a week ago, I was thinking "That would make a great movie, especially now, when people know a little bit about poker and poker players." I was totally shocked to meet him while I was surfing the nightclub last night. I had no idea that someone had turned this into a movie. I grabbed it right away and watched with much anticipation. What a great disappointment! <br /> <br /> All the intriguing things about Stu Ungar were analyzed quickly, and instead I was left with a biopic that might have been about someone. Ungar may have been an idiot exhausted, but he was also a brilliant thinker who could read people instinctively. That's what made it so fascinating. Why not focus on it? <br /> <br /> And talk about diluting the real truth. This guy was excessive about absolutely everything: drugs, women, gambling, starvation, sleep deprivation. He played at sporting events from dusk to dawn, he would disappear for days while walking in crack pits, his body was perpetually emaciated, and yet, if he needed money, he could always beat anyone at ease by playing cards. Now that's a story! Much time spent in his childhood and personal relationships (although his ties to "Vincent" and his daughter were barely touched) and almost nothing about his drug use (which was exorbitant), his game insane and his incredible card-playing skills. <br /> <br /> It is probably too late now, but I hope someone will redo this movie properly. I had no problem with Imperioli. He is excellent. The script just left him with nothing interesting to say.
