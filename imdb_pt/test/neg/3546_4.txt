Matthew Aldrich. This is a name worthy of remembrance. This is the guy who put his fingers to the keyboard and created one of the worst scripts ever. Cliche. Predictable. An insult to the public's intelligence. <br /> <br /> Is he the only beneficiary of guilt? Of course not. Renny Harlin took this abysmal excuse from a screenplay and made a movie. Sam Jackson and Ed Harris actually read (or not) and chose to star. Guilt is plentiful. <br /> <br /> This is Denise Richards from movie scripts. There are not enough Razzies in the universe to give proper recognition to how truly horrible this writing really is. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, Samuel Jackson's profession is unbelievably new and the way it is presented is highly creative. , but at the end of the day, it's all just trimmings. Pretty trimmings. <br /> <br /> Pack it out the way you want it - trash writing is still written in rubbish.
