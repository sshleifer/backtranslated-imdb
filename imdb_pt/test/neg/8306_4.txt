Mel Welles, you must remember him as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman's Little Shop of Horrors addresses this somewhat interesting and distorted story of Dr. Frankenstein's daughter who continues her father's work after her death and creates a creature not because of his intellectual ability or his likelihood of being / doing well, but because of his sex appeal. You see, Tania Frankenstein, despite being a medical and scientist in her own right, is concerned with nothing more than sating her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sexual slave using her body with the fine brain of a man she do not love. The story is thin as a fabric here, and you get what you would expect: many malicious and suggestive comments (surprisingly most of the female lead), special effects that are not so special, performance that lacks depth of characterization and does not much action or suspense. And while this film is almost sterile with regard to good storytelling, Lady Frankenstein strangely has some aspects that make it watchable - not very watchable, but watchable, though. The Italian actress Rosalba Neri AKA Sara Bay / Bey plays the Baron's daughter with some aplomb and lots of sex appeal. It exudes desire and seduction very well. Her performance is very one-dimensional, but she is very beautiful and plays very well. She is also very open with her performance if you understand me. Poor Joseph Cotten, now regulated for European horror films for money, plays the father in a brief but competent performance. He is the main attraction, but it was gone before the movie really got into action. As for the rest of the cast, Paul Muller is somewhat effective as Dr. Charles Marshall, the baron's assistant and an admirer of the daughter for some time. As the crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village, police officer (I was not buying it), Mickey Hargitay begins to bombard Tania for answers - despite what you may think not to your satisfaction. Where the movie really loses credibility is in the final third of the movie, where the suspicious script, weak performances and dull direction all head south. The creature is revealed and looks quite ridiculous. The film ends a bit abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions very common in the 70's. Although not as bad and repulsive as some may want you to think, Lady Frankenstein is in fact a very flawed film with a few perverted yet intriguing nuances.
