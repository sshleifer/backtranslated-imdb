Hmmm, it's not a patch on the original Shaw Brothers. The fight is medium and looks very clumsy. The plot is as expected from a 1970s Kung Fu movie, confusing and stupid. Stupid voices for women, voiced in elegant English accents for men. I turned it off early and I love martial arts movies. Get the original, it is much better than this average movie, do not be fooled, I bought the wrong movie what I wanted was the Shaw brothers movie. I just started to comment, I'm just doing foreign and martial arts movies, this is just the beginning of my movie collection, I personally own the most modern martial arts movies. Hope you do not waste time watching this, it's just for Kung Fu fans of the 70's.
