This happens in 1920 Harlem. A black-owned nightclub has to deal with corrupt gangsters and cops. <br /> <br /> Terrible project of vanity for Eddie Murphy. He tries to mix comedy and drama and fails in both. The comedy is simply not funny and the drama is boring and misrepresented. Do you think a three-legged comedy movie - Eddie Murphy, Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor - would be great, but it's not. There is an uninterrupted chatter and the OPENING scene has a boy shooting at a man to death (this is shown to be OK). Also we have the beautiful Della Reese degraded in interpreting a madam. One of the "comedic" highlights has a long, unfortunate and terribly cruel fight between her and Murphy. A boring, offensive and stupid mess. Not the worst Murphy film, but very close. A 1 all the way.
