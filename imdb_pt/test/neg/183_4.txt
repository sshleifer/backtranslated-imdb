He who fights with monsters can be careful not to become a monster. And if you look for a long time in an abyss, the abyss will also look at you. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is from Nietzsche's Aphorism, from "Beyond Good and Evil." And that's what you find at the beginning of this movie. <br /> <br /> If you watch the whole movie, you doubt if it was the message Ram Gopal Varma Production wanted to convey. As the scenes arise one by one, quite violent and sometimes vomiting, the spectator is expected to forget Nietzsche's quotation and think differently. That to deal with few people you need dedicated people like Sadhu Agashe, who will have the license to kill anyone, not just writing FIRs (something unworthy of being made by the police, as we are led to believe). <br /> When TADA was revoked and the government wanted to approve newer and even more draconian laws, RGV's Satya did the necessary brain surgery without blood transfusion for the urban crowd thinking of a democratic country like the India. Within a year, the MCOCA was approved. When real-life encounter expert Daya Nayak 'became a monster on the way to fighting them' and was himself hired by MCOCA, 'Aab tak Chhappan' was made for 'false' impression among people about it. With the approach "you have to be a monster to save your nation" <br /> <br /> And people consumed it. No issues raised. He just praises and hopes that they will receive a Sadhu Agashe at his local police station, who will solve all problems and therefore will only let milk and butter flow everywhere. Blood? You can ignore it. <br /> <br /> Whenever Israel attacks Palestine or Lebanon, we hear voices like "India must also attack Pakistan in the same way." This movie is made for these psychopaths. If you do not give them this, they will probably die of boredom and LSD, and which will not. <br /> <br /> Hence this game of hate passion.
