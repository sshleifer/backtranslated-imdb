'The 4th Floor' is a decidedly mediocre film starring Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer with a troubled neighbor. Jane (Lewis) has recently inherited a grandmother's five-story apartment and, according to the owner, receives a ridiculously low rent rate. Her boyfriend (William Hurt as a scary time man) wants her to live with him, but she wants her own space. Then she moves in, and strange things start to happen, and since this is a B-series horror movie, there's a stupid, not-to-be-found-in-reality reason. As the intriguing Jane keeps trying to tell the others - her boyfriend, the police, the co-workers - what's happening, everyone thinks she's losing. So, of course, she has to face the problem - the lunatic who lives just below her. Neither scary nor interesting, the film's only saving grace is Lewis. She's an excellent actress but misused here, which is not to say she's not the best thing about this movie - because she is. She has a fierce charisma and holds the screen better than a dozen silicone bimbos that routinely populate this type of film. This type of film, however, is not worth it - which is ironic, since it is probably the only reason anyone would see it.
