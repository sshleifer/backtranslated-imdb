The mod squad begins "after" the formation of the "Mod Squad," without even bothering to develop any of the characters or show us why someone is doing what they are doing. <br /> <br /> In addition, most of the events in the film seem to help plot. Without even a bit of character development, the plot snakes from scenes from the Gen-X club to action scenes and vice versa. <br /> <br />
