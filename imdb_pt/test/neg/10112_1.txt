Hey boys and girls! Never rent, or God forbid, buy this piece of garbage. I've rarely seen a movie in any genre as bad as this. The acting is actually worse than me and my friends when we were 7 and in the first grade we had to act before all the parents and siblings. In fact, we would have been taken to the Oscars if we compared to the actors in Darkhunters. The story is terrible, the makeup is terrible, the filming is terrible, the set is terrible, the direction is terrible, and so on. I can not find anything worth the money to see this movie .. Maybe, except all the cats, that my girlfriend thought was cute. Please use your money on other things than in this movie .... I could not even see the last 15-20 minutes of the movie, it was so terrible .. If anyone really liked this movie, I would really like to hear from you , and I'll try to see if I can get some advice in a psychiatric office near you .. 0 out of 10, actually below if possible .. Not worth the DVD or tape is on. .
