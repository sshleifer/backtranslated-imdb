The first time I saw this movie was with this beautiful girl that attracted me. we had a lot of fun laughing and generally making fun. So my impression was that it was terrible, but watchable for the cheeseyness value. Then, as part of our anniversary, we watched together again on video. As it turns out, the film is simply terrible and unattainable. It's amazing how pretty girls can change the look of the world.
