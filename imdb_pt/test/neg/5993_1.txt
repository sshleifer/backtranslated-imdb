The creature? Yes, this is the movie they star. Hell would seem infinitely more frightening if the damned were forced to watch this for all eternity. Six university students meet in a condemned hospital to save money and end up victims of an ancient monster who must claim five victims before returning to the "bleak world from which he came!" In addition to having great problems with logic and coherence (apart from the fact that it seems to be unfinished), this disaster is terribly represented, written, edited (by J.R. Bookwalter) and directed, and makeup FX almost nonexistent. It's also significantly smaller than it claims (in just 80 minutes), but I'm not complaining. It's the worst movie I've ever seen from Full Moon Productions by executive producer Charles Band and the guy is BAD! <br /> <br /> To note, I almost did not bother with a review, but this has got inexplicably good reviews here and I realized that a varied opinion was in order. Proceed with caution!
