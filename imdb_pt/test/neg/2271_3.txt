Normally, when the BBC launches a TV series, a certain guarantee of satisfaction is used. Normally, the TV series is splendid, even if the story is boring, you can trust that acting will be worth it. When I came across Persuasion, here at the local library, I was looking forward to a nice evening because I read the story. <br /> <br /> I'm happy that I read the story first, or I do not think it through. In addition, I was relieved to learn that the production date for this TV series was 1971, since I had thought until that moment that the BBC had lost. It's really bad, and should be used in acting schools as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The only positive thought I have about this series is that the people in this movie will not appear or be involved in any movie. BBC or another product this century, in addition to the young Musgroves sisters, who were apparently taking their first steps in acting, and doing very well under the direction given otherwise.
