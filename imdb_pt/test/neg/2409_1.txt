If you tried to make a bad movie, you could not do worse than this. I can not imagine anyone paying good money to see garbage like this in a theater. The thing that really leaves you is getting hypnotized into looking at the whole thing just for the astonishment of seeing how bad it can get. The redeeming facet of this film was to see the words "The End"
