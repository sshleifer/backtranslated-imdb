I watched the first scarecrow movie and did not teach that, although I knew it was first class, he actually had some decent blood and the guy who played the scarecrow was an amazing acrobat and had some good skills. The effects were better and the costume looked better than this movie. <br /> <br /> I borrowed this with an open mind, I'm also a fan of ken shamrock (former UFC super super champ) and was hoping it would be a good movie. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong, the movie sucked, the monster was pathetic both in appearance and in fact being scary, the plot was so predictable that it was like watching the movie in pre- visualization, I would already guess what would happen, the music was so bad, with a horrible song of lip sync that made me want to punch the screen. <br /> <br /> In general, avoid this fucking movie. <br /> <br /> Save some money.
