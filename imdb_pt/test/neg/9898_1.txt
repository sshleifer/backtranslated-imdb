I wish I had read the comments on IMDb before watching this movie. The first hour was good, though it made me wonder why everything was centered in Chicago and why no one reported any weather anomaly outside of the US. Acts isolated from nature (of this magnitude) are unthinkable. But beyond the first 60 minutes, the movie trails like an endless story. The script is horrible. As for the actors, choose very poor. Only the people hired to run in panic follow their roles. But I have to agree that this movie has some good 'special effects'. If you rented on a DVD and would like to watch the movie, despite the reviews, play it at the maximum speed your player can afford!
