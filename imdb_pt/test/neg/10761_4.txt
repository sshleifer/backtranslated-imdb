This strikes me how anyone can rate this movie very well. It is not intended to call you from afar. How the guy managed in a short time to build a maze of wood from underground rooms is pretty ridiculous or maybe he was the greatest carpenter since Jesus. The obese sheriff played by Hoyt Axton looked like a refugee from the Jerry Springer show and I found the blonde Jennifer Jason Leigh quite simple. We have an expression here on the mutton of the United Kingdom, made like lamb, that fits perfectly in her. It was not at all bad, however, I enjoyed it immensely when the final credits rolled and 'The End' came out was very bright for this potch hotch from a TV movie that if it had been a movie release would have been put on video and in stores off in no time at all.
