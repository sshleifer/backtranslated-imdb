So it's a space movie. But it's a low budget. You ask, "What about the effects?" The effects are sometimes good and sometimes very, very bad. I mean badly. And notice that I started with the effects. <br /> <br /> There's a story here, but it's told in what I think is the wrong order. I am not referring to a wrong order of the Tarantino style. I mean, it's told in a completely meaningless arrangement. Most of it is about a mother (in the future, because you know, it's science fiction) as told by her daughter, which is mostly exposure made in narrative from the perspective of the daughter. Only after spending the first hour and listening to Paul Darrow's voice as a computer do you realize how much constant narrative would have been more tolerable had you read it. This narrative is so constant and inclusive, that the actors on the screen hardly say a word for the first hour. <br /> <br /> There is also a lesson here for you and the next filmmakers: if you are not doing 2001 and want to have some action (this does), then please hire a good fight choreographer. Otherwise, your fights will seem, well, what's in BATTLESPACE. And notice that the title has the word "battle." Ugh. <br /> <br /> I think this may be the classic scenario of trying to make a movie based on nothing more than a concept. And some effects My biggest surprise is seeing IMDb listing this movie as costing $ 1.8 million. When you compare it to something like PRIMER, which worked out better with a budget of a few thousand, one realizes in low budget cinema, it's all about the story. I was not expecting much - but I was still disappointed. Two of ten stars.
