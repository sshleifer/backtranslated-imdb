I honestly do not know where to start when reviewing a film as pathetic as Ernest Goes to Africa. In addition to two or three good laughs spread throughout the film, there is nothing positive about this waste of time and life that lasts an hour and a half. It's incredible that anyone has managed to get together a group of people willing to act, film and edit this junk, and even more incredible that this is the eighth edition of the Ernest series. During the film's opening credits, we see Ernest posing alongside various African objects, such as wooden masks and heads of African animals, making faces and gestures that would probably make most of the children in the third grade laugh. This opening scene gives the viewer a taste of Ernest's frequent moody attempts, and shows how his comedy collapses 95% of the time. <br /> <br /> The first thing that really impressed me about this movie was how bad acting is. Everyone in the movie is a typical C movie actor, but Linda Kash stands out as especially terrible. She is the epitome of overcoming; all of your speeches are delivered with a shockingly inhuman enthusiasm that you would find only in a high school play. Most high school drama students could probably have replaced these actors and presented a more powerful performance. Jim Varney at least exhibits some comedy ability from time to time, but for most of the film he only acts like a complete retard, trying to be humorous by making stupid faces and speaking in different voices. <br /> <br /> Ernest Goes to Africa begins in Africa, where an archaeologist stole two invaluable gems from an African tribe. The stones return to the United States, where an unidentified man is seen running from several henchmen through a flea market. He hides them in a bucket of items "two for a dollar" and then leaves the scene. Ernest is looking for a gift to buy for Rene, a waitress that he likes, so he goes to the flea market and of course buys the invaluable jewelry. Later he takes them back to his house, paints them and glues them to make a yo-yo. He gives the yo-yo to Rene and she explains that they can never be together because he's just an average shmoe, and she wants a man of adventure. Rene and Ernest are found by the henchmen and are taken to Africa to be held as prisoners. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie really does not make sense. Once Ernest is in Africa, he falls from the truck in which he is carried and falls into a river. In the next scene, we see him as a Hindu servant named "Hey You". His skin is dark and he is using a loin cloth. At first, I thought Jim Varney was playing another role in the film, besides Ernest, but I immediately recognized Ernest's idiocy once Hey You started talking. <br /> <br /> Another scene that pops into my mind as being completely ridiculous is the car chase scene in the African desert. Rene and Ernest took an ostrich pickup truck and are being chased by the henchmen. Driving at about 30 miles per hour on a fairly straight road, the henchmen are shooting at Ernest, which is at the rear of the ostrich truck. Ernest, on the other hand, is throwing ostrich eggs at the henchmen and the driver. The henchmen never hit Ernest once during the five-minute chase, but Ernest is able to drive them and the driver down, causing the car to veer off the road and explode into a gigantic column of smoke. I should also add that Ernest is throwing eggs, two at a time, from a large bra. <br /> <br /> The scenery is also incredibly poor in this film. There is a large part of the film in which Rene and Ernest are walking in Africa, trying to find civilization. During the walk, we see them walking through the fields and jungles, which probably could have been filmed anywhere in the United States. The fields are simply grassy fields, with no indication of being near Africa (they could have at least digitally added some African trees in the background), and the jungles look like Connecticut woods with Papier mâchè skulls, vineyards, and thorns hanging from the trees. According to the poster, the film was filmed in South Africa, but I still did not believe it. <br /> <br /> The film continues, Ernest makes fun of Ernest's joke. The rest of the film does not make any sense either; all African tribes speak English for some reason, and Ernest is later challenged to a "Battle of Truth" by the henchman, who suddenly wears a ninja-like outfit, but also looks a bit like a bondage submissive. . The henchman has a table of axes, swords, knives and apples before him, while Ernest has a table with a sandwich, a teddy bear, and some other worthless items. However, Ernest wins the battle and somehow ends up saving the day. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is painful to watch. I could not handle it at once; I had to stop halfway and do something productive for a few hours to compensate for the lost brain cells while trying to appreciate Varney's mood. They should put the Surgeon General Notice in the box so people know they will actually be a bit more retarded at the end of this movie. I would have to say that of all the movies I've seen, none comes close to being as pitiful as Ernest Goes to Africa.
