OK, let's start with the best. The building. although difficult to believe it had electricity and running water after 35 years and a fire, the horrible walls and odd items found throughout were interesting. Also, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> As for evil, it's made by the WWE movies. WTF is this supposed to make you want to see it? if anything, stay away. horrible idea for them to make movies and let Gregory Dark direct him. bad choice. the previous ones were more interesting and fun. <br /> <br /> I can not even begin to discuss how bad this movie is. untalented actors and a disappointing and vague plot. apparently many of the actors are from that show "all saints". It's a wonder because I've never heard of them or their show. In addition, the bus driver, whom you do not even see, just him closing the door, had more action than almost all together. at least it deals with stunts for some decent movies. <br /> <br /> I like to watch horror movies, I really like. but this one blew a lot, the whole audience was laughing and cheering the characters in the middle of the way. very irritating. the child behind me was beating more during the previews of other horror films. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie to watch, let alone if you have to pay for it.
