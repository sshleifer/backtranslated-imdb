I had not read any of the books nor seen the first movie, so after receiving passes for a preview, I had no expectations. <br /> <br /> "Angels and Demons" was a confusing and confusing film, with no direction or credibility. There was very little development of character and I never felt worried about the situation of the protagonists; the opposite was true, I was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would succeed, since the first half of the movie was almost exclusively focused on why the Illuminati are who they are. <br /> <br /> The movie jumps from one place to another. site with little explanation or reason and hopes that the viewer believes that everyone in the movie is an ally when they meet for the first time. Any analytical mind will realize that this is highly unlikely. <br /> <br /> The climax is extremely clich√© and leaves you wondering what happened and wondering why no one considered some of these points, it seems very complicated and unnecessary. Actors are not particularly credible in their roles, especially because I found it hard to believe that church scientists, teachers, and men would act the way they do without taking into account the consequences of their actions. Events that happen are not plausible at all, and the pace of the film is questionable, with the characters jumping on a tight schedule and I had to question how the protagonists manage to get from one place to another, each time. The most enjoyable part of the film is cinematography, I found it a beautiful movie to watch, but it was a mess, which I thought would not be worth paying to see in theaters.
