Some of the critics of this film were extremely "generous" with praise. I personally was disappointed, because because of these reviews, I was optimistic when opening credits started rolling. <br /> <br /> The very familiar story goes like this: The deformed boy and his father live in Louisiana. swamp Local boys ridicule and torment him. Local boys start Gruesome, oh sorry, I mean Victor Crowley's booth catching fire with it on her. Dad tries to rescue his son, formerly known as Eddie Munster, and accidentally finds an ax in the boy's head. Victor becomes a murderous ghost who pursues the unfortunate ones who come into his domain. Oooo ... scary. <br /> <br /> One thing I liked about Hatchet was that it was never taken seriously and some of the jokes even made me laugh. The thing is, I got tired of the slap-strips of horror B polished in Hollywood. I like to laugh and I like a good scare, but this movie did not offer a solid dose of either. As for Crowley being the next Michael, Jason or Freddy ... Pumpkinhead has a better chance.
