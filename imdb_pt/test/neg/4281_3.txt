Being a big fan of Disney, I was very disappointed when I saw this crap. The animation was beautiful, and the backgrounds were amazing, but I believe the good animation does not make up for a weak script, and a weak story. I will have to disagree with people who say that it is not suitable for children. Yes, there are some deaths in the movie, but is not death something that children should at least be exposed to? But I digress. The script is full of bad jokes and stuck jokes ... the kind I could expect from most dream movies. The music was mellow, the morality forced (and forced without any charm) and the characters would explode into songs at totally inappropriate times. The characters were also cold, and I really could not muster any form of excitement for them (bar irritation). I am a big fan of jungle book, Aladdin and Emperors new groove, but this Disney movie was a total waste and total time ..... do not watch it !!!
