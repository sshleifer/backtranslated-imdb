That was painful! Recently donated as a free DVD with a British newspaper, this British-Belgian co-production of 1977 (could have fooled me, looks at least ten years older than that) is quite deservedly obscure and if you go half-way , consider yourself a trouper. The combination of live action and animation is rudimentary, at best, and absolutely terrible at worst, which makes you wonder why it was decided to try doing the movie that way when the technology was not really there. Harris is no more than a human prop and the animation is one of the most boring and lifeless I've ever seen, with the obligatory moments of 'trip' (especially where the brainiac subtrato character animation is involved) that have yielded countless Cartoon. features from the late sixties onwards dated instantly. Don Black's script provides a convincing argument for the generally resilient lyricist to stick to what he does best, and the pace is so slow that even the younger ones will be bored. As for adults, follow Jonathan Swift's original novel.
