I was drawn to watch Shark Hunter for the comments posted on IMDB. The movie was bad, but the shark was cool blah blah blah. So I rented it. Bad idea. This movie was bad on so many levels that I'm glad I had the option to move forward. The shark itself is ok. His appearance is decent and it's the only thing that saves this movie from getting a 1 (dei 2). The acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is so deplorable. I was not expecting much, but I was surprised by this success. Antonio Sabato Jr. is some kind of biologist or scientist or something, I was not really paying attention. He descends with the dispensable crew of this submarine to find out what happened to this submarine station that the shark took off course. By the way, all the scenes that show someone working underwater are not underwater. First of all, if they are just going down to find out what happened to this season, what about all the huge tranquilizing darts and the harpoons and stuff. Are these things you normally carry when investigating an accident? The shark theory was advanced by Antonio while he was on the way, so it was not like they were in knowing what they were facing. Antonio and this young college student, horrible actress, by the way, just jump into the controls of the submarine when the sub is in trouble. What is up with that? Unless everyone is getting some kind of sub-training before they graduate from high school, I find that a little silly. The director seems to think that if team members are working in the background, it's a good idea to put someone else in the background. Metal crafting is very important when you are in a sub I think. Anyway I could go on, but I've said too much. Bottom Line: Go to your local video store, rent this video and then destroy it. Then send an email requesting IMDB to remove all records from that movie from the site. All the memory and evidence of this movie must be destroyed. We can do this if we work together.
