This third installment of the Scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot. I know, I know ... but how good is this? Well, let's not be silly. It's still pretty bad, but compared to the first two, it's a great movie. Again filmed in digital, with decent lighting and good camera work. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> When a college baseball team goes crazy new members, one gets diabetic coma. Of course, they abandon him in a cornfield, tied to a scarecrow. According to legend, the soul of the boy is transferred to the body of the scarecrow, which comes to life and causes terrible revenge, well, practically everyone. The co-eds head for the beach, which is somewhat close to the cornfield. On the sunny beach, they are killed one by one by the whistling of the scarecrow. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Brian Katkin does a credible job of bringing such much-needed drama to the film. Unfortunately, the drama jumps on the good and falls on the common cheese. Much of the acting was fair, but there were some really awful chunks, including a horrible piece of poorly done lip synching. Some plot points were left unresolved, and most were used to get someone alone so they could be slaughtered. Again, better than the previous installments, but still lacking.
