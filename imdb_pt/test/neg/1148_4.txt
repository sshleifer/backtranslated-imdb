Arthur Miller has always been known as one of America's great playwrights for such works as "Death of a Salesman" and "The Crucible". "Focus" is one of his lesser-known pieces brought to the silver screen. However, knowing what a great playwright, Arthur Miller, I doubt his original piece was much like the movie. The film appears as empty and stereotyped, with William H. Macy as a non-Jew confused with a Jew by anti-Semitic neighbors in World War II in Brooklyn. Do not get me wrong: the acting is good, and I assume the people behind this movie are probably trying to make a point about racism, but the film just does not work. Macy, Laura Dern and David Paymer simply can not create an effective story with the material here.
