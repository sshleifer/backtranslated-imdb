I love documentaries. They are among my favorite movie genres. Before seeing this movie I had not seen one I did not like. <br /> <br /> The premise for this movie is great. The execution is well done. There were times when I laughed and smiled. However, as the film was more tedious and annoying became. This could have been something special had the subject not been so inarticulate, childish, and inept. I appreciate your passion for the movie, but I stopped complaining. If you are low on money, you may not have as many children or spend a lot of money on alcohol. Maybe you should have gone to film school, or at least graduated from high school. Maybe you should have lived the life and obtained perspectives and experiences that could add to your vision. <br /> <br /> There are so many people with interesting, funny and poignant stories. Seeing this guy chosen over any of them is nothing short of rude. If you want to make a documentary about a filmmaker, why not make one with someone from China or Iran, a filmmaker with real problems? <br /> <br /> Two final questions: <br /> <br /> Who takes a child to see Apocalypse Now? <br /> <br /> How many times did this guy say "man"?
