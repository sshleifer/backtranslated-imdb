Foolish walkers will camp in the mountains of Utah only to encounter a murderous and disfigured gypsy. <br /> <br /> The prey is a beautiful run of the mill slasher movie, which mostly suffers from lack of imagination. The characters of the victim are very familiar idiot teenagers, which means no one cares about them, we just wonder when they will die! Not to mention it has many extravagant moments and is filled with endless and unnecessary footage of nature. However, it has a few moments of interest to fans of slasher, the occasional touch of scary atmosphere and a decent soundtrack to Don Peake. Still, it's normal for the movie trailers dead. <br /> <br /> There are much better movies in this regard, but above all, The Prey can be watchable enough for diehard slasher fans. While it may be more rewarding to watch Just Before Dawn (1981), Wrong Turn (2003), or even The Final Terror (1983) again. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
