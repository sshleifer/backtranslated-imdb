This film is strictly for fans of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. <br /> <br /> I get angry at TCM for showing this mess more often than the Bachelor Mother, the wonderful original. I get even angrier than some Hollywood boobs thought it would be a good idea to redo the Bachelor Mother, filling her with some songs that are only meant to stop the flow of a cute comedy. Instead, Hollywood could have spent the time, money, energy and talent wasted on this horrible remake to give us something new and original - Wow, what a concept! <br /> <br /> Single Mother (the original) with Ginger Rogers and David Niven are a spicy stew, boiling with sexuality. It's a 1930 wink at Hays office. Bundle of Joy (the remake) with Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher is strictly milk and biscuits. It's a 1950s handshake with Eisenhower. Which cast do you prefer to watch - Debbie Reynolds, Eddie Fisher and Adolphe Menjou, or Ginger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn? For me, all the cast members of the original version are way better than their counterpart in the remake. <br /> <br /> In the original, a beautiful young Ginger Rogers is at its peak. David Niven offers perfectly like a somewhat spoiled, sophisticated and still confused heir to a wealthy department store mogul. And I always love seeing Charles Coburn in a movie. In Bachelor Mother, he is invaluable as the aspiring to a desperate grandfather. <br /> <br /> In Bundle of Joy, Debbie Reynolds is your usual self. She is well in this role, although her performance (along with Fisher's) completely changes the tone of the story. As an actor, Eddie Fisher is useless. He is completely devoid of "presence" on the screen. Here he is very healthy for this story. His acting is completely bland and clueless. Likewise, his singing is so tasteless and banal that it has been completely forgotten by the world at large. The only time he is not completely painful is in Butterfield 8 - where, incidentally, he does not sing. Here, Fisher's lame performance is enough to ruin this movie. Adolphe Menjou, a favorite actor, offers competent performance, but not one of the best. He is more arrogant than Commander. He and Fisher are not convincing as father and son. <br /> <br /> Do you see a musical for music, the story being just incidental? Or watch a musical for a story, with some good music (hopefully) used for tempering? If the former, you may like this lame remake. Otherwise, you're much better off watching the non-musical original from Ginger Rogers, Bachelor Mother.
