Beautiful visuals and many fights do not make a good movie. And that is precisely what happened here. <br /> <br /> Firstly, let me admit that I am still playing FFVII (I intend to order it soon). However, I did a research to familiarize myself with the characters and the story. However, not everyone has the luxury of time to research things like this, and Advent Children requires knowledge of FFVII to be necessary. <br /> <br /> Despite incredible visuals, I can not say that long ago this is New. We saw this in Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, and in addition to a better move, I can not say they did a lot of super-daring things with that. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes - well, they're a little fun. Yet how could we doubt the outcome of any of them? This was a boring classic - there were three fights with the bad guys, following the standard procedure (the hero, Cloud, is crushed, so he almost gets there and gets crushed, and finally wins). The reason I say it was tediously classic was that it is heavily used, but in this case it is poorly executed. I'll talk about this later. <br /> <br /> The English dub looked good to me, although I have not seen it in Japanese, so I will not judge the Japanese stunt, but only English. I'll say it - I've heard many better ones, even in my limited repertoire. <br /> <br /> And now, the plot. Ummm ... what a plot? Let me be frank, this movie is nothing more than a fan service, a chance to see the FFVII characters on the big screen with beautiful eye drops. As I said earlier, the fights seem to happen for no reason. The opening fight is never explained, Kadaj seems to have no ambition to destroy the world nor any real motivation to do anything unpleasant. Cloud sits around depressed for the entire movie, and virtually everyone gets a mandatory turnout. <br /> <br /> Actually, FFVII was a set piece. Advent Children is anything but. If they managed to give everyone a significant role in the story (Star Trek: First Contact proved that it was possible, I might add), then that could have been a lot better. Of course, that would have changed the plot too, which, let's be honest, is almost ready to be better than what we got. <br /> <br /> The characters were also generally unused or virtually forgotten. The members of Avalanche (which is the group with which Cloud worked on FFVII, for those who do not know) get 2 scenes (3 in the case of Vincent Valentine, and some win even less). Hell, thugs get more talk than these guys, and that's too bad. <br /> <br /> The music ... well, I do not care if Nobuo Uematsu is God himself, he screwed up this great Time movie. The Winged Angel of Advent One was the only decent play. Otherwise, he could not decide whether it would be epic (and orchestral) or entertaining (with guitar). As he shifted from one to the other, you felt as if he had carried a sledgehammer to your head. <br /> <br /> And that last point about whether this movie was epic or fun ... it tried to be both, and failed miserably. Honestly, you can not please everyone and do everything. The movie also tried to be deep (you can be epic and deep, or fun and deep, but all three are too much), but also failed here. The last scene, which is reminiscent of a baptismal ceremony, was thrown there for what seems to be a matter of it. You do not have to be a Christian to just nod and cry there. That scene just did not belong in the movie (and not even Aerith's frequent appearances - she's dead, Jim!). <br /> <br /> Given how fantastic I heard Final Fantasy VII, this movie is nothing. short of a gigantic deception. Because of the beautiful visuals, I give 2 out of 10.
