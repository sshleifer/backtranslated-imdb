A frustrating documentary. The son of Louis Kahn, who saw his father only minimally during his childhood because he was a member of only one of the three separate families that his father created, assumes the task of trying to learn more about his father through an exploration of his architecture and life his. It sounds like a great idea for a documentary, but ends up being uninteresting and uninteresting. Sadly, the basic problem is that Kahn's son, Nathaniel, is not only one of the protagonists of the film - he is also director, writer, producer, interviewer and narrator. Nathaniel seems very inexperienced and possibly very close to the material to function well in any of these roles. Also, while he seems to be a nice enough guy, he does not have a lot of onscreen presence, so the fact that he's the only constant in the film becomes exhausting. Nathaniel also appears as an unprepared amateur interviewer - there are several points where an interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement and the camera cuts to a Nathaniel scene offering little more than an empty stare and a kind of shy "ah-huh", as if he was a little panicked that he would have to come up with something to say in response. Sometimes I felt embarrassed to see people who might have had really interesting things to say about Kahn (or at least better things to do with their time) seeming to realize that they were in the hands of an interviewer who would trust them. to direct the conversation. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel's double role as documentary filmmaker and lost son seems to do more to hurt the film than to help. It turns out that some of the interviewees are reluctant to really open up about the negative aspects of Kahn's personality and career, presumably because Nathaniel is not clear whether he is wanting to find out the truth or simply wants to hear good stories about his father. - preferably those who will confirm their hope that his father really cared more for Nathaniel and his mother than it seems likely. Your passive approach as an interviewer can originate directly from this conflict. The only person Nathaniel pushes at is her own mother, but these conversations tend to look a bit like a bad teenage drama (are not you angry, Mom?) And do not offer much in terms of helping us (or Nathaniel) to understand Kahn or the loyalty he evoked from those around him. <br /> <br /> What the film desperately needs to shape by an experienced and independent hand, not to exclude Nathaniel but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience. away from the material, thinking more about what the respondents could contribute to and hopefully cutting off the parts of the documentary process that just do not work, like the weird segment with the guy who says he saw Kahn die (which made it seem that Nathaniel was being fooled by some madness) or the whole part of staying with Kahn's cousin, who had nothing to add about Kahn or Nathaniel.Many times Nathaniel makes us see him standing or standing near a K building ahn strange buttonholi to tell them that his father was the designer. I understand why these things may be important to Nathaniel and that showing the documentary process is sometimes interesting, but this is one of those examples of when. a documentary can be very personal. <br /> <br /> As an aside, I thought the score for the movie was great! (But, one of the strangest moments at all for me was when, during the Kimball Museum of Art tour, the voice-over quoted Kahn as making a comparison between Beethoven's NONTH Symphony and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Kahn was a great architect and of course he was an unusual human being and had an intriguing life. story. There is definitely a good documentary to be done about it. One is sympathetic to Nathaniel's quest for the father he did not know, but I'm not sure if this is an interesting story. It does not work so well in this movie.
