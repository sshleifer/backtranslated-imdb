Years ago, Sara, a young girl witnessed her parents being murdered, now as an adult she suffers from various mental illnesses (did I mention she has an imaginary friend?) This movie calms the viewer, not in a sense of tension, but a feeling of drowsiness. Unconditionally mortal, I found it difficult to sit still as I felt my eyelids growing heavier with each endless minute of stupid talk and supposed "mysteries." Is Sara going crazy? or is it paranormal? A better question would be: Who cares? And the answer to that, no one. No one at all. Ignore this movie, spare yourself some more suitable time to perform other worthwhile tasks. <br /> <br /> My notes: D-
