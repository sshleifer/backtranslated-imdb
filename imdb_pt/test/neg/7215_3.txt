I happened to see a promo for this movie on Spike last night, it was grouped with a swazy repetition of Patrick from another movie he made and I thought swazy was in that sequel ..... boy was wrong I ... I see the screenwriter also starred, and I'm thinking that the budget was a bit tight. I'm surprised to see Will Patton in the movie that he has far better credits for his name than to be playing in a "c" movie like this. Bussey jr was striving so hard to portray the image of his father (one of the best bandit actors of all time) who failed miserably the only redeeming qualities of the movie were the "girls," handsome and with not only T & worth the time or your hard-earned dollar to rent it
