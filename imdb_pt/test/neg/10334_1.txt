But certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time. <br /> <br /> I bought this cheap DVD, with Sandra Bullock as headliner on the case. This is false advertising - it's on screen for almost 10 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there was no other sales pitch for this film - the dialogue was horrible, the issue apparently was made. by someone who was stuck in Quaaludes, the direction was ... well, let's just say that my 14-year-old daughter could do better, but I hope she never sees that slight compliment from me. It's possible the cat in the family did better. Sandra does a meritorious job for the first film, in the short time she's on the screen - and that's the only redeeming quality of this film. Stupid story, poorly written and transferred to the cinema, as only a 7th grade media class should be able to do. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a failure.
