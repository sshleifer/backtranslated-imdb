Once upon a time Quentin Tarantino was a relatively successful filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Now, unfortunately, he not only makes terrible movies, but puts his names on names like that. <br /> <br /> A supposedly cool retro flashback to the motorcycle movies of the 60s and 70s, that makes new depths. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I like it when a blouse falls into a movie more than the next man, but even I felt kind of despicable watching it. To use a word I never thought I would do, it's msysoginistic (you see, I can not even spell). The plot (in the vague sense of the term) is as incomprehensible as Vinnie Jones's accent, the fact that his terrible performance does not support ours is as damning as a testament as you might think. <br /> <br /> This is just terrible. Shocking. It almost made me cry. In horror.
