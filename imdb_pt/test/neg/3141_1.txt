Looking for something shocking? Okay ... the images are that. That's about it. This movie tries to make deep connections with the audience through various symbolisms and ends up being annoying. I'm not sure if the director's goal was really to portray some kind of deep message to his audience, or if he just wanted to shock the hell out of them with blood, sex and violence. I'm thinking it was probably the first ... but in the failed attempt .. it just turned out to be a piece of artistic junk with a lot of blood, some unpleasant characters, and an over-reliance on religious symbolism. If you are looking for some independent film to criticize for your attempt to use metaphor ... do the same. If you are looking for a gore movie that will make you nauseous and uncomfortable ... here you go ... If you are looking for a movie that will annoy you endlessly because you realize that in the end, the message was stupid .. The movie was stupid ... and you will never have those minutes of your life back ... this is certainly the movie for you!
