First of all let's discuss the story. It's a copy of the movie "Hitch" with an Indian flavor added to it. One guy, who is a love guru, and another man who is apparently a sucker when it comes to women, and how this apparently sucker becomes a charmer with the help of the love guru forms the story. Salman Khan is the love guru, and Govinda is the lame guy. <br /> <br /> Now coming to the performance of the artists, Salman Khan strives throughout the film, he tries to be funny but does not get much time. You can see Salman screaming throughout the movie, no real acting is seen in his performance. Govinda teams up with Katrina Kaif (Oh, my God, she's a great girl.) A real beauty is a 50-year-old, and Katrina is a twenty-something girl. In the movie Govinda looks like Katrina Kaif's grandfather. What a pity! Coming to the movie. This movie looks like a B movie, and a poor imitation of the Hitch movie. Where Hitch looks like a movie with purpose and depth, this film is shallow and purposeless, nowhere is there justification or clarity. <br /> <br /> Simply forget this movie as it is nothing more than typical Bollywood food. Actually I give 3/10 because that's the smallest I'll go.
