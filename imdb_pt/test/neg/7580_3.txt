I decided to watch this movie because it was considered the "scariest movie of all time", so that's what I expected. Unfortunately, what I've discovered is that the film did not have a single scary moment (and I'm the kind of person who jumps very easily). The movie was just terrible cliches and every time there was a moment of leap it was incredibly obvious. The professionals in this movie would be the music and the weird scene that really was filmed well (like the last scene where she opens the door and you see Tun in the reflection and when you turn to him you see the ghost on your shoulders). Overall, this movie has not really added anything new to the genre J-Horror and all that lacks creativity and scares.
