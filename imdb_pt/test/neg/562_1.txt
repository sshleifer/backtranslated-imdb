The Bogart-faced man sets out to undermine viewer nostalgia for the late 1930s and late 1940s films. He fails miserably for several reasons. First, Sacchi, despite appearing reasonably with Bogart and even speaking like him at the time and using his mannerisms, lacks completely any charisma or acting ability of Bogart. This is really apparent whenever Sacchi is not clearly imitating a scene from one of Bogart's films. Second, the film lacks the top-level characters that Bogart was able to work with. There's no Peter Lorre or Sydney Greenstreet on this one, folks. Of course we are presented with performances by Victor Buaeno, Olivia Hussey and George Raft, among others, but they are not of the same caliber (either they do not receive enough screen time or are misinterpreted). Third, attempts at "modern" humor fall. All the underwear jokes, making Marlowe almost never * remove that damn hat and raincoat (even if Bogart would have), etc. they're just not funny and really bring down that movie. Fourth, I've never heard a stupid theme song on this side of Mitchell. Finally, the false reverence of the film by Bogart (and other classic actors) is really annoying. Bogart almost never played a direct hero, on those occasions he was a hero. He played tricky characters. This film makes Bogart to be a moralistic and happy welfare. While this may have been true about some movie characters, Bogart's characters rarely fit that bill. It's movies like this that make people who are not exposed to the movies of the past think that all this is cheesy, "good guy beat the bad guy and get the girl" crap with low production values.
