In 1932, Humphrey Bogart was relatively unknown - an unproven actor who was starring in one of his first films. And as he was unknown, the film they gave him was clearly a B movie - a fast-moving film with relatively low expectations. After seeing it, I could see why it would still take Bogart many more years and another movie studio before it became a household name. While the film is not terrible, it certainly is not good - making it more of a curiosity than anything else seen today. <br /> <br /> Bogart is a pilot who dreams of building his own airplane engine. company. However, when a rich and empty player appears in your path, all your dreams seem to be on hold. As one of the characters in the movie said, the combination of the two is like oil and water - they just do not mix. <br /> <br /> While Bogart is throwing away his promising career, his sister is at full speed on the road to Skankville - having met a scoundrel who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them by ton Of money! Bogey has no idea that her sister is not the actress she claims to be and does not realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him to the same guy whose lover is .... Bogart's BROTHER !!! All of this leads to an end that is reasonably enjoyable. However, the following is one of the most stupid scenes I've seen in a long time! So far, the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with Bogey's sister (phew!), But because she is now poor and is not good for Bogart, she is about to fly away and kill herself. Bogey discovers, chases the plane on foot, jumps on the plane while it is taking off and climbs up the fuselage to take control of the plane and save it !!! This is so silly and ridiculous, I found myself laughing loudly. Until then, I could have scored a 4 or 5 - this sank the movie to a 3 (as a reviewer gave an 8 is beyond me). <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this was a talking and silly movie. In addition, it's all wrong for Bogart, since the action hero at the end and the sympathizing lover are horrible matches of his persona that was beautifully crafted in the early 40's. Manly and solid best fits the man - one of the great actors of America, but clearly out of their element here. <br /> <br /> By the way, those who love pre-code movies and their adult sensibilities may want to see this. Virtually everyone in the film believes and practices premarital sex and Bogey curses in the movie - things you would never have seen after the hardened, more moralistic Production Code was adopted in 1934.
