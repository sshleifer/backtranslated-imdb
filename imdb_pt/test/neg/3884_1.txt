After three hours in the movie theater, the strongest impression was that something is wrong. What became clear was that the directors forgot to direct, the actors to act and, more importantly, the writer to write. Everyone shouted for no reason and made a shrug. The script went ahead with many preventable twists that have now ended, Priyadarshan's very familiar theory of converging actors in one point. This theory worked well in Hera-Pheri and Hungama, but somehow managed to irritate it this time, as did the habit that the inability of each actor to answer them directly. Simpler questions, such as "what's your name, would be repeated N times". <br /> <br /> Finally, what was wrong was that the director forgot that his audience had something called intelligence.
