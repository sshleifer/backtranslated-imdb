Jim (Roger Cline) and his wife Alice Fhelleps (Tamera Noll) arguing while driving in the rain, unfortunately Jim crashes the car and his daughter Heather (Leigh Silver) ends up dead while Alice is turned into a vegetable chair of wheels. Devastated by the death of his daughter Jim begins to visit prostitutes, he then kills them because of voices in his head. It's really. <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Chad Ferrin, I hate Unspeakable as a movie. There are some movies that you occasionally see that move the 'goalposts' as they were in relation to everything you watch after, some movies are so brilliant that everyone else will be judged by it while others like Unnamed for example are so bad that one new cinematographic bass. This is actually one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I'm seriously surprised by the broadly positive comments about the IMDb, although I'm not surprised by the low overall rating on the homepage, I'm not sure if I missed something, but for Unexpected start has no plot, has no story and very much seems almost random. There was nothing in the Unspeakable to keep my interest or entertainment and as a result it became a stamina test to get through. The movie tries to be shocking with some flabby scenes of sexual abuse of a rental boy by a priest, there is a scene in which a disabled person craps, splats on the floor and his dishonest nurse begins to feel his dirty genitals, legs & clothes intimate If anyone can find such shit fun, then I'll cut my wrists now, the characters are some of the worst I've had the misfortune to know, the dialogue is hilariously bad with some, it looks like it came straight from a dirty fag. porn of the worst kind. It does not work like a horror as it's not scary at all; it's absolutely hilarious and frankly insulting to claim that it's trying to be a serious drama about someone who's suffering a great loss and trying to deal with it and in general I just think it's a trash, trash, poorly made piece of crap. Director Ferrin films like some poorly made documentary, the special effects are terrible and are of the 'let's pour tomato ketchup on the face of our actor and the public will be convinced that they died a variety of bloody deaths , there is no graphic violence at all, except a suicide in which someone puts a knife in their mouths. Considering the amount of prostitutes in Unneakable, nudity levels are kept to an absolute minimum ... <br /> <br /> Apparently unspeakable had a budget of about $ 20,000 and all I can say is where did it go all the money? Oh, a quick note to the filmmakers, if you're going to record a live sound, make sure not to have the actor delivering the lines next to a main road that half of Los Angeles seems to be driving ... The acting is one drug, period. <br /> <br /> Unspeakable is, in my opinion, total crap. It's probably not the worst I've seen, but it's there and I do not remember seeing such a horrible movie recently. One to avoid, unless you are a masochist or insomniac.
