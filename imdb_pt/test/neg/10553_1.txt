What can I say? This was a horrible movie to watch. I'm not usually very critical of gay movies in general due to the fact that most are generally low budget but this really pushed me up the wall. I mean, did this happen to gay movies? Have gay producers and directors learned nothing from Gus Van Saints and Ang Lee movies? Just having to sit through the entire movie was like sitting in a dentist's chair and pulling my teeth out of wisdom. I kept praying for moments when I would feel any kind of connection with any of the characters, but it never happened. Most of the characters' performances were not very convincing. It was like watching one of those badly made and made-for-TV movies on local-access TV stations. I can not tell you how very disappointed Was watching this movie after being a big fan of Tori Spellings other jobs and directors last work on "Latter-day Saints". Definitely not worth the wait. Definitely a few hours of my life I will never go back and certainly will not buy it on DVD.
