LAME rip-off from THE QUERERMASS XPERIMENT (1955): the first half is deathly monotonous, even sad - but the later stages improve considerably with scenes involving the violent 'monster'. In the accompanying feature (a rather dry case in just 9 minutes, compared to those bred for the other titles in Criterion's "Monsters & Madmen" ensemble), director Day - who admits she's not a fan of the genre science fiction - tries to justify deficiencies of the film, saying he had a zero budget to work on (where all the outer space scenes were made up of archive material!) ... and I would have tended to be more tolerant of the film. The film had not recently seen CALTIKI, IMMORTAL MONSTER (1959) - a similar (and similarly threadbare) endeavor, but much more elegant in Italy! Bill Edwards as the arrogant, but unlucky astronaut - obsessed with achieving the titular feat - is positively annoying at first, but he finally manages to gather sympathy from the audience when his physical features are deformed and the character develops a taste for blood! Marshall Thompson as his commander and big brother is O.K. as a leaner type of Glenn Ford; Previously, he had starred FIEND WITHOUT FACE (1958), another (and more successful) produced by Richard Gordon, which, incidentally, is also available on DVD through Criterion. Italian star Marla Landi, struggling with the English language, contributes to inadequate female leadership; even her entry into the featurette proves to be of little lasting value! The Audio Commentary is another nice track from Tom Weaver / Richard Gordon, where, among many things, the fact that FIRST MAN INTO SPACE has been planned as a feature film with BLOOD CORRIDORS (1958) is brought. up - but was eventually released as an independent release, in order to exploit the current news value of the current space race; It is also mentioned that the monster dialogue was actually dubbed by Bonar Colleano (who, tragically, died in a traffic accident before the movie's release!). Weaver even remembers a few anecdotes from the time he was involved in the production of the DVD movie filmed by, among all, filmmaker Norman J. Warren: Landi, who had hitherto become a lady. of title, was still ready to assist in the transportation of the necessary equipment to film the interview below several flights of stairs! Edwards should have contributed to the featurette, but once in London he was reluctant to cooperate with Weaver - eventually the latter learned that the actor was recently diagnosed with cancer and, in fact, he died in 2002!
