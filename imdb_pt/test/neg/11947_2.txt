How bad was it to remake a movie almost worthy of the Oscars? MONTHLY MARTHA is MUCH BETTER, has depth, finesse and so on and foremost: a wonderful and talented actress in the lead role (Martina Gedeck). It's a joke and ugliness with the beautiful Aaron and the whole atmosphere ... again a ridiculous Hollywood effort. There are more and more remake and the movies are full of schemes. Is not there anyone there who can create a good new script? Or is this a security solution to make remake or movies from the well-known cartoons? Movies are getting much less interesting nowadays. Oh yes: If you want to see a really good movie, watch the original movie. Definitely worth it.
