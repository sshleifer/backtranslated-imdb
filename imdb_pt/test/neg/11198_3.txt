I went to Crooked Earth to see a piece of New Zealand. What I found was an ill-written and misunderstood echo of the people I know. <br /> <br /> Great moments between the characters ?? including many of the scenes of Temuera Morrison and Lawrences Makoares together ?? were often ruined by long, verbose monologues that the actors were forced to stumble over. Pretty and ill-fitting phrases turned away from Lawrence in particular as if he were the new Maori Messiah in his pulpit of beer boxes. <br /> <br /> When watching any movie with Maori actors, I discovered that I can always choose half a dozen characters that remind me of someone in my life. With Crooked Earth I struggled to find a key character that sounded true for the entire two hours. Most ?? including Wiremu and Peka? I ended up saying or doing things I did not understand and could not connect. At the end of the film, the writer managed to alienate the public where the Maori could not relate to him and therefore the Pakeha were granted leave to release him. My feeling is that the movie message? or at least the main one of several that was being released in the audience? is important enough to avoid the use of character ends. Unfortunately, no one who read the script before it was filmed and thought of passing this advice. The soundtrack was invasive and as annoying as the horrible bing-bong noise they tied. through 'Eyes Wide Shut'. The audience was not so subtly self-educated to laugh, cry or get angry when the music changed. It reminded me of Darth Vader's entry music in Star Wars: obvious and slightly amusing. <br /> <br /> I think there are some people out there who might like this movie. It's funny in parts, has a decent amount of action and has some really powerful scenes. Calvin Tuteao and Quentin Hita also did jobs. As a whole, however, I did not enjoy the experience as much as I know I should have. Barb Wire, Speed ​​2, Dr. Moreau's Island and Crooked Earth appear to be the quarry quartet of Tem.
