Mr. Bean is just a bunch of bland humor. It is the most superficial TV series of humor ever made in history. The scenes are often disgusting and the horrible canned chuckling sends shivers down the spine. Mr. Bean is a selfish and rude character and can only sympathize with how pathetic he is. It is amazing that a low quality TV series can be maintained for 5 years. It is a complete waste of time to watch an episode and we can not help expressing disgust and pity for Rowen to have been shown as a two-dimensional, bland and ridiculous character. Or pity yourself because you bothered to watch an episode. Watching this is an aggravating experience.
