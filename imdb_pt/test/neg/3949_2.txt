I was not too excited to see this movie in the first place, but a group of us decided to go see it on opening night. I felt like getting up and leaving and trying to recover my money 20 minutes into this movie. I felt that the movie was very annoying, uninteresting and not true in many ways, including "games". I tried my best not to sleep during the movie while watching one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. The horror movie series was more frightening than this movie. The sad attempt to lure a goth girl, an overworked business man and a 15-year-old geek, and some random guy into a video game that kills him is a bad plot to begin with. So they try to make a very horrible love scene where the main character kisses another girl after saving her 10 minutes after her girlfriend was murdered. The theater was packed when the movie began and then ended a little more than half the people were gone before it was over. If you feel the need to waste only 1 hour and 16 minutes of your time watching this movie ... prepare to feel cheated.
