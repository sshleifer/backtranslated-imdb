I saw Winnie's Heffalump a few days ago. A good story based on well-known characters created by A.A.Milne. Although Winnie, Piglet, Tigger and Rabbit are present in this animation, the main character is Roo this time around. He befriends the scary Heffalump that proves not to be scary and shows everyone that friendship knows no boundaries and that everyone wants and deserves to be happy. I love this movie and would love even 10 or 15 years younger. I would like to become a kid again to enjoy this Heffalump story much more, but all I have left is a feeling of sadness for the loss of a kind of childishness and innocence that this movie is full? I was happy to hear Carly Simon sing, Joel McNeely provided great scores.
