I was permanently marked by this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The main action of the film is nothing special. It seems there is a tribe of people who worship snakes in a remote mountainous region of northern China, where women and not men are the leaders and decision makers. I suppose among some men this is enough to make "Succubare" a horror film ... Anyway, occasionally Chinese men roamed the village, cared for the local girls, seduced them, and then abandoned them. Unfortunately for the men, the women had put them under a spell, derived from the snake venom, which would make them die horribly in 100 days - their bellies swollen like a pregnant woman with live worms and snakes - if they did not come back. <br /> <br /> Forget the cover of the US video. This has nothing to do with vampires, although there is an inept scene of drinking blood. The title itself is only marginally appropriate: "Succubare" is the Latin verb meaning "to be underneath," and is the root of the word Succubus, a female demon who seduced men into sleep. In fact, it's the MEN who are the seducers here. <br /> <br /> But that is not the main action of this ridiculous movie that is so objectionable. It's the minor minor incidents. I will ignore the slaughter and the carnage of an ox that is displayed on the screen. Participants seem very experienced, as if this was an unpleasant duty they actually do in real life; and I'm sure they actually ate the animal later ... although I resent having the act pushed into my face as "entertainment." <br /> <br /> What I WISH I could neglect (or had forgotten) is the countless totally strange shots of an unidentified man, who from time to time interrupts the story by eating live animals. He starts the movie by ripping a live snake with his teeth. Throughout the film, he devoured an insect, a lizard, a frog (I had to leave the room after that) and an entire rat (I stopped observing at that point and lost my appetite for days). Let me point out that this was totally unexpected, and had nothing to do with the movie ... unless it's a cynical reference to love as portrayed in the film: a blind, selfish, and predatory survival mechanism that destroys the defenseless ... but again, I'm probably just rationalizing to get the baseness out of my head ...
