Friday night With Jonathan Ross must have those in charge of Ross rubbing their sweaty palms together. They know that the BBC has no imagination when it comes to talk shows, so when they have Jonathan Ross at their disposal, they are well prepared to just sit down and let a humorous mood command this prime time. <br /> <br /> Ross Spends more of the show by preparing his ego and smiling about how much the BBC is paying him. The show is a complete copy of many chat shows in the US - Leno, Letterman, Conan The Brian, the list goes on - but he and his team clearly saw what works in the masses can also be done for the seedless masses in the Kingdom United also The unfortunate situation - it has no competition? Parkinson's came to reality is that he has never been up much except grooming a celebrity ego. Can not we have someone funnier and more insightful on the British screens than Jonathan Ross? Once Ross has built his ego enough, he will then go for the very annoying concept of stiff celebrities in the green room - then trying to move on with each other. If an A-Lister is present (which is often the case nowadays - as there are no other chat programs that they can use - to promote their latest movie) - he will spend the next hour flirting with them or trying be your best friend in the universe. Sqeamish when he had Ringo Starr - a man who does not care to lick his butt - Ross was actually begging for his cell phone number (as common policy in this program is for Jonathan Ross to get everyone's number so he can be seen in the company certain when it is not working). Of course Ringo said what it is - and he simply said no, I do not like you - seriously. <br /> <br /> Ross needs to be squeezed out of all the awards and TV shows - the masses will get over this.
