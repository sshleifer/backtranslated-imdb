(Dir-John Stephenson): A slightly amusing story of a group of five children being forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother fight and work in World War I . England entered the war. They are told not to go to the greenhouse of their uncle's mansion, which of course they do over and over again, and they discover a fairy from the sand they all daydream to last only until the sun goes down. This is the "IT" referred to in the title, created by the group Jim Henson and voiced by Eddie Izzard. The problem is that their desires usually bring other problems from which they should learn. This part of the film is not done very well because it is obvious that the children, especially the character of Freddie Highmore, do not learn from them, but instead go back to "solve" their next big problem. "IT" is not as funny as it might have been with comedian Eddie Izzard did not really give much opportunity to improvise and Kenneth Branagh is wasted as the eccentric uncle, although he is the best character. The kids are good as to their acting skills, but the story would probably have been much better going into the fantasy realm, but they had a human story to tell as well, which probably caused the confusion with the filmmakers. So, after all, this was an OK movie, but it could have been a lot better.
