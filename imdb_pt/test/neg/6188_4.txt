Eric Idle, Robbie Coltraine, Janet Suzman - it should have been almost impossible to go wrong. Of course there are some funny moments - the scene in the showers when Robbie Coltraine echoes the grisly lineup of Lon Chaney Jr. werewolves "I can not help it" is hilarious. But ultimately, the plot, script and direction are as flat as a pancake and as tired as a 90-year-old nun after 180 "Ave Maria". When I was a kid, the Carry On films filled that niche a little better, which is a very sad indication of a movie with such a promising cast.
