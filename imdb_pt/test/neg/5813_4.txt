I love Hedy Lamarr. I think she was much underestimated as an actress for 40 years. She was Nastassja Kinski at the time, and critics did not take her seriously. Having said all this ... this movie is a BORE. When I first saw it, I was shocked by the lack of continuity, not only in history, but in makeup and costumes. Hedy's makeup changes from shot to shot. The same goes for the length and style of the hair. Reason: This thing had so many writers and went through so many stops and starts, it's incredible that they have ever launched. Her "Lady of the Tropics" began filming AFTER this started, it was even released before "I Take This Woman". In fact, at the time, was known in Hollywood as "I Re-Take This Woman". That should tell you something. I'm a Spencer Tracy fan too, but he's horrible here. I read in several movie stories that he absolutely despised Hedy Lamarr, and this seems perfectly obvious in the film. NO ANY chemistry. The story wanders by reel after reel and finally ends up rolling for a very strange end. I can not recommend this at all.
