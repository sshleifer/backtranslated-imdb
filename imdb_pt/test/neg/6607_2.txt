There are three main problems with the film. Or rather, there are three reasons why you are not even a competitor worthy of more serious consideration. <br /> <br /> First, and this would always be true, it's not as good as books. However, at least we could expect it to reflect a little on Sapkowski's wit or depth. <br /> <br /> Second, we have the production. Fantasy films are, in my opinion, the most difficult to produce well. Everything from the props through fantasies, scenarios, acrobatics and (especially) CGI is precarious. <br /> <br /> Finally, and this is very subjective, I can not take the action seriously. I was not raised in Poland, so I can not really judge - it may be my lack of familiarity with Polish films. Even so, the lines look very amateurish ... The cast could also be better. <br /> <br /> In short, the only possible redeeming feature of this film is the rest of the plot: not unlike a diamond ring in a decaying corpse. <br /> <br /> On a separate note, I heard that the books are coming out in English. I have not yet seen them, but I can not imagine how anyone could begin to translate them ... I would ask the English-speaking reader to keep this in mind when judging the book.
