The innocent virgin Indri finds herself in a house of prostitution run by the ruthless MG pimp. Indri ends up in the private prison of MG after she refuses to make love to him. Naturally, Indri and the main con Helga join forces and plan to flee. Maman Firmansyah's blah, uninspired direction and Piet Burnama's insipid script completely undermine any vulgar vitality that this film needs to qualify as a nice piece of baby-holding rubbish: the slow pace penetrates everywhere, there is not female nudity free anything (the girls do not even show skin during the obligatory scene of the group!), the torture and degradation expected are extremely docile and warm, moderate rawness also does not impress, and even a ridiculous sequence of fights is nothing to get excited. Thomas Susanto's pedestrian cinematography, ridiculously bad dubbing, painfully overblown 102 minutes, sappy theme song and Gatot Sudarto's cornball add yet another abject insult to an already terrible injury. Just a decent action from the latest release offers a bit of relief from the tedious stultifying overstimulating timbre. A complete failure inducer of yawning.
