Great book, badly made movie. Cheesy performances and invented situations make this film a sentimental festival. Simple and uninspired work by most actors leaves this movie in the After School Special category. No doubt there is a lot of talent to be cast in this cast and crew, but something went wrong. The talented Gretchen Mol tries to get this film out of the mud, but it seems she can not get over the stupid dialogue. Looks like everybody just phoned him. Even makeup (Mulrooney, 20 years in the making) looks amateurish and raw. Do not waste your time on this noise ... go read the book.
