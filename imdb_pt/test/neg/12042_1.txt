I thought this movie could be a good parody, or at least a good independent comedy like Friday. Instead, it was more like something someone in high school would do with their parents' camcorder. It was not just the low budget that makes this movie bad (many great movies were made on a low budget), it's simply a bad movie and it was not bad enough to be a good camp. Case in point: During the first ten minutes of the movie, nothing happens except the 3 main characters sitting in their room smoking marijuana, making them up and then answering a phone call. You keep waiting for something to make the story move, but it never happens. The sound was so bad that I had to turn the TV all the way just to almost do what they were saying (which was not interesting anyway). If I pay to rent a movie, I will usually suffer from it even when it is bad, but it was all I could do to spend 20 minutes. It seems that the person before me felt the same way because he did not rewind the tape and stopped at the same place I did. The only reason I gave a score of 1 is because the rating system does not have negative numbers.
