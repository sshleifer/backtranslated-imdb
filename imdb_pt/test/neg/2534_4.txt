This film gets promising enough, but gets a little confused and stuck in its stylistic charm. The scenery, costumes and music were wonderful - as close to perfection as possible. But the more I got into the movie, the more I felt as if all this effort was for the director's entertainment, not the audience. Although, I loved looking at it except for a few short musical scenes, I can not say I liked it. The director shows a huge imagination, but if he had fun with this movie, he could not share it with the public, or at least with me. I did not have a feeling of whim and I was not sucked into this universe. <br /> <br /> One great cause of this was (surprisingly) Zhang Ziyi. You may say that she's been struggling a lot, but she seems to have been so mean that she looks almost amateurish. She is a capable actress, but she has her limitations. I noticed in her acting that she still has to really react to her fellow co-stars, a flaw that creates a chemical void. The language barrier in this film seems to only exacerbate the issues. She and Odagiri act as if they are on separate planets. She's also not a very good singer, which made me shudder every time she sang, but fortunately there were not many scenes of that. Odagiri was fine, but not very impressed. <br /> <br /> I did not even call the characters separately. There is really a painful lack of characterization. The only reason to worry about them seems to be that they are good-looking royalty. Without the compelling love story in the center of the film, it's hard to care what happens. The film also takes the detours to smaller scenes that add nothing to the story and actually distract it. I had to rewind because after getting into a subframe I could not remember what the hell they are doing in the main storyline. There were also scenes where it was hard to tell what the action was because it was so stylized. <br /> <br /> Mostly, I am disappointed because I really like the concept behind it and there are many things. I like. The choreographies of music and dance are really great. The supporting performances are uniformly excellent, fantastic in both performance and cornering. It's too bad the main actors were so bland.
