This is the prize that made me lose all respect for the Hugos. <br /> <br /> If such a "distinguished" panel can not see or care for the obvious storytelling problems of Battlestar Galactica, then is it worth their prize? The answer: not much. <br /> <br /> Award-winning shows should be examples of creativity and excellence, and none of them are evident in BG, in this episode or in any other I've seen. <Br /> <br /> Filming on video is not "artistic", it's cheap. Shaking the camera is not "creative", it is vomiting inducing and lazy. <br /> <br /> All that BG has shown is how most "gyms" are corrupt and how easy it is to buy prizes with lots of PR money.
