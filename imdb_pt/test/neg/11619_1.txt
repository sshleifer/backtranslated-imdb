I can not believe this terrible movie was made by the same people who did Lepa Sela Lepo Gore. Watch this and skip this. The plot is confusing and the characters are mostly two-dimensional stereotypes. I suspect that the publisher went on holiday in the middle of the film because quick, furious cuts begin to appear, which only confuses matters rather than elucidating them. The ending does not make sense either. <br /> <br /> This is predominantly a propaganda film made so that the Serbs can feel sorry for themselves and defame America for the 1999 NATO bombings. They do this by perpetuating lies about the Serbs being our allies during World War II, claiming that the whole world is unjustly against them, and completely ignoring everything said and done by Slobodan Milosevic, like the war in three neighboring countries. They seem willing to make a political film, but only show a few seconds of Milosevic on a TV screen without sound. A nationalist agenda obviously outweighed any consideration of art that was not the case with Lepa Sela. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I recommended this movie to a teacher when he played last week at the Seattle International Film Festival. He also cited the bad editing and the confusing plan, and I had to apologize for the bad advice. You have been warned.
