This movie is so bad that it's unbelievable. Even for an independent low budget movie ... it's, well, sucks. I can not even believe that even Troma would put that crap. I've been a fan of some movies from Troma to years (Toxic Avenger, Squeeze Play, Rockabilly Vampire, to name a few). But LLoyd, come on, this goes way beyond the limits of any taste. It presents some of the worst imaginable acts. I think it would have been possible to find unemployed street people who could have been so good ... oh, wait, that's what they did. I mean, these characters have negative charisma. With some luck, the producer and director of this movie will have a huge karmic debt, because of this atrocity. How do people special effects. But beyond the terrible acting and the horrible special effects, the dialogue is absolutely traumatic to the ears. The script is full of holes the size of Alaska, and there are serious problems of continuity. The worst part, however, is that it's not fun, even on the smallest path. And that's the most unforgivable sin of cinema. But do not believe me. Get out and waste four dollars renting it. Just do not say I did not warn you.
