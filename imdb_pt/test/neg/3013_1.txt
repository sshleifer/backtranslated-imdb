This show sucks. I guess I do not even need to say it or because, judging by the number of comments, I'm just repeating it all. Keys to vip is how to turn your TV on and have it throwing poop at you. that's exactly what I do not even exaggerate. these guys are so stupid, they're not funny and they're not kind to girls, which is not funny, it's stupid. I sat four episodes and I want my two hours back. Where do they find competitors because they are obviously mentally deficient? If I were the man who came up with this idea for a show and put it on TV I would do the world a favor and jump out of the tallest building I could find. How the fuck does that go on TV? especially the comedy network should not a show about something called the comedy network, at least be a comedy show or maybe be funny so many times?
