I do not really like this show. I mean, basically everyone in that school is perfect and rich, and I doubt that a boarding school would look as cool as that. And why do they suddenly let girls in school? Is not that a little weird? Either way, Jamie Lynn's spears CAN NOT act. She always has the same facial expression, which really irritates me. She's basically emotionless, and all the guys seem to like her. <br /> <br /> And should not you chase tell her that you like her? It is not so difficult! really! None of these shows are real-life, and she's not "a girl like me" because most normal girls do not go to boarding school, do not have designer clothes, and do not live on the beach. <br /> false false false.
