Actually, the average is the only word that comes to my mind when you see it. <br /> <br /> The acting was average (maybe a little above average), the use of the camera was average (actually below average, so shaky and the colors were grainy and blurry.) The plot was good, but it moved at such a slow pace and was not well used. <br /> <br /> This could have been a lot more if it was not at a snail pace and we saw more in the backgrounds of the characters. <br /> <br /> All we see are flashbacks here and there from Alice and how her home life is so "bad" (her mother is a working class woman trying to find an end to her and her daughter.) We see her flashback from when she was in high school and her friend tells her to "tell her mother to make better food" and "everyone says she's your mother." Yes, this is embarrassing, but why would you run away from it? <br /> <br /> I could definitely see if her mother was a drunk or someone was abusing her, but nothing was wrong with her house except that she was embarrassed by it. How immature! <br /> <br /> We do not even have a glimpse of what the couple's life has been like (except they've been whoring for some time and the woman, forgot her name, gave the baby to her when she was 9 months old.) This really could have been a lot more. It could have had Alice who was abused by her drunken mother go to Florida with her friend, but then becomes a prostitute. Or something like the other, so the real plot of this movie (ie Alice), a girl with a home life of 90% of the WORKING CLASS population fleeing to Florida, but then drifting off to become a prostitute. <br /> <br /> I do not see why he won a prize at Sundance (it must have been against really poor competition to have won that prize.) <br /> <br /> For me, Alice's Boston accent / New England seemed forced. It did not look genuine. (I should know, I was born and raised in Boston, but now I live in Georgia.) <br /> <br /> 4/10 Not really worth my time in my opinion.
