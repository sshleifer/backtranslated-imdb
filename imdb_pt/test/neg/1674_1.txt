I do not know if this type of movie was as clich√© as it seems now. <br /> <br /> Considering how many "Bad News Bears" movies had already been released in 1980, I think this kind of movie was already a tiresome idea. <br /> <br /> A former soccer player is partially paralyzed in Vietnam and is confined to a wheelchair. Chicago Bears offers you a public relations job, but he wants to train. At the same time, his minor nephew is caught for armed robbery. We are told that he has been arrested more than a dozen times before and now he needs to go through a difficult time ... which ends up being less than a year! <br /> <br /> Of course, the kid is a really good kid who just needs a tough male role model in his life. The same goes for all the children in the detention center. Yes ... even the one arrested for attempted murder! I'm sure you already know what happens, so I'll try to keep the rest of this brief. <br /> <br /> Our protagonist becomes the coach of the children's soccer team. He overcomes the cynicism of delinquents and earns their respect. Your team faces a local high school team (yes, right!) And they have their butts kicked. Now determined more than ever to prove himself a worthy coach, he demands a rematch. Will these underprivileged young men with hearts of gold be able to improve enough to win the rematch? Terrible execution of football sequences ruin any possibility of excitement in this film. "Coach Of The Year" should be penalized for violating my brain. 1/10
