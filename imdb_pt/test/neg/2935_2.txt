Well, where do you begin to describe this celluloid disaster? You already know the big fat NADA passing as a plot, so let's stress that this is so offensive to the PC. Hard to believe that Frank Oz, the same guy who gave us laughter as Little Shop of Horrors and Bowfinger, made this mess ungraceful. <br /> <br /> So this guy does not know he's gay until this actor points that out. OK sure. If someone says I'm gay, I'll know the truth, even if I like girls more than George Luca, who likes a dollar. <br /> <br /> And how to know the true nature of my sexuality? Well, if I like classical literature, dance and Barbra Streisand, I'm gay. If I dress like a blind man in a hurry (with half of my shirt hanging out), I am direct. Ah, of course. <br /> <br /> And here's the big cliche clich√©: no matter how you look, there's always a very attractive Hollywood actor who will love every bit of grease under his skin, or a top model that I'm going to love your zero IQ, your ugly face and your pointy ears. If all these common gay places were not enough to piss me off, it happened. In the real world it seems important, folks, and I know for sure. <br /> <br /> I see this coming: now you're going to say "Relax! It's a comedy! Do not take it so seriously!" If being a comedy gives anything "carte blanche" to suck out loud, I think the world has a serious problem. Would not it be much better (and funnier) to make a movie that would deny those old, gritty cliches, instead of enlarging them over and over again? <br /> <br /> So one of the worst movies I've ever seen seen. 1 of 10. If giving this rating has anything to do with my sexual orientation, please let me know. I'm interested.
