Even though this is the first movie of the broken lizard group, it's the last one I've seen. Having enjoyed the Super Troopers and managed to keep up with the crap that is club dred and beerfest, I was surprised to learn that they did a previous movie. Now I did not sit down with high hopes, but I was hoping for a fun joke on campus. My friend asked me to bear in mind that they are younger (obviously) and their first foray into film. I did and was still disappointed. Not taking away the acting and comedy skills of the BL guys, they were fine. The whole movie was tiring, clich√© and downright boring. Some of the other actors in the film were very poor at acting. And the Rugby game did not even look like rugby. Poor display. They have improved drastically with Super Troopers and have since declined. Let's hope they get back in shape with Super Troopers 2
