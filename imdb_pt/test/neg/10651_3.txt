Do not worry about the serious logical gaps, do not mind the painfully cliché character portraits, no matter the random writing, and you may like this movie. The main character Alyssa should be captivating, the heroine you twist to be saved, (or, in this case, save herself) But instead she just moves, and does a wonder, all the dancers are so stupid? His intrepid mother was obviously only needed to further propagate the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to snatch their poor, innocent young man with a perpetually present and scathing director / villain. And the cliché! Not only does she become anorexic, bulemic, addicted to drugs and pathological liars, but all in the course of a few months. It is as if the writer were reading all the horror stories he could discover about the ballet and decided to see how much he could stick in two hours (with commercials). <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, but I'm a dancer. . This "revolt" or "resurgence" of the anorexia and bulemia that is happening is nonexistent in all the dance schools I attended. In fact, teachers are so afraid to suggest that a girl might have a better chance of a few pounds lighter, most of the dancers in my classes would actually be considered a little overweight. I'm not saying that eating disorders ever occur, but not to the extent that it was portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> Another annoying problem that this movie had was the style of writing in the middle. She again in her boyfriend again probably had all of half an hour of total screen time, all in the first half. The other supporting characters were merely props, decorations to deepen the story. Given the correct dialogue, this would have been a very intricate mental study of a psychological problem. As it is, it turns into a show for a woman, and Kimberly McCullough does not dare to achieve that. <br /> <br /> For a non-dancer, this movie would be a supposed "insight" about what really goes behind closed doors in a ballet company. For a dancer, this is a very insulting film, which portrays dancers as stupid and parents so insistent and misinformed. These adjectives describe more correctly the people who got it in the air in the first place. 3/10
