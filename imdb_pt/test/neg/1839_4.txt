This relatively minor piece of Hong Kong is the perfect movie for the desert island of video toms (at least in the first half). Each set-up, each scene, each sequence is an excuse to look for a girl's skirt, look at her breasts, look at her behind and look at her tight groin. What he is setting is the perverted tendencies of the main character, of course! Anthony Wong is a marginally perverted married man who is plagued by erotic fantasies and outrageous fantasies. All involve half-naked and sexy Chinese ladies with nothing but sexual servitude in their minds. <br /> <br /> The plot is thickened by a homicidal subplot, a voodoo doll show, and a bit of rape and looting. Some of the sex scenes are pretty hot and the blood is liberal, but the supernatural elements introduced in the second half look half boiled and the developments in the plot are ridiculous. <br /> Clearly, extravagant garbage producer Wong Jing was in a terrible rush to get in and out of the theaters. <br /> <br /> The artistic title sequence did not fool this tired player.
