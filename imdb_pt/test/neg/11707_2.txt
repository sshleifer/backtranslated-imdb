The Other Boleyn Girl - not to be confused with the book that claims to be based. This movie is not even close to a faithful adaptation. I could understand them by changing or elaborating some things. The book is not perfect, but it was well written and became very popular. I could understand if the BBC wanted to make it a bit more true to what actually happened, who Anne Boleyn really was - but neither is it near to being historically accurate. It's just cute. Shameless. To begin with, the writer and director seemed to think it was a good idea to set the story as if it were a reality show. Seriously. They have the Boleyns sitting in front of the camera confessing how they REALLY feel about what is going on in their lives. Ana Bolena sits in a confessional (not the type of church, the real world type) and chooses what she wants to say and what she just wants to sit and smile at. She looks stupid to have to use a modern movie device on a film set in the 1500s. It's "the real world: England Tudor!" <br /> <br /> Jodhi May is a very good actress and after 'The Aristocrats' and 'The Turn of the Screw' I was becoming a true fan of her. But she should never have been chosen as Anne. In fact, I think she would have been a better Mary. Natascha McElhone was a poor choice. She is a good actress, of course, but she has very modern features and does not look convincing in period costumes. (Honestly, I spent the first half of the movie trying to figure out if she was "that girl" from "The Truman Show." She was.) She's too old to play Mary, so for some unknown reason she made Mary the eldest of the sisters. It does not make sense, I know. It's as if the BBC seems to forget that these people actually lived. They are twisting the story and doing things up and to the right. I feel ridiculous having to correct the BBC about historical inaccuracies, but really! <br /> <br /> In addition to the two sisters, the rest of the cast was actually very well chosen. Steven Mackintosh seemed to me a brilliant choice for George, and his cast was the real reason why I decided to look for this movie. Big mistake. He does a great job, of course, but he's hardly in on it. How can anyone pretend to be adapting The Other Boleyn Girl and almost does not mention George Boleyn? This is simply absurd. Philip Glenister was another very good casting decision, but again, it was hardly in the finished product. <br /> <br /> The real problem with this is the script. There is no avoiding this. It's bad. It's very, very bad. It is very melodramatic and not engaging. Anne is portrayed as an aerial head, Mary as leader and George as follower. Mary's first husband is hardly mentioned, her relationship with the king is never explained - they just do not tell the story that Phillippa Gregory wrote. The whole thing seems like a big waste. I do not feel like seeing it a second time. I think I'm going to have to read the book again and hope that Natalie Portman's version, which will be released next year, is much better. <br /> <br /> * Note: As I write, the only way to get this miniseries in the US is on the last disc of the miniseries "The Six Wives of Henry VIII." That's a great miniseries but it can cost $ 50 to $ 60 and it's a lot to spend if you're just looking for this piece of junk.
