I got this little snippet from VideoAsia's DVD "Tales of Voodoo" video. Much where voodoo should fit, I have no idea. In fact, I generally would not connect voodoo to Indonesia anyway (much less with WIPs). <br /> <br /> I know and love WIP movies. I saw most of them. I could not therefore resist this little gem known from the description given to it on the cover. <br /> <br /> It's an APPEAL. You can not have a WIP movie if the women stay put (even in the shower!). While giving a nod to the exploit genre, WIP without nudity is like a Big Mac without meat. <br /> <br /> As my gym teacher used to say, overall, I'd rather be at the club. ....
