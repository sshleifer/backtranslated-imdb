This is a silly movie with lots of singing and dancing. Acting is average, but writing leaves something to be desired. There are memorable performances from Buddy Epsen, with a short but remarkable performance by Gypsy Rose as the bitter wife of a rich playboy. A totally unbelievable portrait of college life that ends with an excellent ice-skating performance of Alice in Wonderland. Many parties are worth watching, but do not be afraid to move quickly through parts of the movie
