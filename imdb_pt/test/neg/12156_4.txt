The narrative was clear and concise, but overall the film never caught my interest - the scenes were flat and uninspired. Ghengis Khan, historically speaking, had a very interesting epic life, but the film failed to capture that - it focused on small skirmishes like a movie. youth and a love story that I think I've seen disguised in a number of other films. I never felt sympathy or empathy for leadership - yes, he had to overcome slavery, but then he seemed to have an easy way to plunder, kill, and cross the path to the top. The only redeeming quality was photography - the landscapes certainly helped the film's gloomy atmosphere, unfortunately combined with the desolation of the story - I was impassive and disappointed.
