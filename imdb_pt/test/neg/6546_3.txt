This movie has some good performances - and that's all it takes. Leads, especially Pauley Perrette, are attractive. (Although some of the bit players seem to be acting from a teleprompter.) The stuff - that's the problem. I feel as if the screenwriter / director watched the entire Felicity series at once, then sat down to write a sleepless script. It really reminded me of Felicity-a thoughtful young woman, finding herself, finding love, with a flip-and-see-what-happens-approach to the characters and their relationships. But while I usually enjoyed watching Felicity, this movie made me cold. The writing is simply awful. It's incredible that the cast can perform as well as they do, since the dialogue is monotonous at best. At worst, it becomes banal, flamboyant and amateurish. There is nothing original here, with the elements of the plot recycled from tricks that were not so brilliant to begin with. In the first half of the movie, I cheered for the actors and hoped to be rewarded for my patience. In the second half, I just wanted this to end already. My sympathies to the cast, which deserved a better vehicle for their talents.
