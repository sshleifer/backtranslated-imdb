I watched this movie last night, and let me tell you, it's the worst thing I've ever seen. The whole movie is a train accident and they are not the actors. It's the awful script. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** All right, Eddie loses his job to a monkey. Your nerdy son is disappointed. The bathroom goes crazy. <br /> <br /> He gets a free vacation. He goes along with Uncle Nick and the original Audry. Your boats are falling. They stay on an island. They are stupid and do not even bother to look at the nearby hotel. <br /> <br /> OK, so this is it. What makes this movie pathetic is humor. It's so horrible, cheeky and stupid you can not even laugh. And neither is stupid funny humor. I could not laugh at the whole thing.
