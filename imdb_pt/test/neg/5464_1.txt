Well, it certainly surprised me - I can not believe that someone made another Australian movie that is even more annoying than Somersault. The story is implausible; the characters, with the exception of the characters Friels and Mailman, are unlikely and wooden, Tom Long has a VAST array of facial expressions: happy and not happy, and the "sex scenes" that could having been very confronting and disturbingly erotic, would have stayed home in a low budget pornographic film. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I've seen in 30 years of cinema that has left me at the edge of my life. seat .... ready to get up and leave. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the promotional poster.
