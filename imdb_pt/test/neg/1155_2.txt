I just saw this at the Madison Horror Film Festival and I was disappointed. Some funny and shocking moments (with Carla's fist empty, a pissing harpy in the Land of Dreams) and two interesting premises (similar to New Nightmare with the belief bringing a mythical character to life and also Lost Highway with a man living a fantasy in his head), but had long periods of absence of movements and development of incoherent plots. Just because you use the structure of dreams or a mental state of escape does not make you Lynchian. You need the eye-catching visuals and creepy performances. <br /> <br /> Positive things: Dr. Maitland had a real comic timing and all the girls were cute. Carla's father, Chalmers and Ingrid Pitt seemed to be enjoying themselves. And Tom Savini at least looked like he had his lines memorized and we could not see if he was just reading tips cards. <br /> <br /> I get the Hammer references, but it looks like the director realized the script was a snoozer and I just added some shocks to try to get some laughs out of anything he could ride. But they do not work because they are too few and far between and create an inconsistent tone. Condense this for 30 minutes of all the fun parts and you could have a surreal short goofy, but at the length of the feature, skip it. It's not "so bad that it's good" is just "so bad that it's boring".
