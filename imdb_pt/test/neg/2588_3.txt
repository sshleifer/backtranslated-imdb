I was able to watch this uninterrupted commercial, and let me tell you, even for a TV movie, it was quite predictable. The actors did a job of working with what they had, and the cast was well done - Barry Bostwick, Jane Seymour, Frances Fisher, etc. However, the script was not only predictable (except for the last scene), but the dialogue was and sounded as if it had been drawn from a third-rate novel. Jane Seymour's psychotic monologues were laughable. I'm sorry, but I find it hard to believe that someone so scary would not arouse suspicion. As bad as Theresa Russell was in "Black Widow" -and she sure drove her crazy-she at least had the good sense to play her pseudo-characters a little straight. Seymour is a much better actress, but she has not outgrown the material here. <br /> <br /> Finally, the musical score is incredibly tacky. It's almost a satire of its kind, like a collapse of Kenny G. A film with such a mediocre and derivative script should have been something bolder.
