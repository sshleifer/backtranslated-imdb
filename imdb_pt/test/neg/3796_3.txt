... a good script or director could not fix it. <br /> <br /> The original "Poseidon Adventure" was a story of human courage triumphing against great odds and personal tragedy. The survivors were led by a charismatic figure of great spiritual strength who would take anything God gave him. <br /> <br /> The accompaniment attempts to recreate the mix, but fails through a roadmap and direction of pedestrians. Irwin Allen may have been a major producer of disaster films, and did a great job directing the action scenes in 'Towering Inferno', but he just can not bring human depth to his characters. If the characters are not credible, the danger they face also falls. <br /> <br /> The script also tries to copy the original obviously. So we have Peter Boyle doing the Ernest Borgnine thing being tough and nasty (but he has a tender heart); Karl Malden is the moderating influence of the Red Buttons (and is in a terminal state for good measure); Slim Pickens does the comic relief for Shelley Winters, and so on. <br /> <br /> To make history more contemporary, we have a dishonest gun dealer ready to throw gun plutonium for the highest bid. A really nasty piece of work that ruthlessly abandons injured men (the actors who play their henchmen were presumably paid as extras because they do not seem to have lines) and a woman shot in the back - what an idiot! Thank God, French rescue services made the hole in the hull of Poseidon twice as large as it did in 1972 (and on the other side of the propeller shaft) so he could get his possessions. And while we're on the subject, how they got the boxes * to * the ... oh, forget it. <br /> <br /> Actually I paid good money to see this when it was released. Given the current reputation of the film, this may seem strange, but in fact has quite confusing criticism at the time. Some said it was rubbish, some said it was as exciting as the original. No matter, no one can be right all the time.
