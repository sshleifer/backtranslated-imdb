As a resident of CA, I would like to see the holes that were turning off the power plants to raise prices and also to prison. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was very good and has some very informative pieces. While they stuck to how Enron rose and fell, I found it very interesting. However, when the film focused on its anti-Bush tilt, it made me wonder if they were being really accurate. <br /> <br /> It's good to point out any connection the Republicans had with Enron, but the monster was created while Clinton was president. The CA's energy crisis came under Davis's command. Both were in office during Enron abuses, but neither is responsible at all. Instead, many minutes are spent on how Bush was friends with Lay. And? Lay played golf with Clinton and spent the night in Lincoln's room. Why do Democrats get such a free pass in this movie? I think most politicians are a waste of our taxpayer money, so I'm not partial to either party, but I hate feeling like I'm subject to someone's political agenda when I watch a documentary. Yes, politicians deserve some guilt, but I really doubt the only culprits have Rs after their names. I found no value in portraying the Bush as Kay's mistresses when Democrats received as much money from the Enron campaign as the Republicans. Like I said, it weakens the rest of the movie for me because it makes me suspect the rest of the facts they exposed.
