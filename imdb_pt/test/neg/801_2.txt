Set in 1976 for no apparent reason other than keeping the set-ups occupied, 'The Box' was directed by Richard Kelly ('Donnie Darko') and starring Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as Norma and Arthur Lewis, a young couple who is supposedly struggling financially, though both have successful careers - she as a high school teacher, he as an optician at the NASA Research Center in Langley, Va. They have a son, Walter (Sam Oz Stone). <br /> <br /> One day, the Lewises find a package at their door, containing a black box with a large red button. There is a note from a 'Mr. Steward 'indicating that he will return at 5:00 pm to explain about the box. <br /> <br /> The mysterious Arlington Steward, played by Frank Langella, appears on time, elegantly dressed in an elegant Savile Row. suit. He is polite but professional, however, his most notable feature is his face, half of which seems to have been ripped off and poorly attended. Langella is the only thing worth watching in the film, however, unfortunately he is overshadowed by his own makeup, which resembles Harvey's 'Two Face' Dent (Aaron Eckhart) from Christopher's 'The Dark Knight' Nolan. It's like the elephant in the room: you can try to ignore it, but it's more than a little distraction. <br /> <br /> Steward explains that he will return in 24 hours to pick up the button. If, during that time, they decide to unlock and push the button, he will give them $ 1 million in cash. The only problem - and it is great - is that somewhere a stranger will die. It may be on the other side of town, it may be on another continent, however Steward assures them that the victim will be someone unknown to them. As a show of good faith, he leaves them with a $ 100 bill, to keep them pushing the button or not. Arthur and Norma are skeptical, believing the whole thing to be a fake or an elaborate farce, yet it did not take them long to wonder what would happen if they pressed the button? Would they really get a million dollars? Would someone really die? Tired of speculation, Norma hits the button. Nothing happens. However, his initial relief gives rise to alarm when Steward shows up the next day with a briefcase full of money. They decide to call the whole thing, however, Steward says it's too late. "You already pressed the button," he explains. As Steward's limousine drifts away, Arthur watches the license number, which he discovers after he is registered with the National Security Agency (NSA). <br /> <br /> At this point, the film begins to drift into territory impossible to be replaced. characters begin to cause nosebleeds and signs of peace. Meanwhile, the town is overrun by plump and sloppy nerds, wearing shirts that start following Arthur as a party of recognition for a race of nerdy alien nerds. Arthur eventually gets caught up in the menacing worms of the library (?), Where Steward's spinster wife appears - whom we have not seen so far - and informs Arthur that to leave the library he must enter into one of three vertical columns of digital effects tacky-looking water. "What happens if I choose the wrong one?" Arthur asks, looking much less confused than he should be under the circumstances, and certainly much less confused than the audience is now. "Eternal damnation," says the spinster, menacingly. <br /> <br /> Artur enters the middle column of digital liquid effects and, after a brief absence, appears suddenly, still in his water cocoon, hovering over Norma's bed. When she wakes up and sees him, the water bubble explodes and Arthur falls into bed in a shower of water that, incredible as it may seem, continues to drip from the water pipes above the camera while Marsden and Diaz are soaked. /> It's confusing, I know. <br /> <br /> We finally learned that Steward was once the public relations officer of the NSA until he was struck by lightning that destroyed part of his face. He was pronounced dead, but then returned to life, having been transformed into a kind of superman who now serves "those who make lightning", and whose powers allowed him to take over the CIA, the NSA and NASA. by itself. <br /> <br /> And what's the point of all this junk? Apparently, Steward's mission is to subject humans to a kind of test of biblical character (eg, 'Binding Isaac') to determine whether humanity is worth saving. If enough people pass the button test by refusing to push it, Steward's Lords of Honor will spare the race. Sadly, those pushing the button, such as Norma and Arthur, should be punished for their lack of moral judgment, for which they are subjected to a series of somber trials of "Lady or Tiger" that unfold as one of those "Saw movies , "except for the fun grace or the benefit of a coherent plot." The Box "represents the kind of mindless masturbation that philosophy students like to do after a few beers. Richard Kelly's tedious exercise in existentialist falsity eventually collapses under the weight of his own incomprehensibility; the tortured mixture of unbearable ideas eventually freezes itself, like a mixture of many colors, into a gray and sinuous slime of a film as insipid as one of those narcotizing on-board movies whose plot is not more or less interrupted by a slow nap <br /> <br /> There's a point in 'The Box' where Arthur, who is a technically busy guy, gets curious about how the button works. Opening the unit, he is disappointed to find nothing inside. <br /> <br /> Having seen The Box, I know exactly how it feels.
