How did this movie enter the Berlin Film Festival? I understand you entered the Panorama section, but still. <br /> <br /> This movie features: <br /> <br /> 1. No plot. 2. Horrible acting. 3. atrocious videography. 4. Some of the worst graffiti ever captured on video. <br /> <br /> The decisive argument that explains most of the festival's acceptance is the presence of this old way of waiting: homosexuality. That's right, the only thing that happens in this movie is that an artist makes one with another and pushes him. So he feels weird about it and they have a boring "break" talk you could expect to hear of your first passion in high school (with phrases like "You kissed me first, man"). Oh, and by the way, this is not a game of crying ... you see the gay angle coming in the first ten minutes of the movie. Also, it's basically just bad tags, undercover and undercover cops, a skateboard and a train ride. <br /> <br /> If the subject is of interest to anyone, I recommend looking on the internet for some underground videos made by real graffiti artists. There's a lot out there ... and they're a lot more fun than that crap.
