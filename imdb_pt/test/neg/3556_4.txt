The Ealing Comedies constitute their own specific subgenre in the history of cinema. They were distorted reflections on British life in the late 1940s and early 1950s. They are always fun, but I feel it is misleading to characterize them as comedies. They are cheerful and humorous, rather than funny. However, the best of them are tied with discreet satire and filmed with an occasional dark spot (especially Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Ladykillers). <br /> <br /> I have a fondness for all of them, but The Lavender Hill Mob is probably what I have the most trouble with. Compared to the others, it seems a little superficial. To me, it's an outline sketch for a movie, but it needed to spend a lot more time developing before it was ready to go before the cameras. <br /> <br /> Everything is a bit underdone. For example, no one receives any real or historical context. Henry is simply a zealous idiot, whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions are not recognized, while Albert is a frustrated artist, forced to prostitute his talent by making garbage the gift shop for a living. This establishes a motive for the crime, but nothing that happens subsequently is a consequence of your characters or your plan. <br /> <br /> Other characters are introduced but do not play a real role in history. The elderly resident in Henry's guesthouse could (with his love of detective stories) have been made an unconscious thorn in his side, but is merely used as the background color. In the same way, the various police officers entering and leaving the action are there simply to keep the plan working. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film is directed entirely by its artificial devices, which I find frustrating and slightly irritating. The not very ingenious assault is performed with minimal problems, although Albert was prevented from fulfilling his part in the plan (Clayton, Sidney Tafler). Gold is then smuggled to France without any setbacks. Everything would have gone well had it not been for a small setback, regrettably based on the French pronunciation of the letter 'R', which results in the accidental sale of six of the Eiffel Tower gilded to some English schoolgirls. <br /> <This leads to a series of frantic pursuits when Henry and Albert try to retrieve them. These scenes are well executed, but every now and then the conspirators are frustrated in chasing after the students through a series of totally factual accidents. It is as if God is deliberately intervening to cause them difficulties. This kind of plot always makes me grind my teeth. <br /> <br /> When they finally trace the last Eiffel Tower to a Police Academy exhibit and catch it under the nose of John Gregson's police inspector (why is he there, anyway?) all the fragments of the logic of the plot are abandoned. The final car chases are then simply filling in the screen time until we return to the framing device with which the image began. <br /> <br /> The film does not even bother telling us the fate of Albert (Stanley Holloway). ), Lackery (Sid James) and Shorty (Alfie Bass). <br /> <br /> This cool little trick has the professionalism of Ealing's team behind it, so it's far from being a bad movie. I suspect most viewers will find this considerably more enjoyable than I (and why should not they?), But I can not help but think that there was a much better movie waiting to be done, if only more time and effort had been spent on fleshing apart from the characters and the story. <br /> <br /> By the standards set by Ealing, Lavender Hill Mob is a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> PS: A curious footnote is that Audrey Hepburn gets credit for her single line at first, but Archie Duncan remains anonymous despite his much more substantial contribution. I think she just had a better agent.
