In his debut feature "Yellow," Chris Chan Lee tries to shed light on Hollywood's portrayal of Asian Americans, starting with the stereotypes typically portrayed in mainstream cinema. However, in doing so, Lee commits a much more heinous crime: he exaggerates the very stereotypes of Asian Americans to the point of being incredulous. The result? Terribly one-dimensional characters and a scandalously superficial script unleashes the cast in a frenzy of over-action, ultimately resulting in a movie that is physically painful to watch. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by any of the positive comments obtained by `Yellow '; each falls into one of two fields. In a corner (for example, right here on imdb.com) you find Asian-Americans who are so exultant that an Asian character can be pictured on the screen without thick glasses and a math book that they somehow neglect idiocy of Lee's final product. On the other hand, you find movie critics who simply assumed that it would not be legal to give "Yellow" the full attack it deserves; after all, it's an Asian-American movie of an independent Asian-American ... protected for the time being. <br /> <br /> Case example: main character Sin Lee (Michael Chung). Writer / director Lee performs a monumental feat with Sin, editing `Yellow 'in such a way that Sin never appears on the screen unless he is ugly or screaming. See Sin resenting the support of your friends. Frown. See Sin walking along the beach and litter. Frown. (Screaming). See Sin closing his father's shop. Frown. See No urination. Frown. See Without breathing. Frown. <br /> <br /> Damn, I wonder if Sin is full of Asian-American anguish. Do you think that? I'm not sure. Frown. Just to be thorough, Lee introduces us to Sin's father, Woon Lee (Soon-tek Oh). Throughout the film, while Sin simply frowns or screams, Mr. Lee frowns and screams. In fact, this is the main role of Woon in "Yellow": make ugly face and scream at the same time. <br /> Gee, I wonder if Woon is an Asian father with an authority complex. Do you think that? I'm not sure. Frown. Shout. <br /> <br /> If Lee's one-dimensional characters do not bother him, his story will be. Meet Mina (Mary Chen) and Joey (John Cho), two characters that exist in this film just for the purpose of transforming a tangential and totally irrelevant love story in the film. You see, Lee learned in film school that every good movie should include some kind of subtext related to love, and these two characters allow you to fulfill the obligation. The flirtatious and exasperatingly insipid dialogue of Mina and Joey consists of insults of a line, culminating in a kiss: "Nerd!"; `Stupidhead! '; (eyes meet); (comprising smile); kisses happen <br /> <br /> But be quiet, somewhere out there, Sin is frowning while all this happens. <br /> <br /> That neither Mina nor Joey contributes in any way to The Movie's plot does not as perplex me as Lee's insistence on the clichés of more banal films to carry out his non-kidnappers. And trust me, the sequence of flirting is just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, we find Woon Lee trying to explain his constant scowl and shouting to Sin's girlfriend, Teri (Mia Suh), in what I'm sure Lee wanted to be a moving moment. What a surprise: when Woon invokes a metaphorical story about the motherland to illustrate his point of view, torn from Reader's Digest, his voice quivers in an extra-special paternal way. The camera takes a mandatory shot from Teri's trembling hands. We feel compelled to roll our eyes, except we realize that Woon's explanation makes no sense at all. But the lack of substance did not stop Lee from making the film, so why would he cut this particularly ineffective scene? After all, the world can always use another cliché. <br /> <br /> Well, you say, the movie can be painful, but at least it must * be a technical masterpiece - say, "What Dreams Can Come." Sorry, on a technical basis, 'Yellow' disappoints as well. Lee's editions are awkward and upset the little rhythm in the film, but I'm sure Lee thought they seemed to be cool. To make matters worse, each frame is underexposed or overexposed. Although the light meter was invented in 1932, somehow the new technology did not reach the 'Yellow' scenario. <br /> <br /> In light of the film's complete deficiency, supporting actor Burt Couls, who plays Sin's best. friend Alex, performs relatively well. Although cakes dim a little, you can not blame him when Lee's script consists only in making ugly faces and screaming. Co-casting colleagues, on the other hand, do not demonstrate any restriction in their extrapolation. <br /> <br /> I have not seen a movie as bad as 'Yellow' in a very long time. And I really pray that I do not see a movie as bad as 'Yellow' for some time either. Please do not waste seeing it; life is already too short. Thank you.
