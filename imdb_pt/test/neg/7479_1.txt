He seems to be a control maniac. I heard him comment on "losing control of the show" and telling another guest that brought live animals that he had a rule - "no snakes". He needs to hire a comedy writer because his jokes are idiots. The only reason I see him is because he has some great guests and bands. <br /> <br /> I watched Craig Ferguson's show for a while, but his show is even worse. He likes bull sh ** to burn time. I do not think any man has a lot of future in talk shows late at night. <br /> <br /> Daily also has the annoying habit of sticking your tongue to lick your lips. He should do this at least 10 times per show. I like the band Joe Firstman. Carson Daily needs to calm down before it's too late.
