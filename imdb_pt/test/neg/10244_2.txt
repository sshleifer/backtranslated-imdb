I'm not a movie snob. I liked many movies that critics hate and I hated movies that critics love. However, I have to agree with the critics here - "Galaxina" is just below standard. Clearly meant to be a comedy, it just has a few laughs spread. "Galaxina" has bad photography; has bad special effects; has some very poor performance; and production values ​​... well, the sets could very well have been made of cardboard. "Galaxina" tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is searching for a magical object called "The Blue Star". "After a long journey (and some very unconvincing space battles), the crew arrives at its destination, a kind of alien world of the wild west.There is a painfully bland canteen scene (clearly designed to be a parody of the famous scene" Star Wars "), a chase involving space bikers and a final escape. <br /> <br /> The cast tries, but can not bring it to life. <br /> <br /> Stephen Macht and Avery Schreiber did a better job in other films. The late Dorothy Stratten stars as the title robot, and although she looks great, her role does not give her much of a chance to act. <br /> <br /> you can watch this movie to see Dorothy Stratten. However, if you're looking for a good movie, you'll probably want to skip this one.
