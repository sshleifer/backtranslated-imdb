I just wrote a review for "ACES HIGH" (1976) and it reminds me of this movie that I watched as a kid when it was released; since then I only watched it once and that was more than enough. As Kevin well says "it's a complete waste of time." In addition to dog fights that are well done, the rest is a string of poorly patched scenes with actors struggling with a bad script and equally bad direction. I do not remember the foolish German accents mentioned by Kevin in his comment, but that's another pathetic mistake; If Corman tried to make more convincing the characterization of the German pilots, why did he not use German actors or were these parts dubbed? On the other hand, it is a good example of Hollywood's shocking style of making films with its "villains" so clearly identifiable not only by their cruel actions but also by their grotesque accents. Speaking about "cruel actions" the ridiculous scene was the murders of Lieutenant Hermann Goering English nurses during an attack at an air base is an absolutely disgusting piece of propaganda made with "historical retrospect." If you want to see a factual, moving, well-portrayed and directed film about the Air War during the WWI watch "ACES HIGH" (1976) or that wonderful classic "The Dawn Patrol" (1938) you will not be disappointed.
