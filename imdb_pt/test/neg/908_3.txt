The film uses motifs that could be plagiarized from "Wait Until Dark" (1967), a much better film by Terence Young, starring Audrey Hepburn. "Dead Silent" is a pale paraphrase. There is nothing new here - the hidden object in the doll, the bad guys wanting it, the bad guy posing as a cool guy. The deficiency, however, changed: Audrey Hepburn could not see, the child in SD could not speak. But both stories depend on the handicap. Where "Wait Until Dark" built unbearable suspense, "Dead Silent" lets you guess the result, the story being a stereotype.
