In short, the film is about a gang war in the 1950s. Leon, the leader of the Deuces, begins the gang after brother OD in "junk." He promises to protect the neighborhood. The rival gang leader is just coming out of prison and wants revenge. <br /> <br /> The movie did not do that for me. The "Good Guys" were no better than the "Bad Guys". Very little was shown to suggest that the Deuces really cared about the community. I suppose the writers were going for realism here, but I do not care which side won. Neither character was sympathetic, or even capable of attracting my sympathy. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Annie's and Bobby's courtship had a sulky dialogue, and the overall performance was well done.
