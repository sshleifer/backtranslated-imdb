The COC had its moments. I liked the sequences of action, but I despised the script and the plot. I hate this movie so much, I'm going to write about the stupidest part. First of all, the plot would never happen. Second, the coldness of the Chinese president was unnecessary. That would never happen. Finally, the dialogue. Employing non-Chinese actors to interpret Chinese roles is understandable, but writing a dialogue for them that is TOTALLY OUTSIDE is stupid! For those of you who understood the Chinese in the movie, you know what I mean.
