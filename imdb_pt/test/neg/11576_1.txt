I was watching the science fiction channel when this steaming pile of trash appeared. While not as bad as Wynorski's "Komodo Curse", it still sucks ... BAD. Wynorski uses the same island as in "Komodo Curse" as well as the same actors and house. The effects are top notch (amazing) but that's about it ........ I do not know what else to say about this movie ....... oh yeah! As in "Curse of the Komodo", the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island! Also .... when I saw this part I laughed hysterically ... THE KOMANBRA !!! (part man, komodo and snake!). Overall, this movie sucks, even in bad movie standards. Just remember if Jim Wynorski had something to do with a movie .... stay away ... to avoid falling asleep keep repeating "It's almost over .. it's almost over ...". 0 out of 5
