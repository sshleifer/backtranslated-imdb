When the movie starts, it's obvious how old and sick the kids are. Although Oliver Hardy is huge, it is Stanley who looks like death warmed up. Apparently he was seriously ill during the production and obviously had lost a lot of weight. Although he eventually heals and lives another decade and a half, here he looks like a dying man. Also, as I watched the film, I was shocked at how many falls Stan suffered - I half expected him to fall dead because of the effort. I really can not understand why they got out of retirement considering their health - especially when the story and the production values ​​are as bad as they are with this movie. <br /> <br /> Stanley inherits an island and a boat. He and Ollie are ready to leave when Antoine, a homeless man, is literally left on his boat and they begin their journey to find the island. Along the way, they discover that Giovanni hid, but despite this the four men become friends and land on a different island. It seems like a paradise and everyone is very happy. A little later, a beautiful young woman joins them and everything looks great. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, uranium is discovered on the island and the site is flooded with scourge. Eventually, the crowd decides to hang the four men and take control - at which point the island sinks back into the sea and the men are spared. <br /> <br /> I would give the movie some credit for being original and for being interesting. However, one thing that is not is FUNNY - and this is unforgivable for a Laurel and Hardy movie. Although not a bad movie, it's certainly not a good movie. A sad end to your brilliant careers. <br /> <br /> All actors, except the duo, are dubbed English, as the film was made in France. Although it may not be the worst movie they've done (this would be THE GREAT NOISE), it sure is close !! Watching this movie is painful and like seeing people cleaning up after a serious accident.
