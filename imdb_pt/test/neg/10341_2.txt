I watched the screening of this movie. It was forged with clich√©s and bland jokes. I think the other reviews were from people who must have worked on the film or been family members of the cast. I'm surprised that this movie cost $ 3 million to $ 4 million without any real stars. Where did the budget go? Obviously it was not for writers to rewrite. Nice thought of betting on the success of Big Fat Greek Wedding, but a great lack. There was little or no spark between the main characters and the inciting incident was a bit flimsy at best. The direction was not inspired and it looked like a student movie. <br /> <br /> I do not even know what it means. Everyone wants Italian. This is a true saying. I've never heard it.
