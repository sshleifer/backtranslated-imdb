THE GOOD: The performance was great, especially Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. Terrence Howard should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor instead of Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> EVIL: I am a visible (not white) minority and have experienced some form of racism in my life. But despite my life experiences and the subject of the film, I definitely would not say that this movie is the best of the year, in fact, it's a long way from that. I have problems with this film both from a viewer's perspective and from the perspective of a visible minority. Some of my problems with this movie are: <br /> <br /> (1) Bad character development (or none). Just because we saw extremes in a character, for example, Matt Dillon being a racist cop and being a good caretaker for his sick father, that does not mean that the character is well developed at all. Yes, I admit that in a big cast like this movie, it's very difficult for all characters to be well-developed, BUT that does not mean that none of the characters should be like this. <br /> <br /> (2) The dialogue seems really artificial to the point that I'm really surprised that this movie has been awarded Best Original Screenplay. They should show this film in a script class not because it's good, but to show students and future screenwriters what NOT to do. I felt like I'd been hit by the head over and over again as racism is bad. I understood. <br /> <br /> (3) The plot seems so coincidental that it is laughable. What are the chances that a black-car thief runs over an Asian man who is also a human smuggler as he walks into his van, and the same thief of black cars ended up robbing that Asian guy's van several hours after he brought the hospital to him? only to find that the various Asians being trafficked inside the van just to show that the black car thief has a good side, after all? Or how about that scene where a biased white class woman who came down the stairs and all her prejudice and hatred disappeared into thin air? If so, why do not we play all the racists in the United States down the stairs so they can change their minds? <br /> <br /> (4) I think my biggest doubts about this movie are unrealistic. view of racism. As someone who has experienced racism in my life, the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden and not in your face. I refused to go into a supermarket because I'm not white. Did the shop owner say why I was not white? No, he said the store was closing, although there were a lot of people shopping inside. He shouted racial slurs? No. Racism in America is more hidden. Some taxi drivers probably will not stop to pick you up because you are non-white but that does not mean they will try to run you over or leave and say racial slurs. If a Chinese woman broke me, I will not say "blake! Blake! Learn some English bitch!". On the other hand, if I were a Chinese woman and accidentally ended up with a Mexican woman, I will not say "Mexicans are bad drivers" in front of her face. This is not how things work. Instead, I would give my insurance information, apologize, and go home and tell my Chinese friends and family that the Mexicans are bad drivers and mock them behind their backs. This is true racism. It's hidden and not in your face. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Crash is not original, contrary to what some people may say. The intertwined and intertwined story lines, graphics, and characters were made before. "Magnolia" is a film that does so much better than Crash and yet has never been nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture. He had a stellar cast - Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who won the Best Actor award recently), Tom Cruise, etc. It's really confusing how Crash was nominated for Best Picture.
