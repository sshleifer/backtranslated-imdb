The breadth and height of the scale of this film dominate me. About a week ago, I published a commentary on the 1926 epic, the MACISTE IN HELL mass, referring to it as "disconcerting." Then I found the Pollonia Bros. RED BLOOD PLANET. Wow ... <br /> <br /> It's all about the scale of thinking behind it. Pollonia Bros and his colleague John McBride were thinking so well that the reflections of Arthur C. Clark and Stanley Kubrick in 2001: "The Space Odessa" was lucky to have been released thirty-two years before that love. In fact, Kubrick had it easy with modelers, a budget, real actors and big studio supporting his little Star Trek, and all Arthur C. Clarke had to do was write the damn thing. What is so hard about muscles around a typewriter? The Pollonia brothers, on the other hand, had to think radically, out of the box and quickly. They recruited half a dozen of their friends and colleagues - including a hot girl - bought a bunch of colored lamps, raided old dumpsters for every keyboard, monitor and hands-free headset they could find, they all looked the same. Black turtlenecks, taken with all county cupcakes cases, learned to model and texture enough to animate a pair of spaceships, spent a few hours making a script, performed what is easily the scariest space monster puppet since that the horrible little monster that Jabba the Hut carried with him was fried by R2D2, spent literally days working with a VHS camera and an Amiga to film and edit his movie, and emerged as the winner. This is the best D.I.Y. Straight to the epic domestic video of the fan film I've seen, and in proportion to the amount of talent and resources available to dwarven filmmakers up to LOGANS RUN or BATTLESTAR: GALACTICA (the original series) as being a creepy look at our future, to a presenter wearing a poorly adjusted and poorly adjusted second suit. As a species, we are doomed. <br /> <br /> Seriously for a minute though, it's a great improvement on later epics like CHRONIC DINOSAUR or PREYALIEN: FOREIGN PRISONERS, which is funny since it was made before any of these masterpieces. Somewhere along the lines, the Pollonia began to calm down: this movie runs with a certain conviction that makes you believe that you can actually breathe in the vacuum using a dust mask and two bottles of squirt. And the scene in which the alien beast consumes a miniaturized crew member made me immediately think of where I had seen it before: GODZILLA VS. THE SEA MONSTER, where the giant monster crab spits two canoers and eats them on the camera. It made me cry when I was a child. <br /> <br /> It made me cry like an adult because here I'm wasting my time trying to be some kind of critic or writer or writer / critic and these guys get to have fun, actually making a true fiction epic with a lot of colorful lights, a hot slide projector and a KAL. One of the flight crew even wears his black baseball cap back and looks with the goatee like that Metallica clown. Is this supposed to be a joke? No. It's an epic statement about humanity, humanity, and humanity that deserves to be seen by anyone who has the ability not to take it too seriously. Look at it in a set of 2 disc boxes called GALAXY OF TERROR in the trimming bins of your favorite discount retailer, which is probably where it belongs, but how many of us can say "Yes, they have some sets of movies for sale on Best Buy. " <br /> <br /> 4/10: Anyone who has no sense of humor may want to try SILENT RUNNING or maybe TRON. But some day an alien civilization on the other side of the galaxy will intercept the broadcast of this movie and decide that we should not be confused. Good job guys !!
