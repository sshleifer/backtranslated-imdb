I was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and I know a bit about Tudor England. <br /> <br /> The direction of writing and editing this TV movie for the most part was really horrible. I felt like I was watching a very bad drama movie about the analyzer period then a movie. <br /> <br /> First there were many cuts between important parts. And leaving out important events that happened at the time, one of them is the fall of Henry to Rome because of his desire to divorce Catherine of Aragon, which led England to break with Rome and establish their own church. they barely got stuck in the book. I'm all for creative freedom, but to a limit, especially when you're dealing with a well-written book as your starting point. in the book Mary gives birth to young Catherine first and then she has the young Henry born. Your father is Henry's eight. in the movie they show first Harry, then Catherine. And to suggest that Catherine's father is William Carey. <br /> <br /> There are many bad times in the movie to write them all. <br /> <br /> However, I will say that Jodhi May and Natascha McElhone portray since the Boleyn sisters were probably the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> If you have not read the book yet and know nothing about the Hennry 8 court, I recommend staying away from this movie. And for those who read the book, the movie will bother you because of its lack of detail and important plot.
