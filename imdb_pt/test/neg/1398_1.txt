This is the most unfortunate excuse for a comedy show I've ever seen. I'm confused that this guy was given his own show. It smells of utter desperation on the part of the central comedy, trying to fill the void left by the talented and incomparable Dave Chapelle. It's a hint of the golden bag of Ned's comedy: Is not a joke funny? Need to give an extra boost to the joy? F *** ING YELL it on top of your lungs. Simple does not it? And as an added bonus .... finish half of your jokes with ... then you're re-TAH-DED! or DUH-DU-DUUUUHHHH! Oh, man. So funny. Beaner ... hilarious. Wetback .... the laughter forever? <br /> <br /> To illustrate my point in a more cerebral way, I will cite one example. Mencia jokes about how "retarded" it is to rebuild New Orleans because it is so close to the water. Genius. The line of distinction between a great comedian and a hack has never been so clearly drawn. While a good comedian would find hidden humor in tragedy, finding subtle ways to weave a joke into something we can all laugh at and console ourselves, Ned goes for the obvious. Move the city. Great. Wait, is this funny? Ned has no intellectual capacity to find the deeper meaning of things. The hurricane did not flood the city. The dam project was underfunded and in great need of federal dollars ... and behold! They broke. I think it's God's way of telling us not to be there. After all, he has a seat in Congress. What a fool. <br /> <br /> Chapelle was a master at turning a tired racial comic into his head. It was effortless, and at every point we were laughing with him. While Mencia talks about the blacks not being able to swim, * Chapelle advanced 300 meters ahead with the black and blind supra-supra. You do not have to be blunt to be nervous. You have to be original. <br /> <br /> Mencia and his legion of fans are like that gay guy who laughs very emphatically at gay jokes, thinking that this somehow masks his own insecurities. Except of course, with Ned, he's laughing very emphatically at the "retarded." Du-du-duuuuh.
