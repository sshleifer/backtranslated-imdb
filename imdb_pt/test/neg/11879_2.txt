What can I say about it? A great production of prestige - but in the end? Time wasted, money wasted. <br /> <br /> This work is a disaster seen historically. Just a few examples: Augustus is usually called 'Gaius' - his first name (Pronomen). But the ancient Romans do not use that name. Correct would be the surname (Nomen Gentile and Cognomen) or the 'Octavian', 'CÃ©sar', 'Augustus'. <br /> <br /> * Livia was shown as a tyrannical wife. But this historically wrong. Iulia was shown as a nice young woman - but she was not one. Adultery and (perhaps?) Prostitution and arrogant behavior was the cause of their banishment. She was not in bed dying from her father. She was never allowed to leave her banishment. And she was around the age of 50! Not as young as she was shown. In the same year Augustus died, she committed suicide, because Tiberius stopped giving her a pension. Augustus was much more unscrupulous then in this movie shown. But the author and the director seem to believe in Augustus' own "Res Gestae." <br /> <br /> What's left? Historically extremely dubious, poor performance, bad built and equipment - 2 points on 10 - one for Peter O'Toole.
