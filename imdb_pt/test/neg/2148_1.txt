You know you have a bad movie when you hear that the soundtrack runs completely on a single cheap programmable synthesizer without any melody or sense of rhythm. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see how anyone could handle it. seriously, even when giving a bad review. This movie is well below "bad." <br /> <br /> The continuity of this film is shockingly massacred. In a fight scene, we, the hero (wearing jeans and T-shirt) round the corner with two revolvers in hand; he folds back, only now he has two semi-automatic on his hands; he turns another corner and now he has an automatic rifle in his hands; he chases a hallway and leaves (suddenly dressed in standard army barrel jacket) with a shotgun; after he leaves the building with another automatic rifle. Or here's one for the books - a bus crashes into a car at high speed; the car flies, launched by a gigantic explosion - cuts the bus that is completely unscathed from the same explosion? Narrative continuity suffers from an equally numbing sense of unreality; the bad guys really want to kill the hero - obviously - but every time they knock him down or put him in a vulnerable position, they decide they want him to "live to see it!" There is? One of the funniest moments in the movie is when the hero is released from isolation because his lawyer came to see him; then the thug decides he will not let the two of them meet after all; and this despite the fact that the villain, the hero and his lawyer know what is happening anyway, then the hero writes a note to the lawyer and then we see the note passed to the lawyer by another prisoner, even if we never see the hero give it to him. (This lawyer, BTW, has full access to the ATF Offices in California, including his confidential computer files.) Huh? Well, but it's an irrational action movie - so how are the action scenes? Not bad, surprisingly; unfortunately, they are stolen from about a dozen Hong Kong movies made five or ten years earlier. The opening scene, a shooting in a junkers garage, actually has shots whose composition is stolen straight from "Hard Boiled" - so clearly that it's a wonder John Woo has not sued for plagiarism. Other Stolen Hong Kong films include "Prison on Fire", "Burning Island", "Burning Paradise", "Police Story" I, II and III (also known as "Supercop"). I thought I recognized some clips from Sammo Hung here too. In other words, action scenes are exciting only in that they are successful duplications of action scenes from other films. <br /> <br /> There's nothing you can do with this movie, unless you shoot and need a lot. of visual stimuli that need not make sense. <br /> <br /> Very funny movie, for all the wrong reasons.
