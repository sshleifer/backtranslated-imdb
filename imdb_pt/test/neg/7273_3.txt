I decided to watch this ultra-low budget film from the studio "Poverty Row", PRC, because it co-starred the exciting actor, Lionel Atwill ?? and I really enjoyed the title. Although Atwill often plays these cheap movies, his excellent acting style has always made the films look much better, since his on-screen character was great (his real life is also quite interesting - like a bizarre novel). The reason I use the term "Poverty Row" is that it was a nickname given to the cheaper and worse production companies of the time. Many of them were neither real studios, but production companies that rented space and scenery from the big studios at night! Yes, there is a good chance that this was filmed after normal business hours - a common thing for these studios. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Lionel Atwill telling his friends a story about something he was involved years ago. behind. A doctor falls in love with a lady, but is afraid to tell her about himself. That's because your job is to put people to death on Death Row, not exactly a job of glamor! Doc asks his friend (Atwill) for advice on how to share her with her, but regardless of that she will not have the man. Later, you realize that it is because your own parents were criminals. <br /> <br /> Later a man is killed and you are involved, although it is obvious to anyone with a brain that your sister was involved. a bit of a nut) and the evidence against the lady was poor. But apparently the jury was full of people with no brain and she was convicted and sent to the death row. Even more brainless is that his former boyfriend was the man responsible for his execution. Do not you think anyone could be able to handle this case? Until that fateful hour, her friend (Atwill) spends much of the film trying to prove her innocence - and proves that the weird sister knows a lot more about the case than she will admit. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is only slightly interesting and a little silly. While it's watchable and Atwill is good (as usual), the rest of the movie never really rises above the mundane and some of the performances are pretty bad. It's sub-par and about what you'd expect from a low-budget movie and nothing more, despite the legal title.
