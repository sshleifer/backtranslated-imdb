First I have to say that I do not really like fiction movies! But there are some movies that I really liked. This is one of the others;) I have the same opinion as some (most) others here. The movie is still happening behind my back, but the few effects are not enough to watch all the time ... I think what they did well were the animated scenarios with 3 suns and 4 Moons, but it's the only one I liked . There are no smart dialogues (there are ???). But it's a great movie for everyone who loves Lara Croft or a few other girls in HOT-PANTS ...;) <br /> <br /> For the directors: "Stop to try again, PLEASE !!!"
