The funniest thing about Fortunes is that one of the main characters, Lewis (Urbaniak) has a writer block and apparently the same did the screenwriter of the film. This is also sad, as I think in general, this must be a comedy, or drama, but this is the funniest thing I remember watching this. <br /> <br /> Three friends go out and drink. one night. On the way home, two decide that their fortunes are told by a "Gypsy," as they call it. These two lives crumble as the third friend waits. So nothing happens. <br /> <br /> I hope I did not spoil the movie there, but really, this low-budget, bad quality movie had some kind of idea when it started, but it quickly turned into the depths of hell. Yeah, I'm being tough. Honestly, it was not so bad, it was just blah. The writer mentioned was annoying to watch, though he may have delivered one or two of the two single funny lines. The clich√© "man of women", the only one who did not receive his fortune said that it was simply annoying. The only bright spot was the remaining friend, the married father whose fortune was informed that something big would happen to his son and he needed to be prepared. He was funny, genuine and clearly the best actor in the movie. Unfortunately, that's not saying much. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm being too cruel. Heck, they had the ambition to make a movie, they went and they got funding and they did something. Unfortunately, however, I can not recommend the film; there are hundreds of thousands of other independent films that have hundreds of thousands of ideas and better plays. This was literally 10 minutes from an idea stretched by another 81 boring minutes.
