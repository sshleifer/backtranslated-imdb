I do not think I've already given a 1/10 grade, but this one easily gets the appellation. I find it hard to just sit on one of your jokes. It's not just that the jokes are so bad, but they combine this with the fact that the Carson Daily has zero charisma, can not rearrange or end a joke, and you have a night comedy recipe that will really upset your stomach. <br /> <br /> I watched the show, never in its entirety, but often still. This only scares me after Conan. I usually watch a minute or two just to see if Carson Daily is still the worst talk show host ever. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you see him interviewing a guest, it's just that, an interview. I feel so sad every time he has a guest and his confused smiles try to mask his body language that is screaming, "Take me away from that freak!" I recommend watching the show, not to laugh, but to reflect, how it got on the air and what it is still doing there. Watch as much as you can, I think you will find your complete embarrassment ... interesting.
