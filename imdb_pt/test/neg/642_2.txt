Alien Express is one of the worst movies I've bothered to experiment with. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable. The aliens look like rubber stocking dolls. The effects would have been mediocre in the 1970s, but they are just atrocious by today's standards. Could not they take a picture of a real train instead of using an obvious model? <br /> <br /> The performance is not great, but, in fact, the dialogue is the worst part. It opens the way in your mind. "Do not die on me, not now." If you can suspend disbelief long enough to be absorbed by the film, you will quickly be painfully shaken back to reality by the aliens, the train model or the cliche dialogue. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not give this movie a "1" is that it does not deserve to be rated so poorly that some poor suckers can watch it for the pleasure inherent in a really bad movie.
