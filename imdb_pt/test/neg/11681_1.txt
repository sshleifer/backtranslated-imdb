I rented a copy of this from Netflix - a big mistake. The DVD version titled "The Arm Swordsmen" was produced by mad men who thought the fight sequences would be appreciated best glued together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent and sequential story. Part of the story has been left in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Do not rent or buy. Not that there was anything wonderful about the original story, a complicated absurdity. As much as I enjoyed seeing Wang Yu at his peak again after all these years, this is a complete waste of time. I had detergents that made a better film than that. What the dented DVD version shows us is that, no matter how silly a Chinese script may be, you have to see some kind of story to worry about the way the fight sequences end. <br /> <br /> But "The One-Arm Swordsmen" offer the chance to see the faithful and blond Wang and the brothers Shaw Lo Lieh beating up the handsome and smiling boy David Chiang - it is always a pleasure to see this happen . He plays a sort of second-string villain here and serves as a prime example of why some people really need orthodontists. The film is also awarded with the participation of Taiwanese actor Chang Yi as the magistrate. <br /> <br /> Another comment above mentions the mandatory fight scene at the inn (there are actually two) where Wang and Chiang are attacked by a band of comic barbarians using what look like caveman weapons, making Bruce Lee resounds as they fight. None of this makes sense, but it's okay if you're not expecting any clarity or common sense. It was fun to watch anyway. <br /> <br /> Another peculiarity of this production is that there are no significant female characters. There are some female roles, but they do not play a serious role in the action or the plot. <br /> <br /> If you can find a copy of Shaw's original One-Weapon Swordsman movie, which explains why he has only one arm and why he uses a broken sword, go ahead.
