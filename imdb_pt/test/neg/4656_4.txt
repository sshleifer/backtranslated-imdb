Like his almost contemporary "The Great Race" and "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines," I have always associated this movie with my childhood, especially in the New Year. On New Year's Day we would visit my grandmother and after lunch, while the adults talked, the kids would watch TV, where invariably one of those three crazy fucking movies would pass. <br /> <br /> Just for that reason, I really wanted to mark "Monte Carlo Or Bust" well, but I fear I can not, the child not being the father of man on this occasion. By that I mean that I can clearly see her faults and while I was tempted to smile occasionally, in fact I really wanted all the competitors to reach the end of the race long before they really did. <br /> Of course it is dated by its stereotypes of nationalities and women as the fragile sex and I also do not care much for one or two vaguely recognized vulgarities that occasionally appear. More than that, though, the cast, despite cornering it scandalously just did not sell enough film. Tony Curtis, in a test for his "Yank Abroad" in the TV series "The Persuaders", seems too old to be playing the gallant young man, Terry Thomas is not mean enough, Eric Sykes is unbelievable as a dirty Minded Lothario, while Gert Frobe as an exaggerated Teuton, it's weird to do a camp comedy when you remember that he was Bond's best villain, Goldfinger. If anything the Englishers do better - Susan Hampshire is at least engaging as a "bright young woman," properly gamine as a snappy elegant, and although chained to the script's leash, Pete and Dud offer the most fun as upper-lip army types rigid , although the "Carry On" team has done much better in "Carry On Up The Khyber Pass." Director Annakin tries everything to evoke the "Golden Silents," with clown lashes, deceptive identities, faster camera shots, dramatic acrobatics, and some light novels, but there is no real tension for one. race so famous and, anyway, the dispute at the end seems more like a swizz. <br /> <br /> Actually, I would have given another note if they had gotten the alternate title "Those Magnificent Men in Their Fun Jalopies", but in fact the animated series "Wacky Races" made it so much better.
