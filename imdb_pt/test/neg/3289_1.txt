I finally got to go through an entire episode of this show. I was very, very tired. Clearly. Previously, I always had to turn it off because I thought it was so bad. Watching an entire episode convinces me that it really is that bad. I could not even tell you what happened, but I clearly remember not laughing. For people who think this is the new All in the Family or Married with Children ... have you ever watched these shows? They are well written and well represented and, most important, funny! This show is not funny. You might think so, if this is the first sitcom you've ever watched. I can not see who else would. I echo all the previous feelings about Arrested Development, etc ... It's probably my fault for getting frustrated with the television and not watching it, thus allowing stupid people to dictate what really gets in the air.
