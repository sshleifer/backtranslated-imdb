I actually own this movie which is the MST3K version called "Cave Dwellers" which is really the only way anyone could actually watch a movie like this. If it were not for Joel, Crow and Tom Servo constantly joking, it would not be possible to get through this crap. You have a hero named Actor who looks a lot like Jeff Spigoli in the Fast Times of Ridgemont High and looks just a little smarter without being stoned. Invisible men, a giant snake (with a bunch of anal retentive snakes who like to line up all skulls to match in the same way), invents a hang glider that suspiciously looks like a modern aluminum one with some cheap vines wrapped around it, and then battling against the evil face of John Saxon. Then he rides his horse on the tire track where someone has been on four wheels. <br /> <br /> Yes, I have gained most of the MST3K, which as I said is the only way to watch this movie turkey. If it were not for this, it would receive zero stars.
