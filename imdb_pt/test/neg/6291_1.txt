The film is an adaptation of a Japanese story by respected author Yukio Mishima. It simply does not make the transition to a credible story about Brits and Americans. <br /> <br /> The story moves slowly, especially the part where Miles and Kristofferson are separated and the director fills in the clich√©d shots of a movie. the bow of the ship crossing the waves and the small route line filling the maps, while his letters are heard in overvoice. The film moves so languidly that I even programmed it quickly through the scenes of sex and masturbation that, although long, are not really passionate or erotic. The film reached a certain extent of notoriety when the then wife of Kristofferson divorced of him by extracurricular activities with Miss Miles during the filming. I think they liked the sex scenes, but it's not exactly the same for a viewer. <br /> <br /> There are no characters to cling to. The sexually frustrated widow is unpleasant, the child is detestable. Kristofferson is kind enough but he simply does not have the acting skills to bring much to the role, although maybe we really do not want to get too involved with him considering his final destination. <br /> <br /> For the little boy, well, he kind of falls down with a bad crowd after his father dies, and they help him plot an evil against the man who enters his mother's life. Now this is a very bad crowd. They do not just steal and smoke drugs, nosireebib. They slip a mickey for a cat and the vivisectam. This is shown in bloody details. But of course, this is only practical so they can do the same thing with Kristofferson! <br /> <br /> So the movie moves more slowly, with no characters to relate to, and when something happens it's untiringly morbid. <br /> <br /> The ending is as unsatisfactory as any movie you can see. <br /> <br /> All of this may have made sense if the local and Japanese cultural context had been maintained. As it stands, it's just abysmal. <br /> <br />
