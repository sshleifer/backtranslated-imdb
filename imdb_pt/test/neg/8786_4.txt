I rented this when it came out on video cassette in 1995. After re-watching again, my idea about this has not changed much. <br /> <br /> I was an adult then and I'm still an adult now! lol <br /> <br /> The illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers did not bother me. This is not a documentary, it's a fantasy story where animals can talk! <br /> <br /> While I did not care for most of the songs, I liked that at the end of the picture, where it is sung by Barry Manilow and someone else. <br /> <br /> Some people seem to give an excuse for their primitive animation by saying that CGI was not used often in animations, but let's not forget that THE LION KING was released about a year ago. earlier and that has possibly packed more excellence than any animation feature that came before it !! <br /> <br /> But I think it's pretty fair to say that ARBOR AND PINGOIN was made in the cheap as LION'S KING was not t .... <br /> <br /> The high points for me in 1995, as well as today, is the suspense generated by the few scenes of dangerous (mainly) underwater pursuit. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the opening scene that happens on a page of music notes and a bit of love story. But most of the time, the story dragged on and was boring. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look if you like animation, but if you're an adult and not a risk taker, get another Walt Disney production instead!
