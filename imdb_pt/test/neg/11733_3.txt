Honestly, how hard can it be to make a good remake? Obviously very difficult! I was sooooo excited to see this because I loved the original, and my friends will see it and tell me it really sucks. Well, I finally see and I was so disappointed. Ok, the shower scene was more realistic ... that's why I gave it a 3. Otherwise it sucked. Vince Vaughn does a terrible job playing Norman, he's very dense or something. I do not know, it was just terrible. I do not see it!
