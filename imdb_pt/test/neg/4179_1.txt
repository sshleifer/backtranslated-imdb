If you want to take advantage of the money it would take to rent that money, buy an ice bag and watch it melt. This is more fun than this movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Cowell, with shame. <br /> <br /> Or if you want to see the plot of the movie, go on a cornfield, bring two of the dullest girls you can find, run around for a few hours with the girls screaming as loud as possible . So send me the couple of money you'd spend. <br /> <br /> I liked the first Black Harvest, after watching the sequel, I'm going to cry until I sleep.
