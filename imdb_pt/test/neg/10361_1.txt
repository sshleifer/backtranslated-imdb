I mean, nothing happens, 5 idiot kids go to Oklahoma to find a magic jungle of marijuana ... this could have been fun if it was not for the 5 worst actors in the world. And the dialogues were not at all funny. The only thing I almost bared my teeth at was when dumb cops stopped teens in Oklahoma or Kansas ... The plot could have been fun, were it not for an abysmal interpretation. If you think about watching this crap movie, do not think. How stupid it is that the guy stays away from the cops saying he's gay, like his friend did (except he was not pretending ...) and there's that stupid joke about the various meanings for the word "gay." I'm laughing my hair out ....... NO ....... Either way ... FINE MOVIE I've seen !!
