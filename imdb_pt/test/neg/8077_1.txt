This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot is a joke, the effects are terrible, the cinematography does not fit the tone of the film, the dialogue is tacky, and the actors do a good job at ruining the rest. People simply do not act like this in real life situations. My question is: Who would finance this crap? <br /> <br /> The movie begins where some gold miners fall into a mine after a firefighter can not save them. Then we join some motorcyclists in a forest who are doing acrobatics on their bikes. A guy falls and breaks his leg or something. The firefighter is here to help you. Meanwhile, someone starts a fire. A few more motorcycle stunts. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> I wasted my time. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie.
