Cultural Vandalism Is Hallmark's new Gulliver Travels production an act of cultural vandalism? Not literally. After all, not a single copy of the book is recorded. But if this is the only people Gulliver who is exposed to ?? and for many, these people will not receive anything like what Jonathan Swift intended. If Jonathan Swift were alive, Hallmark could be sued for moral rights violations and they would lose. This is a good way of thinking before starting a project using someone else's ideas. <br /> <br /> Swift's masterpiece is an extraordinary sight of humanity. Through his hero, Gulliver, he travels to places that make him feel big, small, crappy and ?? human. The small people in Lilleput are small in every way. Insignificant and stupid, they fight, the great and unhappy, endless wars of annihilation, on which boiled eggs are opened on the breakfast table. Sounds a bit like us. <br /> <br /> I forget most of the rest: it's been years since I've read it. The program reminded me of some things and, on the positive side, made me want to read it again. <br /> <br /> This gift to mankind was broken, like Gulligan under the branches under the vulgar. yahoos, and Danson, Steenbergen and especially two great actors, Peter O'Toole and Edward Fox, should be completely ashamed. Some "creative people" had the bright idea of ​​focusing on "the star": Gulliver, played by Ted Danson, whose acting is simply bad. He portrays Gulliver as crazy. All your travels have been made. Weeeeel Yeeeaaah! Of course Swift invented Gulliver! Of course, the lands he visited were imaginary: this is called fiction. His purpose was to talk about humanity and our often terrible relationships with one another. The journeys of his imaginary character to imaginary lands is his method. But these people treat the imagination as a disease and anyone who has a time when Hallmark could not turn into one of their nonsense cards is suspect. <br /> <br /> I can see why Hallmark would produce such crap. It's so bad that O'Toole, always deep, seems as little as his Lilliputian character. He is in character, of course, while commenting on the character simultaneously, as many if not all great actors do. Informing the character sheds light on him. Our light completes the character. It becomes three-dimensional through this act of psychic triangulation. Most of the actors do it in a very subtle way, like Hopkins in "The Remains of the Day." Others, like Nicholson, in most things over the last twenty years, play the two very separate parts. Nicholson really plays with the relationship of his two points and with us too: with him is the whole cradle of the cat and he, laughing, holds all the ropes. Great fun, like O'Toole. But something here is missing. He is screaming in a megaphone (as big as ever) and all the senses are a hollow shell under him. <br /> <br /> That's why it is. Look for "anodyne" and there should be the word "Hallmark" as synonymous. Harmless, bland, harmless: Hallmark is the doll that can not pee because it has no genitals: it's the norm, the average, the person without distinction. Hallmark's trademark is non-trademark. I never suspected that these people despise so much those who have imagination. Suddenly, "Disney vs. Metaphysicists" by Pound stands out in bold. Einstein's "men of genius will always be violently fought by mediocre minds." In fact, anyone, for this mediocre type, who has an answer to any question other than "a)" or "b)" is suspect. Who more distinctive than a man who travels to the darkest places of the human soul and shines his little lantern to illuminate what can be found there? Hence the act of vandalism. The Taliban destroyed the Buddhas in Afghanistan, the Palestinians the oldest synagogue in the world in Jericho, the barbarians the great statuary of the classical era and these things are obviously vandalic. Hallmark strives to protect us from foreign enemies, undermining our own culture; the one who feeds and sustains them. It is us. <br /> <br /> Please purchase a copy of Gulliver's Travels Wherever You Live and Read It. Or order online. I like to use ABE books.
