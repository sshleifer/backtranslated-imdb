I come from Bangladesh, and here, C.C.Costigan is an incredible sex goddess. Joking aside, a friend and I were up in the middle of the night watching movies on Encore: Action when we came across a number of science fiction films. There was RoboCop 2 (not bad, not bad ...) then Judge Dredd (Stalone almost ruined his career) and then a movie called Lethal Target. One might think that the title "Lethal Target" could only be awarded to a very cool and really extravagant Rambo knock-off. But no, what's delivered is what I'd like to call "Semi-softcore, semi-pseudo-action, semi-science fiction" ... actually, I guess I can say that this is not even a movie at all. If it were not for the heat of the main character, my friend and I would have turned off the movie when the opening credits were released. <br /> <br /> I have some questions for people (I would not do that). I dare say "professionals") who made this film. "A future, why are they using the weaponry we used in 1999?" Oh, wait, I get it, that's all they could have in their hands, ... right ... ... well then ... why the main character is wearing what looks like a normal linen shirt and a vest? , like what people wore in the late nineties? .... oh ... I understood ... in space, it must have been a fashion statement ... well, then ... WHY, OH, WHY does the main character get a 3.5 floppy at one point in the movie so she can do something stupid? wtf! ... we have progressed so far that we have space travel, but have not yet progressed beyond 1.44 megabytes of space ...? <br /> <br /> I think I'm just asking too much. <br /> Question two, let's just say ... that yes ... this is a softcore porn. So why is there just one real sex scene, and why does it last 2 minutes? <br /> <br /> I mean, you're catching the people of REASON getting in the middle of the night to see this crap (dare I say 'movie' more?) ... and reduce it to 2 minutes. Hell, they should have just taken that sex scene and sold it to another porn movie, and they'd still make more money out of that "crap" than they did. <br /> <br /> CCCortigan is hot. And no offense to the actress, but she acts as well as I do. and I am mentally retarded, and I only have one testicle ... (C.C. Cortigan, ... send me an email ... let's have lunch) I would write more, but I ran out of space.
