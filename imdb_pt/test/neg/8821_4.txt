I've heard a lot of bad things about this movie before watching it but I thought all the negative reviews were probably related to the film's low budget and bad acting - both of which I can handle when it comes to zombie movies. However, what I did not tell you is that this movie is really very annoying; If there is one thing you can count on with low budget zombies, your blood and entertainment - but unfortunately, this movie does not have either. I'm rather surprised because the two previous horror movies I've seen from director Bob Clark - Deathdream and Black Christmas - were both highly creative and entertaining, but Kids should not play with dead things just do not cut it. The plot follows a group of young adults who travel to an island of burial in order to fiddle with rituals to bring the dead back to life. However, they soon discover that playing with things they do not understand is a really stupid idea when their rituals actually bring the dead back to life and the corpses of the island come back to feast on their blood! <br /> <br /> The plot looks like it could lead to a decent movie, but what I did not mention is that the interesting parts do not start until the final twenty minutes; and as this is a ninety minute movie, I'm sure you can imagine that this is not a good thing. The opening hour and ten minutes are filled with bad action and even worse characters. I can understand the configuration of a situation so that the horror is more powerful when it comes; but please, if you're going to spend so much time, you really have to make it interesting. All the characters in the movie are exaggerated and annoying, and personally I just wanted the zombies to hurry up and eat. The film is not without its merits, however, as the atmosphere is a highlight. Lucius Fulci would show seven years later as an isolated island and meat eating zombies can blend well; but Bob Clark already did it with this movie. The direction is also not bad, but it is hampered by makeup effects and a lack of blood, which does not appeal to fans of zombie movies. Overall, I really can not recommend this movie; but if you're a hardcore zombie fanatic, you can have fun with it.
