Oh gosh. This sequel has a mirror, this time housing the evil spirit of a psychopath who murdered an entire family with a shotgun in the Amityville house. The mirror captured the whole ugly incident of the horrified family that did not have time to prepare for the uninvited guest. The mirror is given to a photographer, Keyes (Ross Partridge) by a vagabond (.. who happens to be his lunatic father, and the man responsible for killing the family) and evil soon terrifies those in an attic (.. like Keyes is having nightmares, looking through his father's eyes as he lowers his family in cold blood, worried that he will be able to follow his steps in. Soon he sees other occurrences through his father's eyes like that terrible day he hits his mother's head against the floor of an institution or experiencing a moment inside the cell while the doctor administers a drug to immobilize him. <br /> Casting support that deserves better than being stuck in rubbish like this, like David Naughton (American werewolf in London) as the owner of the loft with which Keyes lives, Richard Roundtree as an eccentric sculptor / artist, Terry O'Qui nn as a psychologist - Detective, and especially Lin Shaye as a hilarious and rather strange secretariat in the asylum (..the one held by Keyes' father) will soon be closed. <br /> <br /> Completing the film, Lala Sloatman sexy as leggy as Keyes's supporting girlfriend, Barbara Howard (Friday the 13th as the Final Chapter) as Naughton's betrayed wife (he was about to start a case with Nickman-Soul), Jack Orend as the sadistic demon who tries to provoke his son to kill innocent people as he did, and Robert Rusler (A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge) as a rejected lover (.. of Nickson-Soul) finding an unfortunate death while tearing pictures as a revenge for his dismissal. /> <br /> This film is a poor special effects film using only the Amityville title as a money. The franchise was never so good to begin with, but as each sequel was green, it got worse and worse. After the third movie, the infamous house furniture becomes "possessed" items that plague people. The cast struggles, however, but the material (a mirror causing chaos and murder through supernatural means) lacks quality ... and the rather mediocre special effects do not help at all. O'Quinn, as little as he has to work, shows why he is a great actor, he can even shine in excrement like this. All is not lost, you get to see Sloatman always wearing super short skirts (.. or his man's shirt in his panties), showing his legs everywhere .. hey, you have to find a silver lining somewhere. Believe it or not, AMITYVILLE: A NEW GENERATION was the seventh movie in the franchise! The coolest part of the film was the portraits of demons painted by the Nickson-Soul artist, perhaps inspired by the evil mirror after examining him.
