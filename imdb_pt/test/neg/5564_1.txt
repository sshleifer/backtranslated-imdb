I hate this movie !!!!!! I've never seen such complete and complete trash in my life !!! I live in France, so I discovered that I was on the front line to watch this horrible movie. At first it seemed cool, something like something about a cursed forest that chews people. Unfortunately, it turned out that it was something very different: a good start with a girl who knows a guy and everything, so the girl is threatening messages in the form of crows in the bathroom closet (ridiculous), that bit and so, the movie begins to slide down quickly with much desperate agitation in the process. The movie ends with plenty of druid sacrifices and old ugly, stinking creatures coming back from the past to kill some people. Many questions were running through my head so far: why the hell did they bring back that stinking monster? Do druids look like maniacs dressed in sheets? Why did they bother making this movie? The movie's "climax" was so silly that I laughed all the time: the "horrible" stinking monster struggles with the two young women (who seem to be experienced masters of kung fu) and the teacher is cut in two or something. What struck me was that the monster was so slow and awkward in battle, should not it be a war god or something? Anyway, the movie at his death was a lamentable sight. A brief condensation of the contents of this film: Kung fu mayhem + druid stones + mysterious murders "a la thriller" + ancient prophecies + poor crows + old and clumsy god of war without bones + teacher of nuts = full and complete, sick, boneless , eaten GODFORSAKEN, GODDAM, RECYCLED, FALSE, WANNABE, LUDICROUS SH * T !!!!!!!!! Things I learned from this movie: - Ancient war gods are crappy in kung fu. All young women who study archeology at university in France are experts in kung fu. -Professors are so sturdy they can survive being cut in two by a mass of saw, without any damage.
