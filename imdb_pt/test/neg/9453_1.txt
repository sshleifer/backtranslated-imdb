A friend of mine loves cheesy horror movies, so I often see low-budget things like that. This is, however, the first time I've been forced to write a review of one ... <br /> <br /> Put simply, this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen! Worse still, Boggy Creek II! <br /> <br /> The whole budget for the movie seems to have been spent on a brief scene in the middle when Dr. Klaus is in this chamber thing and turns all vampires. The only good thing to say about it is that it was hilarious after a few beers (but for all the wrong reasons).
