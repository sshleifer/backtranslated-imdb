Sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says "Stay away from this movie." We should all pay more attention to this little voice. This may be the worst movie I have ever had the pleasure of not sitting down, or it may be the best reason to remember that your DVD player has a fast forward button. Made on a budget somewhere in the vicinity of $ 1.99, "The Cavern" is obviously a cheap cheap made to hitchhiker in the current group of scary-cave-lots of darkness-claustrophobic spelunkers-flicks unknown threat as "The Cave" and "The Descent". A few years ago there was a similar wave of similar films that used sea vessels instead of caves. Everyone had scary boats / submarines - many dark adventurers - claustrophobic - unknown threats ... same as ever. "The Cavern" is really "The Blair Witch Project" only this time we are lost underground and not lost on top of it. Throw a flashlight with weak batteries, a cow skull with fangs glued to it for a monster, and one of the most stupid "twisting" climaxes ever put into the movie. That being said, let me ask you to listen to me, the little voice in your head. I am your friend. I want you to have a happy life. Stay away from this movie.
