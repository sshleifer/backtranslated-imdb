I learned little about the meaning of this film that I did not know about CNN and the New York Times. (And I did not obsess over Enron's case, as some others did.) The movie did a lousy job of explaining what "business" Enron was in, which could actually be on the rise before it started to hide its debts. in the entities created by Andy Fastow. He also underestimated significantly the role played by Arthur Andersen and Vinson & Elkins in validating practices that were later considered illegal. Nor did he go as far as he could explore what the "investors" - all those prominent bankers - thought they were doing. With cable networks 24 hours a day, the Discovery Channel and the History Channel, the documentaries proliferated. I've seen many last year that were better than this.
