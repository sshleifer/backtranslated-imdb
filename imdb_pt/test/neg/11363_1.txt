This has to be the worst movie I've seen this year .. and I watch a lot of cable. The plot is simply ridiculous, the scenes are thrown at you without action, with no beginning or end of any scene .. are just random idiots with makeup who scream on some plane .. The "special effects" (Spielberg would laugh his ass off) are horrible, the yellow eye contact lenses are cute though .. I have to admin that I could not bear to watch it to the end. The scene where the great scientist Bennett was holding for the life of the engine body was too much for me. I'm sorry for my bad English. I'm from Romania (and this is my first post). I had to sign up just to make a comment about this movie because I just can not believe this is a movie released in 2007.
