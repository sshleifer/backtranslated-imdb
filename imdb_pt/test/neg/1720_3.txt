Oh, boy, it's another comet-hitting movie on earth. Arriving within a year or two of Deep Impact, Armageddon, Space Cowboys and several other stupid movies with rap stars in them, you'd think people would be exhausted with that concept. Apparently not, since I rented it, hoping it was not horrible: Dennis Hopper was in the movie, after all, and he's a good actor, right? <br /> <br /> I forgot something important: along with Peter O 'Toole, Robert De Niro and many other esteemed actors, Hopper has a crush on appearing in terrible movies. Not only that, but he seems to prepare for them by taking forgetting lessons. Your performance on Tychus is so terrible that you expect Divine or Edith Massey to appear in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not know what else to say about this junk, unless you have things falling down in the movies of Earth, watch Deep Impact, and then Armageddon and Space Cowboys in one stretch. Forget the others completely. This is actually the bottom of the stack.
