(Some Spoilers) PRC quickly has J. Carrol Naish playing Dr. Igor Markoff who is not really Dr. Karkoff, but an imposter who assumed his identity in Europe. True Dr. Karkoff had an affair with Dr.Markoff's wife that led him to kill the real Dr.Markoff and then to have his wife Lenore infected with acromegaly that made her look like "Elephant of Man ". "This was made so that no one would ever want to look at her and he could keep Lenore to himself, but the troubled Lenore later engaged her insane husband, killing himself. , the fake Dr. Markoff, then sees Patricia Lawrence, Wanda McKay, a night at the theater where her father Tony Lawernce, Ralph Morgan, a world-famous pianist is giving a concert. Enchanted by the lovely Patricia who is a dead bell by her deceased wife, Lenore, Dr. Markoff becomes obsessed with her and goes to great lengths to marry her, even if she does not want to do anything with him. <br /> <br /> After ridiculing her in her efforts to get Patricia to fall in love with he, sending him flowers with syrupy love notes so far five times a day, Tony will see the deranged Dr. Mankoff tell him to stop bothering his daughter.Then Tony ends up being knocked out by the good doctor who injected him with a dose of acromegaly that turns into a rather dull subject. With his hands and body swollen and unable to touch his beloved piano, Tony tells his doctor Dr. Adams, Sam Flint, that the only one who can cure him of that terrible disease is not Dr. Markoff! the person who gave it to him. <br /> <br /> The film has the usual subplots with Dr. Markoff's assistant, Maxine, Tala Birell, who is also in love with him, jealous of the false doctor who plays a part for Patricia. There is also Dr. Markoff's enormous butler, Glenn Strange, who, like his pet gorilla, is just a clumsy jerk who can not even dominate Maxine, who is less than half the size. Strange ends up getting bitten in the head and knocked out by Patricia's boyfriend, Bobby Blake, Terry Frost. As for the gorilla, he ends up being just a big, hairy coward when he also tries to do Maxine and is chased away and locked in the cage by the pet dog Ace. Dr. Markoff, in his desperation to get Patricia to marry him, promises her to heal his father just so that his father can free himself from his chains and in the ensuing fight he ends up killing Markoff with his own gun. <br /> <br /> There is a happy ending to all this confusion with Maxine, who knew so much about Markoff's acromegaly cure as he did, injecting Tony with a secret serum that made him as good as new. The film ends, as it began, with Tony playing piano in a crowded and lively house at the local theater.
