I have to say, I'm a big fan of these 'Ultimate House on the Left', even those most people seem to hate are often very respected by me; but one of those types of movies that I did not like was Aldo Lado's 'Night Train Murders', and unfortunately it seems that the trains and The Last House on the left do not mix, since Terror Express is another dull movie. out. Something that this kind of film really needs is an extremely unpleasant main character; and while Terror Express offers up to three potential candidates, none of them increases and becomes that villain, missing out on the most important area. In fact, it's a good start when three young people on a passenger train start to slightly irritate the guests on board. This leads the public to believe that there are more things in the store, but unfortunately this never happens when the scene is set. From there, the trio ends up "taking over" the train and uses its new power to terrorize the guests and rape the women. <br /> <br /> It has to be said that there is a fair amount of film which will be pleasing to many viewers; but there is almost no blood. Director Ferdinando Baldi seemed to think he could do well by replacing the blood with sex scenes, and he might have gotten away with it too; if he could film a brutal sex scene. The idea that these men took the train by force goes out the window once it comes to sex, since the people you expect to be powerful and powerful seem very interested in showing their women a good time, and despite a sequence very 'meek' sandwich, none of the sex is particularly interesting. As much of the movie is occupied by these sex scenes, this becomes a big problem. Movies like this are often lacking in style, suspense and credibility; but you know you're watching a bad one when you're bored. As you might expect, nothing of the performance depends on anything; and the three plants in particular stand out for being junk. The direction is lacking in style, and there is very little tension or suspense; making it difficult to take care of what will happen. Overall, this is a very bad example of an exploration movie, and I can not recommend it.
