I used to work in a video store. I saw this title in the horror section and took it home as a free video store one night. <br /> <br /> This movie was really horrible, there is no redeeming quality about it, because in fact it takes a well respected sub-genre. of film and will only destroy it. If the first film was not low budget, then this movie really catches the cookie, being housed (mostly) indoors and at night ... thus avoiding the scenic cost of the first film In the first 5 minutes of this film a college lecturer comically run over an attractive student. Instead of feeling mortified, the speaker apologizes and the girl mentions that despite being thrown in the hood of the car (he sped up when he approached her) that there is nothing to worry about ... after he attacks her with a crowbar and kill her! If this is not strange enough, he wants to perform an experiment on her, bringing her back from the dead ... and so she feels the need to remove her clothes to do so. <br /> <br /> Female nudity (and pubic hair) is rampant throughout the film and is, to be honest, the only real thing to keep the average interest of male viewers ... like the swimming scene in the first movie ... but even having said that this movie goes from bad to worse with its bad acting character, bad dialogues and absurd plot ... why introduce a key character who survived 29 days of zombie attack just to kill them within 10 minutes .... it's just a very very bad movie
