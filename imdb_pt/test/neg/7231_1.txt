I just watched this, after getting sick of preparing for the Michigan Bar Exam. I wanted something that was stupid and that I could sit and say, "What the hell were they thinking?" I was not disappointed with this venture, but if I was watching him with a serious humor, I would have been angry. The company that did this thing just put together the CGI images of the first Octopus and added a little footage with a fake octopus that makes the one used in "Bride of the Monster" look like a special effects masterpiece. Since when has an octopus got its prey? The plot is that a New York Police Department diver is investigating some murders / disappearances on the Hudson River shortly before July 4. He and his partner (soon to be transferred, or soon to be attacked by an octopus) investigate in a rather inept manner (while believing that a huge octopus will kill people) and occasionally are accompanied by a female. lackey of the mayor's office. Of course in one of them it is believed that an octopus can get so big until the thing attacks the policeman and the girl from the mayor's office. Surprisingly, all hell does not break loose and only a few policemen and a few more civilians are killed. <br /> <br /> Really lame. Do not bother with that.
