The trailer for this movie promised a new twist on the zombie genre: set it in the Wild West. Except it's not the real Old West, of course. It's a sort of Future West, in a world where some apocalypses, like apocalypses are known, kill people and then turn them into zombies. It's time for the zombie virus again, guys, and you know what that means? Be bitten and become one of them. <br /> <br /> So, in this dusty and dead-filled world comes a hero. He is a bounty hunter, getting paid for taking care of zombies. It is not exactly clear who is providing the funds, but it seems that a small cottage industry has emerged to hunt for zombies. But as the trailer tells us, there is a problem. They are running out of zombies. The only way to keep gaining is to infect new cities with the virus. <br /> <br /> I think it's not a bad idea for a movie. But unfortunately, it takes a lot more than a good idea and a crowd of people banging on the windows to make a good zombie movie. What we really got was a clone of Clint Eastwood (the actor even called Clint for crying aloud) and his "hilarious" partner, trying to get zombies while chasing some thugs alive for a big reward. The whole subframe about infecting other cities is mentioned only in passing, more than half of the film. Instead, there are a lot of Western movie cliches, zombie makeup and some bad world-class acting. Too bad. The guy who would not even make it to Hollyoaks. Both the hero and the villain bite the cigars, jokes are played, people are bitten. As the movie comes to a conclusion, the only thing worth wondering is whether it will end with the hero's cliché being the only man alive, having killed what he loves, or his cliché turning into a zombie at the end. picture, Frame. (It's the first, by the way) This movie was written and directed by Gerald Nott. It's the only thing he's done and, hopefully, will be the last. At the beginning of the movie, there is a caption that says "Nott Entertainment". At least they got one thing right.
