I can not help thinking that this is Franco's "hamage" to the Marquis de Sade's "Thousand Days of Sodom". People (in this case women) abducted to serve as slaves to a privileged elite? Checks. Bizarre sex? Checks. Torture including whipping? Checks. Victims randomly chosen to be killed? Check. Thankfully, Franco did not go to the whole world and introduced the cinema audience to the delights of coprology (and in fact coprophagy), another perversion that arises repeatedly in the tediously long and disgusting saga of Sade. <br /> <br /> I expected this movie to fall into the category 'so bad it's good'. But even the acres of naked flesh and numerous sexual encounters did not make up for the discouraging dialogue, the terrible action, the indescribable plot and - just to put the can hat on it - the English subtitles of dubbing (a belt approach and suspenders of women's fantasies). Alsation gave a very professional performance though. <br /> <br /> Of course I could be wrong about Sade's angle. After all, I did not realize that the actor playing the prison head was a transsexual. I should pay more attention to the size of people's hands in the future. <br /> <br /> According to another reviewer, the film was banned in the UK. Well, clearly it is not anymore, although I think the scene of nipples was cut to satisfy the censors. On the DVD I watched, it was only clearly visible in the trailer in Spanish (which, in case you're wondering, I watched it compare to the trailer in English). <br /> <br /> The DVD also features an interview. with Jess Franco, although you need a Spanish better than mine to understand. Unless I am very much mistaken, it is not dubbed or subtitled. And this indicates that the person who sodomizes the character played by Franco is Ajita Wilson disguised wearing a mustache. Half ironic, given that he had the required accessory removed surgically.
