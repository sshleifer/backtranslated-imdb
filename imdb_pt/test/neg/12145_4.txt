GOLD RAIDERS (1951) <br /> <br /> A dull comedy / western feature with the Three Stooges (including Shemp Howard at this point, which I always liked as the "third Stooge") doing his usual cheesy chat, and directed by the normally trusted Edward Bernds, who also made some of his funniest short cuts - so you can imagine, what went wrong this time around? The most likely answer is that what worked very well as a two-minute 15-minute seems to be too much for a 55-minute feature film. Unlike many of its classic short tracks, GOLD RAIDERS is not worth revisiting. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
