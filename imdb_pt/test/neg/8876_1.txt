This movie is just another waste of time. The plot is ridiculous, forced drama USA. The characters were all very weak, especially the charismatic Goya and the misunderstanding of Bardem, who was only well in his classical interpretation when acting as a French ally. <br /> <br /> Just one more missed chance of spending the money on a good movie. I think it was not a low budget movie. Definitely not recommended. Maybe the director should think a little about whether the movie makes sense or not before wasting so much money. Maybe they do not mind how they make a profit before releasing them in the movies. <br /> <br /> No more hope in the movies ...
