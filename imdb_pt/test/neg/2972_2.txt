Hollywood has made many weird movies over the years, but none stranger than that. Why this movie was made I will never know, nor how Paramount might have thought it would sell tickets in 1947. It's the strangest mix of genres I've seen in a long time, a movie that really does not know if it's trying to be a drama of serious war or a Viennese operetta comedy. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a British spy trying to get a poisonous gas formula out of Germany in the days just before World War II. Ray Milland, a great actor, is arrested playing the role of a fugitive from Monty Python, a very exaggerated dialogue of English. In Germany, he meets a gypsy, Marlene Dietrich, who helps him travel hidden, as, of course, another gypsy. She plays her role as the typical Gypsy caricature of the Viennese operetta, as do the other "Gypsies" in the film. But there are also Nazis who are not funny at all. And then Milland discovers that he's beginning to think like a gypsy, and that's not treated as a joke. Sometimes the music is for a light comedy, sometimes for a drama. Every time the Nazis appear, the soundtrack plays Wagner, which is funny by itself. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a comedy, or it could have taken the situation of the gypsies seriously and done a serious job of showing how the Nazis treated them. Both are hinted at in this movie, but neither of them went on. What we have left is a truly strange miscellany of genres that must have embarrassed everyone (except the director) involved. Bizarre.
