This movie is not a comedy. It's not even funny in the department, "This movie is so bad it's funny." On the contrary, it is simply bad. Other reviewers mention poor lighting, but in addition there are plenty of bad plastic surgeries. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a great acting talent was wasted on a poor and uninspired script. The main characters are one-dimensional and boring. It's hard to feel sympathy for any of them. It is also difficult to see the four characters as close friends. It just looks like a bunch of women thrown together pretending to be around. <br /> <br /> I will not list all the problems with this movie, as this does not deserve much attention from anyone. (Nor is it worth the time it takes to watch it).
