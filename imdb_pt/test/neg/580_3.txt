Dorothy Provine does the opposite here: She continues to grow and grow. I did not detect any subtext, though. "The Incredible Shrinking Man" and other films of his time were parables about radiation, nuclear war and other horrors. Provine's growth is the result of an inept computer / robot. <br /> <br /> And who runs this computer, but Lou Costello! I like some of his films with Bud Abbott. But despite being a very bad movie, it goes well without it. And Gale Green is an excellent role. <br /> <br /> Green interprets the great pompous city. He is the father of Provine. He intends to be elected mayor. Then, when his beloved daughter begins to have problems, he abandons her. He does not turn it down exactly, but gives up his battle against his long-time admirer Costello. <br /> <br /> This is quite implausible: Costello is the local garbage collector. <br /> <br /> Special effects are minimal. And the sub-story involving the military is lame to the extreme.
