Normally, when a biopic of television is cast on a celebrity, it is at least exaggerated (ie, Cybill Shepherd as Martha Stewart, Lauren BaCall as Doris Duke), this is the most horrendous, cheap and annoying television movie of all times. If the VH-1 is to make a television movie, they will have to spend a little more money on them. Flex Alexander - though endowed with Michael's voice - is not a great dancer, does not look like Michael at all, and does not even have his mannerisms down. The VH-1 would have done better by hiring a real copycat, so when Michael goes into plastic surgery, he does not actually look EXACTLY the same. Why should we be surprised by the shrinkage of Michael's nose when it's exactly the same size as at the beginning of the movie? The woman who plays Elizabeth Taylor can not act and does not look anything like her, and did not even start working with the woman like Janet Jackson. A terrible script and a serious case of miscasting must prevent VH-1 from producing more movies. Flex Alexander would have made JERMAINE JACKSON much better than Michael. Suits Useless cheats. Neverland? Joins scenes from news documentaries. Do not worry about this ... not even remotely worth it. The only casting good part - the actor who plays Joseph Jackson and MAYBE the actress like Lisa Marie Presley, although she should have been more of a brat than girlie girl.
