The horrible and annoying zombie sequel is only marginally better than Uwe's first horrible movie. It consists of a group of soldiers going to a university campus infested with zombies to find a certain type of blood that could help find a cure for the infection. These soldiers are their typical lambs for slaughter and none of them is that pulled out (or at least not very interesting) so you do not feel a sadness in the pit of the stomach when they are eliminated. The movie has the typical zombies biting humans and blood splatters. He still has the same chewing guts. It simply does nothing for the zombie genre to give memory to it. And the climax of the story is quite anti-climatic and ridiculous. One can imagine how two people can submerge in an army of zombies and not be bitten (as they are the main stars that always seem to be able to escape), while others seem to be bitten easily. The only motivation of the movie is to show people how to get bits ... nothing more. Just go watch a Romero movie for lasting effect.
