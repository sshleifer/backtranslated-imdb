I get the American premiere of that at the Chicago International Film Festival. I was beyond disappointed. From the mood of the audience, I was not the only one. <br /> <br /> The film takes a long time to reach the conflict, and then refuses to resolve it, choosing to tell us that the story is "Continued." Is it a spoiler to reveal that a movie has no end? I consider this a further warning. That is, at best, only half of a movie and not the good half.
