Skip Butterballs, this movie smells bad! It is a monotonous and indifferent swallow that never stops working. It's no wonder someone bothered to leave Groucho in his bizarre eyebrows and mustaches, as he has nothing spirited or outrageous to do or say over this boredom. Chico must have been so disinterested that he forgot to use his Italian accent. <br /> <br /> Only Harpo offers one or two smiles, and there is not much to do around here. Figure on a talking hotel manager and another nasty co-comic in Frank Albertson, and the road gets even more bumpier. <br /> <br /> A real fault of ignition.
