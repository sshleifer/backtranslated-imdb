In this desperate and completely silly attempt to keep Hammer's Dracula franchise alive despite having already lost most of its power, our legendary vampire is brought back to life in bustling London in 1972. Exactly one hundred years after it was destroyed by his arch-nemesis Van Helsing, an occult disciple named Johnny Alucard (understood?), reunites his extravagant friends in an abandoned church, among them Van Helsing's great-granddaughter, Jessica, and performs a satanic ritual that resurrects Dracula in a cloud of smoke. Dracula's only mission is to wreak havoc on Van Helsing's entire offspring, and the fragile Jessica is the ideal victim to do so. This is probably the only movie of the '70s that goes way beyond the top trying to look like a 1970s movie! Considering that the previous six Dracula films were all set in the Victorian era, director Alan Gibson really wants to emphasize the fact that we are in the 20th century and thus he fills his movie with unbearable hippies characters, horrendous fashion trends of the 1970s and bad years 70. music. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing seem hopelessly lost in this scenario and their performances unfortunately show this. The opening sequence (a flashback) and the climax of the showdown are quite nice, but everything in between is painfully boring and the complete opposite of scary. The biggest elements in this film series have always been Dracula's dark castles and exciting bus races, and of course, this plot does not have it all. Fortunately for fans, contemporary Hammer Studios has released other vampire movies that are much better ("The Vampire Lovers," "Twins of Evil," "The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires"). Not recommended.
