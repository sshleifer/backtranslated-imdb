This was the second MST3K movie I've ever seen, and it still holds a place in my heart as one of the most hilarious and horrifying movie experiences you'll ever have. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keeffe (sp?) is at it, using his sculpted physique to mark another payment on the mortgage of his condo. He's hard, wooden and unconvincing, but he still looks like a nice, nice guy, and at least he's photogenic. That's the only decent I can find to say about the movie, so I thought I'd get it out of the way. The fact that he's in the movie adds another point to the score and saves him from being "1 in 10". <br /> <br /> In no particular order, examples of how badly mounted this movie is: 1) OK, Tanya Roberts (Mila) clone seeks "the ends of the earth". 'to find Actor, which takes 3 minutes of screen time, including the time she stumbles around to die from a poisoned arrow on her shoulder (which I suppose would have slowed her down a bit). Then the Actor heals, takes his help Thong and leaves for her castle ... and spends the next 50 minutes of the film recovering the ground that Mila crossed in 3 minutes. How does it work??? I know that the intrepid crew is being harassed by magical forces and enemies etc. on the way back, but still ...! <br /> <br /> 2) Apparently the writer / director felt the need to add 'depth' to the film by adding an ongoing debate / dialogue / Socratic game of 20 questions between Zor (the middle suitor of John Saxon) and the sage Akronas (the aspirant to Richard Harris). But Joe Damoto apparently got his philosophical Hallmark card training, T-shirts and stickers, and he does not understand timing, timing or timing ... or the actors. (Crow's comment during one of these exchanges is the slogan of my entry). The scenes with these two drag on, interrupting the movie and killing any moment or excitement generated by sword fighting and hero-seeking trio. <br /> <br /> 3) When the Actor arrives at the castle (and is captured), things go even further. Zor decides to feed a group of female victims, along with Actor and Mila, to the God Snake he keeps in his basement. This scene had some potential for excitement, so the director immediately kills that potential by instilling the scene with all the drama of people waiting in line to pay their traffic tickets. Actor happens to have a great battle with the Serpent which is little more convincing than the battle of Bela Lugosi with the octopus marionette in "Bride Of The Monster". <br /> <br /> 4) The climatic scene, in which Actor invents the hang glider of animal furs and fur, is so patently silly that it completely takes the viewer out of the movie and makes you roll on the ground, laughing to your sides hurt. <br /> <br /> 5) Ah, yes, and the filmmakers decided to include images of an atomic explosion at the end, with the moral that Actor decided to destroy the 'atomic nucleus' McGuffin who directs the film because humanity was " not ready ". ("Zzzzip! MESSAGE COMING IN !!!") Just like "Bride Of The Monster" again, come to think of it. All that was needed was a spectator to observe: "They interfered in the dominion of God." <br /> <br /> 6) For some reason, the movie version I saw introduces introductory and closing sequences of homoerotic credits that have absolutely NOTHING to do with anyone or anything else in the movie. I have no idea where this footage came from, but it is actually worse than the actual movie bookends. <br /> <br /> Check this out only if you are a big fan of Miles, or if you like the way MST3K stuffs stuff like this.
