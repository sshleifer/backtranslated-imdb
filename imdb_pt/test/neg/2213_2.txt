It's amazing to think that this movie came out just a year before Star Wars, but it looks like a million years ago in sophistication and special effects. In fact, the direction of art and set design (good Victorian spacecraft) are not bad; are the most laughable, zombie-like monsters' outfits on the LOST IN SPACE TV show. The Caveman's evil makeup reminded me of some aliens from TWILIGHT ZONE's old reruns. <br /> <br /> The script is flamboyant, and out of the comic relief of Peter Cushing, the acting is also very unhappy. This movie is recommended only if you really like a kitschy bad SF. And the music ... A horrible experiment from the 70's with synthesizers that do not fit the time frame of the movie and sound like someone rambling with a Minimoog and a 2-track tape machine.
