This is not a good movie. It is an experienced remake of the English movie 'The Hitch'. But he insults the original. This is hardly a movie you expect from a veteran director like 'David Dhawan', who is credited with directing such good films as 'Raja Babu', 'Coolie No.1', 'Hero No. 1' The main theme of this film is taken from "The Hitch" with some changes, so as to attract the Indian public, but somehow the story and the script is not convincing enough. In addition, the acting of the leading roles, namely Salman Khan and Govinda is regrettable. It seems they need the slightest provocation to remove their shirts to reveal their bare chest. I do not consider this fascinating and least of all comics. What was the director thinking? In addition, viewers must endure the case of Govinda's Over-acting. It was simply unbearable. I advise viewers to watch it at their own risk. My rating of 2 for this movie could be considered very generous. <br /> <br /> Instead, I advise viewers to watch the English movie "Hitch," which is much better.
