The first 1/3 of this movie I loved and thought it was going to be one of Truffaut's best movies. I loved the plot where a pen pal married a half-way man around the world - unseen vision. Especially when this woman turns out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the real friend so she could take her place! She then cleared her husband's huge bank account and disappeared! I was really addicted and wanted to see more ... <br /> <br /> And then, the movie fell apart and was just stupid! Although it comes from New Caladonia (an island in the Pacific) and it from Reunion (an island in the Indian Ocean), when he goes on a trip to the south of France, he comes across it almost immediately. Hmm ... the odds are 187,000,000 for 1, but he finds it. So instead of killing her or handing her over to the police, he forgives her - even when she acknowledges what she did. Okay - this is hard to believe, but okay, but it helps to hide it from a private eye by killing him. Nobody is so stupid! Yes, the character Catherine Deneuve plays is very handsome, but come on guys - that's silly. Also, if he just wanted her as a sex object, then why would he do it for a woman who is often frigid and completely selfish and mean. <br /> <br /> This film, because of its very ridiculous plot, does not deserve such high ratings! Unless you're an inveterate Truffaut fan, try another movie - even one from Truffaut - but not this one.
