I'm still waiting for that dark muppet movie, where we will not know how it ends from the beginning. I think Linklater could make an experiment with animation. This time, I was not cleverly expecting something like that, but deeply desiring. <br /> <br /> Joan Cusack sucked. She moved to a level made for the TV lazily acting with a cynical clich√©. The muppets were more life than her. A disappointment. <br /> <br /> But the whole movie was, bar Pepe. I loved him. He was the one who made me laugh (while Goldbergh as God let me suffocate and cursing). If we can not see a dark muppets than about at least one PG: 13 one with more controversial jokes from Pepe and Animals metal-head, ogggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg saw even the boring Carol Natal beats a gift out. Muppets need to avoid this holiday marketed. <br /> <br /> 5/10
