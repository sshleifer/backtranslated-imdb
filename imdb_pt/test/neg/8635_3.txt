George Vanishing's original version of The Vanishing aka The Man Who Wanted to Know offers one of the quietest sociopaths in European cinema and one of the most memorable finals of all time (blatantly stolen by Tarantino for Kill Bill Volume Two), but it has much more to offer than that. Playing chronology and reversing the usual clich√©s of the standard 'lady some' plot, it also offers excellent characterization and strong, understated but compelling performances. Sadly, I can only assume that when it comes to the remake, Sluizer was so determined that no one else would get a chance to spoil his movie when he was perfectly capable of doing it alone, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensive it destroys its own work. His career has never recovered from this disastrous false step. <br /> <br /> The main culprit is an astounding performance of Jeff Bridges, who was thought of in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his first films noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor, as long as you kept him from thinking about what he was doing, and this movie is the proof of the pudding. Each move is overly mechanical in its accuracy, making it look like a rusty toy while his voice is a bizarre mix of Tootsie, Latka Taxi Gravas and a Dalek who are all learning lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a madman walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying, "Please.Let me.Kill.You.Thank you.For your consideration." But the guilt really needs to be shared here. None of the performances is good: do they often even look good ?? Keifer Sutherland looks more like a hamster than a distracted man at his wits end in the rushing scenes at The Gas Station, Nancy Travis, fails and Sandra Bullock has no impression of being the object of her obsession, not that they have received any help the director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. To put the focus firmly on Bridges over the couple at the opening of the movie, the worst is the rush the movie is going through, draining the life and character of each scene in its race to get to the next. / Mood changes in the couple's relationship or the seemingly casual but careful establishment of the feel of the place, we only have a few arguments that give the impression that he is probably better off without it. ??? stan dard woman hunted by nutter in the forest risk material complete with lame 'let's end up in a joke as a show TV police officer? better not go there ?? which is a piece of advice that goes with all this train of a movie. Even a shocking and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can not do anything for this.
