This "movie" and I say it lightly, it's nothing more than pure junk. I'm sorry for those people who really wasted their money to go see this in theaters. I saw a screener from a friend's movie and I've regretted it ever since. <br /> <br /> As a black woman, I am extremely ashamed to have seen this. Moreover, I am extremely horrified that people of other races may have seen this too and may believe it to be a behavior of blacks in general. It is full of stereotypes against all nationalities and genres, grossly vulgar jokes and ridiculous jokes of well-known African-American comedians who should know better after reading this script! I must also mention the countless rappers and rappers who populate the film as if it were a video clip too long - they had absolutely no place in the film. I think they were the "Jiving & Singing" minstrels? HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> "Writers," producers and anyone who has had the stupidity to fund this "movie" should be filmed or locked in a room and forced to look at this crap without stopping for the rest of their lives . DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE !!! It's wasted time of your life that you can never go back.
