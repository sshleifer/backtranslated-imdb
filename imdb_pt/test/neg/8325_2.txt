This is a documentary about homeless women. Interestingly, this focused on women who were socially engaged - with jobs and long-term friendships - but in situations where they could not afford to pay for housing. <br /> <br /> I found some of the women covered by them. interesting, but there was little focus or progression in the story. Direction and editing failed to keep my attention. There were differences in the stories of these women, of course, but the message was essentially the same and could have been told by focusing on any of them in more depth. <br /> <br /> I got to the end of the movie, but it was a rather boring journey.
