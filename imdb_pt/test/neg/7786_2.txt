When a BBC murder thriller is fraught with heterosexual dysfunction, you know who the killer must be: The homosexual. <br /> <br /> Who murdered the sexy blonde teenager (who is also a pathological liar) on the way home from school? Let's see, could it be the mother who (against all common sense) is letting her teenage son make unpleasant visits to his serial killer father behind the bars? Could it be the grumpy son, who was impressed by his father's absurd attitude toward women? Could it be the serial killer himself, who seems capable of manipulating events behind the bars, to the Hannibal Lecter? Could it be the mother's boyfriend, a schoolteacher whose affair with a former student led to his wife's suicide? Or could it be the boyfriend's daughter, who will blab the secrets of everyone in school, causing enormous misery? No, not one of those probable suspects. It's ... The homosexual! <br /> <br /> The only mystery to the viewer is to guess who the homosexual is. Of course it could be anyone, since the only characteristics of Homosexual are the shameful secrecy and propensity to murder and make life complicated for "normal" people. The homosexual is the invisible cause of the evils of society; only when that person is exposed and eliminated, the fractured family can come back and things can go back to normal ... whatever. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, both Jemma Redgrave and Robson Green are now officially past their selling dates. The world could go through wonderfully without ever seeing the screen again, but as long as the BBC has roles for The Aggrieved Woman and The Misunderstood Man, I suppose they will keep coming back in movies like this.
