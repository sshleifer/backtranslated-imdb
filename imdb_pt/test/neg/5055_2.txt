Did I hear that this movie was bad ?? They even warned me that it was terrible, but for some reason (probably Katie Holmes) I still watched it when it came on national TV. Watching Kevin Williamson movies means torturing! Their scenarios are not funny, they're definitely not scary and not at all creative. Teaching Mrs. Tingle breathes the same irritating atmosphere from her brainless "Dawson's Creek" series, and probably also serves the same target group. Before the credits even started, 5 people already wanted a hug and said that 'I love the sentence'. There is nothing better as the soundtrack is full of annoying pop / rock and the plot is ultra-thin. Three undergraduate students are picked up by the most ruthless schoolteacher. Every college has a teacher like that, you know? To save their skin, they try to convince Mrs. Tingle that it was not their intention to cheat, but this attempt is horribly wrong. The typical middle school humor is completely lost on me, the overdose of feeling is pathetic and acting (with the exception of Helen Mirren) is abominable. I'm sure Katie Holmes can act ?? is this a fact proven by his role in the 'present'? but she urgently needs to stop accepting female fraternal roles. As stated earlier, the only positive comments are for the brilliant cast of Helen Mirren as the shrew. It's like Kathleen Turner in 'Serial Mom'! The paper matches with it perfectly and you can not imagine someone else playing it. Other than that, this is an absurd teen avoidable.
