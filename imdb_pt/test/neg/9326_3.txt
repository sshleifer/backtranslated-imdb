Again, I was fooled by seemingly intelligent ratings by making seemingly intelligent comments about an obviously bad movie. I actually put on my shoes, got in my car, burned expensive gas and drove to the nearest rental place AFTER reading reviews and paying the 4 dollars needed and switching to rent this thing. I'm telling you, this is not worth the minimum of kilo calories spent on raising your index finger to change channels on a TV remote. <br /> <br /> I even gave it a few more minutes after seeing all the signs of a pile of pedigreed dogs. These presented as clinical symptoms of a director who is a. going senile or b. is only marginally interested in the film he / she is required to create. I've seen a similar deterioration with the ridiculous caricature of John Carpenter over the last few years. <br /> <br /> Here are some scenes as incriminating evidence. The priest is having a disturbing dream ... supposedly a harbinger of evil to come, since he seems to be determined to open the archaeological feature that houses the devil. The dream is a goofy collage of disjointed images from the Twilight Zone movie. A ticking through the darkness of the dream, implying, what?, The unfathomable mystery of Time? ... Big Deal! A disembodied head, painted in demonic features with convenience store Halloween makeup, flicks from side to side in a convulsive frenzy. Every time I see this effect, a big steal from Jacob's Ladder, it pisses me off. This, by itself, almost instantly discredits a movie. <br /> <br /> All the accumulation of the archaeological excavation is laughable. Everything is so obvious ... so tired and overwhelmed ... the only possible answer is boredom. At one point of the excavation, the priest comments on finding the angels' statues around a sarcophagus ... they are pointing to the crypt with their weapons. He asks, "Look at these surrounding statues ... It's like they're holding ... something ... down!" This is to create tension ... critical mass ... but it does not even come close! How can there be suspense if you treat the audience like a bunch of idiots having to explain the suspense as you go along. The images are made first, but the added comments just add insult to injury in my opinion. Soon after, the tomb is "decorated" with the mortal remains of the soldiers placed there to guard the main atrium (another shameless blow from The Keep, incidentally). Who, for God's sake, made the makeup effects for this movie?! The blood actually had that rosy quality that can be seen in the 1970s Tromaville movies. At this point, I was almost convinced that they simply forgot about the make-up and had to go to Wal-Mart in the interest of time and money. <br /> <br /> DO NOT listen to the glowing reviews on this one! I'll keep an eye on Schrader, too. Looks like it's time to hang your gloves. Perhaps a close friend offers a gentle warning to leave while there is still dignity in memory of past films.
