When I first saw this DVD in a bargain box for three dollars, I really could not believe my luck: a Christmas movie starring Tori Spelling, William Shatner and Gary Coleman ??? Needless to say I picked it up right away and considered it a worthwhile investment. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was as bad as any movie you'd expect to be combining Christmas with the three "celebrities" mentioned above. The dialogue was idiotic, the characters were one-dimensional, and Carol's character was completely unbelievable. The movie itself was a lifeless piece of boring that refused to end and made me feel used as a human when the end finally came. <br /> <br /> My advice: do not watch this movie unless you have to and then just under the influence of some serious holiday eels.
