"Terror in the Aisles" may seem like the best treat for horror fans, but in fact, it's very little to offer. Granted, it presents a decent and versatile selection (very versatile?) Of fragments of horror / suspense that are considered classic, but ... what's the point? This documentary is primarily aimed at the horror-loving public, so we've seen all those clips, have not we? The only really praiseworthy thing about this project is the issue. If you like screaming queens, murderer chases and that kind of thing, "Terror in the Aisles" has some compilations of the most famous sequences. All these different scenes are joined by a story involved with Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen sitting in a movie theater. Between two sequences, address the viewer and "explain" because we love terror so much. These discourses are naturally soporific and rather obvious (it is our nature to be afraid ... bla bla bla) and I can not understand why many people love the concept. It's worth taking a peek in case you're a loyal fan of terror, but it's certainly not an essential sight. On the contrary: in case you still have to see a classic genre title, be careful that pieces of it here do not spoil your future vision. The main reason I generally did not like it is because it blatantly ignores a lot of lesser known, but fundamental (stranger) titles incessantly focused on "Halloween." This results in a cool internal joke, however, when Donald Pleasance shouts at the screen in his own character.
