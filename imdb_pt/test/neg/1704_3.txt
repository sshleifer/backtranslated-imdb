This movie, done correctly, has a lot of potential. Parody movies are always funny, and people tend to like them because they are cheerful, stupid, and silly, but fun. This movie was funny in parts, but it could have been a lot more fun. The acting itself was OK for all the actors, but ... I was not satisfied. It seemed a bit empty, and my short title tells all about the effects. Adequate green screens were not used for this movie ... backgrounds were added after which it just looked terrible. No wonder this movie went straight to DVD lol. It was not all a total loss, it's funny and it will give you a good laugh (AT, not with this most of the time).
