I saw this after seeing "Death Tunnel" (this being undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life) so you can understand that I've been rolling my eyes a little to see the directors and producers of that movie being responsible for this. First of all, I thought the director and producer were the same guy. Both are Kid Rock and meet Dawg the Bounty Hunter. I watched the TAPS investigation, and I'm not a skeptic - I think TAXI is the closest anyone will come to a scientific method in the field. That was cool and believable - I believe they are haunted. <br /> <br /> But this, like the reviewer mentioned above, is like taking a tour. Okay, a tour, fine, but the "researchers" and "group leaders" seemed to make a handsome penny and have a financial investment to know if it's haunted or not, so when they have fantastic stories, I have to take it with a full teaspoon. of salt. <br /> <br /> As someone mentioned, I could see what they wanted me to see in the picture about 50% of the time. The rest of the time, I could not understand anything. Also without any context for the photos - time of day, type of camera, humidity in the room, dust particles (which are 75% of what the orbits are), time and a ga-gillion other factors, I can not accept them . I also can not help thinking that some can be manipulated. <br /> <br /> Why would this band keep the numbers on the door? Vandalism? Also during the PPPT investigation, they attempted to unearth the death certificates of these nurses - and found only one that was considered "accidental" (people did not officially want to proclaim suicide). However, when one of the guides mentioned this, he said "yes, and his suicide marked". It really felt like the guides to the haunted houses here in October. <br /> <br /> I, however, enjoyed the interviews with the patients and staff of the old hospital (s), which really gave it a lot of perspective and a personal touch. I'm also glad they mentioned that the staff had the best intentions, and they were not some macabre keepers. They were not the best methods, but that's all they had. They were desperate to stop the disease.
