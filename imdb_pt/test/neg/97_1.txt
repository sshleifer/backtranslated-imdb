Lowe returns to the nest after another failed relationship, finding that he has been appointed to the jury position. It is in plans to somehow get out of it when he realizes that the defendant is the girl he has had a serious downfall since the first grade. Lowe remembers these feelings and does everything in his power to clean Camp's attempted murder while staying away from the real villains at the same time, and manages to create a hit movie at the same time. <br /> <br /> I've heard that St. Augustine is the oldest city in the United States, and I also know that it has some ties to Ponce de Leon, so the setting is a good start. Unfortunately, it's the only good thing about this movie. The local police are inept, the judge is an idiot and the defense lawyer does everything he can to look like Joanie Cunningham! I do not know if I should blame the director for bad direction, or for just letting the cast put such an unhappy effort. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was so boring that I could not even sleep it! 1 out of 10 stars!
