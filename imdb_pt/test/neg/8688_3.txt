The VHS cover for The Evil Below makes it look like an underwater horror movie. Unfortunately, it's closer to a boring adventure movie and has no real horror elements. It starts with some divers who are attacked and we see some blood, but that's the only blood in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The evil below is not the worst out there, but for a horror movie. is tediously tedious. The acting is decent and to be honest, the only thing keeping you watching is the developing novel between the two tracks. There are some nightmare sequences in which it seems the director did not know what to do. I was able to sit down with everything (almost), but I would not recommend this movie to ANYONE. Horror fans may want a copy for the cool VHS cover, but it's best to leave it there.
