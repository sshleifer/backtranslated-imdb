Bad editing, bad production values, bad continuity, implausible dialogue, bad ... this movie is bad, bad, bad. However, if you want a movie to be entertaining (the MST3000), this is your movie. I would not suggest spending a lot of money on it, but if you see this movie, make sure it has lots of witty friends.
