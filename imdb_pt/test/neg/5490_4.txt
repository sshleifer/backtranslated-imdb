This film stomps on very familiar ground - the confusion of art and reality in the lives of the actors. There is nothing particularly new or interesting to say on this subject and, in fact, it is quite annoying. The final scene in particular is endlessly tedious. Seeing the audience crying over the "moving" acting they're seeing on the screen made me ask "who do they think they're kidding?" <br /> <br /> However, there are some good performances and interesting scenes, particularly from some of the smaller characters. Ben Gazzara plays an old and slightly touched actor, who gets a bunch of cops cheering his performance when they come to arrest him. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken again plays an over-the-top wacko. Remember your character "The Continental" on Saturday Night Live; an aged eurotrash satyr chasing a young woman around the furniture and trying to get her to bed? He makes an identical turn in the film, chasing his young prey (male) around an old table and giving him champagne. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was charming and annoying, but mostly annoying.
