Do not be fooled by the 'awards' and the comment below. This is just a bad movie. The way George Katt played his character (the soft gangster) makes it very annoying to watch. The conversation in the opening scene is a dramatic display of it. From the rest of the film the character's head seems to be somewhere else. Your emotions do not match the things that happen in the movie. The things he says as a narration do not add anything to the movie. This makes Zeus an even more cowardly character with a head in the clouds. <br /> <br /> The story and the film were made together with a total lack of fantasy. All parts of the film were stolen from other modern directors. Hopefully, Jon Rosten will use his own style and ideas for his future films.
