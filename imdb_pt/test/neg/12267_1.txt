Everything about this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> You can tell in the first five minutes that this movie is going to be terrible. You can not, however, measure how bad it will be. <br /> <br /> We started the film with a seemingly endless intro scene aided by gay music and no dialogue. Getting the camera up and down big guys who are trying too hard to seem mental does not cause the least emotion. <br /> <br /> What begins then seems to be one of two separate stories. The first half of the movie consists of the wogs out there competing in paid fights at midnight with other ethnic groups. Wogs always win, of course, because they apparently lift weights and have "respect." It is in these scenes that we first see the degree of bad acting, editing, routing and hatred of the people who financed the film. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the main character and his partner are sent to prison. The whole prison part of the movie has nothing to do with what I suppose to be the plot, and consists of a lot of fights. <br /> <br /> Once out of prison (3 years for murder?) The main character and his companion meet up with the wogs. They then go to the "other side of town" and try to shut up, because apparently everyone wants to kill them. <br /> <br /> Soon, the wogs prepare for the rape of another gang girl, and run around town fighting against hordes of different gangs. This point of the movie can be compared to an arcade game, as wogs simply run and fight enemies that seem to get worse and worse as the movie continues. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie ends with some climactic fighting scene in which the remaining wogs (the two main characters) face all the gangs that have fought so far. Apparently, other gangs have no problem joining other wogs (skinheads do not care about Asians). After about a million people get beaten up by the invincible Wog brothers, the movie ends with the main characters coming home. They do not come home however, because they are burned to death by the thousands of furious movie critics who attack the set and leave angry letters everywhere. <br /> <br /> This movie may be more like a computer game. then a movie because that would explain how two guys can take about a million punches in the face of a million different people, who most of times are twice the size. <br /> <br /> There are also more stupid tons of unexplained events in this movie, like an Asian fighting his own gang and carrying a katana to the head just to let the wogs escape. <br /> <br /> As someone mentioned, this movie is not so bad. It's funny, it's so bad.
