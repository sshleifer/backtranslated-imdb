This movie was so horrible that I do not even know where to start ... The only positive thing I can say is that Luke Perry did a good job. The whole movie was all over the place, there was no explanation for the cause (only theories) of the eruptions, or the rationale for their solutions or why it would work. It was ridiculous! All the characters and relationship between them were so extravagant, you just want to laugh !! There was no fund for any of them. The "love" relationship seemed to have been added to the script, it was so weird. There is an army man; big black general with a cigar standing in his mouth, with "AaarrrGH! I am the man!" attitude, such a pathetic face. The two partners, who should have been geniuses, are acting like two 16-year-old frat boys. And then, to create some action, they decide to drop a rock on someone's shoulder and for the rest of the movie he coughs like he's dying of pneumonia or something ... and then he's a hero (thicker scene of all !!) help the plan that is to make who knows what ... is never a good sign when you see yourself laughing loudly in the middle of the dramatic scene ... in a nutshell; do not waste your time!
