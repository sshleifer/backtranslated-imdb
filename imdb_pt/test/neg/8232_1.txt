This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The plot revolves around a man named Luther, who wears metal dentures, bites people around the neck, and walks around like a chicken hitting his arms. He also thinks he's a chicken. <br /> <br /> It looks bizarre, right? Well, for me, the more bizarre and strange the person is, the better. The more bloody, the better, and so on. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the council deciding if they want to release this maniac from their institution. They mention that he created some dentures in prison that he used to bite around the neck. He also shits like a chicken and THINKS that he is a chicken. <br /> <br /> If I had such a patient, I would not have been able to release him. <br /> <br /> First, Luther goes to the supermarket and attacks an old woman on a bench and leaves. So he flees in the back seat of a woman's car and drives her to her house. <br /> <br /> While in the house, Luther ties the woman to the bed. When the wife's daughter and her daughter's boyfriend arrive home, Luther hides. <br /> <br /> After the movie, a police officer arrives at the front door and asks about his mother. You can clearly see that the daughter is scared and crying, but the policeman keeps asking if everything is okay. She replies that everything is fine. The officer finally gets in his car and leaves. If I saw a woman constantly crying and looking scared, I'd like to at least go home to investigate for a bit. <br /> <br /> The ending is also stupid. While the woman in the barn, she begins to cluck and leaves Luther excited, then he begins to walk beating his arms and beating like a maniac. She finally shoots him and just sits there for a minute before finally sucking some more. <br /> <br /> Then the credits roll. <br /> <br /> This is one of the STUPIDEST movies I've seen! NOTHING happens at the woman's house! ANYTHING! <br /> <br /> Sometimes I like extravagant movies, but this one really bore me. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 10 star. Good idea, bad direction!
