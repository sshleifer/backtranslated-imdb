This movie "Vampires: The Turning" is not even worth the 2 of 10 I'm giving. The film is very predictable from the beginning to the end when our hero kills the leader of the Vampire Hunters. The use of music in this movie was really bad, it kept ringing as if you expected something significant to happen at any time even though it never happened. The acting was B-Rank at best ... And the film was just, bland. The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 is because the story, despite having the potential, ended up being unable to deliver. Oh, and did I mention the wardrobe? The wardrobe for this movie was obviously inexpensive to "non-existent" because our hero and his girlfriend (which he is trying to save all through the movie) wear the same clothes throughout the film. I would suggest this movie only if you were really bored, and did not have a good wall with fresh paint to watch dry. ~ Dave the Cowboy Horror
