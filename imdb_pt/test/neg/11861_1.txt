Anyone who writes that this is good for any kid may have worked on it or have invested money in that horrible college experience. It was bad, slow and painful to watch. Run time of only about 84 minutes, it seemed three and a half hours. The only person to blame is the director, who knows nothing about how to direct a scene, where to put the camera! 95% of this terrible movie was filmed by long master shots. Two or three people on the board talking or shouting forever (or what seems to be forever) without close-ups! There are no average shots !! There are two alleged fight scenes that any filmmaker with a brain would have shot some close-ups or medium-length recordings for them. They looked very amateur. Scenes with screaming father and son with each other would have worked better if there had been a court just from the father or just the son acting or reacting. Tri-C must be very mortified to show it anywhere. I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time, some of them are fun because they are so bad they are not one of them.
