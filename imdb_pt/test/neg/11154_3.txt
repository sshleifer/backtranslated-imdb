What does this movie have? Too much shooting and expensive effects. Nothing makes sense on any other level. <br /> <br /> Watching Arnold cry is to see acting so bad that it's laughable. The plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you think the devil will be impressed by a bad actor with a machine gun, well, this movie is for you!
