I did not like to see DS9 compared to other Star Treks, even Enterprise, but I did not like Babylon 5, and now I know why. They are the same show. I just read the old news that Paramount stole the idea from the creator of Babylon 5, but they chose not to sue for a reason I do not know or care, but seeing how a Star Trek series is based on yet another show nerd just to much to naked, now I will condemn anyone mentioning the DS9 when talking about the series. Original, TNG and Voyager are my favorites in that order. Before I did not understand why everyone thinks DS9 is great and I did not know, but I know I know. It's also because the captain has a real problem of anger, and I hate people who act cool, but freak out, out of nowhere; and he seems in every episode.
