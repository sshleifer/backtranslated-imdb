This was the most unrealistic movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can not believe the writer and director did not see that almost the entire movie looks like an SF. <br /> <br /> For example: 1. It is impossible for the killer to keep the glaze cold and after 10 hours to get up so quickly. <br /> <br /> 2. You can not be electrocuted through a water pipe like in the movie (believe me, it's my domain) <br /> <br /> 3. With a saw you can cut 10 tubes in 10 hours very easy. Let's say the chain was made of steel, but the water pipe was rusty and made of iron. <br /> <br /> 4. If you try to cut your foot with a saw you faint (at best, it is more likely that he will die because his harp fails) before reaching the bone (shin). <br /> <br /> And there are other examples.
