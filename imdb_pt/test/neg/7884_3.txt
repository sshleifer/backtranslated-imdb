A movie about a French girl who is raped by street thugs. The rape scene itself is filmed in every detail, with all male and female organs and their interactions clearly visible to the camera. In a fit of rage, does the victim take his friend's gun (or was he a brother?), Shoot him and run away with the gun. She knows this whore who has just seen her pimpled pimp, they come together and leave for Paris. A series of crazy, senseless and savage murders, the girls seem to enjoy each murder more than the previous. A poor boy is shot in the hole. There are good doses of sex played between the numerous murders. <br /> <br /> The movie is not the most violent I've ever seen, I'd say Private Ryan's Rescue has probably had more violence. If violence is what you are looking for, there are many other films out there. And if it's for sex you're off, then I suggest one of those XXX. <br /> <br /> I went to see the movie because of all the hype that the media was giving. The movie itself is no big deal, just a lot of violence and sex filmed with something like a handheld camera. I was surprised that this movie had an age limit of 15 years in Sweden, if people of 15 years can watch this movie, they should be able to watch XXX movies as well.
