One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Yes, I know I'm not the target audience. Target audience is female, be it college age or middle-aged or any age, I think. I'm not any of those, so the manufacturers do not care if I do not like them. But that does not justify the fact that dialogue and plot are horrible. The main character, Phoebe, goes on a trip to Europe to find out what happened to her sister, Faith, who committed suicide. Phoebe is a futile character that I hope nobody identifies. Faith is also a character with very little credibility. Wolf is the only person who seems to be a little unreasonable. As I said, the dialogue is boring and uninteresting. The plot does stupid things sometimes. The worst thing is that Phoebe and Faith's father is an artist, but their paintings are completely awful. There is nothing new, interesting or refreshing in this movie. If you are a guy, you will pray at the end. If you are a girl, you may be able to sit down, but you will not be impressed.
