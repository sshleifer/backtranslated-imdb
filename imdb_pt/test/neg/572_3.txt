A movie about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town in your ear should be fun, romantic and easy to entertain. Instead, this movie is more about unspoken and unspoken things, so it gets to the point where you're grateful that everything is said, even if the dialogue is not exactly quoteable. <br /> <br /> SPOILER - <br /> <br /> When the relationship that matters most is the least seen on the screen (Danner and McEwan), you know you're in trouble. But these two actresses are most welcome in a movie screaming for some genuine people. <br /> <br /> END OF SPOILER <br /> <br /> Capshaw gets the job of creating a character of not much and she is not totally successful. As I said above, the theme seems to be repression and I understand that it is an element of life and love but I do not want to see a movie about it, at least not this one. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this despite the very talented cast that is left to defend itself.
