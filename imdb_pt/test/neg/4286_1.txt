The guilt of this terrible film lies with the director, Martin Campbell. After seeing some of his credits in later years, this must have been one of his first directing shows. He had a more than decent cast to work with, but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing. There were scenes that made absolutely no sense. Where was his head ............... was he drugged? I was looking forward to this movie just because of Oldman & Bacon. Maybe it was a short shooting schedule and Campbell just had to "knock." I can not imagine that the story that Campbell directed came close to the story the writer wrote. Oldman and Bacon, along with the rest of the cast, must have slipped under the chairs if they went to the exhibit. As one poster pointed out, Karen Young did a good fight scene with Bacon. She really let go. It's unfortunate that I have to fill in more space just to stay within the guidelines of what IMDb requires, because I really do not have anything else to say about this uninspired movie. You do not have to be forced to be a windbag by criticizing a terrible movie and wish the IMDb to change the amount of words to fill a review.
