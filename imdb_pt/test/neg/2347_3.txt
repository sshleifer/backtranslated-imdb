"The Cellar" is an intolerant tedious and extremely friend-friendly cheese parade of the 80s, directed by Kevin Tenney (creator of the best films "Witchboard" and "Night of the Devils") and starring Patrick Kilpatrick, supposedly portraying a guy with feelings. The rhythm is very slow, the plot seems very familiar, the monstrous effects are almost petrifying and the film opens and ends with a tedious narrative that somehow does not relate to the real subject of the film. The narration keeps bothering about the wind and the creatures riding in the wind, but what the hell, there is no wind in the plot? Like so many horror films of the '80s, "The Cellar" deals with cursed Indian landscapes and very real mythical monsters hidden in basements and quagmires. Mance Cashen and his family move to a house built on what was once home to the Native Americans, but then white people came and turned the land into oil fields. Half the script is useless to explain the origin of the monster, but I can summarize this easily for you: an ancient Indian healer summoned the creature (which looks like a huge papier mache rat) to annihilate white people overflowing. earth, but he buried again because, and I quote, SOB kills Indians as well. Mance's extremely annoying son accidentally arouses the beast and naturally can not convince his parents about the hungry big rat in the basement. The supposedly emotional family situation (Dad constantly wants his child to love him) is very pathetic and redundant and the film needed a lot more bloodshed; children's film or not. The young hero (Chris Miller) is very annoying, but we definitely saw worse kids actors in the 1980s. "The Cellar" is not recommended, unless, of course, you are a fan of monster designs and typically the 1980s. big and dishonest rat thing is a real joke to see.
