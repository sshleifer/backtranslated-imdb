Please do not blame Korea for this bad movie. I'm in Korea (please excuse bad English). It saddens me to see these films that make Korea seem obsessed with blood and sex. It saddens me even more to see animal murders and hear the Americans say that's how Korea is. We do not eat live animals !! So, please stop apologizing for your crime by saying it's the culture! There are scenes with the man eating live animals and non-Koreans think it is normal. It's not disgusting to us either. The director is a misfit, a sick individual who has an obsession with killing and having sex with family members. I want America and France to stop glorifying this evil man who is laughable in his own country. Please watch ANY other Korean film, which will give you ideas of how we are really artistic. This movie is crap.
