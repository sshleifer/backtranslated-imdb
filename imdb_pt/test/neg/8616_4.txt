A sequence just under the name of John Carpenter's Vampires, this movie takes place in Thailand and involves a sect of evil vampires, who like to kill people, and a sect of good vampires who do not. While it is an interesting idea to set a vampire movie in Thailand, writers do not seem to do much with the exotic location. This movie could easily have been set in Los Angeles. Which brings me to the next point, which looks a lot like Blade Lite. We have the rock soundtrack, the scenes of martial arts battles, a sangria dance club and, of course, many sharp objects going by vampires. What we do not have is budget and talent. Yes, the hero is a good martial arts fighter, pity that his acting has not been so good, and there is a lot of decent wire work, and a lot of fast-paced, maybe too much. The problem is that they do not have the same impact as the Blade movies. Maybe it's just because the movie has a feeling that it "has been seen there." <br /> <br /> However, for me, the biggest problem was that the filmmakers did not have enough time to establish the relationship between the leader, played by buff and bland Colin Egglesfield, and his girlfriend. She is snatched at the beginning of the movie after a tearful exchange with her boyfriend. We have no interest in your well-being right now and there is no reason to believe that your boyfriend would be willing to risk his neck to save her. Now that's a big drawback when that's the main thrust of the plot. <br /> <br /> In the end, you could do worse than squander 85 minutes of your time on it, but I can think of much better things to do with your time, like renting one of the Blade movies.
