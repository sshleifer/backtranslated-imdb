I hate movies that end up like this !!!! <br /> <br /> This disaster of 16mm is full of clich√©s, stereotyped characters, a generic, a plot made and a terrible dialogue. In this "Movie" we have the Black Aggressive Face, The Black Face Girlfriend, The Blonde Bitch, The Possible Lesbian "hacker girl", the Pedophile teacher ... Blah, Blah, Blah ... And then the Pumpkin. <br /> <br /> "Do you think someone is taking the legend too far?" This question is asked at the end of the movie. Taking the tagline from scream 2 too far. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ***** Normally I do not go into spoilers, but I have to complain .... <br /> <br /> A dream? The whole thing was a dream !!!!! This is the simplest way to end a movie. "I do not know how to explain all this, and we have no more money ... Let's make it a dream." That's what the director / producer / actor / FX guy must have thought of. Yes, the director is the character of Mr. And he did almost everything in this garbage film. This is such a difficult ending ... And as for the director, okay, he has done all the abduction! What does this have to do with the movie? Of course the blacks are dead, the bitch girl is dead, the teacher who has a past sexual harassment with students is dead (he is the main suspect) .... YUCK YUCK YUCK !!! This movie hit me. <br /> <br /> No sense, no sense, and done with Visa and Mastercards parents (which tells me it's probably still being paid), this movie is stupid, boring and just plain stupid. ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the credits. The way they presented the names, etc., at the beginning and at the end. It had a scary feeling. Too bad the movie did not do it! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
