What a farce of unfair movie ratings - a 2.1 on the IMDb rating scale as I write this. Guys, this is much closer to a 3.0, I'm going to go out on a limb and say 4.0 where I put it. Come on - how can you have a movie about a static electricity network around Earth and amorphous alien cell structures, and not give at least a 4.0 for creativity? So you have all that great dialogue like- "Dave, look at the composition of this mud." You know, I do not think they went back to that mud. No matter, this is the kind of movie that 'Z' movie fans live in, and now I can rest easy. In fact, I saw this a few years ago without proper appreciation for it, along with Corman titles like "Attack of the Giant Leeches" and "The Wasp Woman". I do not know what the fascination can be, but to quote a character from the movie - "Whatever it is, it works fast!" <br /> <br /> Back to this amorphous alien cell structure - I liked the idea of ​​a third element competing against your standard red and white blood cells. When astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmett) returned from the dead, I had visions of a scene that might have been a precursor to the 1979 "Alien", but that did not happen. Instead, budget constraints limit the image to a decrepit Big Bird, although this concept is still about a decade away. Who knows where one idea ends and another? <br /> <br /> Look, this is not so bad. Not so good, but not that bad. Every time you can connect astronauts on landing with alien beings committed to Earth, you have a winning combination. Play the cheesy monster factor and you are on your way. Just remember - "An injured animal that is not good".
