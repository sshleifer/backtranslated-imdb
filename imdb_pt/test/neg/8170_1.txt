This movie really shows the farce and the hypocrisy of Indian society. What he tries to show is only one side of the story. The other side of the story is the hidden emotional and mental abuse of Indian children that this movie does not show. <br /> <br /> "Indian parents" are guilty of the following: a. Destroying the individuality of the children, making them completely dependent on the parents very early. These children grow up to be adults only in physical appearance, but children remain in the minds. Since everything has been provided to them by their great Indian parents, they automatically do not feel the need to work hard at something or learn the fundamentals of human communication with other humans as well as their parents. <br /> <br /> B. I can show you so many Indian parents who try to stop their children from making friends by leaving or preventing them from doing anything that starts to make them become adults. <br /> <br /> The reason they do is the same selfishness. Indian parents "expect" their children to care for them when they get older. They do not spare for themselves and once they reach the age of 50 ... They claim LOUD ...... We grow old now and so we are dependent on you children as we made the GREAT SERVICE to bring you to this world and take care of you and make you intellectually weak. <br /> <br /> Most 50-year-old Indian parents have dilapidated bodies and health and are financially completely insecure. Most feel that ABSOLUTELY does not need to take care of themselves, since it "waits" for their children to take care of them. <br /> <br /> In the West, the opposite is true. People start planning at age 20 about their retirement and, once retired, are financially secure. <br /> <br /> Indian parents DO NOTHING like that, since I said they brought the children into the world and what better I am a victim of my Indian parents (I'm sure there are countless other Indian children like me) , who have grown up physically but are still struggling with their lives on their own. and they continue to annoy 50-year-olds who yell out loud at HELP all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie shows only ONE side of the story ..... UTTER piece of JUNK
