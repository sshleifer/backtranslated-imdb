I saw Wicked Little Things as part of Horrorfest's "8 Films To Die For" movie, and this was the only movie that disappointed me. Namely, a mother, her little daughter and her teenage daughter settle in an abandoned house in the mountains of Pennsylvania. Every night, however, the vengeful spirits of children killed in a coal mine run and kill anyone they encounter. <br /> <br /> I think the director was betting on his viewers being pushed back that the kids would be able to kill picks. and eat human flesh (of which there are luxurious close-ups, as a good tribute to George Romero) because the film is not scary otherwise. In other words, there are many pictures of the evil children running to the next murder site. If someone will pick you up in the barn, there will be a shot of the children ARRIVING in the barn (oh, the suspense) and then moving to the kill. <br /> <br /> Come to think of it, why do children suddenly walk SO SLOWLY when they corner their prey? And not that I have any experience in this, but I think a shotgun blast will throw a child a lot more than this movie implies ...? It also does not help that the mother is one of the worst parents I've ever seen in any movie. "The lock on the front door is stuck"? You have an EIGHT year old DAUGHTER in the WOODS with BEARS and MOUNTAIN LIONS! RUN, MORON !!! Also, Mom and her older daughter seem very close in age - even to a teenage pregnancy, and there is an unbelievable death that involves sneaking into someone trying to push a car out of the mud with their butt. <br /> <br /> I'm giving it a 3 because it tried. How a splatter movie is not bad. But for good scares, go somewhere else.
