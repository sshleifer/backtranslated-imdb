The film was a pleasure to watch if you're a Stooges fan. The story is told from the point of view of Moe Howard and his relations with his brothers Shemp and Jerome (Curly) Howard, also the long friendship with Larry Fine. The film deals mainly with the highs of the camera and the falls of the career of Stooges of several decades. The casting director and makeup artist did a good job of finding actors who resembled the famous ensemble. The actor who plays "Curly" Howard did a great job playing the antics of the famous Stooge. A must see for any fan of Three Stooges shorts.
