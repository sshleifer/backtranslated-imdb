This movie sucks so bad. It's funny to see what a poor story it has, where two American twins who know nothing from outside their school can come to another continent and do unimaginable things there. It's so stupid and so bizarre. How can they find two Frenchmen, beat them and in the end kiss them, knowing nothing about them? More realistic would be to have the guys take them away and rape them, which could easily have happened in such a situation. As for the part where they make the French president drink 'bad water', this was just lame. I do not think he would have been very pleased in real life. Everything worked very easily for the girls, and they could have been in real trouble many times in the movie if they somehow portrayed real life. My rating: 0/10
