The lack of character development is fatal to this movie. The character of Valeria Golino, Grazia, starts looking like a bipolar personality, but quickly degenerates into a caricature and seems unreal. The other characters are fine, probably the writer's fault, not the actors. The only exception is Filippo Pucillo as the youngest son Filippo: his energy and bravado are fun and convincing. <br /> <br /> I suppose the little cruelty of children should contribute to an atmosphere of desolation and emphasize the generous primitive spirits. in the city, but to me, gratuitous cruelty is redundant and contributes to the overall hassle of the movie. Some scenes were fun but not necessarily intended that way, for example, when battered dogs become fat and healthy and appear to be ready to show. The beautiful cast and setting make an attractive trailer but can not load the entire movie.
