This is based on Michael's life from 1983/4 until 2004. Flex Alexander performed well but did not look like Michael at all. I feel that Michael was portrayed as a stupid person that I do not believe he was (even if he trusted the wrong people at times). I thought Flex Alexander looked Chinese when they made Michael look white. I think Latoya should have been portrayed in this, she was always portrayed with her brother in the 80's. I never thought any of the cast would look like her colleagues. There were some things that were inaccurate. Lisa-Marie Presley's son appeared to be about 4 years old on the wedding scene, although he was not yet 2 when Lisa and Michael were married. Also, when Michael tells his mother, Katherine, he thinks he and Debbie should get married if she's carrying her child, it was Katherine's idea for them to get married.
