I mean, come on! This movie had such good potential, but it's as if they run out of money to finish the script and only cable the rest of the film about 2/3 of the way. The characters begin to spit in this movie the whole reason of existence for other characters who did not ask for information on extremely fragile premises. They also fall into some stereotyped behavior because that should be expected in this film genre. It's really very sad because this movie could have been so much more. <br /> <br /> I was really hoping that this would be a good movie. There was some good acting. Mark Hamill does a great job until the film comes undone, as does Sally Struthers. It was fun to see them working and succeeding in their craft. Majandra Delfino was very good for some time until her lines became unsustainable. I felt sad that she had to say those lines that only gave credibility to every movie to any movie goer. Brad Hunt does a great job. He actually has a surprising range of talents judging by another of his films that I recently saw, the Lucky 13. (which sucks). This guy could be a star if he could choose the right scripts and get lucky with the right director. <br /> <br /> I almost forgot! The music was so heavy that you may think that this project was delivered to a small film school to be marked. I call this type of music "Teller Music" because you can just tell what's to come based on music. Less is more sometimes. <br /> <br /> Cut off half of the music in this movie, get a good movie editor, a little rewrite or two and that would be a really good movie.
