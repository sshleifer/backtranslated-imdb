This person is a called artist who has to resort to swearing, vulgarity and defamation to try to make others believe he has talent. I have often seen comics use a little of each in effect, but when all you can say is a sign of a distorted mind affected by the drug. It makes me wonder where your twisted and fried brain will be in a few more years of abuse. Poor man!!! I admit I could not watch all this - very idiotic for words. The surprising part of this is that someone really believes that he is a philosopher !!! No wonder self-respect and decency are diminishing and perversity is increasing. Could the UFC have been a factor in his brain?
