Neal N Nikki is voted one of the worst movies of the year by Planetbollywood. It's hard to believe that the famous Chopra produced this bad movie. It was presented as a family movie, but ends up being a ridiculous sexual comedy. It does not make you laugh, but you cry in boredom and you do not have sexy girls to make the movie look sexy. The title song is the most annoying of the decade, I'm Neil, I'm the guy, the rock star. Uday Chopra is one of the worst actors in Bollywood, with no acting talent. After making many Super Flops, and not receiving any movie from a producer instead of his family. He gives a total performance of crap, which annoys you to death. Tanisha, who is and always will be known for being the sister of Kajol, has a terrible performance. Both actors have the most boring chemistry and are very immature for their age. It has a special look of the very cute Richa Pollad, in a pathetic role. The end was so stupid and stupid, I can not believe I actually paid money to rent that crap.
