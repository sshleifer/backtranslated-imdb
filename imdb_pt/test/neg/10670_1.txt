First things first, how can someone with their creativity on the right side believe in a movie like this. I saw this movie and after the end of a few hours it was scratching my head, what exactly is director trying to say. <br /> <br /> If it is a thriller, there are no emotions, if its action, there is no action barring a chase sequence, there is no Drama, and the much loved love story never actually takes off. No passion, no emotion, nothing is there. <br /> <br /> In fact, I never expected wonders from the movie, however, after opening the bumper, I thought of giving a chance. I have no problems with Himesh Reshamiya, and I'm not one of the guys who will knock him out at all times. I entered with an open mind and came out with a closed. <br /> <br /> Let's not put the blame on Himesh Reshamiya, he's just a rookie. But direction, script, writing, makeup, everything went for a throw. <br /> <br /> Himesh is very hard and would take a long time to climb the bend. He can do the kind of roles. Hansika is just a child, and appears on the screen with her baby fat and the way she walks. <br /> <br /> The only actor who was good was Himesh's friend in the movie, I do not know his name, but he looks promising. <br /> <br /> Watch at your own risk, it's not even good to watch it for a preview time. <br /> <br /> ** We strongly recommend you avoid this movie **
