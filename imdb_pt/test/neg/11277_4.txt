A previous reviewer for IMDb said that 'Rafter Romance' is a rip-off of a German musical called 'Me By Day, You By Night'. Apparently the critic does not know that both of these films borrowed the premise of Box and Cox, an English play written by John Maddison Morton in 1847. This play deals with two merchants renting the same room from an unscrupulous owner . every man believing to be the only tenant. As the two men have different work schedules, the ploy is not immediately discovered. This play was already so popular in Britain that 'for Box and Cox it' became a common term for an agreement in which two people willingly shared one-person accommodations. <br /> <br /> The innovation of 'Rafter Romance' (and its predecessor) is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman, who inevitably develop a romance. As usual in these cornball movies, the boy and the gallon detest themselves until they fall into one another's arms. Hoo boy. <br /> <br /> The landlord in this film is played by George Sidney, an actor specializing in interpreting Jewish stereotypes that should be sympathetic. George Sidney has never been as annoying as the hateful Harry Green (the Jewish equivalent of Stepin Fetchit), but the representations of Sidney's Jewish characters are still exaggerated and embarrassing to watch. The most remarkable thing about 'Rafter Romance is that as far as I know, this is the first Hollywood movie to refer to Hitler and the rise of Nazism. At one point in the film, landlord Eckbaum (Sidney) learns that his teenage son Julius was busy crushing the swastikas on the walls. Eckbaum and his son are clearly made to be Jews. Admittedly, no one in Hollywood in 1933 had any real idea of ​​what Hitler was planning for Jews in Europe ... yet it is surprising to see a movie depicting a Jewish teenager who thinks swastikas are a joke. His father is, very properly, irritated by this display of the Nazi symbol. One very shameful aspect of Hollywood history is the documented fact that all the major Hollywood studios continued to do business with the Third Reich. in 1939. The leading Hollywood women were medically documented as "Aryan" so that their films could be distributed in Nazi Germany and Austria. For the same reason, the leading Hollywood men were documented as "Aryan and uncircumcised." Except for Twentieth Century-Fox's Darryl Zanuck, all Hollywood studio executives conspiring to this policy were Jewish-but clearly had no objection to doing business with Hitler. I'm surprised that 'Rafter Romance' contains an unfavorable swastika portraying scene, as this sequence would have provided the film Verboten in Germany and Austria. (Maybe the scene has been cut for release in German: this is not crucial to the movie's plot). In addition, the film contains nothing remarkable. Robert Benchley makes his character confusing and bland: I never understood the appeal of this man. I'll rate 'Rafter Romance' 4 out of 10.
