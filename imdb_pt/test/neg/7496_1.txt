I was ready for a Crouching Tiger style movie and all I got was the worst movie I've seen in years. It was almost as bad as Baron Von Munchhuasen. Dead script. Acting dead Everything. <br /> <br /> Granted there were some good fight scenes, but the positive side ends there. If this movie comes to your house, run to a telephone and dial 911 and say, "Please help, there is a movie in my house that should force people to commit suicide"
