Calu and now? Yeah, I thought it was a stupid name too. Chris Carter remains blissfully unaware of the scum in his team of writers. Starting with the usual X-Files cheerleading teaser (a baby getting hit by a train) in this episode ... well, I can not say it will come down because, to be honest, it was never going up. Badly written, with us feeling no pathetic to any of the characters (except perhaps that baby in the beginning) the writer makes us hate the characters before brutally killing them, it is the worst technique of all . Should we feel sorry for the characters who hate them? Do not ask me. <br /> <br /> It's not just annoying and not scary, but it's like watching a very bad Omen sequence with exaggerated and disgusting death sequences and rotten special effects (although to be brutally honest, this is the least my worries). <br /> <br /> Sara B. Charno began her X-Files career with a groan and happily ended up with one too. <br /> <br /> Verdict: <br /> <br /> words from my math teacher Mr. Laverack: "Horrible, Awful ..."
