I am very disappointed because I expected a real tour, as promised in the many reviews. The script is very bad with many holes and the direction too. The director completely failed to develop each violent scene with emotion and suspense. He tries very hard to follow an aspiring thriller. So I had to watch how each bullet was used without making any sense to me. I was always asking what kind of movie I'm watching. So I did not like that she aggressively smoked one cigarette after another, but maybe the movie was backed up in part by the tobacco industry. The ending is also very disappointing. I can not understand how Jodie Foster could have been nominated for the Golden Globe in this worst role of her life. Jodie, so I really enjoyed PANIC ROOM or FLIGHT PLAN. This is definitely one of the worst I have ever seen. 4/10
