Extremely slow movie. There are great performances from all the actors, and that's why above 5 points. Surya and Jyo are supposed to be the ideal husband and wife, and this is shown until you start asking if there is a story. One day, Jyo discovers Surya's diary to find his failed love story in college. The college love story is totally unconvincing, as Surya is an arrogant Senior who is always criticizing Bhoomika, assaults her friend, yells at her in public, and despite being terrified of him she falls in love with him. Even after he continues to master it using raw language. I certainly could not appreciate the meek character played by Bhoomika, I do not think any self-respecting woman will fall for such idiots in real life. Then Jyo decides to bring them together and what happens after that is the climax. The story is extremely weak in its characters. An extremely arrogant Surya for Bhoomika is exactly the opposite of Jyo (and there is no reason for the sudden change of character). Again, an extremely meek Bhoomika becomes a great extrovert when she returns. If she had been so overconfident, why did not she try to find her love, since she feared no one else.
