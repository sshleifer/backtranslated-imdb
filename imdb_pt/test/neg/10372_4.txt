I absolutely love the first three movies, they were great! I once got Part 5 on VHS 10 years ago and was disappointed. But maybe it was because I never saw the room because they were shot consecutively. but after finally seeing a copy today, I have to say that it was nothing better than the number 5. My expectations were not high to begin with, but this is cheap direct video thing, not even a horror movie, it's the PG-13. The acting was not convincing, the story was pretty stupid without any excitement and there were not many effects. But the main problem is that there were no deaths or any gore (the boring kid who is killed in his car should be the highlight, but come on ...) <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, both parts 4 and 5 were directed by Sequel director Jeff Burr who gave us the excellent Stepfather II and Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. I liked the Puppet Master: The Legacy, even if it was nothing more than a tribute to the best scenes from all the movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, Puppet Master is very much like the Hellraiser Series: A great trilogy, but forget the rest ..
