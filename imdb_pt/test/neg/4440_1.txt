Robert Altman's "Quintet" is a somber, dark, difficult-to-follow thriller, in which you finally give up after a while, because it's very complicated. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this at my local twin brother on the opening weekend with a full house. By the time the picture was finished, it was less than a full room. I never witnessed a mass exodus without an emergency to expel people. That should tell you how bad it is. I believe it was the worst film ever made involving such important talent in front of and behind the camera.
