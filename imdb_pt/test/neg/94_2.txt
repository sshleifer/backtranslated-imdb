The most positive points in this film were the credits (text style) and some moments in the performance of Ice-T. The plot; two rival gangs having to fight it, with the subplots of betrayal, power and change are well-worn, but in this case painful (much) plots to go through. The decrepit scenario, which added little credibility in places, and questionable lighting, constantly distracted from any interest / identification with the characters (the glow of the actress's forehead / nose was blinding, not to mention other scenes with the same problem). Even in the middle of the movie, I wanted to know more about how and why this happened, as opposed to what was happening on the screen. A disappointment if you've seen Ice-T in other roles. Congratulations to other actors / actresses who seemed to get into their roles despite the weak direction; Corrupt side kick and other restaurant worker.
