Ok - the title "House of Frankenstein" was a reference to a line from the original Frankenstein movie. When they follow up with a movie titled "House of Dracula" that does not make sense, you know it's just starting to turn into a franchise. <br /> <br /> Without explanation, Dracula is back, and he is calling himself Baron Latos. He infiltrates the home of a Dr. Edelmann, claiming that he is seeking a cure for his vampirism. Edelmann has a hunchback nurse who helps him (what about the humpback assistants in those films?), But what really matters to Dracula is his other, more handsome assistant. At this point, Larry "Wolf Man" Talbot returns (again, no explanation given) and is just looking for the same doctor to cure his lycanthropy. And then he simply falls into a cave in which plants can be grown to help him, which also happens to contain the monster Frankenstein. Dear God, when it will end ... surely, the other sequels of Universal monsters were silly, but that's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> First things good. There are great settings, and the effects of vampire bats are slightly better than normal. Some of the other effects are pretty cool too. John Carradine is not bad like Dracula once you get used to it, but still nothing as bright as Lugosi was. In my opinion, Onslow Stevens plays a much better vampire in this film, although he has exactly the opposite problem to Carradine - the whole shiver and nothing of class. None of the performances are so good, but it's more because of the atrocious script than anything else - the female parts are particularly poorly written. But, stupid as it is, it stays reasonably fun most of the time. The best thing is that it's short. <br /> <br /> Now the bad things ... are not scary, are poorly written and do not work. I was hoping the three monsters would start a kind of supernatural power struggle, but that does not happen. The focus is almost entirely on Dracula, which is not particularly well portrayed. On the other hand, this is the only film in which Dracula infects another man, but is done through a blood transfusion instead of a bite, because Universal has always felt uncomfortable with the possible homosexual subtext. Larry Talbot is decent, as always, as the Werewolf, but plays a comparatively small role. Once again, the Frankenstein monster part is reduced to anticlimactic final moments. For God's sake, Glenn Strange was fantastic as the creature! Why not give more time on the screen? It is unfortunate that the series has ended on this note (not counting the classic comedy "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"). In the end, he just failed in the sunlight and died, much like Dracula himself.
