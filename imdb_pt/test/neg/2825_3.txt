Well, the movie starts well but after half an hour it becomes boring and stupid when the whole plot is about Karen's pregnancy (which was the girl's name, right?). <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is really tacky and the characters really stupid. <br /> <br /> I do not know who's stupidest, whether the girl because she came back with her boyfriend or boy by the way he was used by her. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my conclusion is this: it's definitely not the best comedy of the 80s, just another movie like many others with nothing special, they could do better, but they screwed up, They keep this pregnancy material and they definitely ruined, so the final conclusion: I do not like.
