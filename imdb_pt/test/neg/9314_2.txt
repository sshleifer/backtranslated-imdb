What can be said about this independent effort apart from the fact that it was filmed with television cameras, and whether this was due to concept or budget constraints, does not make it easy to observe this variation on a Romero theme. I was always reminded that I was attending a school project for someone, at best derived, at worst cheap. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Georg Koszulinski (who also appears in the film) does some interesting things with film pictures but that says more about his editing style than his directing style, which consists of close -ups with TV cameras that made me think I was watching public-access television instead of a real, honest-to-good movie. The story copies and glues pieces from various sources, including the DEAD trilogy, THE ROAD WARRIOR (the film of a "future" that looks like the past) and the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. <br /> <br /> What results are the zombies of an hour and nothing, tracking and eating humans. (Okay, the "humans" in this case are clones, but that does not change anything. It's the same menu.) <br /> <br /> The year is 2031, and the first strand of people who were cloned nineteen. years before it began to malfunction, particularly in the area of ​​diet. Of course, when clones go wrong, the first thing they like is human flesh (or, in this case, cloned human flesh). It is not safe to be indoors, it is not safe to be outdoors. It's only a matter of time before flesh-eating goblins devour our heroes. Have you seen this before? <br /> <br /> I do not mind people stealing Romero, if it's well done, but no new territory is covered in this movie. It is NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD finds the PROJECT BLAIR WITCH, filmed with television cameras. What is particularly disappointing is that the DVD cover makes it look like it was filmed at least with 8mm film. That would not have been a problem with me if the story had not been equally cheap. The film offers a bleak vision of the future in which technology has evolved to the point where human cloning is possible. Should we continue to clone our favorite movies?
