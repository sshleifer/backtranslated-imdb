Some spoilers **** Soap has some wonderful times to recommend it. When Charlotte and Veronica approach intimacy, it's a beautiful scene, discreet and truly erotic. I also loved the soundtrack and the cinematography smooth and muted. It is not clear if the curious structure of stop and start of the film comes from being digested originally in serialized form (the speaker describing the action in sections is quite annoying). My biggest problem with this movie is the rather absurd representation of a trans woman and her life. Of course, she has to be portrayed as a sex worker (what's more), impassive, impractical, absurdly neat / feminine, totally hopeless when it comes to dressing and unable to make any interpersonal connections in the world. In addition, she always shows two days of beard growth (for some bizarre reason), as if she wanted to emphasize how bad her life is. And she's waiting to undergo gender reassignment surgery when she apparently did nothing more to direct her transition. In fact, the character resembles a drag queen, not someone who is in transition. <br /> <br /> These are typical fantasies of outsiders who really are not connected to trans people. The fetishization of the GRS surgery film is a way of objectifying the people who are going through the transition. Not impressed with this aspect of the movie at all. At least, why not have the character played by someone who is really transgender ... I thought that the actor who plays Veronica was fine but no better than that. Much better was the woman portraying Charlotte, a very complex character full of energy, self-loathing, desire, and contradictions. If she was so fascinated by someone with feminine energy, a Charlotte could go to a women's bar in two seconds and find him. Yes, she was attracted to Veronica, but more like an abstract idea of ​​someone with masculine / feminine characteristics (a gentle touch, but with a good punch), not as a single person. Yes, what The Soap says about love is often loving and moving, but that does not mean that an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped a bit more in the process. <br /> <br /> This film also proves that the Danes are terrible. dancers. For such a promising premise (best performed in a film as "Different For Girls"), the final film is a disappointment.
