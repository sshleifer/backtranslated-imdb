Hunka less than redemptive garbage that is mercifully free from the ravages of competence. Some idiots from the north come to the south looking for Confederate rifles hidden in the legendary Whiskey Mountain. They are threatened by scary hill countrymen, in a big nod to 'Liberation'; but it turns out that the country boys are ahead of the idiot of the northern marijuana trade. This is brought to light so soon that it does not even qualify as a turnaround. Women are locked and raped in catatonia; instead of rescuing them, the guys run into town to get the sheriff, who is lazy and does not believe them. I think if my girlfriend was being raped, I kind of would take the shortest route to the hiding place anyway. Okay, because as soon as they show up to soften the bad guys, the girls get excited and jump, if the trauma were like this in real life. Also with a sert√£o face with a beard that cackles a lot. Not exactly exploding in the seams with ideas.
