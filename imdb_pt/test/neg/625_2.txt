When I was 8 years old, and going through my Marx brothers stage, my dad read in the TV guide that they were showing the Marx Brothers movie, "The Big Store" on Friday night, and recorded the VCR for me . When I woke up on Saturday - no doubt due to a misprint in the TV guide - my father and I discovered that "The Story of Mankind" had been recorded. "The Big Store" was probably one of the least funny of all the Marx Brothers' films and yet it stands out as one of the best movie works of the century when compared to "The History of Humanity ". I can almost justify the mistake of TV Guide, in which the Marx brothers - Groucho, Chico and Harpo - appear in both films. Although in "The History of Mankind", they are divided into a series of independent scenes: Groucho plays Peter Minuit, Chico plays a guy talking to Christopher Columbus, and Harpo plays Isaac Newton ????? The Harpo scene lasts about half a minute; Chico only has two or three lines; Groucho's scene is at least funny, but horribly insensitive to today's standards. The rest of the film does not mention it. They trotted out some of the best actors of the day, and made them recite the total garbage. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> TV guide, I sent you a nice letter, I'm still waiting for an apology. <br /> <br /> For the record: "The Big Store" has a bit of physical comedy with the Marx Brothers skates, and some songs by Virginia O'Brien. I was really looking forward to seeing this.
