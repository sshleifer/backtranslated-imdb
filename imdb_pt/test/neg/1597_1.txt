Okay, so not every Aussie movie is that good. Yes, there may have been very few with much merit. Take Away, however, is an absolute bomb, qualifying itself as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I try to like this. I thought I'd give it a fair shot. I even met one of the screenwriters Dave O'neil, so I feel like a traitor giving this movie a bad review, but ... The plot is fairly thin (I will not bother to relate it ... read the synopsis), which I can forgive: there are many movies that can cover this with some decent jokes. Unfortunately, Take Away jokes cover her plot as a $ 2 prostitute skirt. The only laughs that came out of the other 6 people in the movie were probably the bad acting and the dialogue. Take Away comes down as a week old Dim yes ... You can understand this joke if you see the movie but the joke is not worth it.
