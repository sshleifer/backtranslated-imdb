I say that Ben Johnson and my Canadian colleagues say "Ben Johnson?!" - he was a fucking mob of the MOVIE STAR band, a COWBOY, and in 1976 he was making a stupid movie sheriff made for disaster movies like this, profiting from the DEADLY SWARMS OF KILLER BEES that everyone apparently thought was coming to us time. Then there are these bees, and they kill some people flying in their mouths and going after them underwater. Eventually, these idiots find the swarm and die and this woman is stuck in her car all over the swarm. Cops are like, what do we do? Bees die when it is cold. So where could we make it cold? I know - the stadium in New Orleans! So they drive this car and its swarm of killer bees through the streets of New Orleans, with a megaphone saying "GO OUT OF THE STREETS OR YOU WILL BE PENDING TO DEATH." And the future home of tens of thousands of flood victims with their broken toilets, thus becomes the narcotic doom of these particular bees. I do not know what the greatest indignity of this great city is ... well, but this one sucks too. More appropriately seen in an extremely faded 16mm orange print, though Betamax is a good alternative!
