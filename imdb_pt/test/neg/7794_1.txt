Do writers who evoke such comedies have lives so empty that they have to incorporate them into such tragic shows? <br /> <br /> Why the talented and handsome Busy Phillips is among this crap is beyond me I can not stand the Hispanic girl whose accent sounds too fake and is as bland and annoying as the other African-American girl with the voice strident <br /> <br /> Jokes are often stupid, the Jew screams. and the show is never going anywhere, a particular episode with the soldier looking for love was simply terrible. <br /> <br /> I do not believe there would be many working in a love office and only one man? Of course all women are in tight tops and tons of makeup to make up for the lack of talent. <br /> <br /> I really found Holly funny in her older shows and I always admired Busy, but this show is dumb, empty and had nothing to lose.
