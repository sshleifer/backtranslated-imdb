This movie came very close to being a good movie. The direction needs to be a bit softer to progress from one piece to another to make it more plausible. In particular: The main character's need to escape is not explicit enough. Is he trying to kill himself? Is he trying to escape? His life does not seem to be that bad, it makes it harder to swallow that he wants to leave his life too much. Also, it is not very clear how much "in love" he fell with Jennifer Jason L. If the film were reworked with more attention to those details, it would have been great. On the other hand, for an indy movie, it's very good! Maybe if you have a couple of drinks, to hinder logical reasoning, it would be more fun ... <br /> <br />
