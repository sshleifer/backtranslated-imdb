I'm not sure I've ever seen such a bad movie. Terrible acting, all over the place, terrible special effects. There are some "so bad, good" moments here, but not enough to keep the interest going. The woman who plays Tracey looks ghastly. There are some rather disturbing scenes with a dwarf that make you feel a bit raped. On the plus side, the scenes of operation are quite fun for the special effects, as well as the chase of cars where a car is "trying to force us out of the road" without really making contact. I guess the budget was not stretched to destroy cars. Oh, and what appears to be a postcard of the Taj Mahal is shown every time they cut to the fictitious foreign country.
