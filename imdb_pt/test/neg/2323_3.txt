I watched this last night for the first time in 40 years. It's bad. Too bad. But it has hilarious moments and terrible enough that is worth watching. First of all, was it deliberate to make the boy a completely effeminate babysitter? He even says to Costello a la Mae West "you fascinate me!" as Costello does a double exam. God knows what would have happened if the nanny had been a man. This kid would have seduced him in the blink of an eye! Then there is the main male dancer. He is totally inept. Roar of laughter as he jumps and dances without any talent over the giant's grave during He has never looked better in his life. The two romantic lanes are zeros, rubbish. Abbott begins to sing a line and this was voiced by another singer. God, I do not think he could even carry a song! Costello manages to be charming in his I Fear Nothing number, and I think very young children might like it, but there is not much to recommend. But oh that seductive effeminate boy! That aspect alone surprised me! Also, the fact that the family accepted someone on the street without references to a child's nanny! Today, the little femmy boy would be taken from them!
