Brave but weak, James Bond movie mainly because both the hero (Bond) and the villain (Blofeld) were seriously wrong. Lazenby is too big and innocent to play Bond. He looks and acts more like the humorous, but stupid companion in a police action movie. The director and writer try to establish his credibility, but his dictation of lines like "Royal Baluga, North of the ..." just are not effective in establishing him as this mundane and smooth rogue. Savalas does not do a bad job, but his characterization and behavior are best suited for a mob gangster. The best characters portrayed in the film are Tracy and her father. But the performances of these actors while sharing the screen with Lazenby serve only to emphasize their shortcomings as an actor. This film is very long (140 minutes) for a Bond movie and offers no excitement until the Bond mountain trail where it begins to pick up. This movie goes a long way but falls short. Many Bondian elements are present and the climatic battle is top notch, but I always have the feeling that something is missing while watching this.
