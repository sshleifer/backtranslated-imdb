This has to be the most incredible part of the cinematic crap I've ever watched. That makes the Mel Brooks films worthy of the Oscar in comparison. Jim VanBebber needs to be publicly beaten for trying to pass this off as any form of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Although some may say that this film is true to the low budget genre of classics like "The Chainsaw Massacre" or "Night of the Living Dead," the production value is not in question VanBebber's ability to cast and present a plausible plot The cast is deplorable For the role of Charlie, he must have chosen the first actor to see with a beard and long hair. (Manson never crossed his shoulders), this actor spoke in a monotonous tone without a fraction of the personality that Steve Railsback or even Jeremy Davies lent to his Manson interpretations. "The actor chosen to play" Tex "Watson had hair curly blondes instead of straight, dark hair, a fact that anyone who has shown even the most distant interest in the Manson case knows this.He looks like a Minnesota farmer in "Little House on the Prairie "The actress who plays Susan Atkins has a bigger ass than Oprah, while those who know the members of the Family know that" Clem "was considered a bit retarded. so cloaked and chaplain, was like watching an old Vaudevile act. Instead of Sharon Tate looking like a beautiful pregnant woman, the actress looked like a swollen, alcoholic trailer trash. VanBebber accelerates filming in some places for the artistic effect, but this technique has not proved remotely useful since "The Munsters". The final credits list all known family members but we are never introduced to most of them and those to whom we are introduced are not sure who they are sometimes. <br /> <br /> The facts are also destroyed in this film. . "Lotsapoppa" did not die in real life, Steven Parent was shot four times, not twice, Abagail Folger did not have his throat cut off, Where were Mary Brunner and Bruce Davis during Himnan's murder? Patricia Krenwinkel has never worn a "Dorothy Hamill" hair style. <br /> <br /> The most disconcerting aspect of this movie is what modern freaks have to do with this movie? Why was the girl wearing a rubber mask with a vibrator? What was their problem with the journalist? What was the meaning or purpose of the final confrontation? Why were they included, period? The viewer never knows! <br /> <br /> Sacred mackerel, I could go on and on, but space prevents it. Do not try to eat popcorn during this crap because your hand will be too busy scratching your head while you repeatedly say "What the f ---?"
