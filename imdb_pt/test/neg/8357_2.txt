I'm writing this review simply because I'm a big fan of the book, Prozac Nation, and I was shocked by the film. <br /> <br /> I guess if you had not read the book, you would have been lost watching the movie as it provided no real history for Wurtzel's depression. There was no real mention of her childhood (her relationship with her father, her experiences at summer camp, her first therapists (actually the film gives the impression that she's never been in therapy until Dr. Sterling) ... ). That said, if you had read the book, you would have been confused by how much editing had taken place. <br /> <br /> I thought the book was a vivid picture of depression, highlighting Wurtzel's low points, and the experiences she had along the way. The film, however, started at Harvard, and literally played the audience directly with no real explanation of what was happening. Events that were important in the book (like Wurtzel's abortion, his summer working in Dallas, his suicide attempt while on Prozac) were omitted from the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, this is pedantic, but Wurtzel did not lose his virginity with Noah. The suicide attempt that was shown in Sterling's office was completely different from the book. To begin with, she actually suffered an overdose of Mellaril, unlike the para-suicide gesture shown in the film. <br /> <br /> On the whole, I would say that if you read the book and liked / identified with it, then do not watch the movie. Read "More, now, again" (by the same author). Or watch the Girl, Interrupted. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming feature was the performance of Anne Heche, who, I believe, portrayed Dr. Sterling very well. Christina Ricci was good too, though her performance seemed a bit ... flamboyant. Jessica Lange made a pleasant sight, but it seemed the opposite of how Wurtzel's mother is described in the book. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? Do not bother yourself.
