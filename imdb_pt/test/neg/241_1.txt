"Classic" Mexican was the third entry in the Aztec Mummy series. As you'll soon discover, this movie is anything but a classic, instead it's more like a movie that deliberately tries to bore you. <br /> <br /> Some scientist wants to steal the Aztec treasure from a tomb, but guarding that tomb is that traveling commercial paper toilet: The Aztec mummy. Knowing that he can not beat Mom, he then builds a robot and a very bad one at it. We can only see Mr.Robot on the last roll, while he knocks and fights with the Aztec mummy. <br /> <br /> I've seen many science fiction films, heck, most Sci-Fi. The Fi movies I see are awful, but this, for the entire duration of 64 Minuites, is the worst movie I've ever seen, with Fubar coming in second ... <br /> <br /> In conclusion: Do not lose your time.
