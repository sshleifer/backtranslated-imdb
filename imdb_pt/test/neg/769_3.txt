Mute is right: Tom and Jerry reach their goal of a non-stop aerial flight to Africa, but then worry about mingling with the natives. They put "blackface", break the plane, try to survive on a plane wing floating in the ocean, and then survive the wild animals when they land. <br /> <br /> After reading some comments before seeing this, I I know what to expect. It was just these two guys doing their impressions of Amos and Andy / Stepin 'Fetchit. Offensive to blacks? Of course, but this is the 1930s for you. Some of his lines were funny, some were idiots. The main flaw I had with this cartoon was the audio, since it was often not easy to understand what these two guys were saying. <br /> <br /> All in all, a piece of curiosity, but do not let racism stop. you have to check this out. At least it gives you an idea of ​​how times have changed ... for the better.
