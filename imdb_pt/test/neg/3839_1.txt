A blind person could have filmed this movie better ... seriously! The director is clearly a newbie. He must be Dennis Hopper's cocaine dealer or something to convince him to be in this movie. I felt so embarrassed by Dennis. <br /> <br /> For John, the director ... PLEASE, withdraw from the direction. Your contribution is neither necessary nor desired. The middle of the movie is stronger without you. You're terrible at driving. Keep shopping bags or something. <br /> <br /> This movie must have gone straight to the video and been "straight into the trash." I'm a dumber person for having seen this movie. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE IF I RESPECT YOU AND RESPECT THE MOVIES ART!
