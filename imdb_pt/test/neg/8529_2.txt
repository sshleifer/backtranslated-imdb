My Take: Yet another PG-13 horror film with predictable tactics and a plot derived. <br /> <br /> The spirits move. The walls creak. There's something wrong in the basement. These, along with several other clich√©s of horror films, haunt the walls of another house in the country, THE MESSENGERS, produced by Sam Raimi, a lame pastiche of the most predictable intimidation tactics thrown into a wilderness and better recycled (and times, even worse) horror movies of the past. <br /> <br /> When the Solomon family moves to an old farm in South Dakota, another attempt by their father (Dylan McDermott) to reconnect with the family, especially with his former drunk Living his daughter Jessica ( the underestimated Kristen Stewart) in the subtler countryside than her home in Chicago. The horror happens when Jessica begins receiving small surprise visits from the house's poltergeists. Thinking she is a teenager who cried wolf, her parents do not believe her. How could they? The true horror in THE MESSENGERS is waiting for which horror movie it will attack next. Will it be an angry bunch of ravens wanting more than the family crops (a direct hit from Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, THE BIRDS)? Will it be haunted house with a story that goes back to THE AMITYVILLE HORROR or POLTERGEIST? Or will it be the grotesque ghosts drawn from their well-known recent horrors, like THE RING and THE GRUDGE? Heck, the movie still manages to steal one or two scenes from some really bad horror movies, like AMITYVILLE 3-D and the mediocre COLD CREEK MANOR. Maybe all the Pang Brothers really wanted to make a level B horror movie, but would it be that bad? Could not they steal the best? Avoid it. <br /> <br /> Rating: * out of 5.
