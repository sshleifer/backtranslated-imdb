As a big fan of most modern fantasy films, I was really looking forward to it. I was not familiar with the character, although after hearing some general stories about the comic style and good reviews of the movie, I thought I was in a real treat ... <br /> <br /> From the moment the main character began to speak in his voice hoarse forced, I could tell immediately that I would not like this movie. I found the story to be weak and predictable, poor acting, the effects were very good for a small budget film, but did nothing for the overall storyline. <br /> <br /> Maybe as a comic book fan you can get something more from this, otherwise I suggest you skip this and do not waste your movie time on this boring adventure.
