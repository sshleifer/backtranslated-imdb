I had not laughed much in a theater for years. The only problem was that it was not the intention of the movie to make my throat out of laughter. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely overflowing with bad CGI, absolutely dreadful duo, absolutely terrible acting, and enough referrals geeks to make it all sound like nothing but complete cheese. As a gamer and a geek-type girl, I recognized all the obvious references to games in this movie, as well as STUFF geek who has just been thrown in the background as eye drops (Steamboy's poster, the t-shirts from thinkgeek.com and j-list.com), and that did not rescue the movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have been good in EVERYONE was that ghostly children enter characters that were intentionally mis-rendered in CGI to make it seem like they were from a game, and that they were OBVIOUSLY stolen from terror. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it was hilariously bad, and something I would expect from a midnight screening of a Sci-Fi channel made for TV movie. Do not expect more than that and you will have a great time. Just do not get a soda or you'll spit it out everywhere when you get great lines like, "Why did you bring this game into our lives? WHY ?!"
