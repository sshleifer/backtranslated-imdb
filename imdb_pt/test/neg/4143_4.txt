I wanted to pursue this movie, but somehow I can not find it in myself. Showing a duality of fighting styles, it is Li Vs. I read in a somewhat decent battle for supremacy. This is one of those movies in which history brings the performances. Li's acting is extremely amateurish, hesitant and tough for most of this movie ... until the end. At first I convinced myself to believe that he was doing this for one of his two characters. You know, to show a difference of personalities. But it seemed inexperience or lack of talent. It got a little better, more relaxed in the end. But that was not enough to save his performance. Jet Li's performance improves as his career progresses. I do not hate your acting. I simply hated it. <br /> <br /> I also have to say that the effects were very class "B" effects. What effects there are. <br /> <br /> The story itself had great potential. It was exceptionally creative, bold and fresh. Unfortunately, the budget was not broad enough to accommodate better lighting, effects, movie quality and some acting classes, or the principal just did not care enough to care about those little details. He also did not bother with science in science fiction. A fact that was a great detractor for this movie. <br /> <br /> The fight sequences were somewhat unilateral, since he seemed to give more to one character and little to the other. But all along the story line made a very nice attempt. <br /> <br /> As nice as it may have been, I could not help but think that this was just one of those movies that you can not help but see for what it should have been, not for what is. <br /> <br /> It ranks a 6.0 / 10 on the "B" scale. <br /> <br/> This is a 4.2 / 10 (on the "A" scale) by having a good plot, from ... <br /> The Devil :.
