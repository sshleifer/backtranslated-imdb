Vehicle adapted obvious for Ryan Philippe. It seems the studios expected him to play a tough cop and it did not look like he was 16 years old (he can not). <br /> <br /> Heavyweights Jason Statham and Welsey Snipes serve as stands for Phillippe, but when there are no Phillippe flounders on the screen; his shallow acting style has nothing to counter. <br /> <br /> The script is a typical good cop / bad cop of the late 20th century with a ridiculously predictable plot and dialogue drawn from 1970s TV shows such as "The Streets of San Francisco." Snipes reprises his role as the eternal black-hat villain, playing a madman a little less crazed than his role as Demolition Man. However, there was not much for Snipes and Statham to chew on. Statham's character announces that he had given up on nicotine and caffeine - something that this film urgently needed injections. <br /> <br /> A truly forgettable moment: Ryan Phillippe exposes the Buddhist dogma: Galloway: Are you a Buddhist? Dekker: No. It's just something I picked up along the way.
