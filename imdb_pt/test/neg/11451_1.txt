*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** There's not much you can say about this early-age film. (I hesitate to call "Cimarron" a "movie" because I feel the word is too esoteric.) But what can be said about it ... mostly speaks against it. <br /> <br /> For example, the overuse of portraying the Indians as bad people. In one scene, the lead character in the film - an overbearing and overbearing man who wants to set up a newspaper business - is playing outside his father's office. An Indian kneels in front of the child. "Hello," the boy says to the Indian, in a very polite way. The Indian gives him a feather, he rises and leaves. Yancy Cravat, Jr. races excitedly inside the office. "Mama, Mama!" he shouts, holding the Indian's present. "Look what an Indian gave me!" <br /> <br /> "How many times do I have to tell you!" it fits the boy. "You'll never talk to these filthy Indians!" <br /> <br /> Yancy Yates, Sr. (Richard Dix) appears as a man speaking with a forked tongue. Early in the story, he seems to have a definite plan to give his family a better life. But we soon discover that he is not a great achiever - let alone a totally moralistic man. His slave son, Isaiah (Eugene Jackson) is a telltale sign of this. <br /> <br /> On his family's first trip to a mass on Sunday morning - one in which Curiously, Cravat is to give the sermon - Isaiah tries to approach, dressed as Cravat, long-tailed suit, holster, gun and everything. Cravat tells him to go home. "You do not want me to go with you?" Isaiah says with a pout. "No!" Cravat corrects him, patting him on the shoulder. "You do not understand! I want you to stay and protect the house, and if someone comes along ... you shoot him!" <br /> <br /> The characters - not to mention the actors - "Cimarron" could not get out of siege bags, despite their obvious efforts. And nothing in the script was very commendable either. (Granted: the incomparable Edna May Oliver - famous for playing the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland, also released in 1931 - can actually look good, taking the portrait of a pompous old woman, which is what she has also been better at "But besides, well ..." Yancy Yates has not been popular in the city since the first week she arrives, and one of the bad guys decides to shoot the white hat of Cravat as he and his wife (Irene Dunne) walk casually.Despite his anger at the man who fired the bullet, Cravat only brings it fully to the surface. Not only was this story "not firing" for realism, "but it was too much lack of several key areas: for example, Cravat's newspaper is never seen for real. (Newsletters and posters, yes - but no newspaper. > <br /> Perhaps the strangest of all: however, this is happening in a small town in Kansas. <br /> <br /> < > <br /> However, for some reason or another, Yancy Cravat is determined to call his newspaper "The Oklahoma Wig-Wam". <br /> <br /> Really good things have always been very few. and far away - the only exceptions are Clint Eastwood's so-called "spaghetti westerns" from the late 1960s to the early 1970s. Cliché westerns, on the other hand, are dozens of dozens. <br /> <br /> If you like Western clichés, "Cimarron" will make you proud - but as for me ... that made me embarrassed. <br /> <br />
