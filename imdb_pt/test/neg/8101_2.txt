I probably have to blame myself, but I certainly expected more from a movie that goes by the title "Black Dragons" and revolves around secret conspiracies of World War II, Nazi plastic surgeons and revenge. This film is a monotonous flaw with an incomprehensible structure. The actual plot (which is basically quite ingenious and intriguing) only becomes clear during an explanation near the end, but the problem is that you stop caring much earlier. We see how the icon of horror Bela Lugosi infiltrates a society of prominent American politicians and kills them one by one. The story is timed just before World War II and ?? especially after witnessing the end? It's certainly a premise with a lot of potential, so it's a shame it's not elaborate. There is, however, a great dialogue that I can not resist sharing! Man to woman: "Do you want to marry me?" "Because?" "So I can beat you? It's the only way for you to leave this place!" It's the only highlight in a very annoying general movie. Is Bela Lugosi beautiful? as always ?? but its scary performance alone is not worth buying this movie. If you're interested in seeing his other ghoulish presentations (in films with decent scripts), check out "Invisible Ghost," "The Corpse Vanishes," "White Zombie," and of course the Dracula version of 1931.
