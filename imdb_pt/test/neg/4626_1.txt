I saw this on the Sci-Fi Channel, so I knew it would be bad to start, but I was surprised at how much worse it was than expected. The CG effects on the dragon were terrible even for the science fiction channel and the writing was pathetic. I could not tell if this was supposed to be as stupid as a joke or if it just came out that way. The only redeeming quality of this film is that it's so terrible that it's almost funny, especially the part where the character of Patrick Swayze's knight goes home to his father Knight who retired after losing his legs and is now bedding in his armor for the sole purpose of letting the public know that he was a knight. Most of the movie revolves around a huge dragon egg that turns into a not so huge baby dragon with some of the worst CGI I've ever seen. That was awful.
