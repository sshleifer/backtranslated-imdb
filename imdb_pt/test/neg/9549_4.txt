The plot has many flaws and illogical sequences to be worth. Jolie's acting is fairly flat and poor, Washington is fine, the rest of the cast is cardboard cutouts. Somehow, almost everything about this movie exudes mediocrity. The plot is lame. The only thing I liked more or less about this movie are the rather unique methods that the abuser uses to wipe out their victims. The technical details are worse than the CSI's "knowledge" and the more relaxed appearances, and in the middle of the movie he wonders if the director even cared about the credibility of the details. (Some Spoilers hereafter!) I mean, an ECG machine with a pure sinus wave reflecting a man's heart rate, a quadriplegic with full-body muscle spasms and a working index finger for sure. A murderer gutting the entrails of a man, keeping him alive to allow the mice to delight in him, followed by a mouse pointing to the face of the guy! What's with all this stupidity? So there are very few tricks of continuity, but you can find them elsewhere here on IMDb Honestly, I found it to be an insult even to my limited intelligence. <br /> <br /> Waste of time. Still 4 out of 10 to keep my girlfriend from kicking me.
