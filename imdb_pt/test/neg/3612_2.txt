A group of tourists are stranded on Snake Island after an unfortunate accident with their boat. They are forced to spend the night and as you probably suspected, it is not called Snake Island because it is so much fun to say - it has a history of people disappearing one by one because of the large population of snakes, which is exactly what happens with these poor silent souls. This is a very boring and typical movie with tons of off-screen snake attacks and bad performances from NOBODY actors. The only somewhat fun scene was an absolutely unnecessary and forced strip scene that has nothing you can not see in a PG13 rated movie, folks. If you're into snake movies, take a look at SSSSSSS, but do not torture yourself with that crap.
