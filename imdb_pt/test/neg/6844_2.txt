A movie theater with a horrible story of hideous murders reopens. Of course, the bloody deaths begin again. Written, directed, filmed, tagged and edited with an appalling lack of elegance and skill of the uniquely talented Rick Sloane (who later further disgraced the celluloid with the "Hobgoblins"), this horrific attempt to strike a couple of rotten coups in every imaginable way: the unbearably lethargic rhythm, painfully static and grainy cinematography (there is a stinking excess of monotonous master photos everywhere), an annoyingly monotonous and redundant synthesizer score, the (non) direction, a script boring and monotonous, low and indecisive sense of humor, murder without bloodshed, a woefully inadequate killer (he is just an old face wrinkled with a doughy makeup), the uniformly unpleasant and unpleasant. characters, an abruptly unpleasant ending, and lifeless performances from a remarkably uninspired cast, everyone asserts that watching this mess is as much fun and rewarding as eating raw rancid eels steeped in sour vinegar. This crud totally lacks the raw charm and despicable vigor needed to be a nice trash. Instead, it's just a hard, cumbersome, sinuous one that never catches fire or is even remotely entertaining in such a sloppy fashion that it's smoking. Only a tiny bit of nudity and the always trustful presence of Mary Woronov as a sardonic and sarcastic secretary provide a little relief to the general cruelty of this miserable loser.
