The cookie cutter starts working overtime in this obvious and unoriginal love story. The plot, as it is, was done before a trillion times, so there is no need to recount any of this. Suffice it to say that all 12 year old girls will love this movie while the rest of us will be forced to grimace. Even the soundtrack is horrible! It's not that I do not like to skate, although I do not like it, I do not like bad movies and clich√©s.
