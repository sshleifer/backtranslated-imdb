I was also the wife of an abusive husband, even though in my situation the attacks were psychological, not physical. He presented a very respectable, responsible and generous personality to anyone who saw us together, which, in contrast to myself, resulted in making others treat me as monotonous and unstable. Initially, I was so incredibly flattered that someone like Gus (who worked in a bank and was generously confident) even gave me the time of day, and I fell completely in love with his IDEA instead of the person he was. If I had my head in front, and got to know him a lot better first, there's no way I'm marrying him. However, this is my mistake. It was not my mistake to be abused. I did not deserve this, nor did I see it happen until I was involved in mental games, criticism, and isolation. He acted as if I had no business holding a different opinion from his - in fact he went further. If I did not agree, he supposed that I had misunderstood and increasingly simplified his words ... when I finally lost my self-respect, I was unable to recognize the situation in which I was and had to be shaken by reality. by external influence. My dad said Gus called me a bitch. Well ... it was still half a year before the anger that started at that moment finally exploded and I packed some things while he was at work, and I left. and it was still several months before I understood the fact that I had been abused and that it was not my fault that he was doing the things he did. ..... so please, someone who assumes the victim's guilt, THINK !!! If a dog is kicked by a cruel owner when, in an anxiety situation, he has an accident on the carpet, do you blame the puppy? when abuse in a relationship reaches an obviously violent level, the target of abuse has been so wounded and depersonalized (much like the Nazi concentration camps) that it is almost impossible to judge the circumstance accurately because the victim believes that all things horrible vomited by the aggressor. Have a heart, people. Labeling abuse victims as idiot idiots is like kicking someone who is already terribly beaten. -------> And this helps how?
