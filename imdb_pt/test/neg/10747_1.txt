The last sentence of this review is a big spoiler. <br /> <br /> I liked Joe Dante's work since Piranha. He made a lot of parodies of different genres, which were funny and honest. <br /> <br /> But that sucks. This is the kind of satire - in line with the Thank You For Smoking - that is so literal and straightforward that it leaves nothing to be ridiculed and b) let the public think. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, because the plot and the material are so rich, timely and ready for smart comments. <br /> <br /> By the way, there is absolutely no reason for the main character to film the character Ann Coulter at the end of the movie. It's just ridiculous.
