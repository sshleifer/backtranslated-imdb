That growl ... <br /> <br /> That scowl ... <br /> <br /> The acts of random violence ... <br /> <br /> The guttural voice ... /> <br /> Fetish wear ... <br /> <br /> That shaved head ... <br /> <br /> It can only mean one thing ... <br /> < > GRACE JONES IS BACK! <br /> <br /> In fact, my sources tell me that the title role in Blade was not interpreted by the 1980s diva, but by Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> This is not an improvement. <br /> <br /> Blade is an adaptation of a comic character; in some way, in the transfer of the simplistic and two-dimensional world of the printed page, has become even simpler and has lost some dimensions. <br /> <br /> The plot is banalized almost beyond belief and adds nothing to the vampire. genre, in fact, much like Nosferatu, seems to suck the lives of the public. In short, the moving up vampire wants to become more powerful, but it's against Blade, half human, half vampire, all annoying. Everything comes to a climax with Blade being put into a vampire juice, some bad martial arts and the most regrettable CGI since 1968. Blade has to be the least empathic character since the Punisher of Dolph Lundgren (also a comic adaptation). , maybe there's a trend here? Surely the audience must be on the same side as the 'hero'? And while a vampire can be a tragic character, this is not true for Blade, he is relentlessly ruthless, disdainful and not much better than the bad guys. <br /> <br /> I assume that Wesley Snipes has an 'actor career purely so that all others can be compared favorably. As he crawls through your movie, you find yourself looking for a stake - even a ballpoint pen - anything to put Blade in the grave. As a piece of narcissism, Blade is practically unbeatable - we are treated to endless photos of Snipes for no reason. Similarly, no other actor is allowed to give a reasonable performance; the likes of Steven Dorff * CAN * act, but they have to play second violin to Snipes' tedious performance. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson used to appear in good movies, here he is reduced to a companion who you just know will not move to the final reel. And what happens when Blade discovers? Yes, you guessed it, he rushes to the scene to inflict his revenge on the villain's giant underground lair. <br /> <br /> Why can not world domination take place in a quiet country house? They always go on in underground cathedrals that would have Albert Speer wondering if they were a little grandiose. Many of these plans could now be suspended if local councils paid more attention to plans to expand the basements. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is so monotonous and unimaginative, with nothing new to add to the genre. Vampires were killed and maybe they should rest a little - at least until someone can figure out some way to make them interesting again. <br /> <br /> To conclude, * IS * to Grace Jones's vampire movie is called Vamp and is ten times better than that.
