Ridiculous and nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; inept, superficial and condescending, scouring all the more banal clich√©s about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and middle age. The lead actor grimaces through the film, struggling to portray the self-congratulatory, self-congratulatory self-pity that the useless character and script calls for. I'm sure the book was bad, but it could not have been so bad! The camera is permanently equipped with a "Tuscan" yellow-Tuscan lens filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun was not Tuscan enough?), Which they forgot to remove when the scene changes to Rome and (how imaginative!) The Amalfi Coast . You've never seen the white marble of the Vittorio Emmanuelle monument in Rome look so yellow ... I mean, Tuscan. One of the worst movies of all time and therefore worth a look.
