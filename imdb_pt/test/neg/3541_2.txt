You think you've seen the worst movie in the world? Think again. The person who created the front cover of this box should be accused of misleading advertising. The cover makes it look like a suspense of good and scary terror. But not. What we have instead is the NIGHTSCREAM. A movie that makes a "sweeeoooowww !!" every time a credit flashes on the screen. The biggest name in the entire film is probably Casper Van Dien, who hardly has a part. <br /> <br /> I voted for one for this just because I could not vote for anything less. If I could vote for something like five thousand negatives, believe me, I would have. So for now, I'll give NIGHTSCREAM 1/2 * out of 5 just because it's over.
