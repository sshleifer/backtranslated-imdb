To call this film a complete waste of celluloid would be a euphemism. <br /> <br /> The acting was not convincing to say the least, especially from actor Craig Fong, who could not have acted harder. As far as history goes ... well ... what story ?! The "movie" is nominally about Harry Lee, a Malaysian of Chinese descent who returns to his native country after being disapproved in every direction he has made and tries to start a band. <br /> <br /> The movie has always been clich√©. you can think of - sex, tension between the band members and a bit of racial tension. The problem is that even with a subject that was approached properly even by the most amateur directors, the film is everywhere and the whole thing seems complicated, with parts that would leave even the hair of the most critics hard standing. <br /> <br />
