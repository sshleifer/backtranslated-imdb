Laughable. <br /> <br /> Clich√©. <br /> <br /> Overdose in style to compensate for poor writing. <br /> <br /> Remember when MTV actually used to stream music videos and other programs beyond Reality shows? Aeon Flux (2005) is based on one of these shows ?? a cartoon from the mid 90's? featuring a superhuman female protagonist in black latex clothing. Aeon, played by the lovely Charlize Theron in this adaptation, is a cool rebel who is as skilled as a line dancer and as deadly as a snake-snake. It needs to be, if it is expected to kick the asses of totalitarian rule. <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but I hate the sudden flow of overdose films of futuristic mid-buttress dystopian technology like The Island (2005). ) and Equilibrium (2002) (bottom of the stack). Aeon Flux has all the problems that are present in these movies, but amplified. That is, there is nothing original to show, so they compensate for this with the elegant style that Matrix (1999) catalyzed. The special effects are therefore sensational in Aeon Flux, which gives him some points but scratches the surface and literally there is nothing there. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, all the performances in this movie are atrocious and some really hurt me to watch. The character of Charlize Theron, Aeon Flux, is intertwined with the weirdest tough dog and it seems that the director Karyn Kusama can not decide where to go with her next? should it make her more detached or more emotional? She does not know! Let's go both ways! Imagine you taking a shotgun, loading it full of character developments of different types and shooting into a random mess. This is the Aeon Flux character. The Aeon Flux film presents all the 'obligatory' ideas in a dystopian society - individual versus society, nature versus science, emotion against cold reason, etc. You've seen all this before and done better. Go read Orwell, Bradbury or Huxley, or even watch Logan's Run (1976) or Blade Runner (1982) ... anything! Avoid this cheese festival, which does not get complicated, for as long as you can. <br /> <br /> 3/10
