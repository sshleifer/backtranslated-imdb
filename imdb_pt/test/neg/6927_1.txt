I really wanted to love this movie. I read the book for my daughters and we all love it. The book is wonderful. This movie is a long way from the book. The book is splendid - this movie is a horrible adaptation. <br /> <br /> In the book, Sara is honest, kind, strong and NEVER does anything spiteful to receive someone. That's the point of the book! It behaves like "princes" regardless of the circumstances. An important part of behaving like a princess is not to return to rudeness. It is to behave honorably regardless of how you are being treated. <br /> <br /> In the book, it supports a lot and touches the lives of others. Other people change their behavior after witnessing their gentleness and ability to endure without sinking into spite and revenge. Sara does what is right, simply because she is right. Outside the bakery, she finds a beggar who is poorer and hungrier than she is. She has half a dozen warm breads. She is very hungry. She gives a coke to this wild-looking little girl curled up at the bakery door. When she sees how the girl is hungry and watches her devour the bread, she gives him another. She keeps doing this until she's given 3 or 4 - I do not remember how many. <br /> <br /> The baker is looking out the window. She is so moved by what she witnessed, she takes the beggar and bears her as her own daughter. Other people are influenced in the same way by Sara. <br /> <br /> And in the book, her father died. The man next door is his father's partner - he's looking for her. His father did not lose his money after all - the man is happy to find Sara; he takes her and Becky to his home and he creates them as his daughters. And Sara has her full inheritance, of course. <br /> <br /> Miss Minchin is not a chimney sweeper. In fact, she stays in her same position at school. But she is humiliated when Sara told her new guardian of the cruel treatment she received. And Sara talks to Miss Minchin at the end - Miss Minchin is trying to downplay her treatment of Sara and Sara in a calm and steady demeanor, instructing Miss Minchin that she had been cruel. <br /> <br /> There is no punishment for Miss Minchin. It continues in your miserable existence. It does not matter - what matters is that Sara has a home with a guardian who loves her - and her best friend in the world, Becky, is now for all purposes, her sister. <br /> <br /> The book is about love and honorable behavior under the worst circumstances. It's about self-control and humility. It's a wonderful book. This movie does nothing to capture the true story and messages of the book. My wife was so upset about this, she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to stay out. We were not rewarded. <br /> <br /> I can not, for my life, think of a reason the movie does to change this excellent book in such a bad direction. Perhaps it was the influence of the ghastly script of the book in which Shirley Temple acted. I do not know - but this movie is so far from the book in character and values ​​that I do not recognize it. <br /> Do not waste your time - buy the book. It's unforgettable ... even for a father!
