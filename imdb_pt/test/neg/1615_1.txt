Greetings; <br /> <br /> I never thought I'd see the day I'd be so disgusted with A movie that would be a burden to end it ... I've always been a fan of horror movies, B 'C and C included. But in this case it is difficult to describe how a film can fail to qualify for any letter on that scale ... The film is centered on a later well-developed story, a mixture of folklore with taste. And, on top of that, the performance of the actors is questionable. Horror B movies usually fall into two categories ... 1) A gem that was under looked, and under funded 2) So bad it's funny, laugh or your money back. Well, this movie falls in the middle. I was not scared, do not laugh ... So I think if you really need to see, you can, but I recommend that you do not ...
