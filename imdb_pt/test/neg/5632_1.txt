This movie was pure junk. Not the worst movie ever. If it was to be broken, the acting was good enough to do the job, but the script was so there and so stupid that it was left thinking, "Where has my life gone?" Even Vanessa Redgrave ~ whom I love (and that's the reason I watched it) was wasted. Totally wasted. She did not even make an impression. The direction was so far that none of the characters left me much of anything, but to see Redgrave left nothing. His part was nothing. She was good as an evil boss, but that was it. Take depth and she gave depth to small roles - see Venus and Atonement. I was not going to waste my time and was annoyed at having spent the $ 5 in this movie ... I wanted it back. No returns. Skip the movie. This will only bring you pain ... and boredom.
