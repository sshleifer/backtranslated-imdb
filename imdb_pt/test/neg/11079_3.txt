A group of speleologists with a sad story leads an author to a "hairy" adventure through an unknown cave in Kazakhstan. In these times of remakes and sequels and movie companies trying to profit from any winning combination of cinematic components, The Cavern has only had a relatively different turnaround in the past eight cave movies in recent years, and this turnaround seems to be drawn from an X file. I like to give each movie the benefit of the doubt, but there were lots of little bugs for me here. Camera work can cause headaches as they seem to constantly confuse the way. Not being a caver, I do not really care if the footage was realistic. There are many unnecessary PANNICK of allegedly experienced beaters, until the last half you are saying out loud one of two things? Oh shut up and focus on saving yourself, or I hope you all die in the end. It must have been very tiring for these decent actors to make that movie. A moderate amount of blood and nothing special in dialogue or characters. While you're pretty confident you know what's happening in the end, the last five minutes explain every detail. But I would have a better opinion of the film if they had left the last minute on the cutting room floor. It just was not necessary. I suggest that you tap eject immediately after your suspicions have been confirmed and save the sequel configuration. I have long thought that the film industry should share the payment scheme of a modified restaurant industry. You pay for the materials to make the movie before entering, but any profit for the movie comes from the tips you give when you leave the movie. I can not blame what I do not like about this movie on its low budget.
