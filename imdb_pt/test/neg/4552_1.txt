Okay, let's start by saying that when a Dutch movie is bad, it's VERY BAD. There is rarely anything with a bit of quality (Lek, Karakter) here in Holland, but not often. Coast! is about 4 girls going to Spain to go on holiday, party, getting drunk, sex (you know what to do). It is also about the world of Clubbers or Proppers. Pro's who are trying to lure the crowd into their club. <br /> <br /> I do not know how long it took to write the script, but I suspect something between 15 minutes and 20 minutes because you're watching a bunch of random scenes for 90 minutes in length. Nothing, and I want to say nothing is believable in this movie. It's almost too ridiculous for words what happens to the plot. Suddenly, the movie turns into a kind of karate action. With a face-to-face fight with 'the bad guy in black' and cliche scenes of car chase through a water car (can be more tacky). Also the words character development and cast are not familiar to creators. After having seen "Traffic" three days before that, I fell from pure brightness, from a work of art to that. This is making movies, it's sadder. And do not start on a low budget. Because even with a low budget, you can write a better script. It almost seems like the filmmakers were too busy having fun to make a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the cubs in the water eventually invented a little, but for the rest, Do not waste your money on such crap.
