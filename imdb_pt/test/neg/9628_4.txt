I really did not hate Mirrormask. I really wanted more of a movie than beautiful visuals. The film begins with a young woman named Helana who works in a circus. But while other children (supposedly) want to escape to the circus, she just wants to escape the circus. During a heated argument with her mother, Helana wished she would fall dead. Bad move. The mother gets sick with ... something (presumably cancer) and needs surgery. The night before surgery, she dreams that she travels to a wonderful world made up of her dreams and nightmares, where she "finds herself." Personally, the movie deceived me as soon as she started dreaming. The opening scenes show the strange and wonderful world of the circus and then contrast it with the hospital's desolation and the grime of an apartment building. But as soon as she dreams, the whole movie shifts to the CGI, where almost everything is a computer image. The problem is that this dream world lacks the mystery and admiration it should have. while movies like the Wizard of Oz seemed attractive to explore Mirrormask pushes images into our faces and then snatches them to give us another image. There is little or no reason for the design of this film, and although some things are very beautiful (the librarian is a masterpiece) they just disappear so quickly that they are soon forgotten. Helana and her boyfriend Sidekick are annoying at best and unbearable at worst. Overall Mirrormask is such a beautiful stake that you bite and discover that it is actually gray. Stick to real world kids.
