Predictable, bloody, super-enigmatic, mediocre. Do not waste time - there are many better movies out there. The resurrection begins well, but the plot quickly becomes repetitive. My interest level dropped steadily. By the end of the movie I was happy to finally be finished. The characters have never been fully developed. Cinematography is muddy and the rapid POV rotations - though impressive in 1999, perhaps, currently serve only to label the film as an attempt to replace the flash with content and substance of the character. Film tricks serve some purpose (they transmit tension and anxiety), but they are constantly overused and end up becoming counterproductive. A general shame - the film / story obviously had potential and the producers / directors and actors obviously had technical ability. A disappointment.
