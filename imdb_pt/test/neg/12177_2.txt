If this movie were in English, all the critics would have discarded that. The language is extremely bad, the scenes are terribly directed and not funny at all. After the movie, I thought that this movie could have been written by an 8th grade student, at least if you consider the lack of believable characters and fixation on certain parts of the male body. (oh, in dogs too ...) The story is simply absurd compared to the more mature Vingar av glas that debuts almost at the same time. Of course the audience chose Jalla! Jalla! while the Vingar av glas received little attention. <br /> <br /> What was really disturbing to me was the fact that the movie looked really bad. This is probably due to the fact that director Josef Fares, for the first time, used really cheap camera equipment and decided to play with it, for fun, I suppose. The result, however, is a film that can be easily divided into 12 short films with a new style of direction in each of them. This was very frustrating. Maybe Josef Fares should have stayed with his short films, since this seems to be the only art form he can master. <br /> <br /> Another worrying fact is that history does not hold up. On several occasions in the middle of the movie, the story has to move very quickly and the characters come across each other in a way that is simply unbelievable. <br /> <br /> And so I did not mention the two-dimensional characters, especially those in the supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Although I consider this one of the worst Swedish films of the 1990s, and also one of the most overrated, it is understandable that the audience likes it. I mean, bad taste has always been the hallmark of the masses ... <br /> <br /> I'm more surprised that critics have liked it. They should have known better ... <br /> <br /> Grade 2 of 10 <br /> <br />
