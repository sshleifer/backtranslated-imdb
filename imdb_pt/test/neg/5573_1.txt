I see that most of the comments so far have been positive, if not overly positive, at least positive. I can not understand it. The only explanation I can find is that the people who commented had something to do with the movie, because this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This makes "Boggy Creek II" and "Mutant" look like masterpieces of terror. The acting is unstable at best and horrible for the most part. The whole movie is almost dark, probably so they could film everything in the same place. The monster looks like something from one of Roger Corman's worst movies. And the plot ... well, the less said about it, the better. <br /> <br /> One to avoid at all costs.
