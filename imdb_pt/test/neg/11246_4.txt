... this is not worth the cost of a movie ticket. What these filmmakers did can not be called cinema; instead, they chose sixteen students of some diversity (though not as diverse as the revisions suggested) and released them. The results are, to be brutally frank, much more boring, self-indulgent, exaggerated, and out of the realm than really insightful. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, moments of type recognition and identification. is only possible in the documentary, but in general there is not much more truth here than in "Bully" or, moreover, a decent TV documentary of the same type. Though full of conversations about sex and sexual diversity and racism, the film brings nothing to the table that would be useful to anyone who has thought about any of these matters with any seriousness. And while certain segments serve absolutely no purpose other than injecting some comic relief (admittedly welcome), most often the five-minute limit prevents you from getting emotionally involved with any of the students. An interesting idea, but thumbs down for CHAIN ​​CHAIN.
