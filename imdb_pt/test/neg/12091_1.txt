***** SPOILERS ********* <br /> <br /> This movie was really horrible. This woman deceives her employers from the beginning and then goes on selfishly to separate them. In the end, you see her making a profession out of the craft she learned from her "pupil"'s father. I put the student in quotes because the housekeeper never seems to teach the child anything. She seems to hate her and can not stand being around her. I felt sorry for the little girl who simply wanted to be loved, absent from it, it was understandable that she would say and do outrageous things just to get attention, but the viewer should not sympathize with the little girl, the viewer should sympathize with the housekeeper who hated her ward and manipulated and deceived their employers. I simply could not. This was not the story of a self-made woman, but rather it was a window into the mind of someone who uses others at every opportunity, with no other thought for anyone outside of their own family. I could not stand the housekeeper! This was a really horrible movie. I only paid a dollar to rent it, but even that was too much!
