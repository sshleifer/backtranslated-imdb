I remember this movie with pure feelings. . . agony. More than half of the movie is commercial (no, actually!). The slight excuse for a story could easily have been told in 25 minutes (and it almost is!) The end result is a prefabricated love story of predictable schlocks, all obviously thrown together in a blatant attempt to buy a few more bucks of the season . Debbie Boone was right. Yes, that's how it was produced ... the song that "inspired" was still great on the charts when the movie was released! <br /> <br /> Despite decades of bad movies, this one still impresses me. by his extravagant, barrier-free and impetuous leap in the most tedious, absurd and indelible cinematic wickedness. He really deserves to be on the IMDb list of the worst 100 of all time, and never left the top 3 on my "worst" personal list. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the pure masochistic emotion!
