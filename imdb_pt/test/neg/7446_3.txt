I recently got all three Robocop movies in a box set, very cheap and the only reason I did this was for the first special edition superb. I've seen Robocop 2 before but not for 17 years, the year it came out. I've never watched since then because I still remember how disappointed I was when I discovered how horrible it really is. It's a complete mess, really, it has all the signs of a problematic production with so many sub-plots happening at the same time. It has a very uneven tone too and it is also one of the most unpleasant movies I have ever seen. I do not mind a bit of violence, the first one was incredibly violent, but this one is simply unpleasant. Also, SFX is terrible even for 1990, say hello to bad stop motion. Also having a drug trafficking, cursing the kid like a villain is a little too much. Peter Weller at least had the good sense not to return to the next. The only positive thing I can say for this movie is that it has some good jokes like the thank you for not smoking one and the kids baseball team robbing an electricians shop. To quote the child who plays the villain "It sucks"
