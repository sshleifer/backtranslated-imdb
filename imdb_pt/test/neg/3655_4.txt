The guy mentioned to process the lost 1.5 hours of his life, I can not disagree on that. The film began as a sort of class project and ended up in a dark room. whenever the girls were totally naked, magically light was everywhere, I know I do not write the script or I have something to say about it. But this is like a bad remake copy with a bad ending. Think of a man who actually wrote this story, sick. This is really a shocking movie I can not say it is terror because it is not. It's just brutality and violence that made me sick. It's really frustrating to watch an unfinished movie, it's like a bang in your face. the movie is ready now you can go home. <br /> <br /> Cons -cam -lighting (althrue I think it was supposed to) -overcoming -sickening <br /> <br /> Cons-real in your face -acting was good in my opinion -it sucks you in. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is not my taste of film the witer wanted us to know that these things happen, and the man wrote his own fantasy. If you have seen the movies have you seen it? They all had a moment of comfort in something to hold on to. This one ? do not. Maybe it's just me, I'm too soft, but this movie made me tremble, and the story is short, the sick man kills the girls slowly. But the actors sucked you in this movie with every blow of every scream you could almost feel. <br /> <br /> And to be honest, I was quick to judge about this, is it a terrible movie? No, it's not. is an exaggerated example of reality, this is as real as it could be. But do not watch this movie if you expect a great mystery or a real plot, or even some kind of story. the man picks up girls in a dark room and kills them one by one, that's right.
