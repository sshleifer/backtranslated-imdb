I'm starting to wonder if all these PG-13 horror movies are just glorified screen tests for young emerging talent. Get a first-time screenwriter, an inexperienced director, some TV actors looking for a great break and see what they can do. 'When a Stranger Calls' is a bit better than most recent offers, but it's still completely by-book; full of holes and genre cliches. <br /> <br /> The story is unbelievably simplistic. The meager 87-minute race time is filled with inconsequential friends and a nonsensical cheater boyfriend. The killer is devoid of even the symbolic motivation of Jason or Michael or even the original movie killer and as a result, it is never particularly scary. The police behave so incredibly inefficient and lazy that it borders on professional misconduct. Simon West brings the same compelling banality to the procedures he did with Lara Croft, but his style of driving is decidedly generic, lacking in talent indicators or real vision. The performances are routine, the dark corridors replace genuine horror, and the scares are of the tired variety of cat-in-the-closet. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and production design, however, are above average for this type of scene. movie. The house is beautifully designed, all dark wood and vitreous reflections, and there are some moments that are of visual interest. <br /> <br /> Although it lacks a bit of dramatic originality, it acts as a reasonably satisfying dark house. 'thriller, and holds more interest than most of his laia.
