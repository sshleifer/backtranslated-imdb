Well, I have to admit that this movie brought some occasional laughter to my face. Okay, but that does not make it a good movie. Most of the characters are terrifying and truly unconvincing stereotypes. Not all of them give great performance performances, but some actually try, but fail because their characters are poorly written. The perfect example is Julia Koschitz: she changes her eating habits from one conversation to another, in one conversation she does not drink alcohol the next she is allergic to champagne, she feels too pretty for most people (actually she is) but still ends up with the "perfect" fit for looks, and refuses to give some more "realistic" guys a chance, and so on ... The ending is very tacky, although I like one of the final scenes, when everyone finally stops talking and the director gives us a chance to catch our breath again. Shoppen is basically a movie that offers some cheap laughs (mostly because it's about sex and relationships, I suppose) and maybe a bit of entertainment. Still, the whole picture is a great stereotype and nothing is really special about it.
