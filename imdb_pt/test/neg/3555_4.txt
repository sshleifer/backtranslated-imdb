The performance in this film was old school: tacky and tough. Irene Dunne is bright and is the best, despite having some unnatural words to say. Still, his ability to convey emotion comes through. <br /> <br /> Old moviegoers will find at least some redeeming qualities in this film through watching the cinematic technique of the 1930s. Otherwise, it's not really that well worth it.
