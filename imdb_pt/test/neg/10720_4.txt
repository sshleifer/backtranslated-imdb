Unfortunately, this is not as good as any of the other films that Jim Carrey (producer and actor) and Brian Grazer worked together on, but some of them are definitely worth laughing about. Basically, Dick Harper (Carrey) thinks he's being promoted to a better job. That's until the Dynocorpe company sinks and closes. Now Dick and his wife Jane (TÃ©a Leoni) and their son, of course, are in trouble with money. No matter what they try, they can not raise the kind of money they really want. So they start stealing some places. And then they decide to steal the guy who put Dick, his former boss Jack McAllister (Alec Baldwin). I think the most laughable parts are when Carrey is in the elevator singing "I Believe, I Can Fly" and the moment he ties someone up in a robbery, and is talking to a voice changer (he sounds like a robot). OK!
