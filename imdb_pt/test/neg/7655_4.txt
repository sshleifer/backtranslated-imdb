The second woman is about the story of a mysterious man who lost his wife in an accident and now believes that someone wants to hurt him. A girl who likes him wants to help him, but she is led to believe that her fears are caused by a mental illness ... Interesting plot, very good acting, but the result as a everything is bad in many ways. The story is very simplistic, or rather presented in a simplistic way (although there are some interesting twists). For example, people say they love each other after just two meetings. I do not want to reveal anything else, but you'll see what I mean by watching the movie. "Come on, it was the fifty!", You may think. However, I have seen some movies from that era and I know that some do not seem so dated these days. <br /> <br /> Something that bothered me was that some scenes were shot, making it almost impossible. to watch what was happening. Okay, it's a noir movie but this is very noir in some spots ...: o) <br /> <br /> In general, the Second Woman is not a masterpiece of the time, but neither is it rubbish. See if you have nothing else to do ...
