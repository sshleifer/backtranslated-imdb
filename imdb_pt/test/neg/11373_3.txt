I gave a note of 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> And what is sad is that I made a point of looking for the schedule of the film so that I did not miss seeing it. I wanted to watch this movie because it is based on a book by one of my favorite authors, Barbara Wilson. As a lesbian, I expected to love this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know how Mrs. Wilson felt about the movie, but I found it a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> It should have been intriguing - it was a mystery - established in Spain, and the main character, Cassandra, is a linguistic translator who is contacted by a mysterious and beautiful woman who offers Cassandra a large sum of money to locate her ex-husband, Ben. <br /> <br /> There are secrets in abundance revealed, but for some reason, it does not matter. It was like, oh, so what? I could not get involved with these characters, nor care about them, or feel for them. I could not even identify with these characters. <br /> <br /> I think a big part of the failure of the film was the actress playing the main character. She looked old, tired, worn, and as dull as tap water. Her hair was a perpetual mess, her loose clothes were flat, and she just was not attractive or interesting. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie was listening to a recording of Dean Martin, but even that was ruined. by the strange makeup worn by the man who danced and dubbed the music. Believe me - it was nothing like seeing the handsome and gentle Mr. Martin playing him. <br /> <br /> The end is so tasty that you would want to have some pancakes to accompany the syrup. <br /> <br />
