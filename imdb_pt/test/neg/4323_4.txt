Lon Chaney Jr returns to the wood while the mummy Kharis seeks his mate, Annanka, whose soul now resides in the beautiful host of the descending Amina (Ramsay Ames). Andoheb, High Priest of Arkan (George Zucco) leaves Yousef Bey (John Carradine) in charge of Kharis to continue his evil ways. Tom (Robert Lowery) must find a way to save his beloved Amina from the future terror of the mummies. <br /> <br /> The routine and predictable introduction in the Kharis series proves that almost all films follow a specific format / formula. The city is threatened by a slender, one-armed, masked wrapping corpse that appears to have been endowed with superhuman power to stifle the lives of capable men who are relatively easily restrained by a mere strangling of Kharis. Frank Reicher, who saw Kharis in action ... and knows a lot about Egyptian history ... in the previous film (The Mummy's Tomb), proves that anyone who survived an earlier encounter with the mummy will surely die if he returns in the next movie. Well produced, but it lacks originality that would differ from the other films in the series. Unfortunately, Carradine dreams of her role as evil Yousef Bey. An embarrassing error in the script has Kharis, who is known to use a crippled and crippled arm, carrying an unconscious Amina with both arms over long distances with no ill effects. One aspect, the shocking climax in which Tom's attempt at heroism does not go according to plan, while Kharis holds her hostage as a damsel in distress, takes the film out of the lull.
