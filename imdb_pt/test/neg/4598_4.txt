About twenty years ago, Charles Bukowski was one of my heroes. I blindly accepted the image created by intellectual types and seen in several films. Of course I never got to know the intellectual types who prescribed Bukowski as a hero. They could usually be found safely behind the video stores and record stores. These people hardly spoke, and when they asked, they usually mocked and nodded in some vague direction. They were useless when it came to locating a specific title, but their shelves were always filled with strange and unique titles. To be introduced into the modern and secret club, I believed that I had to get rid of my bourgeoisie and adopt counter-culture. <br /> <br /> My introduction to Bukowski began with the movie Barfly, the 80s movie that starred Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunnaway. I was a Rourke fan at the time. He also incorporated a kind of fantastic modern male anti-hero, a thoughtful intellectual type. At the time, it attracted me. The Barfly hero scoffed at the convention. A mid-thirties vagabond, who lives life without ties, does not respond to anyone, - Oh - and to be recognized as a genius by a female literary snob, the icing on the cake. Later, I read Post-Office and Hollywood, being Bukowski later assuming his experience with the film. Now, let me move on to the most recent film based on Bukowski's book, Factotum, which I read and enjoyed. Bukowski takes the form of Chinaski in this novel. I often wonder where Bukowski ended and Chinaski started. 20 years after Barfly, the fictional film Bukowski is still the same. I watched about an hour from the movie and I still see signs of cracks in the facade. That is why Factotum Bukowski was my hero. Chinaski is handsome (played by Matt Dillon). He has clean, stylized hair, but not on top. When Dillon smokes and writes, he looks cool. Chinaski goes from job to job, ignoring and / or struggling with various bosses. He screws two floozies, one of which he lives with, leaves, only to return with little rebound. Chinaski is his own man and we never see him cram. He is a sterile, one-dimensional, 30-year-old archetype of James Dean. Factotum lies to the viewer. He does this by haranguing the idea of ​​a man (a writer) without consequences. A poor man who suffers for his art. What could be cooler than that? Now let us say that there are some truths in the Factotum, in which events occurred. What is lacking to the public is the pain that hides Chinaski's existence. Perhaps the goal of this movie, and most movies, is that for 80 minutes we need to escape the world that is full of consequences, pain and indirect problems with an antisocial womanizer who smokes, talks, drinks with her cold-blooded boyfriend. The one who rejects the conventional behavior of work and family. My hero used to be the movie Bukowski. Long ago, this would have worked. It was easier then. Now, I still have to claim a hero. Things are not so easy. Hipster logic and film renderings of counter-culture icons do not offer solutions or even ask questions.
