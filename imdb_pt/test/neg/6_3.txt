A difficult sale: British playwright Ronald Harwood adapts his autobiographical drama to a high-profile film about the Shakespearean theater troupe of World War II sealed by a bright but unreliable star at the end of his career. The actor's effete assistant works diligently to get his master coiffed and costumed for a production of "King Lear" (during an air raid!), But both men are losing control over their unraveling situation. Based on the final years of actor Donald Wolfit, whose dresser was Ronald Harwood, this acclaimed production seems to be a welcome refuge for the actors who like to dine on them. Unfortunately, Albert Finney (at this point in his career, not at all old) seems very robust and quick to play the actor; Finney (and Oscar-nominated director Peter Yates) can not modulate Sir's moods and coherences in a way that makes sense to us, so that in one scene he's stopping a train with the imposing echo of his voice and, in the next, curiously falling apart. With such a shipwreck of a human being in the midst of ill health and aptitude, one would assume that a dedicated assistant would make great efforts to protect his boss (and his future), but servant Tom Courtenay nudges and badger and urges Finney to charge instead of resting. Courtenay, who played that role onstage (and was nominated for an Oscar alongside Finney for Best Actor), is much more in tune with his role, and in the end his commands and confusion of ballads reach the only real feeling in the film. These two, fortunately, do not bite each other's head, and the set designer Harwood takes care not to fall into a pattern of love and hate (which could be perceived in the first act of the film); but without a juxtaposition of servant versus celebrity, there is not much more to contemplate in this portrait, except for the deterioration of narcissism, the hint of what has already been. * 1/2 of ****
