I did not understand! The teenager takes on "Horror Star", supposedly all are devoted terror fans, but when his favorite idol (Conrad Radzoff) dies, they unearth his corpse and do all sorts of disrespectful things with him, like dancing at home and throwing remains of food in it. Does not that sound like something the real horror fans would do now? I am a big horror fan and I love immensely deceased icons like Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Boris Karloff, but it never occurred to me to ridicule his memory. Is not it any wonder Conrad comes back from the dead? admittedly, after a session? to cleanse them all from the face of the earth! Mr. Radzoff was no longer known for his friendship in life, since he occasionally killed the directors who disagreed with his visions, and even after his death he suffers from a tremendous ego. Even inside his tomb there are video messages to petrify potential visitors and the group of teenagers will experience that he also enjoys the business of killers off their sets. "Horror Star" (also known as "Frightmare" and "Body Snatchers") is a very lame horror movie from the 1980s, but there are a handful of rude and cruel highlights to enjoy. The film suffers mostly from its own stupid plot, since no one? not even a film student? He's stupid enough to steal a buried corpse recently, and he really thinks he's going to get away with it, and there are many tedious times to overcome. Conrad's video speeches beyond the grave are overly talkative and definitely undercut the tension, but on the other hand, his methods of killing are pleasantly inventive. One teenager likes the experience of being cremated alive and another (Jeffrey Combs in one of his first roles!) Loses his head in a delicious decapitation sequence. In the most disjointed sequence, a poor girl's head is crushed by a coffin. Writer / director Norman Thaddeus Vane wanted to pay tribute to the vintage horror film and obviously how to make the film look sinister. The venues and settings are great, but Vane did not have the funds to provide the film with adequate continuity and editing. Performance performances are generally decent, with Ferdy Mayne (imitating Christopher Lee) and Jeffrey Combs making the roles more memorable. "Horror Star" can hardly be called a must-see movie or even good, but it pays to be followed if you're a fan of B-Horror enthusiastically.
