For the first time in the review of films, I was immediately disinterested in this story. I do not know if it was the way it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but I felt bland, overused and completely unoriginal. In the first thirty minutes, I found myself quite apathetic with all the characters and the story. I felt as if I had seen this structure before, and Tart was not providing anything new to surprise me. After thinking that it may just be my mood, I stopped the movie and decided to start it in the morning, but the same feeling persisted. I just did not care. That's not a good sign. The characters were bland. When I say bland, I literally mean that as you watch them develop, you will never have any taste on your palate. The story seemed recycled, almost to the point of plagiarism. Now, I'm not saying that Christina Wayne stole this story, but she did not add anything new to the prospect. The cast was horrible, the underlying symbolism and themes were so lost that no critic could find them (or the characters), and the stories were vague and sloppy. You did not know anything about anyone or anything and instead of giving more emphasis to the characters, instead we came across drugs, smaller sex and money shoved in our faces. These are themes that we have seen in all the movies since the beginning of the film era, but that somehow could not be captured creatively by Wayne. <br /> <br /> What immediately pushed me away from this story? It was mainly the characters. I've seen most of the work of Brad Renfro, and honestly he needs to redefine himself. Director Larry Clark has defined it, and strangely, he can not get out of this stereotyped character. In the first twenty minutes of Renfro's screen time, I was bored. I knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why. It was neither spectacular nor impressive, just repetitive. He needed to bring some excitement or suspense to his role, instead of just gently playing this random socialite. Without a strong character, the final climax of this movie comes as a disappointment. Renfro did not show the best of his abilities in this film. While I'm on the subject? no one made the best of their abilities. What's happening to Dominique Swain, out of Lolita, I do not believe she really emerged as an actress, and tracking roles like Cat Storm does not help. Bijou Phillips was the only actress I witnessed really try to bring something remarkable to the screen, unfortunately, due to the horrible performance of everyone else, she was lost. Rambling here and there, and honestly almost forgotten during the second act. Melanie Griffith was a nonsensical cast and most of the film's budget was probably for her two scenes in which she was. Maybe the rest went to the random guy from The Kids in the Hall, who desperately needs to get away from it. project. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem, out of action, was the rhythm of this movie. Nothing, and that's hard for me to say, but nothing fits. There were so many sub-stories going on throughout the film that no real substance was formed. The assaults, the adolescent anguish, the rich socialites learning how real life is horrible, the random kid Kids in the Hall, and by the end, they seemed rushed and horribly edited together. With this crappy craft, the whole story never really formed a true shape. Family structures have never been defined, the characters have never received any emotion, and all that remains is fragments of honest remains. Wayne did not complete the task at hand. <br /> <br /> Although I hate putting all the burden on the director, with this movie I do not have much choice. With a horrible title that just screamed the opposite of what this movie was, with amateur directional ability, the cast was practically able to give every emotion in every scene, leaving us with disgusting acting and poor developments, and with a vague narrative is hard to put any "good" behind Tart. This was a movie that I had not heard anything about, and after seeing this I can see why. All Wayne did with this movie is to randomly pick out snippets of other movies that did a better job at setting all the above elements and cutting them all together to make the Tart movie. It's hard for me to say that, but Wayne ruined this movie. Although I do not believe there is much to take out of history, all the remaining elements of excitement were drained when Wayne took over. While most of the time you can credit a bit of history, maybe a strong performance, or even the music, in Tart you can not credit anything. From the opening sequence to the end, I felt like I was swimming in very irregular oatmeal. No consistency, no strength. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a waste of time. If you are looking for some deep symbolic elements or possibly some joke in our society, you will not find it in this movie. While I know that was what Wayne was trying to show, the final product looks like it was edited in an Etch-a-Sketch. It was an embarrassing film to sit on and encourage anyone to pick it up. Wayne threw to the wind all the teachings of his education at Columbia University and destroyed two hours of my life. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Grade: * out of *****
