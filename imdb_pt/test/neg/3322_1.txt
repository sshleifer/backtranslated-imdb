I'm not usually inclined to write reviews about movies that I do not think deserve to be mentioned. But in the quest to grow as a writer and film critic, I feel it is important to express my thoughts when I do not like a movie. "Queen of the Damned" is one of those films. <br /> <br /> Anne Rice's popular horror stories about Lestat, a bisexual Vampire, first hit the screen in 1994, in the hit "An Interview with a Vampire." Starring two of Hollywood's greatest heavyweights in Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, the elegant aesthetic and mise en gothic scene of the film won the audience. Although it may have been a case of style over substance, there was something about it that worked, despite its appetite (I've never been so enamored with the genre Vampire in general). <br /> <br /> Since that time Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise have gone to much bigger things. It is likely that both of them laughed when asked to appear in a sequel. They would have laughed even more when they saw the end result. "Queen of the Damned" typifies the kind of cr * p that Hollywood is happy to launch at low cost in the hope of earning a quick buck thanks to an average soundtrack and a great marketing campaign targeting people aged 13 to 17 years. /> <br /> Needless to say, this movie is terrible from the start. Lestat, now played by Brit Stuart Townsend of the fame of "Shooting Fish", awakens from his dark pit to the sound of ... you guessed it, Nu-Metal. He freaks out some confused punk musicians and joins the band, with the proviso that he only appears at night, with the sun burning his skin and all day long ... <br /> <br /> Jesse (Marguerite Moreau) , a student who studies the paranormal, tries to find out if Lestat really is who he claims to be. Along the way, she falls in love with him (something to do with her strange past), but has a little competition in the queen Akasha (Aaliyah), a vampire demon queen who is coming back from the underworld to acquire Lestat as his chosen king. The film is shamefully self-indulgent, but its exaggerated tone leaves some room for its derogatory mood. Anyone who sees this movie for anything but a good laugh needs to see more movies in general! Watching Townsend is pleasant. He knows that the role is totally exaggerated and does what he can to walk the tightrope between full and serious acting. The late Aaliyah is, unfortunately, terrible in the title role. She has a minimum of screentime, and what she has, she does not use to the fullest. Poor makeup and special effects do not help; sometimes it sounds like you're talking through a voice box. <br /> <br /> There are rumors that this movie was heading straight for the video until Aaliyah's untimely death last year. With the chance that people will see their latest movie, Warner Bros. has released it for a general release. Otherwise, this would have been one of those movies you see on the shelves of video stores, but avoid because you can say that it will just be terrible. <br /> <br /> No doubt movies like this will continue to be made. Watch the flood of teen rom-with rip offs or the spoofing of the genre itself with films like "Not Another Teen Movie." If there is a market to explore, Hollywood will. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have with this movie is not the movie itself. Hollywood is about making money, so if there is a market for this movie, they will get it. That's business. But what worries me the most is that people will actively go to the movies and pay to watch it! I think this is the biggest argument in the world of cinema: first is the cinematographic art and the second, or is it the other way around? The only people who can decide this is the audience. If you like and are intrigued by good movies, stay away from that turkey.
