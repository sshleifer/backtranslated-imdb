Before proceeding, I have to admit that I only saw the first episode of this program. If I had time, I might have considered watching it every week, even if only to see how the season unfolded. However, it has been very clear to me from the start that Martha Stewart's version of "The Apprentice" simply does not "fit". Martha Stewart has made a career of being a happy housewife, a domestic diva of the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Julia Child. It was only from his scandalous legal problems and subsequent incarceration that his public image began to reflect the true harshness of his character. Of course, she's been convincing for a while, and this whole series raises the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in business. Does it have to come out cold and hard? Should not? <br /> <br /> But the truth is that when Stewart was released from prison, his public return attempts, though certainly justified, would never gain the interest of viewers for long. Maybe a real payback would have worked if she had come home peacefully and waited a year after her often ridiculed ankle bracelet was removed. Instead, she frantically went overkill with 2 sets at the same time, the other being her Martha syndicated day series, much like her old but more mainstream show with famous guests like Bette Midler. Of course, even at its peak, Stewart has never been mainstream, so it's too much to ask the American public to immediately accept his foray into the reality show. Maybe America wants Stewart to come back on her own, instead of being the basis for it. <br /> <br /> The program was basically a tired retread from Trump's "Apprentice," which still holds my interest, depending on the tasks. , the cast and the dismissal decisions of Trump (often controversial - probably for that reason). The portion of the letter was certainly not clich√©, but at least unpleasant. The fact that Stewart never says, "You're fired!" - mentioned in the message board on this site - is particularly harrowing. Producer Mark Burnett should be admired for dealing honestly with Stewart's arrest in trying to make her a hero, but the truth is anyone watching can say she's basically trying to show off as a legal businesswoman. Again never mainstream, Stewart lacks the kindness and identifiability of Oprah Winfrey and the admirable and charismatic "hardness" of Donald Trump. Yes, this may be a biased assessment of your character's genre, but I want to say it's more about the nature of your business. <br /> <br /> It's no coincidence that Stewart was fired, but I wonder if they really intended it to last only a season?
