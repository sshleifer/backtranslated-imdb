It starts off looking like it might be going somewhere, so it quickly takes the main characters to a three ring circus of remarkable stupidity that permanently destroys any sympathy of the characters. I'm a big collector of stoner movies, but this is something I would not consider a valid addition. Bong Water is rubbish from the deepest regions of the bin, and I would not get caught dead with it on my shelf. In fact, I am convinced that this film was created by a partnership for a free drug from America. If you're a fan of Jack Black, then I'd say you might think that 5 minutes of the movies are OK, because Jack Black continues his legacy of singing songs for the retarded. I really can not say enough bad things about this movie.
