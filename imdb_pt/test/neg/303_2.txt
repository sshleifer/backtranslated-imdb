This movie was made before. It is basically an unoriginal combination of "Napoleon Dynamite" and "Sordid Lives". There are some funny parts, but on the other hand, it's a boring cliche. It's a good first film attempt and the director (who also stars and wrote the feature) shows a lot of promise. But the writing was a bit agitated and the story was not very original. I swear I've heard some of the lines in other films. However, the acting was very good and the film was filmed in an interesting way. It is also refreshing to see gay-themed movies not to be so harmed by political correctness and stories weary of anguish. The main character seemed pretty well adjusted for a gay teenager in rural Texas so no saccharine, coming out drama here!
