Looking at the comments, there does not seem to be much love for this movie, and it's not too hard to figure out why, it sucks. <br /> <br /> Now, I'll start by saying that the final product was hurt in several ways by the death of Donald Pleasance (Dr. Loomis) in post-production. This required a re-jigging of the film's completion with Loomis buying the farm and took what was supposed to be a double turnaround at the end with Micheal switching places with the mysterious "Man in Black" and I do not mean Johnny Cash. <br /> Now for the story. The fifth film ended unsatisfactorily with Micheal Myers escaping from prison with the mysterious man in black. It turns out (aggh) that this man knows the origin of Micheal's evil and is also a colleague of Dr. Loomis named Dr. Wynn. They also kidnapped Jamie Lloyd (played by Danielle Harris in parts 4 and 5, but here interpreted by JC Brandy). Jamie, pregnant, escapes from the lair of Dr. Wynn and so Micheal follows her and kills her. But she had the son so now he needs to track the baby so he can kill his great nephew. <br /> <br /> We have heard some ridiculous explanation for Micheal's evil involving Gaelic curses in bloodlines and mysterious symbols. A radio program is broadcast from Micheal's hometown for some reason, which gives Micheal some more unhappy victims. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film, as well as this review, is vague, confusing and unguided with a very anticlimactic ending. <br /> <br /> Some scenes of sex and nudity. Poor plot, passable effects, with some good run of the slasher kills kills, but with lack of motivation. To explain everything, it only provoked some new questions, made parts 4 and 5 useless, and it was a bad way for a great actor in Pleasance to finish his life and career.
