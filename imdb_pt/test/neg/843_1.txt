This should be based on Wilkie Collins's "The_Woman_In_White_", but the only similarity that this brings to the story are the names of the characters, the time period, and the settings. If they were going to change the story so completely, I do not understand why they needed to keep the pretense that it came from Wilkie Collins. Go read the book. It is much better.
