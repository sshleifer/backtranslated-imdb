(spoilers) Horrifying enough, I have actually seen the movie that this horrible movie was a continuation. It was called Actor the Fighting Eagle, and I saw it when I was only 8 years old. It made such a horrible impression on me that I never forgot it again. I've been a fan of MST3K for a long time, so when Cavedwellers came out on tape I bought it. I was horrified to realize that it was a sequel to the miserable Actor movie I had seen so long ago! The Actor suit, somehow, was more elusive than the last time I saw him. How can he wear that tiny bikini? He does not mind that this shows the fact that he does not have ... errr ... package? And poor Thong ... he does not get speeches or girls, and he has to follow that female actor with beaded curly hair and actor all the time. Has anyone else noticed that Miles O'Keefe walks like a woman? No wonder he's not interested in the beautiful, though lackluster, Meela. The evil villain Zor is more to your liking, I'm sure. I loved Zor's cardboard swan's helmet and the way he spent all his time trying to play some part of the Actor. The fight scenes are so poorly choreographed that it's a wonder swords can always connect. The old idiot spends all his time looking depressed. Actor drinks from a glass given to him by a guy who hates him, and then he seems surprised that they drugged him. He must be very clever - he invented a hang glider in space for five minutes, and then flew in a continuous space / time gap, so he quickly traveled to seventeenth-century Bulgaria. This was after he stabbed the giant snake puppet, of course, and saved the coital meela post while she sat around doing absolutely nothing. The real hero of the movie was Thong, who saved Actor several times from his unrestrained stupidity, and killed the evil Zor in the bargain. Kudos to Thong, the only competent person in the whole movie.
