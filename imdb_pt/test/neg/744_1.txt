The Northanger Abbey is not my favorite Jane Austen novel, but it has its charms. This movie does not. He has some of the same character names as the book, but the story is drastically altered, and the sweetest man in the entire canon of Austen (unless Mr. Knightley of Emma is proud) is a ruthless and heartless mercenary . One or two totally unfamiliar characters are introduced, and a palpable air of parsimonious perversion hangs over everything. I was so disappointed when I first saw him in his 1986 release; still today stands at the top of the list of films that disgrace the books on which they are based. Even Robert Hardy fans should give this one ample space. There's nothing, and I mean N-O-T-H-I-N-G, to recommend it.
