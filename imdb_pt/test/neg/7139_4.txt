The Grudge 2 ... Let's see. Do not get me wrong, I'm not a Japanese horror movie or horror or grog. I loved the first and the Original Ju-On. I feel that much more justice could have been made for this. Aubrey only existed to fill what needed to be 'discovered' at the end, (which if you've seen Ju-On before then, you already know the whole movie) all this was really a complete remake of Ju-On. , followed more closely than The Grudge. Although everyone might have thought it was coming to America was a bit interesting, it was expected that the house that was burning at the end of The Grudge would leave the second hungry for a new plot. <br /> <br /> Save your $ 6.50 and wait for this to come out on DVD, rent, watch and decide if you want to buy it. This movie is good for sleeping at 2 in the morning in the movie. But overall, I'd say a 4 out of 10. Sorry the Grudge fans, it's just ... They just failed on that one.
