Okay, now this movie is a job. It is full of idiosyncrasies and jesus speeches that would make most human biengs question whether or not they should be making films. Big names like Roddy Piper and David Carradine attract you, but, take it away from me, this movie sucks. The story is incomprehensible and lacks complete intelligence. The ensembles, vehicles and costumes come as a cross between bablon five and a film of slavery. I'm sure there's pornography with the best dialougue.
