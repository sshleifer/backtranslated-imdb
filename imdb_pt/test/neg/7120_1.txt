All I can say about this movie is that it's absolutely boring. The introduction of the movie is possibly the worst introduction to a horror movie I've ever seen, I mean, an angry girl hitting a guy in the head with a frying pan is not at all scary, which is what I suppose the director was pointing at to, but actually was "lightly" funny. <br /> <br /> The performance in this photo was beyond pathetic; a note to the directors, if you're making a horror movie, please hire some good actors, not a popular teen soap star who has no idea how to act. <br /> <br /> The death scenes in this movie were beyond boredom. .. do not gore, and I'm sorry, but horror movies without gore, or good suspense are just cheesy. I mean, this girl is killed by hair wrapped around her in the middle of Tokyo, and no one sees it happen, they just declare her as "missing," wow that's amazing! <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you and your friends want to see this movie, make sure you bring some sleeping pills because I guarantee you will not get to the end ... Me and my friend we left because we do not even care what happened in the end Congratulations
