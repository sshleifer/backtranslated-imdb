First of all, I personally love Demons and Demons 2, I have seen them, although it was hard to find good horrors without a good official film distributing here in Russia when I was a child, and that is an unchanging part of my childhood. So I did not hear anything about Mr. Bava. Then I saw your Ghost Son. Well, certainly not good to return! Why the protagonist, whom we never knew at least like him, in an accident in the middle of an empty road? Why do African servants say such stupid and stupid things about the human soul? Why is the plot so primitive? Have not we seen enough ghosts for 100 years of film production? Of course Lamberto Bava has nothing to show us until now. It's a shame.
