As a fan of hospital shows and doctors, I found this thrilling and sometimes humorous (especially the scenes with Dr. Whitman), which brings a bit of relief to the light. However, I was anxious for the last episode because I expected the bad guys to be punished and the good ones re-established. Instead, hospital management is becoming even more stupid in an unbelievable way and is getting worse and worse for the good ones. You can not help but wonder what the unions are doing or not. Rob, Donna and Maria know what the unions are for? Also, never seeing the outside, trees, grass, the sunlight is a bit oppressive. Did anyone understand the last words? that is, Rob Lake's response to Mrs. Strawberry's children asks "Why are you telling us all this?" It was very frustrating not being able to understand that.
