If you saw Atlantis 1, you know that what made this movie really great was a brilliant animation and a good script. This film was drawn and animated sloppily. The story is also doped. I was so disappointed with this nonsense that I could not get past the first hour, and MAN tried! The only thing this movie had was that it expanded the mole character, making it more comprehensive and three-dimensional. Take it from me, judge that garbage from the cover in the video box. The cover is poorly designed Disney schlock, clearly clinging to an easy buck of an unsuspecting parent. If this were an independent movie, it would not be so bad, but walking on the cover of a brilliant piece like Atlantis makes it absolutely unforgivable.
