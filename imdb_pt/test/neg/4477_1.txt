I was really looking forward to this title. It sounded like fun. The idea of ​​someone making a monstrous 50s movie might have been worth a laugh, but instead, that title only annoys. Firstly, there is almost no Froggg throughout the movie, which is the biggest disappointment. I have to sit down with over 75 minutes of drama and dialogue to get some glimpses of Froggg to have sex with a naked babe. Because? Also, the movie does not have any kind of fun storyline. I mean, give me something that's a little more interesting than just a bunch of talking heads. I wanted to see some hot girls looking for the creature in the swamp, I wanted to see some cuties being dragged into their lair in desperate need of rescue (things from Creature from the Black Lagoon), I wanted to see some action scenes the Froggg going on a kill , or perhaps escaping from an idiotic trap. Something exciting! Boy, have fun with it, be creative! Who wants to sit through endless and tiring dialogue scenes in a creature movie? My advice to the filmmakers: Go on, your concepts are good, but their execution needs to be much more inspired. Have fun with the creature, put the mood into action and most importantly ... put more creature in a creature movie !!!
