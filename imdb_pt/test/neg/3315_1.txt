I've never voted 1 for a movie in IMDB, but for this I'm sorry the scale does not go to -10. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this movie is that I saw it in a preview, and it was my worst movie experience ever. I do not care about stupid jokes. I can live with the silly story. But when I see those "main characters" of stupid smile with their pseudo-foreign speeches (only the Germans will understand what I say), I felt a kind of aversion that I never thought I could. (If they were left out, the thing may actually have been acceptable ...). <br /> <br /> There is not much more to be said about it. You can laugh once or twice, because it's so ridiculous, but it does not improve at all. It's definitely not funny. <br /> <br /> If you live outside Germany, be happy and rejoice that this terrible work will probably never reach your theaters. <br /> <br /> If you live in Germany, avoid this movie at all costs.
