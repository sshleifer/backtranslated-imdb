Val Kilmer is almost nowhere in this movie - lucky for him! It plays maybe 30 seconds of screen time and its role is completely irrelevant. After watching the movie I could not tell you what "role" he plays in the movie !! ??? OK ... they suck you in the first hour and immerse yourself in dark underground tunnels. Scary movies filmed in dark underground tunnels easily suck most people to last the first 30 minutes to an hour. Then you will begin to ask yourself, "Why am I seeing this?" I remember thinking how easy it must be for a director / writer to use dark underground labyrinths to make a movie. Just shoot people wandering in dark tunnels and you have instant "suspense." But that's where this movie does not go any further! We all wonder what happens at night but there is nothing out there in the dark in this movie but more darkness. The story is even worse. Apparently, there is a story behind the movie that I learned after watching the movie. But the film uses such a bad dialect that it never manifested itself clearly during the performance. I still do not understand what the writer / director meant. Some children trapped in the basement by a sister deceived in Russia? Because? Are they in our time at the same time as the characters? Are they ghosts? <br /> <br /> This was an absolutely horrible movie that drew me to write my first criticism of IMDb to warn others to avoid it.
