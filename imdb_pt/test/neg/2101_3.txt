When renting this, I was not expecting to be surprised. In fact, I knew it would be awful. It was just to see how horrible that really was. This is what comes with low budget horror. "Snakes On A Train," not to be confused with the serpentine summer blockbuster "Snakes On A Plane," starring Samuel L. Jackson, is about a woman who is subjected to a Mayan curse that causes snakes to crash into her and devour it from within. Her only hope of surviving lies in a shaman who lives across the border, so she and her underground companion on a train bound for Los Angelas. Throw some passengers and hilarity follows. Come to think of it though, the story is not so bad. It's not good either. <br /> <br /> The acting in this film rivals that of an Original Sci-Fi, if not worse. Trust me, it's awful. Snakes were another problem. They should be cunts, I think, but most of what you get are mostly harmless garden snakes that attack nothing and there's that sound effect that gets really annoying. <br /> <br /> The bloody effects on the other hand, although not at the level of Tom Savini, were actually very good. <br /> <br /> And another thing, the ending alone makes up for the rest of the movie. I will not talk about it here, so you'll have to rent it and see for yourself.
