A meaningless cash-in with nothing to contribute except wickedness, this is a definite case of sloppy seconds for Robocop. Irvin Kershner's numbness, the less tired plot and the confusion of a sequel are watchable and even slightly amused in a dubious and unpleasant way, but have virtually nothing of the talent, emotion, intelligence or excitement of the original. Instead, we have just another empty spectacle of a blockbuster whose only reason to exist seems to be to annoy the viewer with relentless violence, which is far more absurdly gratuitous than anything in the original. Omni Consumer Products, which produced the original Robocop cyborg, has become more of a totalitarian force than ever before, with flags suspected of Nazi squadron, stormtrooper guards and rental tanks at the end; as for the anonymous Old Man (Daniel O 'Herlihy), he is less a benevolent and more heinous protector of Mr. Burns type, surrounding himself with idiot lackeys who genuinely believe to put the brain of a murderous psychopath in the body of the new Robocop 2 is a good idea. Oh, and the first Robocop takes a look somewhere in the middle of all this mess, though you wonder what on earth a great actor like Peter Weller saw in the script. The funny Tom Noonan has nothing to work like the villain, while Nancy Allen is much wasted as a partner of Robocop. There are some hilarious moments everywhere; the commercial opening "Magnavolt", for example, but this is a poor follow-up of the truly great original.
