I think this movie can be called a badly targeted anger film. <br /> <br /> The characters of Joe and Bob were relics of the WWII generation who did not quite understand their children opposing war, taking drugs and listening to rock and roll. But I think their real fury was in the fact that America was beginning its long decline from the heights the war left it. <br /> <br /> "Joe" is a low-income Archie Bunker, complaining about all the things that made him angry, living his life of silent despair, until he joins Compton, a guy who wants to avenging the hippies who ruined their daughter. <br /> <br /> Honestly, most of the movie looks silly, the characters are worse than one dimensional, they are laughable. Peter Boyle was capable of better things.
