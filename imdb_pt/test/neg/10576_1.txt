I took my 14 year old son to see this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely awful! This movie should be rated R as a minimum. I'm not so strict with movies, but that was too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it would contain some comedy and I knew the comedy would probably be rude, but, this was way beyond the basics. I was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really gave me) and I could not believe how grossly sexual it was. I could not believe it would be good for a 13 year old to read and see this content. I do not understand how the rating system works.
