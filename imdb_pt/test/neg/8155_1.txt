This movie was in a box with another 20, with variable quality, and I can safely say that this title was right at the bottom of the pile. <br /> <br /> It is useless to go through the plot, what happened, choosing what was wrong, how I do not have all day and life is short, which reminds me, I just lost about 85 minutes of mine watching this snort. <br /> <br /> The acting was devilishly bad in a way that made it funny, though just fair, while comedy elements like the two idiot cops must have made Laurel & Hardy fans moan. One of the only moody moments was when the protagonist made a joke about her old plastic friends, T * ts, which would have been nice if I had not had to watch them walk whenever she waddled on the screen. The smallest I can give is one, and probably deserves it for having Heather Thomas in it, since she certainly was sexy and well-formed, although her acting was as bad as all the others.
