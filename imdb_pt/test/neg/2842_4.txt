The best thing I can say about this porn horror movie is: breasts breasts! <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie is made by some Hindu / Indian with some experience in pornographic films or something like that. <Br /> Plot: Talk-Show host and girlfriend are chased by a psychopath who is angry about the situation of the homeless and takes you out, you guessed it, beautiful ladies real estate agent! (movies like these are the reasons why 80's horror films have a representative of misogyny) <br /> <br /> This film is not really a Slasher, but it has the same kind of implausibilities and stereotypes: the cops idiots, the villain is an old white man and women are big girls. <br /> <br /> If you like porn-horror, this is your movie, otherwise stay away. (Adrienne fans will see her breasts down for a second or two)
