Definitely not your typical Polizia, Redneck just never worked for me. The film tells the story of a stealing of jewelry that went wrong and a boy who is inadvertently kidnapped in the process. In their attempt to flee, thieves leave a bloody trail of death in their wake as they plan to rescue the boy. The plan is never taken as the thieves are more determined to get to France and the boy is determined to stay with them. While I could cite a number of problems I had with the film, will I focus on the more obvious? the Memphis character played by Telly Savalas. From his work in The Dirty Dozen and Kelley's Heroes to other Italian films like Crime Boss and his most remembered role as Kojak, Savalas was a winner. I always thought of him as a super cool client. Unfortunately, Savalas is almost unattainable in Redneck. Did the director turn on the camera and instruct him to act in the most psychotic way possible? It might not have been too bad if his actions had been done within the context of a plot I cared about, but here he seems to be acting bizarre because of being bizarre. It seems to be random madness. And what about that accent? Savalas may have been many things, but Southern is not one of them. He looks completely ridiculous, even trying his accent. Also, I found little interest in the rest of the movie. As I pointed out, the plot never appealed to me. I just did not care what was happening. And the notion that the boy is so quickly attracted to the criminal lifestyle is not true. As for the other actors, Mark Lester is almost as bad as Savalas and the normally reliable Franco Nero is not much better. Three "names" actors and not a good performance between them. To make matters worse, I believe the director filmed many of the night scenes with nothing more than the glow of his watch to light up the shots. I did not know what was happening. Characters I hate, a plot that does not interest me and production values ​​that failed? No wonder I've given Redneck a 3/10.
