I had high expectations around this movie (not like it was an apocalypse now or an 8 1/2, but loud enough), and when I saw it on the cable, they were all broken. Beginning with acting (poor, almost mediocre, an astonishing waste of good actors and talent) and the story itself: Since when did a 5-man squadron patrol in a so-called "hot" zone? For suicide? A big mistake, which costs the film. Very good actors act very badly here, as Sean Penn, who recently repeated the annoying way of talking about "I am Sam", and Michael J. Fox, who misses a good opportunity to beat Charlie Sheen in "Platoon", performing only " average". But the most annoying character was Diaz (played by John Leguizamo, another stupid waste of talent by the director), who was a crooked, frightened and insecure person, even more annoying than Jar Jar Binks (yes, you heard). The battle sequences are medium-sized, the only one that really stands out is the opening sequence, with Michael J. Fox trapped at his feet in a VC tunnel. de Palma has a weak work here, and if it were not for films like "Scarface" and "The Untouchables" (these excellent films), I would consider him a "bluff" director: too much publicity, bad filming. 3/10
