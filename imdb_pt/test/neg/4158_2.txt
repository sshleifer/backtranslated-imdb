There is nothing worse than science fiction crafted by people who have not the slightest idea. Clinging to a concept that would not be so terrible in itself (a future where cloning is common enough to make it necessary for you to reproduce with someone very close to you genetically), the writer began to allow his illness Tim Robbins' imagination was able to guess the password of a security guard's computer simply by getting her to say something about herself, I knew I was in trouble. It was later revealed that this ability was due to the fact that Robbins had taken an "empathy virus," viruses being used to grant instant (or near-instant) skills upgrades to its users. Robbins' love interest complained about her own experience with a virus like that - a Mandarin-language virus that allowed her to speak Chinese, but, as she complained, "she could not understand what she was saying." Ok, first of all, empathy, no matter how intense, is not ESP. Without incorporating some sort of true mind-reading aspect (like an empathy virus that actively flushes virions into the neighborhood, it infects nearby people, picks up pieces of its memory, then sets off for the original host - which is, as you probably can tell , a smidgeon on the impractical side) you can not justify the possibility of determining a specific detail such as someone's password just "listening to things you did not say". Nor can you acquire the ability to speak a language without understanding what it is saying - the virus can not infect your vocal chords and translate to you on time, because a virus can not * think *. To give you the power to speak Chinese, this learning virus would have to modify your brain. He would have to code the knowledge among the neurons and once there it is * his * - you certainly understand what he is saying because he needs to. To use your own brain to perform a task, you must understand this task (most of the time). Unless, of course, the movie is suggesting that the virus was deliberately designed to put into practice some bizarre multiple-personality mental schism, where some of its functions function as an internal and unidirectional translator. The mixture of languages ​​spoken by the characters is decent enough, though not at all remarkable enough to justify all the love that other critics have given. In addition, all multicultural insertions in the world can not make up for a simple and frustrating fact: the dialog box stinks! It is slow, it is laborious and it is not natural. Again, I am sure that the adepts have convinced themselves that annoying strangeness is simply the result of an inspired genius that creates a truly futuristic form of discourse (and therefore subject to linguistic drift). I disagree. Good dialogue is a good dialogue at any time - and the same goes for the guts. <br /> <br /> Finally, I will revisit the central concept of the film - the prohibition of sex with itself. Generalized cloning is a good, classic science fiction topic. Global warming also leads to ecological devastation (which Code 46 also incorporates). Unfortunately, the two do not go together! If you have an ecological disaster severely cutting the living area available, you do not run around cloning people! You have enough population problems because it does not increase the number of problems. Normal and old-fashioned sex and birth provide the entire population you need, and cloning of any kind would be ruthlessly suppressed. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the movie was not all bad. Had a good cinematography. Maybe if I had watched the sound mute, I might have liked it.
