This is a poorly written and misdirected short, pure and simple. What is interesting and keeps me observing, to a certain extent, were the values ​​of production. Filmed on video it seems that, with a bad script and a bad direction, one would think that it would also have a horrible value of production. This is what the viewer expects when watching a terrible movie and filmed on video. BUT not in this case, they have spent some money and this shows. This makes me very slightly interested in seeing what comes next, just to see! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst short that I saw that looked great Hollywood budget, although it was filmed in some sort of video format. <br /> <br /> Instead of spending the amount of money they must have spent in a rather impressive setting, it would be better to see a better story run with good guidance. But then again, how can we expect new filmmakers to do that when even Hollywood does not.
