This HBO original is quite simple and very dumb. Armand Assante, once again doing an imitation of Stallone, is Ray Wellman, a former convict who has just been released on parole. All he wants is his old girlfriend Lacy, played by a young Marcia Gay Harden, back. Unfortunately for Ray, Lacy joined the robust Elliot, played by Sam Neill. To further complicate matters, Ray Ray's old friends want some favors and kidnap Lacy to make sure they happen. Ray and Elliot unite, despite mutual aversion. <br /> <br /> What follows is violent and slow, but Marcia Gay Harden shows us why she would win Oscar in the future, she is not so polite here, but her raw emotion, sincerity and some rather explicit nudity scenes almost make it worth watching. Almost. <br /> <br /> Rent "Fever" (without the title does not fit the movie) if you're a fan of it, otherwise skip it and be thankful that the stars have moved on to better things. <br /> <br /> Note-this is a hard "R" movie for language, violence and nudity.
