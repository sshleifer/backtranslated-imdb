I found the movie in my local video store and was surprised to see it on DVD. I had heard of the scenes of explicit sex, violent violence, and notorious debauchery. I sat and watched and I started to laugh! The decorations and the art direction were cheap and fake; the nudity was sarcastic and incredibly uninteresting; the story was poorly written and was just a parade of incredibly handsome and talented actors being held hostage to name the worst dialogue ever written! The incestuous relationship between Caligola (Malcolm McDowell) and her serenely beautiful sister Drusilla (Theresa Ann Savoy, a vulnerable beauty) can not be taken seriously ... neither shocking nor repulsive! Peter O'Toole and John Geilgud were obviously held hostage during the making of this film, luckily they die within the first thirty minutes of the film. Cinematography was a joke and I got even more fun when they used a quote from the Bible! The book of Mark no less. If you're looking for shock value, this movie will disappoint you. If you are looking for cult values, you will be even more disappointed. I know I did. I've seen it shocking and it's two hours of your life that you will never get back.
