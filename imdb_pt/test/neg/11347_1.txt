The first season of Bones is playing in Finland and I can not believe the amount of bullshit this show puts on - the characters are shallow, misguided and clumsy. <br /> <br /> It's a CSI of a poor man. Or, in fact, CSI without coherent plot. Although Bones has potential, he fails due to the lack of director who failed to extract the essence of the actors' show. It's really sad to see a show throw it all away when it could have been a descent show with just a little more thought. From the beginning you have the feeling of how awkward the acting is. <br /> <br /> To shorten the story, do not waste time with Bones.
