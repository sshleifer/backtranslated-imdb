The idea of ​​bringing Dracula to contemporary times is not bad - after all, you can relive the series a bit by injecting a new element of the story into a series that Hammer has already exhausted in a long series of generally excellent films. However, as today turned out to be the early 1970s, the results were pretty silly and looked more like LOVE IN PRIMEST BITE (a deliberate comedy). Seeing Christopher Lee in a 1970s language-filled film and electric guitar chords and laughable rock music just looked beyond stupid. To make matters worse, the acting is a lot more over-the-top here - with an intense and silly performance by "Johnny Alucard". I also found it very funny that Van Helsing's grandson noticed that "Alucard" is "Dracula" spelled backwards - no one else discovered it for himself! Wow, what cunning !! <br /> <br /> So why a lot of the movie was bad, why even got an almost respectable score of 4? Well, when the story came to the expected confrontation between Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) and Drac (Christopher Lee), it was exciting and ended very well. Plus, and I know this sounds very sexist, but if I had to watch a bad movie, at least the character of Stephanie Beacham wore some really cool clothes that revealed her wide ... "talents", so to speak. So at least it was a beautiful movie to watch. <br /> <br /> By the way, does the movie end with the phrase "let him rest in final peace" in the end, although this was not the final film of Hammer Dracula? with Lee. He returned to "The Satanic Rites of Dracula" shortly after and was in many ways even worse than this failure of a monster movie.
