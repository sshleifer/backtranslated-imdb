Alleged "crying queen" Debbie Rochon and her group of border prostitutes travel west to the title site and find terrible murders that end up being the work of a cult of former Confederate psychopaths attempting to resuscitate the south through a massacre without sense. > <br /> Action and suspense take second place to tedious dialogue and uninteresting character development. <br /> <br /> Billy Drago is good at the ungrateful (not to mention worthless) role of the city undertaker, but everywhere else about this aspiring Western terrorism is extremely poor, including the city and the fort, both resembling modern traps made by Western tourists and costumes that seem to have been bought in Party City. <br /> Do yourself a great favor and watch Ravenous in your place.
