My brother plays "Moose" in this movie. Although most of his scenes were left on the cutting room floor. The funniest line is that the movie is "nothing wrong with stat". Anyway, this is filmed in Portland, OR, where we grew up. The dance club is called "Up Front FX". What I loved about this movie is that the main character (who is not mentioned in the box because Bolo brings more influence) should be a police detective ... a great opportunity to drive in a red Porsche convertible. I need a copy of this, preferably the director, so I can see all the scenes my brother is in. The only scene he's in is the beginning when they're at the dance club. He got the job because he was dating this cheerleader from a semi-professional soccer team called The Oregon Thunderbolts. It's interesting because his name appears as the first entry in IMDb. Fame has it, fortune, not so much.
