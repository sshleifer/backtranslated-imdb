It's fascinating how this title manages to slip by the average viewer as something new and innovative (citing some of the comments). Murali K. Thalluri must have thought for himself, "Oh, great! Elephant ... What a fantastic movie! I'll strive to do exactly the same movie and see if anyone notices!" Unfortunately, he even failed with his outrageous idea . The movie ends with a complete failure. Considering he struggles to catch the glare of Gus Van Sants "Elephant", this makes it look even more ridiculous - a faux pas more embarrassing for a film director. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with suicide. of a student in the school bathroom. This scene already shows the awkward acting skills of everyone involved in this scene. You do not buy a single word they say. They go on, interrupted by short excerpts of interview style from children who "live in their married lives," with each bit a little distressing in their clear stupidity based on every useless monologue. Thalluri means introducing the characters in this way, giving a kind of insight to fast-as-junk insight into their hearts ... and failing once again. Five minutes later, Thalluri finally shouts to the audience, "Yes, guys! I stole this movie and for some curious reason I'm proud of it!" Taking Gus Van Sants's most unmistakable narrative style of "Elephant": He filmed scenes twice to let the viewer follow each character involved in a scene in his particular mood and role in a school situation. Hm, does not this look very familiar? To me, this very tolerant level of tolerance had been breached there to the point where I could not stand this terrible movie any longer. Shame on you, Murali K. Thalluri, I say! I'm especially surprised that "2:37" has reached the official selections at Cannes in 2006, while everyone must have remembered "Elephant" (2003) at the same Film Festival a few years ago! So how in the name of the Lord did this most shameful robbery show up there? I find myself absolutely intrigued by this error. Directors like Thalluri use the ignorance of audiences who are not (and can not be completely) aware of all the independent films out there. As the elephant has little to do with conventional cinema (although it is undoubtedly a masterpiece), few people notice that the story told in "2:37" had already been told before! As this is possible at a Film Festival of such importance as attributed to Cannes, I can not say. It is sad and shameful that such things are passed on and hardly anyone sees the real fraud. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is by all means only commercial, useless as an independent film and (at a certain level) a false parody of his obvious idol, "Elephant."
