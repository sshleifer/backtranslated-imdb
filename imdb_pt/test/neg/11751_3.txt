Well, I have to agree with the critics on this, that everyone said "let that go". Why they had to do this reformulation of the 1960's "Psycho", I do not know. My guess is that they wanted to reach a new audience and thought that color and modern actors were the answer, as those were the major changes. The dialogue was the same and the story was the same. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I applaud you for not having finished with much verbiage and nudity, making it a despicable movie. However, if they were going to keep everything the same, why bother when you would not improve Tony Perkins, Janet Leigh and the original cast? <br /> <br /> Did they honestly think Vince Vaughn was going to be as good or better than Perkins? Are you kidding me? Ann Heche, with her short and masculine haircut, is going to be better than Leigh? I do not think like that! <br /> <br /> Yes, the colors were beautiful here, but it's the black and white photography that helped make the 1960 version so scary to begin with. It's perfect for history, not a lot of greens and roses! Once again, I think the filmmakers were betting on an audience that never saw the original. <br /> <br /> This was just a stupid project that should never have gone off the paper.
