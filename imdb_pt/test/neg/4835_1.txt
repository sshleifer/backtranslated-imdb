What most offends the critics after this movie is the mention of "originality." This film does not contain an innovative element. If by "originality" you mean scenes of pathetic action, exaggeration, gluttony in violence, rude humor, and a script beyond intellectual belief. So 'originality' is something Swedish cinema can do without. <br /> <br /> As Röse and Karlsson can agree to 'act' on this poor excuse for a movie is a mystery to me. And as Eva Röse, after the production of this film, can be seen at breakfast - the TV promotion simply disappoints me. <br /> <br /> This movie does not contain a story, the script is illogical, rigid and last but not least, simply bad. These two young directors created a very disgusting fantasy containing violence, comic strips and trivialized psychological portraits. I would not be surprised if the DD scene masturbating in the kitchen during a microwave dinner was actually put there to describe the daily lives of these two grown-up cinematic nerds who pose as directors. <br /> <br /> I would not show this movie to my worst enemy.
