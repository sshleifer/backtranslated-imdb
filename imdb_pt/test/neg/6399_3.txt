I just watched this movie and, for the most part, I thought it was a waste of time with few or no redeeming factor. I do not really understand where all the positive reviews have come from - the animation is clumsy and unrefined, the plot makes no sense from the point of view, and there is no sense of intrigue or suspense in what you are trying to get through. it had been an intriguing and suspenseful film. I've never read the book so I can not tell if the film was faithful, but as with most movie adaptations, it tries hard to squeeze as much information into it as possible. The result is a disjointed and illogical storyline that does not really allow you to understand or relate to the characters or, indeed, to anything. Overall, I felt completely detached from the characters and the plot to the point that I could not care what happened to them, and the only way to see how this animation can be considered beautiful is if your normal animation pattern is a Scooby-Doo cartoon.
