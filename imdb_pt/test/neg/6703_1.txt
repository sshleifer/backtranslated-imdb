Hi everyone, this is my first comment and I would have to have chosen the worst movie to review. As I only watched 5 minutes from this but trust me you could see this movie was going nowhere. The acting was deplorable, camera work and lighting seemed to have been filmed and performed by a 10-year-old gang. No offense at 10 years old. I just could not take it anymore. I got off my couch, took the Adam House DVD from the DVD player and threw it in the trash. Maybe if you're a Colin Farrell fan, this movie might interest you because the character in the movie, Anthony, is a Colin Farrell guy. But that's as much as possible, he will certainly never have the acting abilities of cabbage. I gave this movie a rating of 1 (awful) just because there were no minuses in the drop down list.
