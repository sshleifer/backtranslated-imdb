Simply put, this mini-series was terrible. Let me tell you the ways. 1. absurd plotting. 2. Excess action. 3. Scattershot approach to the characters. 4. Annoying Narration. 5. Inability to create interest of the viewer. <br /> <br /> This film can not even pass the "Soap Opera for Dummies" test. I'm sorry, I did not read this award-winning novel, so I'm just judging as a movie, but it really stinks. Imagine going to a party where they show dozens of appetizers. You look at the wide variety and want to taste them, but suddenly they are removed, and you wonder where they went. It's like this movie, with many characters introduced and never taken away. There are enough stories and characters in this movie to create a series of 20 episodes, but we are given less than four hours to digest everything. <br /> <br /> There are more facial expressions and reaction photos from Ed Harris than you'll find in 10,000 monkeys. The pace is extraordinarily slow. <br /> <br /> Dennis Farina and Helen Hunt are so exaggerated that their characters are not believable. Joanne Woodward's character is one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The persistent metaphor of the river becomes banal. <br /> <br /> And probably the most absurd part of the movie - the cat. That vicious and vicious cat that follows the hero to scratch him and his seat covers - well, come on now - not good Stephen King! Probably the most interesting character in the movie, and one that is not well designed, is John Voss, the troubled kid whose final act of desperation explains the only plot device that works in this movie. <br /> <br /> Almost everyone in this movie is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> To sum up, there is little here to inspire. Drama is a bad melodrama. It's just a terrible effort.
