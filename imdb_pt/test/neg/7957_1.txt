Copy of cats copied this movie from a 1974 Hindi movie called "Call Girl"! "Call Girl" had an identical storyline. The way the protagonists fall in love, then rebel and the climax is the same in both films! "Call Girl" is better than Water, at least from the point of view of history. It was not as agonizingly slow as water! Water, on the other hand, does not progress at all. The goal may be to make the public sympathize with Kalyani forever! Are Indian filmmakers better than just being big copiers nowadays? Well, they call it "being inspired." In its language it is: "to be inspired (without any quotation whatsoever!)"! :)
