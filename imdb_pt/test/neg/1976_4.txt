So, after the initial disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie, which seemed to have no resemblance to the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children launched into a warm reception and now a dedicated fan base. And the reason for the success of the films is understandable as it has lush graphics, fast-moving fight sequences and some cool characters like hell. However, if you have not played FF7 yet, you probably do not like this movie as the storyline continues without explanation and you are likely to miss the plot even if you have played the game. Second, there is no character development, no prior knowledge of the game, their views on the characters are limited to 'legal' and 'not legal'. Of course, for FF7 fans, the movie is almost guaranteed to entertain, at least for nostalgic reasons, and it's cool to see all the characters you grew up loving the game rendered in some amazing computer animations. One last complaint, the film, at least in my opinion, tried to shove a lot in less than two hours and therefore the last half hour or so seems horribly rushed. If you played and liked the FF7, it's worth watching, but nothing too special. If you have not played FF7 yet, it's best to play it before watching this movie.
