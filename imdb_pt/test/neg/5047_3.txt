I do not think I'm spoiling anyone's experience on this movie, telling you not to see it if you have something better to do, like cleaning under the stove. It gets dirty downstairs and you have to clean it sometime. <br /> <br /> I think the film suffers from lack of sex and violence, although there is a stunt double that looks so dangerous that it could only have been filmed in a country where life is cheaper than beer . The heart of the "gargoyle" is in the right place, but its aspirations are conservative. It's at least not pretentious. But I had a lot of fun doing it, playing the perennial horror movie idiot who says "What's in that hole?" and dies for his arrogance. Besides, I met Michael Pare. Every movie addict should work with a B movie clip at least once before death. And the Romanians are the loveliest people I've ever met. Literally the most beautiful. Go down the street in Bucharest: if 7 out of 10 women are not absolutely beautiful, you are walking down a street that I did not find; and be consoled by the fact that at least 5 of the 10 are available for drinks. <br /> <br /> Part of the film was filmed at Casa Radio, an abandoned, unfinished building of the Bloc-cum-Georgian Nightmare Classic Communism originally intended to house the KGB's propaganda ministries, namely the Not-So-Radio - Free from Europe. The building is five stories tall and occupies one block from the city; Best of all, while its facade radiates solidity from the Big Brother State, it resides near the center of the city as a post-apocalyptic ruin in a jungle of burdock and hemp populated by dozens of gypsies and dozens of wild dogs. The construction of Casa Radio was suspended when Causescu and his wife were executed on TV in 1989, and there are still holes that fall from the top floor of the sun (offering surreal views of a modern stretch of 400-meter concrete roof, decorated with projecting rebar and old car parts, overlooking an ancient ruined city) to the damp and scary sub-basement (which duplicates the film to the Gargola lair.) There are no American-style protection grids or warning signs for Bucharest. <br /> <br /> Since the demise of the Soviet Union, Casa Radio has already received several filming of non-unions, including "Highlander III." It is attractive to producers because it is a cheap, huge place in terms of scale and available space, bizarre appearance and free of insurance headaches, as it is still owned by the state. Also, no one complains if you do not clean up after your production: anything left on site is interpolated in the construction of the gypsy residents of your favela in this royal urban jungle. An assistant director was bitten by a wild dog during the filming of "Gargoyle." The apples provided by the catering service were put into service by the cast and crew as projectiles in order to keep the dogs prowling in the distance. I was also bitten by wild dogs in Bucharest once in a bar (!) And once in a city park. I also survived two car accidents in two weeks, both in taxis and none of which was seen by the drivers involved as reason to stop the cars. <br /> <br /> GEEK NOTE: The Sci-Fi Network or Channel or anything else was one of the supporters of this movie (the lower the budget, the more producers on the set), so it's a bit strange that no one had a problem with the original title "Gargoyles," until it was almost time to show it on the network, although Sci-Fi already had an unrelated series of that name. The title was changed at some point relatively close to the release, since I have a copy with color correction labeled with the previous title.
