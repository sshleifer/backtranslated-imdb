Realty's television crew is assigned to cover a small high school hockey team running toward a serial killer wearing a black mask and a hooded jacket. Many interviews in which crew members (and some of the residents who live in the town of White Plains, where most of the film is mounted) talk about the camera with each other, those meeting in the town of White Plains, their situations current and showbiz side of their lives. The screenplay is often acidic, cynical and caustic and Killer Movie essentially mocks on realty television shows, featuring a cast of characters that can be found in The Real World. If this plot is appealing to you, kill yourself. I found the characters tiring and the satire is an old hat. Out of the cast, Paul Wesley, the director in need of a great chance, finding more than he could bargain for, Jake Tanner, is a nice guy, coming out very nice and tolerant of the crap he must face considering the prima donnas and people immature in their entourage that often do not cause anything other than migraines. Particularly annoying is his producer Lee (Cyia Batten), a tyrant constantly barking orders for everyone, his poisonous attitude creating a lot of tension ... she's the kind of producer who wants to capitalize on a small town outburst against the killer, using the The story's hockey team's cape as a front to explore the tragedy that takes place in White Plains. Those who are familiar with Kaley Cuoco know that now she has perfected the spoiled princess because she is the only role we see most of the time. Like Blanca, she is polarizing the way she needs attention, milking her little celebrity status, making a lot of friction when she becomes a source of frustration, and her mouth is dirty (Cuoco may have taken the role just so she could escape from her usual television comedy roles, allowed to pronounce unrestricted profanities) Cuoco, along with the whole cast, cultivates the Killer Movie as a eye candy, but it's hard to find any character you do not want see cut into pieces with a meat. cleaver Jason London is the guy's sound / equipment, a real creepy with a sour attitude, often tormenting others with his dirty comments that are unnecessary. We witnessed many personality clashes, noticing how these egocentric Hollywood cast types kiss each other. The killer's identity should not surprise anyone, it's pretty obvious. Some minor gore, but most of the violence is fired off the screen. Despite some tame lesbianism, neither is this satisfactory. Leighton Meester appears in the film as a cute victim. Director / Screenwriter Jeff Fisher is a very attractive cast, but I would not be able to tell that from the countless slashers who have stocked horror shelves in the last ten years or so since SCREAM. Although I've never liked any of Cuoco's characters, I never tire of looking at her, but eventually she needs to create a role that does not consist of her arrogance, with smug arrogance, always whimpering and complaining.
