Based on the true story of two young Americans who sold national secrets to the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, "Falcon And The Snowman" wants to be both suspenseful and philosophical at the same time, and falls short in both departments. It's less le Carre than who cares. Timothy Hutton stars as Christopher Boyce, a former seminarian who, revolted by Watergate and by the middle-class values ​​around him, is probably the wrong guy to be hired by a company running spy satellites for the CIA. Sean Penn plays his friend-dealer, Daulton Lee, who becomes Boyce's messenger, delivering secret files to the Soviet embassy in Mexico City. An unusual jazz-synth score, lack of sympathy or emotional attachment to anyone, and many scenes of guys getting irritated in rooms, all combined to cushion what could have a decent moral dilemma thriller. <br /> <br /> It really is Penn's film despite the second billing; his character begins to talk about turkey with the Russians while Hutton plays with his pet hawk. Hutton looks like they woke him five minutes before calling it "action." With Penn, it's a challenge whether you have a brilliant performance or an over-the-top. Here, it's a bit of both, but more the latter, especially in the second half, when Lee switches from cocaine to heroin. He screams. He snorted. He beats parties at the Russian embassy. He is assaulted with phone books. He spits himself into a mirror, a great goober he must have saved for a paparazzi. "I do not know who my friends are anymore!" he screams. It is exhausting to just watch it. Penn seems to have modeled Lee a bit on Dustin Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo, from "Midnight Cowboy," complete with overly nasal line reads and constant eye change. John Schlesinger directed this film as well as "Midnight Cowboy," but he seems to have had another Hoffman movie in mind, "The Graduate," rearranging scene after scene of Boyce and Lee by the pool, trying to decide how to live their lives. his golden cage. Too bad that no one suggested plastics. From the initial shots, news images of American decline juxtaposed with Boyce and his bird, "Falcon" makes clear that it is a message film, although the message itself is far from clear, probably because the characters never come into focus. Should Boyce be an idealist? Or is he just a mercenary? Hutton and Schlesinger did not seem to know, which made it harder for us. Meanwhile, opportunities to establish some suspense, such as Boyce stealing documents from the secret "Black Vault" where he works or Lee playing games with the Russians, are interrupted by cuts of leaps in the scenes of the couple with their families and friends. It is the normality of the story that Schlesinger finds interesting, but it is the least interesting aspect for us. <br /> <br /> Good things: It's interesting to see a movie that works the vibe of the 70's as early as this, referencing Mary. Muldaur and Tang. Dorian Harewood, memorable in "Full Metal Jacket," performs well as Boyce's paranoid colleague Gene, who shows Boyce how to make margaritas with a grinder but has serious problems with Nam under his festive side. Macon McCalman is also well, in a totally different way, as the sensible boss who gives Boyce his high-security job. David Suchet, as an employee of the Russian embassy that deals with Lee, creates a fascinating mix of threat and amiability. <br /> <br /> But "Falcon And The Snowman" stands or falls on the issue of the two title characters, and neither the actors nor Schlesinger can undermine much in terms of answers. Worse, after more than two hours in his alternately wild and catatonic company, you really do not want answers. You just want those credits to roll.
