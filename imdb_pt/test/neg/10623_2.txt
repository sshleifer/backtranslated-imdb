When I borrowed this movie, I was not expecting high quality performance, but that was just sad. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting was so incredibly bad that you could not easily get into that movie if you tried. There's nothing like watching a child announce things like "Oh no! My father is invisible!" or "I wonder what it does?" in the same monotonous tone that someone can announce traffic warnings on the radio. There are some good actors, but they are wasted in smaller parts. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, although it is fairly easy to guess considering there are not many real changes in the plot. Lots of holes too. For example, the parent is invisible and the inventor discovers what part is needed to make it visible again. Then the kid goes and steals the part from an electronics store. Could not he just ask his father for money? <br /> <br /> This appears in the Comedy category, but most of the comedy in this movie was pretty dumb, like the Invisible Dad taking off his clothes while he was invisible. and then almost reappearing naked during a meeting, or walking with his head covered all the time. Funny at first, but it gets old. <br /> <br /> 2/5 because it's watchable, and it's one of those movies that are funny in their own way ... like the monotonous recitation of lines.
