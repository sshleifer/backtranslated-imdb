This is supposed to be a story in which a rich man tells a story about his youth. However, you see things like personal computers, emails, faxes, etc., which are items used in the late 20th and early 21st century. So, when should this guy be telling this story - by 2020. Boy, I wonder how advanced we are then. How about we say that? <br /> <br /> In addition, there are several legal issues that also make no sense. In the court scene, the story falls on the usual evidence of surprise evidence, which is inadmissible in any real court in this country. In addition, Grandma would have to be absent for at least seven years in most states before being declared officially dead. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Elmo Shropshire. You are now officially an SELLOUT.
