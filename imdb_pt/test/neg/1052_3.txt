Physical Evidence is one of those movies you want to like, but it should be a lot better than it really is. Developed as a continuation of Jagged Edge for Glenn Close and Robert Loggia, it seems like everyone involved just did this while hoping something better would come out. The premise is perfectly useful, it's technically efficient if horribly uninspired, even with Henry Mancini's surprisingly enjoyable music track, but you can not help feeling that things would have been better if one of the protagonists had ended up being the killer. Rumor has it that was originally the case). As shown by the opening scene of his hotly disastrous Heat (1986), Reynolds has all the ingredients of a great screen villain. As it is, there are few surprises and a sense of indifferent filming by numbers, as you construct a head of interentity as you descend, unselfishly, to a lesser than a great testament. Last. <br /> <br /> Reynolds is well, navigating in charisma in what is clearly a vehicle of stars. Unfortunately, the same can not be said of Theresa Russell. A stunning and fearless actress in the films of her husband Nic Roeg, who allow her to immerse herself in the darker side of human nature, she is stuck in a part that demands star quality rather than depth, and she does not have to spare. She does not cajole her speech or bump into the other actors, but that's all that can be said in favor of her surprisingly energetic and often amateur performance that leaves the film bad. In addition to Ned Beatty's promoter, the supporting cast adds just a slightly surreal presence in Boston, where everyone seems to have a fairly disguised Canadian accent and the streets have an amazing resemblance to Toronto and Montreal. Similarly, director Michael Crichton, who in Westworld, Coma and The First Great Robbery Train showed that he knew how to tilt the audience to the edge of their seats, seems to handle the action in a way purely superficial - in fact, in a brief chase the scenes combine and appear grouped almost arbitrarily. The climax itself has no talent and is completely devoid of threat or danger, and many scenes are played for much less than they are worth. It's no big surprise that, in addition to the uncredited reviews of The 13th Warrior, Crichton has not directed since. <br /> <br /> Your success enough in an 80's TV movie, even if it never lives up to the promise of its opening. If that is reason enough to see this is for individual taste.
