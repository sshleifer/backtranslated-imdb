Some slack can be cut out of this movie due to the fact that it was made in 1979. That said a lot, it's actually very terrible. <br /> <br /> No matter how ridiculous rear projection or the horrible, horrible camera-tracking of supposedly "in-flight" objects are the acrobatics the Concorde draws that will make you blink in disbelief at the absurd. Barrel rolls, loop-loops, and violent "evasive" maneuvers left me wondering why the Air Forces of the world did not just fly into Concord as their top fighters. <br /> <br /> So, here are the important lessons I learned from this celluloid cheese fest: 1. The Concorde is at least as nimble as a Phantom 4 jet fighter. /> <br /> 2. You can fire a gun at Mach 2 by simply opening the cockpit window and sticking your arm out. <br /> <br /> 3. If the gun does not fire, do not drop it, as it may go out. <br /> <br /> 4. The Concorde can dodge up to two Sidewinder missiles fired at once. <br /> <br /> 5. A rocket will always distract a missile that seeks heat. <br /> <br /> 6. Turning off your jet engines is a surefire way to divert missiles that seek heat if the 5 (above) fails. <br /> <br /> 7. When making a forced landing at the Concorde, it is apparently impossible to discard your fuel beforehand. <br /> <br /> 8. The Concorde riders are all veterans trained in combat. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, this movie is not very realistic. The effects are primitive by today's standards and, coupled with the absurd acrobatics that the Concorde performs, make this movie worthy of little scorn. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Not recommended at all!
