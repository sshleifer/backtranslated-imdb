And also a wonderful start, a real quick start. It keeps you anxious and waiting for you to come. Unfortunately, high adrenaline dries quickly, but certainly after half of the film is over. <br /> <br /> And it's a shame because this movie has good ideas and explores many of them. But that is also one of his shortcomings. When exploring many things, everything is confused with many things, so in the end you get too confused to follow any plot or characters. It's very somber and moody but this does not help much if it's also the jumping genre just to try to fit any and everything into your story!
