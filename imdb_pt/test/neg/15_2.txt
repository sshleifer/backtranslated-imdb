Few movies thwarted expectations and annoyed me as much as Fire. The film is pretentious junk. You can not get anything on an artistic level. The only thing he got to receive is a ban in India. If it were because of the poor quality of film production, and not because of topical controversy, the ban would have been more justifiable. <br /> <br /> Now that I have my anguish out of my system, I am more able to analyze the film: <br /> <br /> * From the beginning the film seems unreal, especially when the protagonists begin to converse in English. The director, of course, did not make the film for an Indian audience; however, underestimated its international audience by simplifying it. Watching the character of domestic help conversing in perfect English is too unreal to be true. <br /> <br /> Next, we have regular glimpses of Radha's dreams. These scenes are not very effective. They appear as dissonant and obstruct the flow of the film. I am still wondering how this philosophical dialogue connected with history. I felt that surrealism was lost. <br /> <br /> * Love scenes seemed voyeuristic and were probably made for public excitement rather than a powerful statement. In any case, they do not reach either. <br /> <br /> The names chosen for women, Radha and Sita, are names of Hindu deities and therefore were selected to shock the public. However, since the film was not made for the Indian audience at first, the name shock selection is not to achieve its goal, which is absurd. <br /> <br /> * The quality of the steering is very poor and some key and delicate scenes were badly handled. A better director might have drawn a powerful emotional drama from the subject. The acting looked like wood, though Nandita Das brought life to the role, the others were wasted. I always thought Shabana Azmi was a good actress, but her talent is not evident in this film. The male protagonists were absolute rubbish. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the Earth and want to see more of the director, stay away from this. Please.
