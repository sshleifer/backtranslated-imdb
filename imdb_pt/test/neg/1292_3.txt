I'm sorry, but this movie is only a shallow path for me. In it, Perez is a taxi dancer with boyfriend Keitel trying to do this as an actress. First of all, what the hell is a taxi dancer? Even after going through it, I still do not know. Oh yes, Perez also inspires DeLorenzo to follow her as a passionate puppy. There is no reason behind love, it just happens. There are times when characters and events actually try to pull the strings from your heart, but this rarely works. The only character with whom you really feel something for or with is Keitel's character, and it's only because he does a good job with it. Any other actor and character would have been equal to the others. <br /> <br /> The script is basically an uninspired repetition about how difficult it is to make you an actor / actress. It has been done and said before, language and dialogue seem to have been written by a street pimp. The end is ... well, I do not want to ruin everything. Let's just say it looks unsatisfactory. I'd be more upset if the story was good to begin with. The direction is average with nothing truly wonderful, but nothing that is really painful to watch as well. To reiterate the performance, the only one who does something worth watching is Keitel. Although I could have survived without seeing him in tiger-print bikini panties. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, Eddie Bunker shows up. As random as it may be, this is how it is random in the movie. And Tarantino does his director a favor by showing up for about 20 seconds.
