Yes, of course, the movie that her visuals already made seemed horrible and not very promising, but the premise and cast seemed good, so I still hoped to be entertained with this movie. This, however, was unfortunately not the case. The premise is good, but the story is full of improbabilities and is logically flawed. <br /> <br /> This movie has the potential to fall into the toilet. The main plot is interesting and a bit original. It's good enough to make a good adventure movie you'd think. This film however can not entertain and I think this is the biggest flaw of this movie. Maybe taking it too seriously and a little more humor would certainly not have made the movie any bad. Instead, it's now nothing more than a cheap and lame movie, filled with one unlikely event after another, which also steals a bit too much from other, more successful films. Mainly "Jurassic Park", obviously. <br /> <br /> The characters also do not help make the movie more attractive or at least interesting to watch. I still think Edward Burns did a decent job as the main 'heroic'. The rest of the characters, however, really get confused in the movie and they get very uninteresting to do. The film depends on its look, which is extremely poor. Catherine McCormack also plays a very annoying character. Basically all she does is complain and talk about how she was right and the rest, oh, so wrong. Your character is simply not nice. And the rest of the characters ... well I've forgotten their names, I think that's saying enough about them. Certainly it is true that the performance of Ben Kingsley is only worth watching this movie. He's really excellent at his kind of villainous business man role, but from the moment he disappears from the movie, the movie really comes down quickly. <br /> <br /> Visually the film is extremely poor. It has some scary CGI effects and they could not even get the simpler "blue screen" effects to look convincing in the movie. The scenarios are also horrible and cheap, as if they could fall and break every moment. <br /> <br /> The film never gets tense, exciting or adventurous, since the story is brought in the least interesting and engaging way possible. . It's a very distant movie with distant characters that do not impress. There are many action sequences, but all of them are so ridiculous and far from believable that they are never tense or good enough. <br /> <br /> So basically this movie is lacking in everything that is needed to make a movie genre like this a good and successful. It's sad to see how bassist Peter Hyams has sank in the last two years after making good movies in the '70s and' 80s.
