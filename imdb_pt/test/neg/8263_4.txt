I agree with most of the reviewers above. Moreover, I was shocked by the presentation of the love scenes with the homosexual couple. Because? because while they - the director, the producers - had no compulsion to present the different heterosexual couples in the most passionate embraces including nudity and super close-ups of French kisses and all kinds of naked contortions in bed, completely unnecessary in their duration and in the story, when it came time to show the same experiences with the homosexual couple, they just dare to go as far as a painfully painful embrace, almost between academic laughter, with two very nervous actors. So, in reality, the producers of this film found homosexuality as NOT NATURAL, as one of the characters says in some scene. What a difference with the Spanish cinema !! I remember being in the projection of an Almodóvar movie at an Italian cinema in Rome, and being completely surprised by the total lack of reaction from the Italian audience, they were afraid to have a reaction !! when in Spain people fell from their seats laughing at all the situations of laughter and the fabulous wit and talent of Almodôvar. Obviously, in Italy, there are dark forces in its history that prevent the free manifestation of some normal and natural emotions. Feather. I must add that I was quite surprised to discover that this same comment was censored by another correspondent. It is very bad and dangerous when we can not allow the narrowness of others to express our opinions on certain subjects. Where is freedom of expression? I do not know if this censor will approve the changes I have been forced to make in this comment, and I hope he will not receive the same treatment from some other limited court. Sorry again.
