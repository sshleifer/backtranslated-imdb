Some friends and I have the weird hobby of looking for really horrifying and absolutely obscure horror movies (for good reason) and then watching them under the influence of mind-expanding consumer goods like alcohol and / or light drugs. Surely many people do this, but watch movies like the remake "Godzilla," while we torment our eyes and brains with things like "The Loch Ness Horror". And, eureka, this is a bad prototypical movie! We have traditionally opened with pen music during the opening credits. This is of course to further emphasize for us stupid spectators that the story should happen in the Scottish highlights and not in the birthplace of director Larry Buchanan, Texas. For the same reason, cast members are apparently also instructed to act excessively and speak with conversations with atrocious accents. The North American marine biologist Prof. George Sanderson arrives at Loch Ness with new and highly sophisticated sonar equipment to track the legendary monster's whereabouts on the lake. Meanwhile, there are many other parties hanging around the lake, such as a group of children in a Science Camp (what a tedious way to spend their vacation), retired generals looking for a Luftwaffe plane that crashed into the lake during World War II World. of thieves and unsuccessful scientists who are preparing the monster's egg. You would think that these numerous sub-packages bring some diversity and enthusiasm in the plot, but unfortunately this is not the case. "Loch Ness Horror" is a boring film with only a few notable elements. The monster itself, for example, is a delightfully kitschy creation with cute eyes and a smoky breath. Your teeth also glow in the dark, which is quite useful when you're dumb enough to go out on a boat ride in the middle of the night. Near the end of the movie, the remaining cast members were more interested in the lost Luftwaffe plane than the monster, so it was time to complete it. "Loch Ness Horror" is carefully recommended in case you are a fan of bad B movies from the 80s, but be aware that it contains an overload of meaningless dialogues and a bizarre ending that makes it look like the movie was suddenly shot. out of budget.
