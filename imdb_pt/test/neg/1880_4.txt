In addition to the DA (James Eckhouse), and a brief appearance of the woman who is convincingly sympathetic to Ellen Gulden's (Renee Zellweger) situation, Ellen herself is the only convincing character - and sympathetic character in the film. She is the only one, not her dying mother, who should be and is - the only true thing. is not only on paper, on Zellweger's acting, but also on the plot itself ... Until the plot turns against itself - and makes the mother the "only true thing" in the eyes of her weak and superficial husband who can not do anything right for your wife or daughter. The daughter realizes what the viewer perceives, but these intelligent perceptions must give way to the superficial feeling of the husband, who is discouraged by the realities of his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the only powerful scene in this whole movie, when Ellen confronts her father's cruelty, is given the lie in the end. Ellen is just another strong young woman who must be tamed by a weeping father. A very flawed film - so flawed to the point of being called annoying and not worth it.
