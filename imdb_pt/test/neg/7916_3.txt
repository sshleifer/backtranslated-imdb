I'm glad I did not wait long when I saw this sequence of one of my favorite children's films. The plot was monotonous and unconvincing, as were the characters, and I was disappointed that some of the characters in the original were not in that sequence. I also did not think the characters were similar to the previous movie. Charlie had changed and now he has a girlfriend. The first movie had good music, but the music in this movie was memorable. In short, this movie just did not do it for me. And looking at the feedback from other users, it seems like it did not do that for many of you. Not worth watching.
