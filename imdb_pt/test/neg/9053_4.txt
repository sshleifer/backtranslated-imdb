Eaten Alive is a small movie that opens in New York City and the Arctic where male tribes throw snake venom at some people, so a woman enters the police station that is trying to find her sister who disappeared after 6 months Sheila is from Alabama , but her accent is lousy, she joins an adventurer who seems to just want her money and seems to say that much throughout the film. They venture into the Amazon just to find a community with people and they meet the sister, they are confronted by a crazy man who has probably seen many preaching from Jim Jones. It will take them to a better place, it may be heaven, but no, Mark and Sheila later discover that it is a suicide cult. <br /> <Why do I call Eaten Alive a "little movie"? I'll tell you, but when I watched, I was shocked by all the trouble with the cannibals, Robert Kerman plays a different role from his teacher in Cannibal Holocaust. He's a bit annoying, since we found him in an arm-wrestling that looked like Russian roulette, we know he's a tough guy. Also, the strong misogyny only makes you cringe and it seemed like I saw you in some place, oh the scenes of animals killing themselves. But the whole movie turns in these scenes, it's like they're actually watching nature images with parts of a movie But after watching this movie I realized that most of the movie scenes are taken of other cannibal films, even the disappearance of two of the characters, well ... most of the movie is. That's why I call this small movie, when I discovered that the scenes were borrowed, I felt like playing the disc of the other side of the room, this is not a film just a simple assembly.
