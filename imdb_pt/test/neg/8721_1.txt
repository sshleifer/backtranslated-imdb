The Dune miniseries opens with a flashforward montage of action sequences. The realization quickly reveals that these are the * best * scenes of the 265-minute length, and they are not good. Not good. Oh gosh. <br /> <br /> But let's not judge a book by its cover (even if it's exactly what we're being asked to do). Let's give Dune a chance to redeem himself. <br /> <br /> Well, here is the expected opening of Caladan. But who is this petulant and strangely ugly man? Paul Atreides? * This * is Paul Atreides? This generic plastic doll? And why does he look so old? What is it? Is the actor only 25 years old? Well, he does not look *, and that's too old anyway. <br /> <br /> But at least he has charisma, right? Wrong. Alec Newman is a grumpy, stumbling clown. I'm imagining him being discovered sitting in the dark in a corrective action class because no one liked him enough to say that class is over, and he's too dumb to realize it. When his Paul Atreides has all the presence of soggy toasts, and a performance ranging from "petulant" to "empty," his production of Dune is doomed from the start. <br /> <br /> The other actors pity the poor. Alec though, and give evenly insipid and incomprehensible performances so that it does not look so bad by comparison. At least, I assume that's what they're doing. Because I'm charitable, you see. <br /> <br /> To be fair, they clearly do not get any direction. Random gestures, empty or inconsistent deliveries, lack of their brands, it's all here. This is like a master class on how not to do it. <br /> <br /> And sure enough, there are more elements of the book in this miniseries than in the 1984 movie, but there is no double because of everything. Pause Fill. Time. <br /> <br /> But we can forgive all this because of the small budget of $ 20 million, or just $ 5 million per hour. No one could expect to do quality science fiction with this kind of budget. <br /> <br /> Except perhaps "Stargate SG-1," which earns $ 1.4 million per 50-minute episode, or "Farscape" for $ 2 million. And frankly, I'd rather watch four episodes of either of them while they're punched in the kidneys, than having to sit around with the scam that's Dune, the mini-series again.
