Shakespeare would have been outraged. The writers mutilated Shakespeare's incredible work. Ariel is the only credible acting performance. African voodoo, the isolated swamp and the character "Gator Man" make the film a mockery of the true Shakespearean Tempest. <br /> <br /> Do not lose your sight in this movie.
