Along with his turn in the super-sleazy 'classic' THE TOOLBOX MURDERS (1978), this is considered the worst terror effort of Cameron Mitchell. It's a bit too slow for my taste, it has zero friendly characters and little action to the end, but Mitchell's central performance of revenge, Vincent Rinard, is fun. Not Anthony Perkins good, remember, but definitely fun enough. As a parody of the superficial concept that is Hollywood, that's all; like a horror movie, is also fair. And even as a simple vintage exploitation image, that's okay. I'm a big fan of the unnecessary free-dance sequence, so I was also grateful for the Gazzarri Dancers' appearance, which they just mastered. Five of them do a crazy dance routine of "thrashin hair-thrashin", "sliding the floor" and "wagging the hip" to "Do not Cry, Look for the Rainbow" by T-Bones. Watching these jumping women with huge smiles on their faces in their fringed bikini top and parachute pants set is one reason that defines why I give this a slightly higher rating than usual. Previous Movie Makeup The man Vincent Rinard ("The Best since Lon Chaney!") goes after the people at Paragon Studios. A flashback shows how Max Black (Berry Kroeger), a jealous and drunk studio executive, threw wine into Vinnie's face as he was about to light a smoke. He is engulfed in flames and dives into a pool, but not before healing one side of the face and losing an eye (not to mention his sanity). Now employed by the "world-famous" Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park, Calif., Vincent uses a special serum (described as a blend of truth serum, medicine for nerves and special "vitamins and minerals" ... Beware of Centrum! ) to paralyze the victims. They disappear and the dense detectives in the case (headed by Scott Brady) are perplexed when new "statues" are put on display in the museum. Vince speaks to himself ("I'm a very good man!"), Smokes, whispers, whistles and describes how he gets "excited" at the sound of a woman's scream. <br /> He also has to deal with a lot of selfish scoundrels and witches, most of whom deserve what is coming to them. There's also Nick (Hollis Morrison), an intoxicating, intoxicated museum tour guide who sees a 'statue' blink but does not go to the cops. In addition to Max (a first-class idiot ... who does not even die!) And the stupid cops, the other two main roles are women and both are very atrocious. Marie Morgan (Anne Helm) is not your typical innocent heroine; this bum was hired for no fewer than five different characters in this movie (!), including Vince, Max and two of the missing male wax / male mannequins (I think she never had time to tempt the missing girl). For some reason, she also begs and begs in her annoying baby voice for Vince to give him a 'replica' of the head he's projecting from the youngest missing actor (and fiance number 5) Tony Deen (Phillip Baird). She does not know that Vince has already stuck a syringe in the back of his neck, but I love it when Mitchell dryly agrees with his demands "so you can completely withdraw into reality." He also wants her to "pose" for him, which means she ended up being held prisoner in a box. Unfortunately, the box has a hole where her head is left open, so we have to continue being beaten by her sharp moans. <br /> <br /> The other "woman" is Theresa (Victoria Carroll), one of the go-go girls already mentioned. She was first seen proving that she is completely deficient in rhythm, swaying onstage in a lemon-fringed bikini. Theresa is tolerable before you speak, but when you realize that your combined presence combines Lorraine Bracco's abrasiveness with the Lander sisters' head mentality, you want Vincent to inject the serum as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we are first subjected to a scene in which she makes endless demands on the studio boss and runs through the museum trying to avoid Mitchell. She and the rest of the characters are completely unsympathetic, but they act as a way of mocking the Hollywood system in general, I guess. And I'm probably giving more credit to this movie than it really deserves. The plus points are few and far between, but include (besides Mitchell and the dance routine) colorful, slightly stylized lighting and a bizarre ending that seems to suggest that Rinard will be severely punished for his crimes, spending the rest of his life in his own personal hell ... Married to Marie! Wow, now this is scary. Also in the cast are director John "Buddy" Cardos (also the production manager) as police sergeant. , James Forrest as film director, Virgil Frye as a statue, Rini Martin and Kent Osborne as bartender. Many of the people who worked on this (including executive producer and screenwriter Rex Carlton) also worked on Al Adamson's movie, DRACULA CASTLE and other atrocities. <br /> <br /> My score: 4 out of 10
