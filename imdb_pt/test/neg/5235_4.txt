After the exuberant and inspiring fast-moving aerial shot at the opening of the movie, this turned into total boredom and a note of a tone to the end. Where to start, well, I'll start with the characters. I really liked them in the book, here they were all types and idiots of one dimension who either had "Victims" or "Asshole" written on their foreheads from the beginning. As someone who has not seen through the shop owner, Lealand Gaunt (in a Sydrow performance), is beyond me. <br /> <br /> This movie has no emotion, suspense and, in a sense, yes. , fun values. It stretches for a long time, without much reward. Why introduce many kinds of annoying characters and then forget about half of them in the middle? In the book, virtually everyone who entered the store encountered a terrible fate. Here, in addition to one of the only decent scenes that translated well from the novel (the fight between Wilma and Nettie), it was a disappointment and did not have much courage. I'm sorry, but then an off-screen death, a boring shot, and some fights and then some blasts just did not do that for me. The brutality and petty cruelty of the book were sadly lost. The explosion of the church scene was so exaggerated and badly executed, suddenly the whole city was in a fight? It made no sense and the characters who were not introduced all of the time suddenly are, who are these people and why should I care? <br /> <br /> The story is everywhere and none of the scenes had the right time. . I thought Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedeila were good actors in that, but the movie does not give enough substance for me to give a damn. Amanda Plummer was credible, but very pathetic to really be understanding (in the novel she was a sad and depressing character), here was a note too. J.T. Walsh was fun, but the paper was far from interesting or layered. Very predictable. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was very elegant for the material it was supporting. He stood out like a sore thumb. Easy, friend, easy. Something a little less theatrical, I'd say it would have worked. <br /> <br /> I admit that part of the blood he got was good enough, I think, the director seemed to hold on too often. Although. If you're going to make a movie that reaches the point of 2 hours, make sure you have a lot more going on then this disaster adapting the best novels of the Kings. <br /> <br /> I always see myself laughing at scenes that I was supposed to be taken seriously (Ed Harris's speech at the end, or the Hugh Priest character in general), and I was bored and disinterested most of the time. Personally, the director should have done a lot more with this story, his approach is very meek and he hides behind a lot of clear cinematography to become a decent movie. The movie looks good, but not the look I think this story deserved. I mean, this guy ran ALASKA, not a good sign. <br /> <br /> I'd rather just read the book, as you should too, as if it were a lot more fun, layered character development, violence and clutter, an unpleasant sense of humor, and much more power. This is a massacred version, which does not have much to offer. out of ****
