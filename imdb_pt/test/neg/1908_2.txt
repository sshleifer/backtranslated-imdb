All I have to say is one word ... SUCKS !!!! The only reason I gave it a 2 is because Josh Hartnett was in it and he's cool. You should have beaten those Klein folks ... stupid ass and no brains. At the end of this movie you do not support Klein and you really do not care what happens to Leelee. Hartnett was the only good thing about it.
