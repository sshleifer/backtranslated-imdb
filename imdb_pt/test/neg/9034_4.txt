Marked for Death (1990) spends more time on action sequences than focusing on their characters. After his first two striking efforts, Above the Law (1988) and Hard to Kill (1989), this third Steven Seagal film makes clear the idea: anyone who opposes him must seem like a fool; the bad guys are just there to make it look good. Seagal was building an audience that seemed a little bigger than those who follow the antics of Chuck Norris or Jean Claude. Van Damme. <br /> <br /> In Marked for Death, Seagal throws aside any pretension to style and drives at full speed for exploration. This film contains a lot of graphic violence, gore and nudity that seems to be there for no reason other than to please viewers, who are unable to distinguish between action images that tell a story and those that simply shed emotions without rhyme or reason. And he deserves real blame for this lapse of taste as a producer of "Marked by Death." Seagal plays John Hatcher, a retired DEA agent who returns to Chicago, where his family is being attacked. by a Jamaican street gang who attacks his sister's house, and the film proves he is not scrupulous when Hatcher's niece (Danielle Harris) is shot in the crossfire. Hatcher goes crazy, and he decides to join his old friend, Max (Keith David), a school gym teacher, and Charles (Tom Wright), a Jamaican cop. <br /> <br /> Of course, Hatcher declares war. about the evil boss, a stick-faced Jamaican voodoo priest named Screwface (Basil Wallace), a nickname that apparently means "outrageous exaggeration." <br /> <br /> And it's almost unbelievable in the way Seagal chooses several members of the gang: he rips the eyeball off a guy, breaks a guy's back and breaks several limbs and arms. <br /> </ p> <p> All logic for this movie is thrown out of the window - through the glass, that is. Why are not Hatcher and his friends accused of all the material damage done or the body count that accumulates? And how did they get their automatic weapons cache from Illinois to Jamaica by plane undetected? Seagal has a Clint Eastwood stoicism about him that fans once seemed to like, and despite the three different characters he has played in so many movies, each one wears an oriental black bathrobe and wears a Ponytail. One of the problems I have with some of Seagal's movies is that the protagonists never seem to be seriously in danger, and since he's the star, of course, no one can put a glove on him except for the bad guy. Seagal's heroes are all interchangeable, as are most plot lines and action sequences. Regardless of disguising yourself as a ship's cook, fireman or LA cop, Seagal is always Seagal, which is exactly what your fans want. In fact, the sameness of these films is such that, if I wanted to, I could do an old revision, change the names, and get a fairly accurate view of the new movie. Not that I really did this ...
