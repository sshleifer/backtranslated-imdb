My wife and I watched this after DVR'ing out of the Encore action last week. It has to be the worst horror movie we've ever seen. Predictable dialogue (my wife and I were guessing the lines before they were spoken), fake special effects, a script that spread all over the place. I think the most annoying part was the stereotype of the various characters in the plot, not to mention the free sex scene between two of the young heroines in the movie, none of which had any other purpose than revealing certain parts. from their anatomy to the cameras. This movie should be categorized as comedy, not horror, as film villains (spiders) were animated in stop motion and not believable. I can not say I would have done a better job making a movie myself, but it was very amateurish and it was not even a "B" movie, somewhere closer to a "d" movie, or "f" if that it's possible. I think even Science Fiction 3000 would have to go through this!
