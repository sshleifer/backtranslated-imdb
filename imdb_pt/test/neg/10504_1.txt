This movie was pathetically horrible. The sound was terrible, the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating. If you have a life, do not watch this movie because you will want to kill yourself. This movie completely rips Blade (which is undoubtedly a very good movie ... or trilogy that I should say). <br /> <br /> I do not care who the actors are, this movie is just awful. I watched 10 minutes of this and had to come to my computer and comment on how this movie is just bad. I do not really know why my family is still watching ... ah, wait, yes I know. They are laughing almost non-stop at stupid action, dialogue and acting.
