Lost in the movies, but was always slightly compelled. I found it in the bin at my local video store for two bucks! Am I going to give it to anyone? Probably! No purposeful plot, one-dimensional characters, the plastic world ripped from many better films, no decent dialogue to speak of. Do you know that empty feeling when it comes down from the ecstasy? It is this feeling here. The saddest thing is that the Australia I know is heading in that direction, without the melodrama and the simple answers. It's just interesting to see the older Australian actors (who had to AGIR back in their day to survive) against the younger Australian actors (who have to look good to survive). As a horribly gaudy narrative introduction to a movie clip that never really begins ... Poor Kylie, began her career as an actress too ...
