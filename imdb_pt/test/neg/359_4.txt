The Golden Arm Man (the movie) is a decent career vehicle for Frank Sinatra, but fails abysmally as a good adaptation of a fantastic book. You always hear about how books are "modified" when they are made into movies - things are cut, simplified, etc. Well, you can not even say that they "changed" anything with the movie - they just said a completely different story. story. The characters and scenarios are the same - but not the ambiguous characterization, the depth of the men and women of the Polish Chicago in the book. As for the scenery, it has become just a stage of play, complete with unnecessary "supporting actors" traversing the claustrophobic streets of the interior. The film is a completely different view of Frankie Machine and drug addiction. When that happens, Zosh, Frankie, Sparrow, everyone loses their psychological advantage. Frankie's drumming, a modest dream in the book, becomes his passion in the film (probably because Sinatra is a musician). And drug addiction is treated as a trap, exploring. The acting is decent, especially Louie, who is more menacing in the movie than the book. But it's a shame that this kind of film can be considered a classic alongside the book on which it is based, the true story of Frankie Machine. The movie only serves to show that Hollywood can "hit anything" without filling the bag and add a happy ending. In this case, they just completely changed, cheapening an important and realistic story for Hollywood everyday. I'm sure I'm biased because I read the book first so I can not treat the film honestly knowing how good the book is. I actually thought about turning the movie off (and never do that), just so as not to be confused by the beauty of the book. But this is an overrated movie and although not so bad, the book should come first, since it was the first. And it should have been the only story of Division Street and Frankie Machine.
