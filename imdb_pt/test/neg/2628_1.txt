Milo is a complete steal from the 1992 slasher movie, Mikey, if you really check out both movies have the same slogan! But if you want to watch an incredibly funny movie with absolutely no plot ...... well then this is the movie for you. The acting is terrible and the flashback scenes are incredibly confusing. The story behind this atrocity is simple Milo Jeeder is a boy with serious family problems, his father is a medical abortion who keeps feoutus in gestation (NICE!) And was desperate for a child of his own, he discovered a way to bring one of these children aborted for life and he named him ............. MILO !!!!! <br /> <br /> In addition to all bad deeds, terrible, annoying direction The sound of Milo's voice and the sound of the bell of your bicycle, if you take away all this evil, is still a bad but funny attempt, of a movie. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give a bank 1 out of 10
