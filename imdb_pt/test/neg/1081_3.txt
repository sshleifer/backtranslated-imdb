A ridiculous, poorly acted Mini Cooper infomercial. Includes special participation from Pepsi, Dell, etc. <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing worth redeeming here. Particularly bad are Donald Sutherland, the soundtrack, scene transitions, etc. An embarrassing production. <br /> <br /> Hey, we SHOULD pay you to watch this.
