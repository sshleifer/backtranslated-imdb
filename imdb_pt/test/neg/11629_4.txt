Let's get things straight. I was brought up as a Catholic and a very religious family, and I spent so much time in church and talking to priests and at home. This was useful for two things: to make me a committed atheist and to give me a deep and insightful knowledge of the Church and its dogmas. And I say: if a Catholic priest witnesses a murder and clearly sees the face of the murderer, he can report it to the police, even if the murderer has confessed to him later. He can not reveal what is said in confession, but he can talk about anything he sees outside, and confession is useless to keep his mouth shut. So, here we have a film totally based on a lie. And another lie is that there is no acquittal for murder. According to the Catholic Church, there is absolution for any sin, provided there is sincere repentance. So far, the biggest breakthroughs in this weak thriller. <br /> <br /> As people say, this movie would have improved if Bob Hoskins and Alan Bates switched places. Hoskins is naturally fit to play gangsters (I'll never regret enough that he lost Al Capone in favor of one of De Niro's weaker performances in "The Untouchables") and Bates's features would have been perfect as the priest with a past Gray. But above that, I think the film would have been much better if Liam Neeson, in Ulster's real life (in the time unknown to large audiences) played the role of Mickey Rourke. Not only is his face perfect for playing tormented characters, but he makes us believe that the character is real, something Rourke simply can not. In the 1980s, Rourke was not a bad actor (afterwards he seemed to lose his talent along with his appearance), but he was one of those artists, like Brad Dourif, who is as good as the director he works with. And as a former IRA terrorist, Rourke's acting is more like a pimp. It's sad to think that this movie was made just three or six years later (when Neeson achieved moderate celebrity status in 1990 with Sam Raimi's entertaining "Darkman" and stardom in 1993 with "Schindler's List"), while Rourke has made it almost a forgotten has been), Liam and Mickey could have switched parts for greater benefit (Rourke would have been effective in the supporting role of Docherty, but simply can not take this film as the leader). One more missed opportunity, and yet another movie with the potential to be a classic, it has instantly become forgettable. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the score often criticized (by underestimated composer Bill Conti) worked for me. I did not find it overly melodramatic, but adequately brave and handsome. It reminded me of Howard Shore's score for "The Silence of the Lambs." Here's the talent of Mike Hodges, who did "Get Carter", yes, but do not forget that he's the brain behind "Flash Gordon" too ... It looks like the movie went massacred in the film. cutting room (it shows, as some parts are really hectic and confusing, and others just do not stick) and the Cutter of a Director is waiting to see the light. Okay, but I seriously doubt that makes it a great movie, because we still have the bad cast and the false premise there. 4/10
