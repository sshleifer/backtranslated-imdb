Honestly, this movie is weak. Very weak. Only the upper case character can be something. She works as a supercharger on bad engines ... so if you like redheaded Valkyries - see that. But better find Brigitte's picture as Sonja and put it on the desktop. It will save you from disappointments. Well, Arnold also makes his deal ... but definitely his role is not better. Other characters - bad is not that word. Sword fights? Ridiculous Monsters. The plot is really embarrassing. Why did it have to be raped? Especially, we do not see it. <br /> <br /> Either way, the movie is weak. Although worse movies exist ... Without main characters, it would just be orgasm. And if anyone discusses this, maybe ...
