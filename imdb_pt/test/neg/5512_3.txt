This film is a desperate attempt to ride the fringes of the success of Star Wars movies. The film uses recycled footage from "Battle Beyond the Sars," which is another Roger Corman Sci-Fi Turd, but at least this is better than "Battle Beyond the Stars" - there is no real acting in this film (but it's a Roger Corman movie-What did you expect) again all the soundtrack was done on a keyboard / synthesizer, the sound effects are recycled from "Battlestar Galactica" - there are no special effects because they were recycled / rearranged scenes of another movie space, the costumes look like something out of the Salvation Army's salvage of 1981. Ironically, the little boy in this movie does an infernal performance, and he resurfaced again to star in Sylvester Stallone's "Over the Top" movie - I give that movie 3 stars of 10
