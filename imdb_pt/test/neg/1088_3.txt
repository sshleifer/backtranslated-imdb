American Tourist in tourist package in Asia suffering recent bereavement decides to break the law by: 1 ignoring the curfew; 2 Joining the revolutionary army; 3 Possessing and using illegal firearms ...... etc etc. What is meant to be a political and educational statement about the so-called atrocities of a military dictatorship in Asia ends as a travel guide for disillusioned Americans. ... especially those who wish to protest that the water in the hotel does not work .... Unfortunately the authors of this silly thread have no idea about Asia ... nor does it seem in writing to be a sensible dialogue ... example: Our heroine human rights searching desperately for medicines at the farthest reaches of the Asian jungle, miles from anywhere, comes across a peasant and asks, "Excuse me, does this town have a pharmacy?" know anything about the Asian jungle will appreciate how ridiculous this scenario really is .... Mind that I was recently in the Thai jungle and an American asked me .... "excuse me .... you know where MacDonalds is ? "This film purports to be a serious drama but ends as a parody and theft of all sorts of" killer "movies designed to confirm the Asian stereotype maintained by much of Western" civilization "and reinforced by Hollywood Fantasies. such as this ..... The basic message of this image is: "we Americans ... coming from the worlds, only true democracy has the divine right to go to all other nations ... and correct their mistakes. .. ..create-up your environment .... and teach them about freedom ..... "(see, for example, the beach ...... at least Leo did this with a little more style) .... of course that Vietnam is another story .... And ..... the educated Asian may well ask why Yankie Gungh-Ho's attitude about Asia should come from a nation whose main contribution to humanity has helped spread cancer ... Aids .. Gun carrying children and Jerry Springer ...... et al .. At the end of this picture the cynical viewer may well be rooting for the Burmese military. .... 3 out of 10. <br />
