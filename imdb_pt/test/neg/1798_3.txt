Roeg's opinion of Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" was not exactly what I expected. Although based on one of the most studied and interesting texts in history, the film ended up getting a bit boring. History simply never understands the viewer. He simply appears in an indifferent way. <br /> <br /> The traces of the text are easily seen, but it's still not really Conrad's "Heart of Darkness." The screenplay by Benedict Fitzgerald (who also wrote "The Passion of the Christ") uses only Conrad as inspiration, and thus becomes Fitzgerald's "Heart of Darkness". The movie is simply not worth it unless you are particularly interested in Conrad or perhaps John Malkovich.
