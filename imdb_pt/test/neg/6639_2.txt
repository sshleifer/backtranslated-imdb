Humor is nonexistent in this movie loser. Carrot Top plays an inventor of surfer face that always blows the money of the rent in his goofy and useless inventions. Then he helps a broken old guy by the side of the road, and voila, he inherited a large corporation. And so on envious relatives, humanizing the corporation, hostile takeovers, compelling love interest ... ah ... let's just say that this movie is virtually impossible to watch. What Carrot Top has done is convince me to never go to their shows.
