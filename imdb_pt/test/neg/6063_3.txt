After the suicide of his father, Charlie 'Kid' Davis (Ray `Boom Boom 'Mancini) accepts the invitation and advice of his friend Tiny (Michael Chiklis) and travels to Las Vegas with him trying to become a boxer. On the road, they find Gina (Jennifer Beals) hitchhiking, they hitchhike to her and she becomes Charlie's girlfriend. Johnny Ticotin (Rod Steiger) is convinced by Tiny to be the couch of Charlie, and the powerful agent Alex Dumas (Joe Mantegna), after seeing him fight, becomes his manager, promoting Charlie's career. This movie is so boring that it does not really deserve much time writing about it. I do not like boxing, but sometimes I watch some interesting movie about it. But this one is horrible! Predictable, full of clich√©s, having a terrible lead actor, a sheer waste of time. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Body and Soul '(` Body and Soul')
