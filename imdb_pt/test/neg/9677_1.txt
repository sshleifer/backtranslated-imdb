Since this movie could be classified as Drama, I have no idea. If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen, I would be trying to erase it from my resume. It was as historically accurate as Xena and Hercules. Abraham and Moses merged in Noah. Lot, the nephew of Abraham, Lot, appears thousands of years before he was born. The Canaanites roamed the earth ... really? What were the writers thinking? It was only ignorance ("I remember something about Noah and the animals, Lot and Canaanites and all those Sunday School stuff") or they were trying to offend as many people as possible on the planet - of Christians, Jews and Muslims ? , for historians, archaeologists, geologists, psychologists, linguists ... indeed, was not someone offended? Anyone who had a little taste would have shivered with this!
