My God ... I have not seen such a horrible movie in a long ... long time ... I saw last night and wanted to leave after 20 minutes ... Keira Knightley tries really hard on this but she can not deal thereby. It gives a touch of accent every now and then and does not have the charisma to fill the role ... Sienna Millers acting takes you to a point where you start to wonder: has she ever had acting classes? judging by the edge of love she has never been to the acting class, but should consider going in the near future ... both look very handsome ... maybe that's what they should focus on in their future career ... if they can be actresses everyone can!
