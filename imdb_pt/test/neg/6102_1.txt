Clearly, the director, writers, and everyone else knows nothing about their own religion or about the people who practice it. This film is infinitely defective and, in general, a complete clay pot. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a scene where the rabbi enters the woman's ritual bath while a naked woman is bathing, puts her hand on a woman's head. there and bless her. This is a complete derision of the laws, in this scene only some of the broken laws include: Modesty, a rabbi would never enter a ritual bathroom while there were women in it. <br /> <br /> Inappropriate contact, a rabbi. would never lay a hand on a woman's head, not to mention that this is not how a blessing is given. <br /> <br /> The ritual bath woman is wetting a naked woman by pushing her head under the water. , ritual bath laws require that the whole body make direct contact with bath water; it means no one should be in touch with the person who is bathing, certainly not pushing them down! <br /> <br /> There was more to that scene than diving 13 times (where does this concept come from) not to mention the rest of the movie was a total fallacy. It's scary what ignorance can invent!
