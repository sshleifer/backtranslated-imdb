1993 was a time of change in WWE, but for this Wrestlemania they decided to go back in time when Hulk Hogan returned, along with his good friend Brutus Beefcake, who was out of wrestling since a paragliding accident in 1990. /> This was not a big event. Only two games had some real construction and the whole thing came off as being rushed. The action in the ring was not great and the turnaround at the end, which I'll discuss later, was not really the moment that WWE expected it to be. <br /> <br /> This forgettable night began with Shawn Micheals defending his Intercontinental Championship against undefeated Tatanka. Tatanka had beaten Michaels a few times leading up to the fight. Michaels had a new manager, Luna Vachon, while Tatanka was joined by former Michaels manager and future member of the WWE Hall of Fame Sherri Martel. Tatanka won by DQ. Michaels retained his title and went straight back into his rivalry with Marty Janetty, who was suspended for Wrestlemania only. Why, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Then the Steiner Brothers (Scott and Rick) defeated the Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) with Scott scoring the pin after beating Samu with the Frankensteiner. Good game. <br /> <br /> Doink the clown needed help from another clown to win his match against Crush. A second Doink distracted Crush when he was in complete control and allowing Doink to get the pin and victory. Doink was a fun character, who aged quickly. <br /> <br /> Razor Ramon easily defeated Bob Backlund's return in the next match. <br /> <br /> This brings us to the first place in our life. double main event. As the Mega Maniacs Team of Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake, with newly converted good-looking Jimmy Hart in his corner, faced Hart's old friends, Money Inc (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster). This was a rather superficial ending. Beefcake, as mentioned, was in a paragliding accident requiring a complete facial surgery and had struggled with a face mask. Shyster ripped off his mask and slapped Beefcake on a pulp. The referee went down, Hogan took the mask and knocked out DiBease and Shyster, and then Hart, who was wearing a referee's shirt, counted the three. Another judge came back and reversed the ruling, declaring the winners of Money Inc by DQ. <br /> <br /> Then Lex Luger or Narcissist, as he was also known at the time, defeated Mr. Perfect. This match happened because Luger was being managed by the former manager of Perfect, Bobby Heenan. Perfect had legs on the ropes when he was defeated, but the referee missed. The Undertaker had a lackluster win in HQ in a very bad game against Giants Gonzales. The Undertaker won the wrath of Gonzales coach Harvey Wippleman in 1992 and Taker had defeated his great monster Kamala in the Survivor Series. Wippleman vowed revenge and took him into the Royal Rumble as Gonzales attacked Taker, costing him the game. Gonzales dominated Undertaker in this match, but it was DQ to choke the Taker with chloroform. Weird finish for a bad game. <br /> <br /> This led us to our main event as WWE champion Bret Hart, seriously challenged as champion for the first time, put his title on the line against Fuji's uncontrollable monster Yokozuna. Yokozuna controlled the start, but Hart resisted and then took over. He had Yokozuna in the sniper, surely he would give up and Hart would be established as a heroic hero after eliminating the great monster. But Fuji had other ideas, throwing salt on Hart's face, leaving the Canadian helpless while Yokozuna picked up the pin. <br /> <br /> What a bad ending. But wait there comes Hulk Hogan. He's checking Hart to make sure he's okay. Suddenly, Fuji challenges Hogan to a WWE title right there. Hogan accepts. Fuji plays salt for Hogan, but beats Yokozuna instead. Hogan beats his leg and wins the match and title. What did I just watch? And then, what most fans thought would be the night we saw Hart settle down as a giant killer, or Yokozuna settle down as an unstoppable monster, we saw Hulk Hogan catching a nonsensical victory. A title he would not stand for three months. In fact, this was the only game that Hogan fought for WWE before the King of the Ring in June 1993.
