OK, if I was in the store and someone would ask me if the movie would be worth three dollars for the rent, I would have to say no. The plot was implausible. I have come to the conclusion that Keanu Reeves can not act. It can sometimes be painful to watch (although my wife thinks he is cute). Dan Aykroyd (who is usually great) was up to a bit disappointing as the corrupt cop. On the plus side, the plot (because it is forced) is unpredictable. Cameron Diaz was good.
