I watched a movie called Dark Talon, dated 1974. The credits for this movie are exactly the same as Dark Star, so I'll assume it was an alternate title. Dark Talon was not nearly as funny as all the others here say. The acting was idiotic, the editing slipshod and overall stupid. In the beginning, there's an annoying 70's song called "Benson, Arizona" that has absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Basically, the plot revolves around a small crew of an interstellar bomber circling bombing sites that are unstable. The bombs are sentient and respond to people. The mandatory disaster interrupts the communication between the bombs and the crew. One of the crew leaves and has an absurdly stupid existential conversation with the bomb that made no sense at all. The movie I saw was made in less than an hour and a half with commercials released, so I suspect that Dark Talon is an overrated version of Dark Star. <br /> <br /> The alien is a red inflatable beach ball spray painted with a pair of monster hands that he walks on. He was foolish and unconvincing as an alien. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that John Carpenter took part in it. His other films were much better.
