This movie is not worth anything. I mean, if you want to watch that kind of thing, go to Hollywood movies! This is totally a shame for Bollywood's name. Neal N Nikki seriously sucked! Never watch this movie. As for the actors, it seems that the acting genes have skipped a generation. Tanisha could not have used less and Uday Chopra was obviously chosen only because he was the director's spoiled son. (All this Halla Re was incredibly stupid) The songs are eh, and I hope the director does not spend a lot of money on it ... Bottom line, I hated the movie. Do not let your kids watch it, and if you have it in your home it's a stupid movie to discard it! Buy the CD if you need it. (Like I said, the songs are eh.) At least it's better than the movie.
