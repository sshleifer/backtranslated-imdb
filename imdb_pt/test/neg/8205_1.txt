This movie shows you what you can create if you have a camera, a little paint and cardboard, a toy ship, some friends who play in the community theater, and the incorrect notion that you can make a movie. The end result is an unstoppable waste of time that you will skip unless you take the DVD player out and throw it out the window first. <br /> <br /> Acting in the opening scene (especially for the rotund Lee Morgan as "Captain") and the toy ship "hitting" the rocks before the credits is a good indicator of what you are looking for (with all the foam, it seems that this "special effect" was filmed in a kitchen sink, I think Boyette thought he saved some money by doing the dishes at the same time). In terms of bad cinema, the funny thing is that "Dungeon of Harrow" seems to have inspired (perhaps coincidentally) the end of "Hands: The Hands of Fate". Yes, it's the same lame "I was the victim, and now I take the place of the crazy villain" ironic end. The biggest irony is that two inept and untalented filmmakers could make two equally mediocre horror films filmed in Texas and get away with it. <br /> <br /> The nerd Monotone Russ Harvey is a nobleman in a good family lineage (why they were great, never been approached), boring us while lamenting the death of his lineage and crest before his ship falling (we are also dealing with a monotonous narration throughout the film). Unfortunately, we are not so lucky. The toy ship of his family collides with some styrofoam in a sink and he is taken ashore with his swollen captain and a woman, conveniently deposited on a crazy island of the Earl. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the Count is visited by an evil spirit. who, dressed in a Blackstone Magic Kit costume, attacks him with various puppets (spiders, snakes, bats ... all disgusting things). The Count (William McNulty) outweighs Shatner and has a visibly difficult time maintaining a serious face through the madman's typical madness. <br /> <br /> I would also go crazy if I had to be in this mess. The woman is promptly killed by the count's ferocious dogs, and the two idiots are captured by her servant. The count accuses them of being pirates (apparently their worst fear), he slaps his servant (apparently his greatest joy), Fatboy is tortured, there is a woman who is a servant and one who is a nurse, the rotten witch Countess in the dungeon (she sings Nerdy Noble and is the only effective and frightening thing in the movie), a lot of futile dialogue at a dinner table, the weeping cape is killed while making a pathetic escape (seeing a sloth struggle with a bunch of lions) . . . It's all an ugly fog to me. I spent most of my time on the fast forward button. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the noble idiot and the nurse make an escape and think that they are going to be rescued by three boys in a rowboat on the lake (yes, we must believe that a lake is the ocean). They did not, since the nerd's hair turned gray and it scares the aspiring to ransom. Honestly, I think they simply took the opportunity to get away from this heinous movie while the world had the chance. They return to the castle, the nurse starts to rot like the countess (and her stomach, by this time), and we end up with these two getting ready to go down to the. . . DARGEON OF HARROW !!!! Blech! <br /> <br /> I love old and bad horror movies, but they must have some kind of entertainment value. I feel stolen, even at the low price of $ 5.99 for this cookie. The Mystery Science Theater would have trouble making it fun. I was taken by some crazy critics who claimed that this movie had atmosphere and some scary moments. Wrong! Avoid this tripe at all costs, and do not waste a buck if you find it in a bin somewhere. This film makes Corman's "The Terror" as a masterpiece of horror and atmosphere.
