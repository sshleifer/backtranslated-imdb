Words can hardly describe this movie. Loaded with ridiculous stereotypes, a silly storyline and poor music, this movie lacks virtually every category. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by IMDB's credits. This is not a Michael Dorn movie. He is a minor character in the grand scheme. <br /> <br /> Also listed on the credit is an actor named "Prince" - which makes me wonder if it's the same artist formerly known as .... So again, I'm not sure if it's worth watching to that movie just for that. <br /> <br /> Summary: A bunch of teams ... one has kidneys ... one has $ 35,000 ... has an "illegal". Substance ".... and one has $ 350,000.Add some confusion and confusion about who needs to find who, get revenge for being taken, and such, and you end up with that mess of a movie. /> If I had a choice, I would pass this movie.
