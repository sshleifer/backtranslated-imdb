Although I think that the critics who hate this movie have encapsulated exactly what they do wrong (everything!), I had to add my two cents. If you want a long version of how horrible this movie is, please read the review made by bunnies. <br /> <br /> Here's the short version: the shameless use of the actors' NAMES to push the plot instead of using their talent (no one brought their "game" for it), brazen commercialism (I think Pepsi can afford to put an ad - or 40 - into a movie now), and a plot (???) that was so complicated "Rock Star" clich√©s that it was totally ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Let me put it to you this way. . . I was thinking 'Wayne's World' all the time watching this movie, but I was not laughing! Every time you try to play Steven Tyler (Aerosmith) to aid in your movie plot, you will have serious problems. <br /> <br /> PLEASE tell your friends and family - this movie sucks.
