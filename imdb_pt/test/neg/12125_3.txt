Ok, so I know better than watching movies on SciFi. . . er, sorry. . . SyFy Or shifafa. Or whatever it is now. Then sue me. I spent all my Saturday brainstorming for a non-profit organization. I can be forgiven for throwing myself in the armchair and wanting to watch a movie I've never seen, instead of reading Proust in the original or learning to play the oud. <br /> <br /> What's the same as saying: I did not deserve Open Graves. Of which I did not see any, by the way. Was there any? I slept? Why is this called? <br /> <br /> Some disgusting visuals. Not many scares. As with many films in modern horror movies, no reason is given - apart from shared humanity - to care about any of these people. Half a point, however, for the legless businessman, who was clich√©, but had a good scene. <br /> <br /> Play everything as Final Destination, made in a board game. The game has an intriguing appearance and involves one of my old favorite puzzles. I'm going to give it so much. The downside is that the game had more personality than most characters. <br /> <br /> As for the end, if you have not seen, then I think you've fallen asleep. Somewhere back at dawn of the genre.
