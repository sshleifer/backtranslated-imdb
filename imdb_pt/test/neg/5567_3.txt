In the early 00's, producers had a short-lived craze for supernatural genres in France after "The Crimson Rivers" and "Brotherhood of the Wolf" became successes, so several films were enlightened or saved from their films . France, unlike the US, UK or Italy, has little tradition of fantasy B movies and soon discovered that the sequences of "Samouraïs", "Bloody Mallory" or "Crimson Rivers" were reckless attempts to re-create a kind of magic that never existed in French cinema.When they failed, the producers returned to their usual routine: derived farces or the self-referential tribute to the French New Wave by a former critic of "Les Cahiers du cinéma. "<br /> <br />" Brocéliande "could only have been lit green during this small window, since it serves no other discernible purpose. <br /> <br /> It is his horror film, mixed with vague mythological elements and references of terror, and you'll find female characters in bimboesque, a French university looking like an American campus and so lazy that you do not even care, because you guessed it.one alone an hour before, even before f ilme begin. <br /> <br /> These elements make all the fun of a B movie from the 70's or 80's and you expect them in a movie from the 70's or 80's. However, it's not the 80's anymore and no one warned director Doug Headline, as this tribute to the horror movie genre is nothing more than a derivative horror film. The title itself is not a beginner and has written as a critic about this kind of photos since the early 1980s, but as a director for the first time it shows a lack of skill and ambition that makes "Brocéliande" a boring one. <br /> <br /> When you gather clichés from a subcategory of films and hand them over to a skilled and inventive director like Wes Craven or Quentin Tarantino, you get a "Scream" or a "Death Proof", movies that are imitations of guilty old pleasures, but also amplify these clichés and add much to them. This is called "talent" and that is why you can not confuse these recent films with their original inspirations filmed decades ago. <br /> <br /> "Brocéliande" takes the lazy path and only reproduces the worst elements of past films (unfortunately for the male viewer, free nudity is mostly lacking). There are very strong (presumably unintentional) similarities between the plot of "Brocéliande" and "Halloween 3: The Witch's Season," as both deal with supernatural druidic evil rituals and some silly attempt to rule the world on the night of Halloween. As even the plot of "Halloween 3" makes more sense than this, it means that something seriously wrong was with "Brocéliande".
