From the beginning, this movie drags and trails. Clumsy overdubs explaining history, monochrome performance, boring sets, total absence of any mankind, verve or style. The actors seem to be stoned. Potentially, an interesting story completely wasted. Surely someone realized how bad it was at some point to produce it?
