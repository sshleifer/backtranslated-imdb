Not having read the original book or seen the previous film, and not knowing anything about the plot of any of these or the current movie, I came to this movie with an open mind. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to know where to get a comment about the movie, because the whole thing seems so confusing. It seems like there is a point or a message or something in the movie, but what this is remains completely unclear. <br /> <br /> The effects were fantastic and very well judged. The idea was created very well with the motivation for time travel clearly defined. However it was downhill from here. <br /> <br /> The entire time travel seems to have only the most vague connection to the search that was set at the beginning. There are some good ideas, but they seem to be isolated occurrences that do not really flow and make the film look messy and lost. At one point, one wonders if the movie's main story is the fate of the Moon. When Hartdegen arrives in 802,701 AD, the film becomes very frustrating as he seems to be unable to discover anything important. about Eloi, and although it seems clear that there is something to discover, what is remains irritatingly elusive. This is a rather strange change from previous instances of time travel and we wonder why all of this was suddenly abandoned by what appears to be a completely new story. So many things happen that there should be an explanation, but there is no discovery. I really, really wanted to know what the movie was "coming", what there was to find but to no avail. Having read a summary of what happens in the book at this point, there seems to have been a very untruthful attempt to render it in the film, but it has been so simplified and "dumbed down" that the meaning and context are completely as we finally hope to find out where all this is taking, the film suddenly gives another important change of direction, and becomes an action movie without real action. It is as if, at this point, the director simply gave up putting any meaning in the film. So far countless important things are happening without any explanation. Hartdegen does not take the opportunity to return to the past on two occasions for no reason and suddenly loses all interest in time travel for no reason at all. The film comes to an abrupt end when Hartdegen decides to stay with Eloi. <br /> <br /> In short, after a good start, the film is very disappointing. A lot of time is spent on the adventures of Hartdegen before arriving with Eloi. However, the worst part of the film is what I think is the most important part: setting the situation with Eloi. The whole point is completely lost, and that harms the rest of the movie. After that, the film focuses heavily on effects and action, and all attempts to return to the meaning and core of the film seem forced and out of place. With so many things happening without explanation, the movie seems to get lost and lose direction. However, the end in which Hartdegen decides that he is no longer bothered with time travel is the most inexplicable of all. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the whole movie looked like a collection of disconnected incidents. The meaning and context were lost, though the hole where it should have been was very obvious. What was so frustrating about all of this though, was that there was clearly a lot of potential here: it was not in any way a bad movie, it could easily have been so much better. The start was very promising, the time travel seemed fantastic and would have worked if it had not been tangent, and Hartdegen's experience with Eloi might have worked so easily if some of the right questions had been asked, and if it had not been such temptation to "dumb" and simplify. I just wanted to have a time machine so I could go back in time and discourage mistakes.
