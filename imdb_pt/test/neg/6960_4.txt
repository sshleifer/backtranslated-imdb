The decent but overrated dramatic thriller attempts to portray the inner demons out of control of a tormented artist. The problem is that not a single relationship shown on the screen is believable, and plausibility seems to have been discarded by the window. The title character is so hard to relate to, making it impossible to imagine any of the on-screen characters emotionally invested in it as well. The conclusion is also quite predictable; Certainly there are enough leads from the beginning to indicate exactly where the story is going. Choosing to completely suspend belief in situations or relationships, the film itself is well represented (especially by the leaders) and manages to create a pleasant tension as the story unfolds. As a metaphorical feature, there is some food to think about, and if the script was stronger, there is certainly potential here that could have been better utilized.
