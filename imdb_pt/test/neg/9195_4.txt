As much as I respect the firemen for what they do. I was not impressed and bored with this movie. The performance was good, but Joaquin Phoenix was a poor choice, to say the least. <br /> <br /> What bothered me the most about this movie was Celtic music whining around in the worst possible moment. movie. The direction and continuity were also very bad! <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** For example, after the Phoenix character falls several stories and is seriously injured, he can barely move to talk to his captain on the radio. Then, miraculously, he manages to crawl through a huge space covered with rubble and fire to pierce a man-sized opening in a double-thick brick wall using only one piece of a piece of bar. And on top it gets ultra weak and stuck again. <br /> <br /> Someone also noticed that throughout the film, whenever you see photos of Joaquin fighting fires and rescuing people, there is little or no smoke in the buildings. I think the smoke must be very thick in a building surrounded by flames. <br /> <br /> I also got tired of hearing the search and rescue team yelling "I need some gear here !!!". <BR> I really thought I'd like this movie, but I thought it was a faint attempt to represent the real life of a firefighter. The intention was there, but I honestly think this movie could have been so much better. I could not help thinking that the producer was trying to meet a deadline with this film and had to rush to put it in theaters. More time should have been spent editing and making sure there was a good flow to the movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects were impressive in some scenes, but disappointing and almost ridiculous in others. Sort of like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. Call me a critic, but I can not see what's so good about this movie. At least it was not as bad as "The Whole Ten Yards," which is by far the worst movie I've seen in months. <br /> <br /> I really hope there is not a Ladder 50 in the making!
