This movie is very stupid for words. Even if you consider it to be a parody about movie production, if you consider it to be quite a camp, even than you are wasting your time watching - you have seen it hundreds of times before. But maybe you're a big fan of high-pitched girl voices, you're still in love with Barbie and Ken and you can withstand that typical background noise of the '80s ... Well, then you have a chance.
