I'm really sad that this is the first bad review I've ever made for a movie ... EVER. I could bear watching this movie, and it's the second movie in every movie I've seen that's just. ..a downgrade. The first is Open Water, which simply did not have any point. The next Karate Kid made no mention of Daniel (correct me if I'm wrong, please), and that closing phrase was a shock. It was like "If you should fight ... win." so he showed the bird flying and the flute was playing, and I was like, oh. Okay, it'll take a while for the next part. And then the credits hit the screen. <br /> <br /> GEEZ MAN !! I hope I never have to review a movie in a bad way again, I apologize for those who like The Next Karate Kid, I really, really ...
