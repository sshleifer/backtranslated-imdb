Okay, this will contain spoilers. Now I've never seen such a large pile of poop since the laxative / feed mix in the elephant enclosure at the zoo! It has more plot holes than lace moths eaten and as for the 'realistic' plot. Well, sexual slavery is a terrible and very real problem all over the world, and this pile of sewage uses this plague as a plotting device to excite and provoke, to shame all involved by that kind of questionable judgment. But back to the movie, if you were to kidnap people from an airport, some of the safest places and photographers in the modern world, then why planting a stoolie on the inside of the van that does everything the plot needs a twist. Wait until you get out of the airport, pull the gun, handcuff the passengers, drive quietly to the depot and kill the guys, work done. On the passenger side, on at least three occasions, the good guys have the villains incapacitated and armed, WAST IT! Once in a movie, it may just be acceptable not to put a bullet in the skull of the bad guys, but COME THREE times! And after that he killed most of you. Also the guy is willing to drop the gun to stop a scar on the cheek, but kills a girl for a yeast infection that can be released with drugs worth $ 20. I could keep talking about how many holes but not I'm going to waste more time. Suffice it to say that I rarely feel so insulted by such a terrible stupidity as the true problem of sexual slavery, girls voluntarily go to new "jobs" in distant lands and are abused, raped, and often killed by the gang. master who finds them off the boat / plane and carries their passports and freedom. This is an insult to anyone whose life has been affected by it! Do not waste your time!
