Okay, so I saw this movie at this year's Sundance, and I was very impressed. It took a good fifteen minutes of filming before there was an editing or a line of dialogue that would make any sense, and it took another 30 minutes until the script of the handheld gave way to a plot of work that did not depend on a closing . of Ryan Gosling's smile or moralizing invented. After the first 45 minutes, however, the script turned into a clock, though not completely entertaining or thought-provoking. Highlights include Gosling and Morse, Gosling being a rising star, and Morse being an extremely well-established actor with a good sense of disparate emotions. As a sidenote, after the screening I was talking a little about the movie to some of my friends when David Morse walked right behind me - He looks like the coolest guy in the world but he's a solid 6'2 "and probably me it weighs 50 pounds. I removed my foot from my mouth and promptly changed the subject.
