This has to be Steven Segal's worst movie I've ever seen (even worse than the eco-piffle as On Deadly Ground & Fire Down Below). I'll start with the good points ..., it has a stylish direction for a DTV movie and it has wonderful scenarios ... That's it! The story goes nowhere, it's just a series of well-crafted pieces for the guys to shoot at evil faces (the body count can easily combine Tarantino with his bloodiest!). The plot is unnecessarily complicated and confusing you forget who the good and bad are. The acting (I use the term loosely) is mediocre at best, the usual expression of life imprisonment and acting of wood that I can take, but the others, especially the English, were very bad. <br /> <br /> What's in the package? Why are the bad guys behind this? Is the seagal being set up? <br /> <br /> WHO MAKES AS FULL! <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie at my local Blockbuster (Once I paid) the assistant laughed at me and said it was the worst movie in the store that I could have chosen! (I felt like punching him until my arm went numb) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I did not see Half Past Dead or Out to kill and I did not want to go back for more humiliation in my shop, but they can not be any worse than this turkey. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is supposedly young and modern. <br /> <br /> This gave me a craving for half a dozen asprins. <br /> <br /> In all of this is Seagal at its worst! The guy who won about 100Ibs and looks well past it, he's a guy who just does not when not stopping, he must retire gracefully NOW! and have a go behind the camera or become a martial arts teacher or something. <br /> <br /> My rating 2/10 (1 full stop for scenery)
