A man arrives in the office of psychiatrist Dr. Sammael (Joan Severance), claiming to be the demon Asmodeus (Kane Hodder), the torturer of the 13th level of hell, and he would like to tell strange things. He says he made a deal with Lucifer to become human again. He was to hit his virgin sister Mary Elizabeth (Alison Brie) on the day his mother died and she was to kill six people and deliver the Antichrist, and then he would escape from the abyss and be reborn. When Mary Elizabeth gets pregnant, her stressed-out and abusive sister Catherine (Denise Crosby) does not believe that she is a virgin, but her father and former obstetrician Albert Martino (James Callahan) examines her daughter and sees her hymen intact. Meanwhile, the Church uncovers the truth about Mary Elizabeth's pregnancy and sends the priest and former military father Anthony (Eddie Velez) to spy on Mary Elizabeth. She is dominated by the fetus and forced to kill a truck driver, Lars (Jorg Sirtl), who is mistress of her tenant and friend Jennifer (Azalea Davila), and Jennifer herself and eat their hearts and drink their blood, but she believes that she has nightmares. However, during the ultrasound, she realizes that she is carrying a monster and asks the father to stop the pregnancy. But it's too late. <br /> <br /> The terrible "Born" is a B movie (actually a Z movie) that he believes is a great movie. The result is a pretentious and disappointing production, with an incoherent and absurd story, without humor and terrible acting and direction. The plot is a complete mess: there is a priest who is a murderer and ex-soldier; a demon in existential crisis going to a psychiatric; a father who examines the virginity of his daughter; two female demons (succubi?) who stand naked as a statue with both hands covering their sexes; a character who is a tramp, and only exists to expose her beautiful body. There are many scenes with free and cheap nudity. But the worst is the acting: the unknown actress Alison Brie is histrionic, with ridiculous voices and grimaces. Sorry, Mrs. Alison Brie, but I hated her annoying performance. I did not recognize Joan Severance, who performs well, since I still had the image of his youth. Denise Crosby plays a hateful character and like everyone else, she ages, but she's still a good actress. I believe that if the writer and director had included some dark humor and assumed that this movie is a B movie, the story could have worked better and better. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Anti-Christ" ("The Anti-Christ")
