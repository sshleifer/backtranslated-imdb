Enchanted April was one of the last Harry Beaumont films - he only drove a few more after this one. He made the films "Maisie" in the 1930s and 1940s. In opening credits, says "From Elizabeth's Novel", and completely misses out the author's last name ... quite strange, but since it was von Armin, they they may not have wanted the German association at the time ... It's sad to know it was a flop when it was released, with fun names like Frank Morgan (The Wizard) and Jessie Ralph, who played WC Fields disapproving mother-in-law on "Bank Dick" . Two girls in London (Ann Harding and Katharine Alexander) decide to rent a castle to house two of their friends, but things do not go as planned. Reginald Owen plays her husband with several personalities. In addition to some funny moments, he moves very slowly. Ralph is the only bright spot here as the arrogant type, and the picture is quite inaccurate and out of focus for much of the film. The views of Italy are all obvious scenarios. The only saving grace here is that the Turner Classic version is only 66 minutes long. Too bad they did not give Frank Morgan a bigger role. This was redone in 1992 by BBC as a British film.
