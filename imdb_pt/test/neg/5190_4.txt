The movie begins with its smarter joke and descends from there (pun intended). After that there is a lot of humor and sexual situations. Beautiful women were the best part of the movie. Swearing puns should not be a central joke, but they try it here. The battle between the two groups in the local town (richies and poies) is an old attempt and true setup, so how could it go wrong? Well, there is no reason to envy the "riches" or any reason to feel sorry for the poors, so that we can forget the central plot. The situational humor is all hygienic or sexual directed at teenagers, but it only generates laughter, there are no real laughter. <br /> <br /> The only thing that rescues comedy for this movie is the character's mood, with the blind. providing some rehashed but rarely used settings, and the black bar owner providing the "street" or formidable "hood" mood. <br /> <br /> OK, forget the jokes, there have to be some killer snowboarding shots since this was a commercial venture. Unfortunately, there were only 4 seconds of background action that can be inspiring. The rest was all "B" grade tricks or worse. The big moment, where the main character mounts "the goat", a matador men's ski race, provided a shot where a small avalanche eats the stunt. This was the best of the boarding in this movie. Any serious snowboarding fan will be disappointed with the quality of the movie's acrobatics. <br /> <br /> As for the technical aspects of the film, the soundtrack was average, which is surprising, since snowboarding documentaries are regularly watered down to quality music. You can pick up a lot of editing errors and although it has been filmed on a ski mountain, most of the "scene scenes" failed to convey any real-life feel. <br /> <br /> Overall, it may be worth seeing if you've been able to completely turn off your brain and like silicone breasts. Even so, you will not remember any of it two days later. <br /> <br /> Snowboarding is still waiting for your definitive comedy, you'd better watch a snowboarding documentary for sure.
