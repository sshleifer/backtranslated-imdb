This movie makes as much sense as an episode of 'Ozzie & Harriet' or 'Daddy Knows Best'. An old copy of Reader's Digest (circa 1962) would provide more information about modern life, or the relationship between father and daughter, than this strange invention. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by Diane Keaton. She seems to sleep in the movie. (Given the title of the film, I realize her role was supportive, but even Martin Short got a distinct, supportive character). <br /> <br /> I can understand the attraction of an imaginary world created in a good romantic comedy. But this movie is the prozac version of an imaginary world. I am afraid to consider that anyone could enjoy it even as pure fantasy.
