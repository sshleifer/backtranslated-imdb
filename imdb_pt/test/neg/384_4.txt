Dr. Lucio Fulci (Lucio Fulci) is director of bloody horror movies and is beginning to feel the effect of having filmed many bloody scenes. He visits his local psychiatrist to see if he is missing the balls; this proves to be a bad idea, since the psychiatrist is actually a crazy killer, responsible for a wave of terrible murders. Taking advantage of the opportunity to make Fulci his countryman, the crazy doctor hypnotizes the terror, making him think that he is responsible for the recent series of murders. <br /> <br /> On the surface, Cat in the Brain seems to be a fantastically bloody delight of the spice god Lucius Fulci. Filled with chainsaw splitting, ax attacks and several other bloody murders, the film certainly pours enough claret for even the most hardened blood dogs. But when you look closer, it turns out that many of the gruesome scenes are raised from previous films (mainly the "masterpieces" of Fulci); remove these from the equation and one gets a cool basic plot idea that is totally wasted, some welcome nudity and terrible performances from Fulci himself and David L. Thompson as psycho shrink. <br /> <br /> As the movie progresses, it turns into an incomprehensible mess, with borrowed material inserted randomly, with no attempt to work convincingly in the story. If you have ever seen the Deathly Touch of Fulci and Ghost of Sodom, or the Secret of Murder of Mario Bianchi, then you have seen the best pieces of Cat in the Brain before. After much bloodshed, the film engages quickly, leaving the viewer feeling bewildered and a bit cheated. Watch the movie if you are a Fulci completist, but I suggest looking for the movies the "good parts" were taken from.
