Does the bank / police suspense sound good? <br /> <br /> Chaos looks good: well framed, good production values, high concept of assault to action ... <br /> <br /> But ... <br /> <br /> The plot has the unique achievement of being smart and incredibly, blatantly implausible in the "how we really get the money" mode and supercomplicated in the "who did this and why" section at the same time ... <br /> <br /> Also, Ryan Philippe screaming is NOT seriously, neither tough nor scary ... and he's not especially hard or scary when he's feeling very nervous. Honestly, his big blast is the only really funny scene in the whole movie. It should make him thrilled that he turned down the role of Anakin Skywalker and now he's doing it .... Stratham is usually good as the tough hard but silent with self-deprecating humor but here , the extra lines of relationship are so ridiculously bad that even he seems uncomfortable saying that some of the clich√©d roles are needed. Quieter looks better? <br /> <br /> Snipes is actually fine in a stylized way, but another nail in the coffin of a talented actor: he needs a role as an actor and not an action hero. Maybe this business with your taxes will allow you to break this mold and the public and critics will leave you in the vote of sympathy. It would be nice if he was not so typecast all the time. <br /> <br /> The speeches of these guys talk when they are not doing the plot development and the detective work can be summed up in one word ... The movie seems to be out of tune and never gels: I found it annoying for the first 45 minutes, and the narrowest part was acceptable. It should / could have been good, but simply can not rescue the terrible lines, overwhelming punctuation, and the overall level of irritation with levels of plausibility. <br /> <br /> Overall I almost could not get past: incredibly annoying, and Ryan .... please, please, please get rid of the goldilocks ....
