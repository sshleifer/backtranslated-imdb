Anyone can make a movie these days. Budget, production value or experienced crew does not have to stop the self-described "director" from "realizing their dream" these days. <br /> <br /> Respect for the craft of making movies, or even just respect for any cinematic aesthetics are no longer prerequisites for running a movie. Director Bill Cowell must have thought he reached gold when Lion's Gate decided to market his original film as a follow-up to a film he did not have. I personally think Lion's Gate is much, much more wrong than Cowell in relation to Dark Harvest 2 being available to the public. Lion's Gate's misleading marketing of this film must be investigated by the state attorney general's office, and Lion's Gate officials must be treated with sulfuric acid and kerosene for their scorn for film, for cinema, and for common sense. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, it's not even worth commenting on.
