Diane Lane, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson and Thomas Jane ..... Not a bad cast in my opinion, however, they were totally wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> There was no real direction, there was no unusual In fact, the whole movie was very predictable from start to finish. Mickey Rourke had a very annoying fellow who did nothing but annoy him from the start. Rosario Dawson was totally wasted and there was almost no sense in having her character in the movie. <br /> <br /> I really believe this is one of those direct movies on DVD that everyone will quickly forget a pity as the movie could have been a lot better.
