Unfortunately, this film is typical of the dilution of a good film by numerous sequences. Universal made several serial monster movies in the 1940s, which were pale imitations of the original. The intelligent Egyptologist Imhotep was replaced by a Frankenstein dragging his legs in a mummy wrap, which shows no signs of intelligent life. This movie is fun on some points, but if you have seen The Mummy (1932), you will be disappointed.
