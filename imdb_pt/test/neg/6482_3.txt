The role-reversing remake of 1942's "The Major and the Minor," has Jerry Lewis entering the play originally played by Ginger Rogers, but unfortunately this anemic ride is missing much more than just Ginger. Lewis tries to pass a child by boarding a train; he is successful, but deception leads to a series of comic and romantic confusions. Sidney Sheldon adapted the script, casting musical moments for Dean Martin (playing another in his stash of second-banana) and a subtheme of jewel theft (which is terrible). Diana Lynn, who portrayed the astute teenager in the original film, interprets Lewis's love interest here. She is beautiful; Jerry is not. * 1/2 of ****
