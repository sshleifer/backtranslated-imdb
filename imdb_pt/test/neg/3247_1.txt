An insane attack on viewers. This is a mixture of several Hindi and English films - poorly done. The name comes from the cast of several stars of the 70's, which the 2002 version is also proud of. The story is taken from the 70s Sunil Dutt / Reena Roy debut - "Nagin" and visual effects (a horrible attempt) from The Matrix, Terminator 2 and Mission Impossible II. <br /> <br /> Placed in a college environment (Sunil Shetty, Akshaye Kumar, Manisha - college boys !!!), Manisha Koirala is the victim, who mistakes a fatal assault with two students as a collective effort of the party of our heroes. It turns out that Manisha is a Cobra snake (Nag) who was reborn as a girl in this life and her lifemate before, now a powerful supersuper - all - and - whatever (Ichadhari Nag) - Munish Kohli, is looking for her in this life. Manisha appeals to him to avenge his rape and murder. <br /> <br /> So begins the mad killing, where the avenging lover begins to choose every man in the group, with increasing powers and tricks with successive attempts. The effects are extremely inexpensive, with computer-generated skeletons, metamorphosis bodies and motorcycle stunts completing the farce. Nagin's transport includes Raj Babbar playing a Catholic priest who provides temporary relief for our boys with a more "Religiously correct" multi-religion medallion (the original Nagin only had an "Om"). Sunny Deol portrays Manisha's love interest in her current life and the greatest savior against the all-powerful Munish Kohli. <br /> <br /> Music and music are below average. <br /> <br /> Avoid if you do not make it extravagant cheap thrills.
