Katharine Hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking - and is regarded by locals as a witch. Kate works excessively trying to convince us that she is a hinterland hick (called Trigger Hicks!), But you can see that she does not even believe in this unintentional comedy scenario. Constantly smiling Robert Young plays a foreman working on building a dam on the mountain that becomes Trigger's first passion ... but unfortunately he is married! No amount of white magic can resurrect this formula, based on one piece and brought to the screen by R.K.O. with a very large hick. It is wicked and practically unattainable. * 1/2 of ****
