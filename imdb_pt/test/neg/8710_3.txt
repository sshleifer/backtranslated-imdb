I watched the show out of curiosity, wanting to see if they could, and with all this modern technology, do the classic 1956 Cecil B. DeMille epic starring Charleton Heston, Yul Brenner, and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. Of course, I was disappointed. Yes, they had all the correct biblical characters, but they did not give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes that interested you during the first movie. If you're going to have a mini-series, you have to have some "rotating" scenes, the "Burning Bush", Leaving the "Red Sea," drowning "Pharaoh's Armies," "building the Pyramids of Sethi," could have been made with today's technology in the blockbuster movies such as "The Lord of the Rings" or the Matrix. Obviously, they did not want to leave a definite impression of "faith and sacrifice", which is much needed in these difficult times.
