Smart summary, is not it? <br /> <br /> If Mad Max was something simple, straightforward, nothing special, but nothing wrong, they totally made up for the sequel, The Road Warrior. So in theory, with a third great movie, it would have been a great trilogy ... now, it is not! <br /> <br /> Such a disappointment as well as the Thunderdome! His main premise is quite cool, with an 'underworld' (think of a mix between Metropolis and The Time Machine), but all this is not carried out with much conviction. Add the nasty Tina Turner and the good story line of the people waiting for a plane, and that's just a huge stink. <br /> <br /> Maybe they can light things up again with part 4 probably just going to be a big-budget kind of explosion) because that is not right. 3/10.
