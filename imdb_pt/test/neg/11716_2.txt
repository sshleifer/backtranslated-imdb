This has to be one of the best horror movies. Charles Band made the best movie of 96 'in this gem little seen. Highly realistic and incredibly stylized - with a visual twist that David Fincher would envy, it's not hard to see why the Band went on to make classics like 'Killjoy 2: Deliverance From Evil', 'The Regina Pierce Affair', 'Virgins of Sherwood Forest 'and' Timegate: Tales of the Saddle Tramps'. With a highly sophisticated story - a small body with a big head controls a family of weirdos who perform experiments on naked women, this movie may be a bit much for younger viewers and is just for the kind of spectator more educated, but for those who see him, Band is able to convey subtle messages about the human condition through his masterpiece. The head symbolizes the lost love and longing for the inner self that we all must face at one point or another, and for that reason I was able to get involved with this film on a deeply personal level. Although many previous reviewers have compared the Band movie to the Re-animator and other minor works, this is upside-down and jumps above the others. It's uglier, but not nonsense. The gore in this movie is well crafted and used to enhance the plot, rather than just getting a cheap scream from the public. In addition, the special effects in this film are absolutely excellent, easily the best work done in a horror film since ... well ... always! The work in this film makes the effects of Savini look like the work of a blind tramp with no limbs. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this movie is the sheer amounts of full frontal nudity, which were ultimately unnecessary. the composer's goal - to create a timeless epic that would forever remain in history as possibly the greatest film of all time. If it was not for this little problem I would have given this movie a perfect 10.
