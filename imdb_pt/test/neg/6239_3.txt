Do not watch this movie, go see something else ... I was very disappointed, I can not rate this movie better than 3. The acting was very good and I really enjoyed William Dafoe as the villain but I do not see why this movie has arrived to the big screen. The story was old and was featured in more than 100 films and more than 1000 TV series / movies. The main problem was basically: nothing is happening. Take a kidnapping, let the villain make the wife of the kidnapped man hand over the money, make the police look stupid and boring and extend this to 95 minutes, you have your movie "Clearing." The only two reasons I did not rate this 1 was a) Dafoe and b) the "B-plane-ending". There are not many endings you can give to a kidnapper movie ... 75% of that kind ends with the end A, 20% ends with B and 1% ends with something unpredictable. Boring, boring, annoying.
