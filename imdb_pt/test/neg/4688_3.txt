For the uninitiated, almost every Andy Milligan movie is a shock, but despite the fact that I have seen many of his films, he still takes the cake out of sheer malice. <br /> <br /> That is, of course. , Milligan talks about Sweeney Todd's tale, made with vintage costumes (but not necessarily with vintage hairstyles in some cases) and with the usual camera work and grainy quality. As for blood, well, the version I saw may have been cut some, as there is not much, for a movie with "bloodthirsty" in the title. The best indication of doing subversive cinema here is a meat pie consisting of only a wad of a poor victim. <br /> <br /> So while I'm still going to value that work, on my video shelf, it's definitely a bit of a disappointment as much as content though. Recommended only for the reckless and morbid onlookers. 3 out of 10.
