This show is terrible. I can not get over the complete waste of great talent that this show contains. This is not impromptu entertainment, it's just a cheap attempt to put famous comedy actors on a stage and make them perform a poorly improved scene. I actually did impromptu work as an actor, and this show is not improvisation. <br /> <br /> What the audience is really laughing at (if they're really laughing at this show, it seems false) is the embarrassment of the guest star being lost like a deer in the headlights. Silly things, completely unrelated, are what people laugh at. And if it's not part of the scene, the actors will say it's wrong! I think this show is a disgrace to art, and it makes me cry for shows like Whose Line is Anyway, it had great talent, great impromptu games, and most of all, it did not make me want to change channels.
