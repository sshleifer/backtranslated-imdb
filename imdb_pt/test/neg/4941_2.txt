Do not choose this one. **** Spoiler Alert ***** The plot of this bad aggravated movie is four friends are convinced to take the bus from the airport by a very zealous driver. In transportation with them is a kind of business looking pretty milquetoast. <br /> <br /> Soon after the trip, the ship's driver takes an exit ramp and some lunatic driver tries to drive them off the road. The end result is that they get a flat tire. The driver takes one of the people on the bus to help change the tire and the monkey slides and the faces of the guys are crushed between the tire and the space shuttle. It is at this point that the driver turns out to be a kidnapper and he takes all people hostage. <br /> <br /> Now the film gets extremely slow and tedious as the characters make one lame after another. One of the men is killed trying to escape - even if he has no suspense. Finally, it is revealed that the face of the milquetoast business is in collusion with the driver when an older guy kills the other male friend by cutting his throat. <br /> <br /> There are some attempts to escape from women. Milquetoast is hit on the head with an iron tire - but he survives. <br /> <br /> The driver is also beaten and somehow survived a collision with a fence at high speed as he knelt beside the wheel. Somehow he did not cross the window or was seriously injured by a collision with the windshield. However, the woman driving the space shuttle is unconscious - but she had a steering wheel to protect her and he had nothing between him and the windshield. <br /> <br /> He finally manages to subdue women and make them an underground garage that is a front for human trafficking. One of the women is dead. The other stabs the driver on the leg with a piece of broken mirror and shoots him in the head, but he is capable (in what should be a severely weakened state - severe blood loss, two head injuries and a large cut in the leg) to drag he pulled her out of the bus, dragged her to a large crate, tossed it and locked it, all the while with her struggling fiercely against him. <br /> <br /> Now some people admire the film's message about human trafficking and how it's happening today. This is a serious problem. But making an extremely annoying movie about the topic does not give it a higher rating.
