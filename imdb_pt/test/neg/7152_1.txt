If this movie is coming to a theater near you, consider it a threat. I had the misfortune to see this movie here in Tokyo. As a Dutchman, I was surprised to find a Dutch movie playing in a metropolis like Tokyo. I thought it had to be special if a Dutch film came to Japan. So I went there with some friends, and we were happy to tell the theater staff that we were Dutch and that we were so curious about the movie. As it turned out, this was one of the most childish, silly, dumb, worst-represented films, with the worst English spoken in maybe 10 years, and I left the theater trying to avoid the team because I felt almost responsible for this disaster film. Sometimes you get the feeling that you know what the director was wanting: Lola Rennt, Trainspotting, like a movie. Instead, it was more like MacGyver on drugs with breakbeat music outdated as a score. But if I was not feeling very angry, the film was unintentionally hilarious from time to time, as the Netherlands showed in its smallest size.
