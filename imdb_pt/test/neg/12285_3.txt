Dir-Brett Thompson: Silly movie focusing on children, about three children being taken to the favorite cartoon with the experience of their parents. The script left a lot to be desired in this Hanna-Barbara, like the stealing of some live-action Saturday mornings with people in dinosaur costumes that children show "with some pathetic cave men around." Nothing to really admire about it and nothing much to be said either. I'm just amazed that I found this in a Blockbuster video store as bad as it was and the way the stores are getting rid of old VHS movies. I guess they could not even sell it, so back to the rental rack that was.
