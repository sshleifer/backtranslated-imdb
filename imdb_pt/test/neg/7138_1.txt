What a horrible movie. This movie was so out of order and so hard to follow. It was so hard to follow and it was just confusing. The whole time I was watching I was wishing it would end !! I felt like I had lost 2 hours of my life that I will never go back. Save your money and do not rent this movie. Now I see why Sarah Michelle Gellar was barely in the movie. The first movie was great, but that was just sucked. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Save your money and watch the trailer, because that's the only thing worth seeing with this movie. This movie did not have a real story for that either. I'm still wondering what I saw.
