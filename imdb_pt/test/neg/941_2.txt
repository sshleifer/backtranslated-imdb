Inane, terrible travesty basically about a young man who refuses to conform or rather uses nonconformity to achieve his goals - fooling his parents into thinking he is attending a college. The truth is that this idiot was rejected by all the schools to which he applied. Once you see this crap, you'll see why. What a ridiculous name - South Hampton Institute of Technology. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to discover the initials of this school of nonsense. The problem with this type of film is that, in the end, the nonconformist becomes the accepted mode. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to the world of reality and call this movie what it really is - excess manipulative trash!
