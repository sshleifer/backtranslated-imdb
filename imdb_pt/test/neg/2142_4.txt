If I were to rate this film based solely on the interpretation / script / production, etc., I would give a star. All these elements are terrible. I can partially forgive this in light of the film's $ 250 budget. The film contains lots of fun scenes, especially those of the unintentionally funny variety. Some of them include: a 14-year-old kid stealing and driving a bus, teenage hooligans (one wearing a Joy Division T-shirt) being startled not to harass the protagonists of the movie with a woman brandishing an obviously fake gun, and a meeting with the skull of a plastic bull in the Arizona desert. <br /> <br /> I would have given him 5 stars just for the entertainment value, were it not for the presence of that old and horribly irritating, morally pontificating grandmother. I had to dock a star just because of her. Who the * bleep * makes a wedding cake with black frosting, anyway?
