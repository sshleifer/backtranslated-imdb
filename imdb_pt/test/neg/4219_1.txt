As an avid fan of Gone With the Wind, I was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they left out many important characters. Fortunately, the movie itself was a wonderful piece. When the book Scarlett left, I read it hoping to follow two of my favorite literary characters on their journey together. Although the book does not have a true quality, it remains a good story and, as long as I was able to separate it from the original, it was and still is nice. However, I consider the six hours I spent watching the "Scarlett" miniseries be one of the most exhausting hours of my life. Discrediting any of the original character traits so well formed in Margaret Mitchell's book, this series also turned the sequel story into one of the rape, mistrust, murder, and malformed relationships that even Scarlett's book got away with. The cast of many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well formed in both the original novel and the film, and even continued in the second book, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. In the novel, Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband, Rhett Butler, to Charleston, on the pretext of visiting the family. After coming to an "agreement" with Rhett, she agrees to leave and reconnect with her relatives O'Hara in Savannah. Eventually she accompanies her cousin Colum, a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood, to Ireland, to further explore her deep roots in her family, and is eventually called "The O'Hara," the head of the family. While her duties as The O'Hara keep her busy in her town of Ballyhara, Scarlett ventures into the world of English landlords, and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of her parties. She, having been scorned by Rhett over and over again, ends up agreeing to marry Luke, Earl of Fenton, until Rhett appears in a cliché of "night on the white horse" - sort of ransom. The "Scarlett" miniseries fails to do justice. Smashed by her fiancé and despised by her family, the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is guilty of a murder her cousin committed. <br /> <br /> I sincerely advise everyone to think about spending the day observing this to rethink that decision. .
