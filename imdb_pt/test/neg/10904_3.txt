If he had not bowed to the clich√©, Mr. Shiban might have made a good movie out of that story. It was just enough to keep you interested, so for the same time, energy and money we spent on this stinking, we might have had something good instead of rolling our eyes. <br /> <br /> Wise, it's as good as you would expect from a handheld camcorder, so it gets good grades there. It really is the script that is missing, since the acting was not so bad considering what the actors had to work on. <br /> <br /> I thought the days were far away when we would see somebody, finding a radio transceiver they desperately want to operate, first turn all the buttons of the thing from end to end, hit the top for 6 or 7 times, and then wait for it to work. This story is ruined by a continuous sequence of stupid moves by all the characters except the bad guy. It's as if we think we're too shallow to comprehend all the devices in the plot, so they're all spoon fed to make sure we get them. <br /> <br /> I do not know about you, but it does not work on me. My attention ends up being filled with holes and dramatizations, not history. <br /> <br /> So, as I thought this was not so bad in the technical sense, I think Shiban should try. again, only with an appropriate script the next time; so he can give us something worth watching.
