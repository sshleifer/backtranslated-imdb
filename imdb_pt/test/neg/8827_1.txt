In every episode, I've never seen any real action or drama or comedy. <br /> <br /> The plot is so repetitive. <br /> <br /> Someone has something old and then another person tells them a little about it and how much it's worth and who did it and where it comes from and how much it could sell and if there was any work done for it. <br /> <br /> Sowhile I watched over 30 of these, I realized ... there is no drama .... no one ever loses a limb or life or gets divorced or run over by a car or plane. <br /> <br /> There are no car chases or explosions - not even a horse race with old carriages. <br /> <br /> All those weapons and swords and no one goes on a violent killing ... what gives? No pshycos, no murder of axes, old Englishmen in bad clothes ... just yap yap ... you have an old tea set and came from the country of Germany in 1602 - blah blah blah. .. I'm still waiting for someone with a time machine to go on the screen and ask about it but no ... it never comes to be and the only thing that happens is that some stuffy English or woman does some bullshit about something old being sold in Boston or China during the Ming Dynasty - EFFIN's big deal. <br /> <br /> Can anyone sequester one of the leads and keep them as a ransom? Is there no alien spacecraft that destroys the entire floor? Who the hell writes these things like a series and expects us to stay awake? This is as much fun as watching paint dry - with comments only. <br /> <br /> There is no sex, no comedy or romance, no action, no suspense, no action, no drama, no mystery or martial arts. <br /> <br /> This show sucks! What happened to the supermodels wearing thongs and throwing lasers out of a futuristic weapon? Antiques Roadshow - More like picking up a blanket and pillow and going to sleep show ...
