First of all, I'm in the USA. When I first saw this, I thought it was obvious - and disgusting - to rip off "The Office" (UK). I would have thus awarded zero stars, but behold, it came out long before the Ricky Gervais series. <br /> <br /> Still, it's hard to watch this or any other show with a similar dynamic (including the American "Office") without comparison. It's simply not even close to being the same. <br /> <br /> I'll give you some credit for being original and ahead of your time. I will also say that - and the US "Office" and "Larry Sanders" - are real satire. The UK "Office" is something bigger and more transcendent, as if it were filled with real people at events that seemed to have really happened. However, unlike this or the strident "mockumentaries" of Christopher Guest, it's not really a satire, while "The Newsroom" definitely is. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "The Newsroom" is not yet. t very funny. It is indifferent and self-conscious, but with a cast and crew who are neither smart nor talented enough to steal the goods. It's heavy comedy being carried on weak shoulders. Praiseworthy but in the end not recommended. <br /> <br /> What about the lack of an anamorphic DVD? I know it was filmed in widescreen anamorphic because I saw the pilot episode on one of our HD channels. CBC, stay with the program. ; )
