A precocious talkie melodrama hilariously and involuntarily with Kay Francis as Countess Balakireff chasing everything in pants. At the beginning of the movie, she "throws back" the groom for being too young before leaving for the chauffeur! The high-set English set in which she moves is a clich√© of harummpfers that is ridiculous. But the topper is Basil Rathbone as an Italian violinist with a Chico Marx accent! "My violeen! As weel I already play eet again!" "Patreecia, my meelk is cold!" It is campy beyond belief.
