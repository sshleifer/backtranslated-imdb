I ordered this movie on the Internet, because it is very difficult to get Turkish movies where we live. I heard a lot about the TV series from my friends and practically everyone in Turkey, I was hoping to see a breakthrough in Turkish cinema. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Me and my husband (who is an admirer of any film with a bit of Turkish scenery and Turkish dialogs) just watched it all because we paid $ 20 for the DVD. Well, that was a boring way to spoil it. <br /> <br /> It was confusing, sometimes exaggerated, while other times it was underestimated. The plot was not only confusing, but add a gay man walking with his dog on the beach and use some humor in the script to make it 'Hollywood' also did not work for me. The American characters were almost so stereotyped that they were neither funny nor realistic and, as another reviewer put it, Turkish customs and lifestyles were irrelevant. <br /> <br /> The movements of the camera had no meaning. Adding some Dervishes (never seen on them in Kapadokya by the way) and broken dishes - Greek style - just made the movie even more confusing. <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed of this movie and all the noise the press has made about it. Certainly there are worthy films made by Turkish directors who deserve more attention and respect. <br /> <br /> I give this film 1 out of 10.
