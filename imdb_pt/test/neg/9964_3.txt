A paranoid scientist creates a werewolf by transfusing wolf blood into a meek, quiet but very large gardener to prove a hypothesis. Thus, the gardener begins the night agitation and the scientist tries to use it to regain his credentials, but is rejected by his former colleagues for adulterating the nature. The island of Dr. Moreau, Frankenstein and several werewolf movies mingled in a terribly goofy and dumb morality game. <br /> <br /> Although the subject is pedantic and not original, this film is not too badly done, and interesting to watch as a representative of the horror film making of its time. Like most movies of mad scientists, this is a weak warning against playing with Mother Nature. It does not have the intellectual power or challenges of Frankenstein, but it never extends its reach anyway. The acting is passable, just like cinematography, and the movie moves in a fun clip. Some of the dialogues are completely ridiculous, but hey ... it's just a movie - and a B minus one. There are also some good photos of a wolf, and a handful of humor played to prevent the movie from taking itself too seriously - always an advantage for that genre.
