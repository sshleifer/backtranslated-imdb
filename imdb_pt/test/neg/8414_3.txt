This movie is a bad movie, but to get any nutritional value, I recommend watching it back with Rosemary's baby. <br /> <br /> There is so much to learn watching as different directors can draw different performances from the same actors playing the same characters. Observe Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) and the excellent work she did in the first film compared to the terrible interpretation of this film. <br /> <br /> It's also interesting to see how the same characters were played by different actors. Which leads me to wonder if anyone involved with the sequel was aware of the first movie and some of them watched Rosemary's Baby before doing this? <br /> <br /> If your interest in films is purely superficial then it is best to avoid this. I have a lot more to say about this movie, but I really do not want to go there.
