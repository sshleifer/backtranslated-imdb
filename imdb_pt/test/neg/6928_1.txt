I absolutely despise this movie. I wanted to love - I really wanted to. But man, oh man - they were with Sara. And the father living was very cheesy. This is straight from the Shirley Temple movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend the BOOK. It is wonderful. In the book, Sara is honest and decent and she does the right thing ... BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT. She does not have a grudging bone in her body. <br /> <br /> In the movie, she is mean and spiteful. She does little things to get back to Miss Minchin. In the book, Sara is above these things. She stands up for Miss Minchin. She tells the truth and is not intimidated by it. But she does not do the stupid and spiteful things Sara does in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's so disturbing to me that so many here say they loved the book and love the movie. I can not help but wonder ... do we read the same book? The main point of the book was personal responsibility, behaving with honor and integrity, ALWAYS telling the truth and facing adversity with calm and integrity. <br /> <br /> Sara has a happy ending in the book - not the ridiculous survival of the book. his father, but the union with his partner who has been looking for her. In the book, she is taken by this new father figure who loves and cares for her and Becky. And Miss. Minchin is NOT a chimney sweep - that part of the movie really was stupid. Seeing all these compliments for this unfortunate movie is disturbing to me. Are we praising a movie that glorifies petty and spiteful behavior with some hat tips for kindness? Sara in the book was kind to the bone and full of integrity. I do not even recognize her in the movie ... she's not in it. Good thing. Mrs. Burnett is not alive to see this horrible thing. It is horrible and unworthy to have the title of your book.
