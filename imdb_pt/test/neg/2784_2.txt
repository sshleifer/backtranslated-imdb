Straight to video and with good reason. It's like neighborhood kids making a joke in the backyard, but worse. A young man (Don Digiulio) inherits a farm in West Virginia that has been dormant for generations. He decides to take some friends to check the property. This cultivated land used to produce good corn plantations, even during the Great Depression. The secret is that the owner was killing people and watering the fields with their blood. Then hang your bodies like scarecrows. The special effects are very bad and the horrible dialogue is full of meaningless phrases and the joke is so ridiculous that the sound can be turned off. Cheap Gore is a farce from a horror movie. Along with Digiulio in the cast: Jeanie Cheek, B.W. York, Booty Chewning and Jessica Dunphy.
