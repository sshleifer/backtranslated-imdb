With so many good movies being released in 1995 (particularly "Mortal Kombat" and "Seven"), unfortunately, there have to be some bombs too, and this movie really falls into the latter category with a boring, predictable plot and a lousy ending. It seems that Antonio Banderas could not find a decent script since "Desperado", the only notable film he did. Anyone with an eighth brain could tell who DeMornay's pursuer was from the start. His flashbacks to his mother's death did nothing but confuse a story that was already paper thin. Too bad Dennis Miller was wasted on this movie; this part resembles his frighteningly similar role in "The Network." <br /> <br /> The complicated ending made me shake my head, as I did throughout the movie. Also, any movie that portrays cruelty against animals in any form or form, no matter how fake it seems, automatically harms me. <br /> <br /> To make a long story, if you want to enjoy a good thriller, avoid this at all costs. Never talk to strangers ... especially those who recommend this movie. 2/10
