[POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT] <br /> <br /> It is unlikely that Seagal will scale back the heights of rudeness that he has done with On Deadly Ground (mostly because no one will ever let him drive again), but he sure try, right? <br /> <br /> This is a little fantasy, typically brainless and poorly written, about how Indian folk remedies are far more effective than Western medicine. Seagal seems to really believe this nonsense, though he never explains why life expectancy in the Americas and Europe is much greater than it was in 1492. Kinda as he never explains how his supposed " water "engines" work on * On Deadly Ground *. Even the "action" in this sucks.
