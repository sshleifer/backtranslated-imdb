That fragile attempt to divert his typically insipid horror film over to a creepy cult attack did not have the ammunition it needed to keep the viewer involved all over. Translated into the vortex, Uzumaki is just about it - an irrational and overabundant tribute to the strange downward spiral of nothingness that has apparently captivated a whole little town in lunatics obsessed with dementia. While this certainly contributes to a pleasurable b movie on the surface, the traditionally tiring acting, direction and script will all have but Asian horror fans shaking their heads in dismay. What could have been translated into the Japanese equivalent of one of David Lynch's early works, instead reveals that it's a spiral trick before he even gets a chance to explain himself - which of course he does not. In addition to some clever techniques employed, the film rarely connects the dizzying issue with the tedious script, which turns out to be a cheap exploitation of the cult genre, replacing the genuine substance with empty images. When the film ended, there was hardly anything gained from the interactions, save for a few small scenes or images that rose above the movie of a note. I applaud the creators for at least attempting to bring the genre to more metaphysical and supernatural realms and understand the sudden losses lost in translation, but with zero substance to support any of their aberration, this will likely be relegated to obscuring the bode of fanboys basements
