"Witchery" may just be the most incoherent and deplorable horror film of the '80s, but fortunately it has some compensating qualities like fantastic effects, an exciting soundtrack, and great casting options. Honestly, the script does not make sense, but who cares when Linda Blair (with an exploding hairstyle) portrays another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof portrays a handsome photographer (who does not seem to get it) a movie that constantly features voodoo bloody, sewn lips, upside down crucifixions, vicious burns, and an overused but genuinely scary melody. Eight random people are gathered on an abandoned island off the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple are there to investigate the dark history of the place; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair, though no one seems to care who the father is and where he is), he considers the hotel's reopening, and the sexy architect simply scored for casual sex. Are they forced to stay the night at the disorganized hotel and then suddenly the previous owner? an old actress or something that always dresses in black? begins to draw them in various captivating ways. Everything is somehow related to the introduction sequence showing a woman accused of witchcraft jumping out of a window. Anyway, the plot is definitely of lesser importance in an Italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of "The Evil Dead". The atmosphere is occasionally disturbing and the effects of makeup are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film. There is something extremely morbid and unsettling about looking at a helpless woman hanging upside down in a chimney and waiting to be fried.
