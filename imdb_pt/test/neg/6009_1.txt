This is by far the worst Hemingway adaptation of all time. Rock Hudson was very badly and entirely unbelievable as a hard-to-gnaw soldier / adventurer drawn to war. Jennifer Jones was too old for her part and Vittorio de Sica seemed to think he was acting in some other movie. They have tried to make a large-scale epic from a low-key romance novel and the result is terrible. As if that were not enough, the whole thing is so slow, long and dated that it is virtually impossible to find. Rock must have kicked himself for refusing "Sayonara" and "Ben Hur" to do that horrible crap. <br /> <br /> 0/10. To be avoided.
