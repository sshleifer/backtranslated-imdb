Years ago, "MA2412", the feature film tried to be some sort of "Blockbuster regional" in Austria. One thing is for sure: I hope no one on the outside ever has to see this. Maybe if you're familiar with the original sitcom, it might be interesting to see what director Sicheritz did of his series. I think he lost his chance and wasted his time and money. So far, many directors and writers have been unable to make a serial concept compatible with a 90-minute film (see Alf, Inspector Gadget ...). You can see how difficult this is by watching "MA 2412". The result of this attempt, in my opinion, tastes like an endless TV episode (not a good one). He can not deliver a plot, humor tries too hard and the direction seems too blurry - as it does for the visual style. <br /> <br /> In short, I clearly would not recommend this ...
