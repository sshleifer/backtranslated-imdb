His embalmed look was totally inadequate for the role. Her face was too white, her hair too hairy, clothes, and so on. very clean (and well-adjusted, especially the old hat and coat of the father in the scene where Inman comes home) by any sense of precision. It would be one thing if production allowed all other actors to remain clean and perfect too, but she was the only one who did not get confused. There was never a spot on the cheek of dust. Should we believe she was the only person in the Civil War with a bathtub and a mirror? She certainly looked like the only person who wore them. Tweezers also; I mean, what's with those eyebrows? She looked absolutely bad! <br /> <br /> The love story was implausible. She only went to the guy because someone told him that he had said he thought she was cute. So she goes to tease him, then flirts with him a few more times, and suddenly this is a love on a par with Ulysses and Penelope? Please. <br /> <br /> I should know better than to expect anything better from the man who brought us "The English Patient." My reaction to this was the same as Elaine's in Seinfeld: "It sucks."
