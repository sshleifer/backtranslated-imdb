-SPOILERS ------------ I'm a fan of French cinema from the 60s-70s, but not necessarily the most modern ones, so to be honest, I watched this because of Bellucci. She's very young here, extremely handsome and additionally supposedly this movie is where they met up with Cassel, so that gives extra significance. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a very cool style that reminds DePalma. Then, suddenly, we are thrown into flashback, and the comings and goings are getting tiresome. I do not mind a flash back, but do it and kill the man !!! Anyway, the movie is still interesting to me to a point where the first and hole defined in the plot, which allows the rest of the story, never lets me enjoy the rest. I can allow small holes here and there, but not to base a whole plot in the warm air.This is the story of a man who is literally looking for an old flame.This is the main plot.I go along when the story at some point will convince me that there are really mysterious things going on , but in history there is nothing really mysterious. Bellucci-Cassel is a couple, so Bellucci urgently has to go out for some work in Italy (and not the furthest place in the land of Paris) and she leaves a message, that for reasons later explained that he was not supposed to be absent for two months (not exactly a century) and she would not call her boyfriend in Paris to see how he is? Of course not. Instead, even after she returns, she forgets everything about him. And okay, but later in the movie she tells her friend that she was his greatest love and was ready to commit for the first time in her life. she failed to call him for two months and then never tried to get back with him. What about Cassel's character? He supposedly could not find it in Italy, really hard to find someone in Italy, it's probably like Siberia, especially an actress who is probably listed even in the arts jobs. And after 2 months when she would be back, really hard to find her and ask for an explanation. One thinks that she wanted to avoid it, but no, we discovered that they simply could not find. It's hard to find yourself in Paris. OK, I do not need to go any further, because this is the incident on which the entire movie is based. What's even worse, Bellucci is not really the star of the movie, but this other girl is Bohringer.
