An art student in Rome is possessed ... or something. She has dreams of being nailed to a cross and Satan himself raping her. He owns her (I think) and turns her into a sex addict. That's all I could do and I hung up. <br /> <br /> A meaningless "exorcist" starts. I got it on cable back in the 80's and was horrified ... and not on a good way! This movie is meant to be a horror movie but turns into nothing more than a sex movie disguised as a horror movie. There are tons of nonsensical female nudity and the actress playing the lead role must degrade more than once. We see her being raped by Satan (a hot-looking guy), masturbating, getting to her own father ... You have to give points for bravery. Add to that the dubbing, the editing (the rape scene seems to have been cut a little), the bad acting and a story that does not make sense. The only disturbing sequence (she being nailed to the cross) ALMOST works, but the lousy "special" effects spoil everything. This is one of the few horror movies that was so bad I stopped watching. Skip this.
