This is a snuff film. I'm shocked, even considered in the IMDb library. And Bill, Julia and all the other "professional" actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sickly movie. I thought I would see a somewhat classic horror movie with a creative ending that writers like to invent ... which generally do not make sense when writing a horror movie, but as a viewer, we try to rationalize and understand. This end was not creative. He was sick and has all the signs of a snuff film. I am shocked that it was edited for this finale, and more shocked that it will be distributed by the end of June 2009. It should not be shown in a theater. It is harmful to innocent minds on many levels .... watch the movie, the end, and you will understand this statement. Also, included in the plot is a sweet girl "not yet 9," her character says. She is not at the end of snuff, but it is an integral part of the film. Why do directors feel they need to hit a sick movie to gain recognition? The director is on the wrong line of work if she thinks this is an art film.
