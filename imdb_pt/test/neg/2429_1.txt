It hurts me to see an incredible movie turn into a lame, repetitive, lazy series. It is full of holes and the plot is confusing, in a BAD way. Whoever the chop writers decided to make such a good movie in that junk should have done some research, instead of filling it with simple phrases and new empty characters, and the classic jokes of the first film "And More and More and More." AGAIN. Of course they are a bit creative, but it's like watching the same episode with a little twist. Much like listening to Creed or Nickleback. Kuzco has to prevent himself from failing, Yzma has a complicated plan, but decides to follow the easy way to save time and use only a potion, someone questions the monkey and the insect, Bucky appears in the background, Kuzco flirts with Malina, she dissects - or without sounding like a bitch, Yzma disguises herself as "Director Amzy" and she calls Kronk, and he forgets she is Yzma. I admit, this show has moments. Another problem is the fact that Yzma looks younger and Pacha seems ... strange. Plus, no one can replace David Spade and John Goodman! They are the ones who made Kuzco and Pacha Kuzco and Pacha! Sorry, but I give this show two thumbs down.
