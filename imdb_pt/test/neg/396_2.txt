Kazuo Komizu, who did not make a decent film, directed this shocking "notorious" and should have been ashamed to have been a success in his Japanese release. <br /> <br /> Yes, it features scenes of rape, gore and breakup, but so what? It has the style of a bad movie filmed and poorly photographed by Ed Powers ("Dirty Debutantes") and is incredibly slow. <br /> <br /> It seems that he gained his notoriety based on his list of anti-social acts. <br /> <br /> There is a huge difference between this and the horror that is well produced. <br /> <br /> Just because someone likes movies a little wet does not mean they will accept crap like that. On the contrary, this type of fan (I, for example) tolerates even less crap than the average gambler out there because he has seen too much and has become overly insightful. Too bad the producers do not realize that. <br /> <br /> A critic here (ZombieKilla81) commented that the "almost obsession of the film with collective rape" is one of the factors that killed him. I disagree. The subject is never the problem. The question is how this subject is handled. In A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN'S ENTRAILS, she is treated so unimaginatively that she is boring. Personally, I like graphical representations of psychopathic behavior (with an intriguing context) if the material is well targeted, freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing. This Nikkatsu horror / pink hybrid is regrettable.
