This movie was bad on many levels. The writing was horrible, so even the best actors could not have watched this movie. It's a shame because they had some good actors in this movie. I mean, if anyone saw any of the Police Academy movies, you'd know that Steve Guttenberg was good. His character in this movie was very serious, which was a big difference from the characters I've seen him play before, so that was an advantage. And I thought Steve Guttenberg was extremely excited about this movie. With or without the shirt, you can not deny that he has a great body! Sexy face too. I loved the 5 o'clock shadow look, that made it look dangerous. In a part of the movie he is lying in bed without his shirt and I have to say, I would have gladly jumped there and tried to get his mind off his problems! So, honestly, I would watch this movie again just to fantasize!
