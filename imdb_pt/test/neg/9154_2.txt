THE DAUGHTER OF MEMORY KEEPERS, in the form of a novel by Kim Edwards, was a bestseller of great success and probably appeared in more reading groups than any other novel during its circulation. So what happened when romance became a movie made for television? It may be John O'Tooleier's down-to-earth script (oops !, teleplay!), Which consistently advances in a strange and pedestrian way, removing all sense of credibility from the story. Maybe it's the cut and paste direction of Mick Jackson, who loses his rhythm and character outline. He may suffer from the cinematography of an uncredited source or the musical score of "liquid tears" by Daniel Licht. By any of these (or all of these reasons), this movie novel survives because it is a good argument to educate the public about the capabilities of those born with Down Syndrome. And so it is worthy of attention. Dr. David Henry (Dermot Mulroney), a successful orthopedic doctor, is married to the beautiful Norah (Gretchen Mol) and their lives are changing with pregnancy. On a stormy winter night in Kentucky, Norah goes into labor and Henry's run to a nearby clinic where David delivers his wife (the doctor is surprised by a blizzard) with the help of his old friend Caroline Gill (Emily Watson) . After delivering a perfect boy (Paul), Norah continues in labor and (surprisingly ...) offers an unexpected (!) Twin girl. David and Caroline immediately acknowledge that the little girl (Phoebe) is a 'Mongoloid' (and this is before the use of the term Down Syndrome) and David, having a history of losing a sister because of a birth defect) decides to send Phoebe an asylum for the mentally challenged: Caroline must make the delivery and Norah is informed that the second twin died in childbirth. Caroline follows the instructions, sees the conditions of the "house" where Phoebe must be deposited, shrinks in horror and decides to keep the child. Helped by a friendly trucker, Caroline changes her solitary existence and mothers Phoebe, finding a new life in her Pittsburgh truck. Norah insists on a formal funeral for Phoebe - a fact that deeply disturbs David's psyche, and Henry's life continues with only one child, Paul, leaving submerged pains about the absence of Phoebe's presence. Norah presents David with a camera ("people's lives are like a camera, that's where they live - in a room captured for a moment") and David becomes obsessed with photography. Norah laments, drinks and loses David's attention, while David traces Phoebe's existence with Caroline - sending money and letters to Pittsburgh. Paul (Tyler Stentiford for Jamie Spilchuk) grows, discovers his mother's infidelities and is angered by his father's lack of communication and understanding, and decides to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician, and for Juilliard he goes. Meanwhile, Phoebe (Krystal Hope Nausbaum) has matured into a highly adapted young woman, and the way the Henrys' broken marriage takes place and the healing atmosphere of Phoebe and Paul's lives coupled with the courage that supported Caroline Gill's fight to win acceptance in the world for those born with Down Syndrome forms the conclusion of the film. <br /> <br /> The cast of known actors tries hard, but only Emily Watson is able to resurrect a credible character in this script. Jamie Spilchuk shows a young actor with a lot of promise. Dermot Mulroney and Gretchen find it difficult to shape the empathic characters of the frivolous lines they are given to deliver. The film is a mess, but the message about accepting children and adults with Down's syndrome is important. Grady Harp
