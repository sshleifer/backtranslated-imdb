Although his plot is drawn from the history of ancient Rome, 'Caligula' is not made in the style of sword and sandal epics like 'Spartacus' or 'Gladiator'. (This style of footage was out of date in the late seventies). Instead, it's more like a cross between a soft-core porn movie and a nasty video. At least the abbreviated version of 150 minutes does. I've never seen the full version of 210 minutes, but judging by the descriptions of this page, it seems closer to a cross between a hard-core porn movie and a nasty video. As you would expect from a movie produced by the Penthouse publisher, there is a lot of naked flesh to be seen, and the film carefully catalogs Caligula's sexual perversions, including his incestuous affair with his sister Drusilla . . What may be unexpected from the editor of a magazine so intimately associated with the heterosexual male lifestyle is that there is both male and female flesh on display and distinctly homoerotic overtones in many scenes. The obsession with sex is balanced by an obsession equal to violence, as if Bob Guccione, Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass were trying to kill two taboos with one stone. (It's a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a blatant movie should be called 'Brass' and the screenwriter of such a bloody movie should be called 'Gore'). Characters are killed or mutilated in various sadistic ways, and there is a charming scene of homosexual rape. Emperor Caligula and his predecessor Tiberius were certainly known for their depraved lifestyles, so the film's focus on sex and violence is not necessarily historically imprecise. However, I question whether such concentration is necessary to help us understand this period in Roman history. Both "The Fall of the Roman Empire" and "Gladiator" were created during the reign of Commodus, an emperor as cruel and licentious as Caligula. In neither case did filmmakers find it necessary to turn their film into a mix of 'Up Pompeii!', 'Emmanuelle' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', and both films are artistically much better than 'Caligula'. > <br /> The acting in the film is not particularly bad, with some exceptions, such as the horribly wooden Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla. Malcolm McDowell makes a properly insane Caligula. Caligula was undoubtedly cruel and eccentric at the same time, but historians debated whether he was actually mentally ill. The great mystery is exactly why so many illustrious British actors should have agreed to participate in such a despicable production. In the case of Helen Mirren (the only British Empire lady with a porn actress past), she was probably linked to her rather deplorable tendency to switch between the intellectual and the despicable, but heaven knows what Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud thought they were doing it. Unlike other famous stage actors, such as Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton, Gielgud did not always seem completely at home in the movies, but here he gives an interpretation worthy of the role of Nerva, a decent and honorable old-school senator. Unfortunately, in the context of this film, any attempt at dignity is as misplaced as a pearl in a dunghill. Guccione clearly succeeded in his ambition that this film would become a sort of cult classic of decadence. (If Brass and Vidal had the same ambition for the film is open to questioning). The film, however, does not happen on any other level, either as an art cinema or as a study of dictatorship politics. Even seen as erotic is second-rate. 4/10
