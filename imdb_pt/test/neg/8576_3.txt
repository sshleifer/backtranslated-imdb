This week's surprise screening on GV turned out to be the horror film The Nun. Seriously, I think horror movies should try to create more imaginative titles, even if the story is about the character as described in the title. Who knows, soon we will have spinoffs like The Monk, The Priest, and others belonging to various religious sects. <br /> <br /> The basic premise is very simple, that a ghoul dressed in a costume of nuns who can claim the title) is killing ex-convent girls. There seemed to be some kind of conspiracy involved, since the daughter of one of the victims, Eva (played by an Olympic maiden Anita Briem), discovers, with the help of some good friends, as a robbery of I know what you did in the summer past (also mentioned, by the way). <br /> <br /> So, as body counts increase, it's a race against time for our emotionally-marked heroine (is not it always?) Find the truth and save the day. Investigating the sins of the mothers, the film did the unthinkable, which with a dream sequence as the introduction. I hate dream sequences, since it's a very cheap technique if it's not done correctly, and there are some of them in the movie. <br /> <br /> In part, the film touched on moments like Ju-On going wrong with the movie. many references to Dark Water, and they could have renamed this Unholy Water, to the circumstances and plot points in the film. However, there are holes in the plot, so do not stare at the plot too deeply. You would come to expect that the standard textbook twists all the way over to the sadistic nun, and sets out that it looks like they can rival the recent Thai horror film Dorm. <br /> <br /> The acting is quite forgettable, with the cast speaking in perfect highly pronounced English. And as most of them are pleasing to the eye, the story must intertwine in a love scene in the middle of a witch hunt. What gives? Hello, I have hantu, still have mood ah? So again, the ghoul is a very cheap SFX that has a built-in AI popping up every now and then in a variety of ways just to provoke screams from shy audiences. The characters also break all the rules not written in the Do-Nots in the horror folklore, so you know and expect their fair desserts. <br /> <br /> Can you possibly enjoy this movie? Certainly you can. Just make sure you're watching in a full house (it should be easy, since local people are suckers for anything remotely horrible), and laugh at those who are so nervous that they scream in all the "scary" scenes. It's a lot of fun and adds to the atmosphere in addition to what's happening on the screen. Surround sound does not even come close. <br /> <br /> Think of it as watching a Scooby Doo episode without the jokes, and it's a shame that the film's bloody moments had to be censored for a PG rating. . Those could have been the best pieces, now left rotting on the censor's floorboard.
