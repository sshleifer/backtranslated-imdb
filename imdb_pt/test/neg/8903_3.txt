Abderrahmane Sissako may have known what he was doing when he did "Bamako," but the rest of us may simply sit in the mystification and confusion trying to figure out what that purpose might be. <br /> <br /> The nominal "plot" involves a young African singer who plans to leave her husband unemployed to find work in the city. But much more screen time is occupied with what the movie's advertisers describe as "a mock trial of major financial institutions," dealing with "Africa's enormous economic difficulties." Okay, I suppose, but when arguments and ideas are presented as dramatic and pedantic as they are here, they lose strength and impact. In other words, if the director had found the means to really incorporate issues such as the damaging effect of colonialism on the African people and the African debt problem on anything remotely resembling a compelling plot, the film could have reached the intellectual and emotional. The themes with which the film is dealing may be relevant and important, but try to spend what amounts to two hours of speech as a true, honest to God. The film is not likely to get much of the audience for someone else's message.
