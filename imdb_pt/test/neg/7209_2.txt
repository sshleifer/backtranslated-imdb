SPOILERS: The original Road House is one of those movies I know is clichéd and unoriginal, but it's so good, I'm ashamed to admit that I really enjoyed it. It turns out that many of my friends, whose movie reviews I respect, think the same way. So when they try to make a sequel and it's as if it were written by some high school kids who were given the right to make a sequel, it's bad; Very, very bad. <br /> <br /> Strangely, Johnathon Schaech is listed as one of the writers and I can only hope that his participation in WGA will be revoked. The writing was simply bad and all the writers of this film must retire for complete lack of originality and some of the worst dialogues in this millennium. Schaech already seems to be the king of the DVD sequel straight to the DVD (8mm 2, Poison Ivy 2) and now after seeing this and 8mm 2, I'm thinking that his acting ability is nonexistent. He was awful, just awful. <br /> <br /> And it's not the terrible fighting scenes that make this movie terrible, but take it from me, they're bad. Each fight scene is a slowly delivered punch (still making the "wiff" sound in the air) which is then blocked by the opponent, who returns a punch that sends the first face to the ground. This is repeated throughout the film, worse than any other bad cop show of the 1970s. Or the fact that many of the people involved in the fights seem to have a mouth full of kool-aid cherry for some reason. And we must believe that Will Patton is a fighting machine; Her fight scenes look so incredibly fake that I was honestly embarrassed watching. <br /> <br /> It's the complete lapses of logic in this ridiculous movie that makes it terrible. For example: Johnathon Schaech's character is in town for a day and already tells a girl that he barely knows who he has no idea of ​​which side she is on, "I'm with the feds, but do not tell anyone." The female villain, who fights the good girl in a stunt-fighting scene that rivals any superhero, is easily dominated by "old" Will Patton in another scene simply holding both hands as he utters some ridiculous line ("stab me once, embarrass me, stab me twice, it will not happen" wow, that's bad) and then head over it. Jake Busey's villain shoots the feds while getting caught in the middle of a drug trade, but no DEA agent or anyone else simply goes to his place and picks it up, in fact, he simply lets it go because "this is the sheriff territory ". Busey wants the bar because it is "in a great location" for drug deals, but her own house seems to be so good, apparently offering all the advantages that the bar should have. The character of Johnathon Schaech must be the son of the character of Patrick Swayze in the original, but the surname of Swayze's character is Dalton and Schaech is not (nor the supposed brother of Swayze's character). And Johnathon Schaech looks like about 50 in this movie. I looked up, he's 17 years younger than Swayze, but he looks awful. <br /> <br /> But my absolutely stupid scene in this movie was the highest rated fight scene that ended in movies: the villain is knocked down by a window on a second floor and while they pan down I'm thinking "please , do not tell me he's impaled on something ... "and sure enough, my worst fears were realized. <br /> <br /> Actually, I could continue for another half hour about the things I hated about this movie. Suffice it to say that we are going to end these ridiculous sequences for theatrical movies, at least those with Johnathon Schaech.
