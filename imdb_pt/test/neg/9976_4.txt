Companion Giallo fanatic: care and / or proceed with caution ?? for this movie is not exactly what it seems to be. It certainly looks like a Giallo, with its juicy VHS cover (showing a busty naked girl and a big bloody knife), rhythm title and the names of two veteran Italian actors in the cast (John Phillip & Fernando Rey), but it's basically just a thriller erotic without much plot. Is the version I watched presumably severely censored ?? with a run time of only 77 minutes? but there is still a serious lack of suspense, character development and, above all, sadistic carnage (and typically Giallo). "Eyes Behind the Wall" can be summed up as a reunion of a bunch of perverted characters and a detailed description of their sexuality problems. It is an interesting endeavor, nevertheless, because the writer / director Giuliano Petrelli (his only film) clearly tried to do something special, but the overall result is unsatisfactory and, unfortunately, tame. Inspired by Hitchcock's "Rear Window," the main character is a frustrated writer of seniors and wheelers. He and his much younger lover have their sexual kicks to spy on the only male tenant living on the other side of the road. The tenant respectively enjoys exercising around the house while naked and clearly has bisexual desires. The guy in the wheelchair sends his wife and they have sex. Then there is also Ottavio the butler who repeatedly rapes students. Are there any normal characters in the story? Well, no, of course not! The film benefits from a continually sinister atmosphere, with a melancholy soundtrack and a cool picture, but none of it goes anywhere, so it's all just sleaze and unimportant sex. There is a truly bizarre turnaround / revelation at the end of the story, but it comes too late and too random to raise the overall quality. Not recommended to fans of Italian horror / cult cinema, but maybe it's great to see psychology students, to analyze Freud-style characters.
