Spectacular production and good comedy performance of George Clooney can not save curiously the highlighted, almost bland comedy of Joel and Ethan Coen. The tale of the depression era traces back to yesterday with three fugitive gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process! The film snakes but never builds any moment. He gets a big boost from Clooney's charismatic Gableesque, as well as the art direction and T-Bone Burnett's lively music. Otherwise, the script (by Coen) is seriously lacking in humor and interest, supporting special guest appearances of John Goodman and Holly Hunter do not add any momentum, and the second half of the film slips precariously into self-indulgence. ** in ****
