As someone already mentioned in this forum, it is very difficult to make a fake documentary. It requires tremendous skill, patience, patience, 'distance' in the direction, a plausible premise, a narrative 'flow' and a REALLY believable performance (also known as GREAT performance). <br /> <br /> This is not the case with 'Love Machine'. He begins to show his fake hand over the 20 minute mark (with 60 minutes to see), and the viewer begins to realize that he or she is being taken. It's from there. <br /> <br /> Director Gordon Eriksen simply peaked early. But to be fair to Eriksen, his problems started early: as he explains in the extras, he started wanting to make a REAL document, failed to get funding, and opted for a cheaper way to make his film. <br /> <The premise - people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn site - was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98 when the film was made. Eriksen does a lot of complicated things - an aggressive "host", handhelds, zooms, grainy blacks and whites - all, I think, to elicit a sense of authenticity, but it just does not work. The film is confusing and forced, but what finally brings to the fore is the credibility of the actors and the horrible dialogue.
