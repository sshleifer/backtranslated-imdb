Sometimes when a movie is criticized by critics, just watch it to see if it's really as bad as the affirmation, well in this case it was. I believe this was meant to be a sex comedy, but it was neither sexy nor funny, I think I laughed once when Johnny Vegas failed to jump a fence at the side of the road and that was it. <br /> <br /> The film follows the lives of four men who deliver potatoes to live, each of them has a problem with their sex lives; Dave left his wife and seeks an old flame that once invited him to a trio a few years before, Ferris is living with his mother-in-law who treats him as a sexual object, Tolly has an obsession with wrapping strawberry jam in his encounters, and Jeremy claims to be in a loving relationship but is actually chasing some poor woman. <br /> <br /> The tone of the jokes ranges from tasteless to "I do not believe anyone could write this" an example of the latter is when they tell a young child that his father died in a car accident, so , when the boy asks how his mother is, they say she is in a coma. The guilt for all this comes directly to the feet of the writers, the actors obviously made a poor choice agreeing to be in this movie, but I did not think their acting was that bad ... not that it was that good. Surprisingly, for a rather despicable movie about sex, there is no nudity and sex is never erotic. <br /> <br /> I certainly would not recommend seeing this for any other reason than morbid curiosity, though I judge from other reviews that this seems to be a love or loathing movie, I suspect it would be best watched after a few beers and with your friends.
