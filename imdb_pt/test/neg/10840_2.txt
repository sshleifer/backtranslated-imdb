There were a few decent moments in this movie, and sometimes it was really funny. However, this did not offset the fact that, in general, this was a tremendously annoying movie. There was no chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this movie, and I could not understand why he would even consider leaving his future wife for that girl he supposedly was knocked out by. There was better chemistry between him and Liv Tyler at Armageddon. Hell, there was better chemistry between Sly and Sandra in Demolition Man. There were several moments in the movie that simply did not need to be there and were painfully slow. <br /> <br /> This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding". Wait until you're out for a year and a half on a video and rent it in the 49-cent bin if you have nothing else to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon, and you can not think of any better movie to rent.
