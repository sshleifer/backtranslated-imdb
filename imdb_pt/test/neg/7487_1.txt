I thought this was an extremely bad movie. During all the time I watched this movie, I could not help thinking how bad it was and how it cost $ 3.69. The plot was so agitated. They did an excellent job at the beginning of explaining who dated those in high school, but they never really explained anything after that. Was it a supernatural thriller? Was it a regular thriller? Apparently you can decide for yourself because they have not seen the need to explain. I basically understood what happened, I guess. What I was confused was all this before, what was the deal with bloody noses, phone calls, etc? Was this guy coming back? Was the wife channeling "Carrie" or something? Who knows? You certainly will not after watching this movie.
