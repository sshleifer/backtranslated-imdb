This film is meant to be a character study of perversion. Some critics have been deceived into assuming that, as perversion is portrayed, the film is psychologically profound; in fact, considering the lascivious material, it is surprisingly tedious and superficial, without motivational substance. Why is the main character the way she is? You will not find out the script. For a better treatment of the same theme (and a more fun movie), try the Belle de Jour de Bunuel.
