Poor action movies are the graveyards for the aging of martial arts stars. In such films, they struggle to maintain that dangerous behavior that made their early work succeed, but all end in failure. Seagal is too old for this kind of paper, but he will not let go ... no matter how silly he may seem. Some expect their present work to bring back magic, but there is no magic. The late 80's and early 90's belonged to Steven Seagal and his work made me a fan. I could see him fitting nicely into a crack in The Sopranos, where his overweight body, jowly features and sullen attitude could have found a home. I wonder what is the return of your career from direct to video films?! Since he produces them, I am assuming that the $$$ is more than satisfactory. If this is the agreement, we will be subject to bad Seagal action movies in their last 60 and 70 years .....
