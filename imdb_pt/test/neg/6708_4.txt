This movie starts with this scary song that gave me shivers like the song used on "Nightmare on Elmstreet"! This immediately sets the mood! The following sequence also shows what to expect! We are told that a ghost is present! The mystery about this ghost is what keeps this movie together! But the plot structure is so complex that it's hard to understand! The ideas behind the plot are quite interesting! Only the way we are told is too abstract! I understand the director believes he had to keep the mystery as long as possible! The problem is that when certain subjects are revealed, you never get a satisfactory explanation! The motives of the important characters are left out and some issues raised in the film are not answered! Since we have not learned enough about the characters, it's hard to take care of them! And as a consequence, you will lose interest! Only a few scares and a twist save this movie from becoming a total failure! The turnaround is interesting, but not a real shock! The experienced viewer will see this coming! Some critics complain that this movie is very much like "Ringu" and is not original at all! Well, it's true that some of the effects and scares are borrowed from this movie! But there is one major difference! The suspense in "Ringu" was based mainly on this turnaround in which the spectator discovers how the characters are dead !! In "Ryeong" (the "Ringu" as) twist is used as a scary effect to accompany another crazy twist! "Ryeong" depends a lot on a complex structured plot and twist that does not contain enough scares to keep your interest! Put simply: This is not a horror movie!
