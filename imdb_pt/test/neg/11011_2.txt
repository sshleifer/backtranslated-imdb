For me, this movie was simply confusing, slow and uninteresting. Why did the aliens choose to communicate through ants? It makes no sense. The ending was confusing and did not make any sense. In the end, I expected the ants to kill everyone. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. Not even the MST3K was able to save it.
