Maybe it's because I'm not a fan of comics (but if the comics are of the same "quality" as the film, it's hard to believe there are any), but this has to be one of the worst movies ever made. Non-existent plot, laughable acting, idiotic dialogue ... This movie is so bad that it hurts. Very. That some people actually gave this 10/10 is an insult to any good movie or at least mediocre (or at least bad). If you hate yourself, then see Tank Girl! In another thought, if you hate yourself so much, maybe you should commit suicide ... My rating: -34/10
