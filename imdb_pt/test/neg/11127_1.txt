OK, if you're a fan of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 and you love simulated movies, then you'll have a great time with it. Otherwise, it can be very painful to see. An obscene cripologist invades a huge box containing a Chupacabra on a cruise ship (apparently without having to declare it at customs, or even mention that he is bringing aboard a living animal - "No, it's a research equipment, the air holes are just an accident"). A few sticks he hired to open the crate, imagining he paid a lot of money, maybe there's something to steal. Once the WOOD CHAIR is open, the Chupacabra goes through the STEEL BARS inside and goes in a death bout. <br /> <br /> Yes, whatever. By a stroke of pure coincidence, a Marshall (I presume that a US Marshall, since he was in the Gulf War, not just a fellow named Marshall) is on board, investigating some money that has disappeared of the ship's safe. He is posing as an insurance salesman ("Madam, I am the best insurance you have ..."). Other flamboyant characters include the captain (John Rhys-Davies, and unfortunately his dignity is the first victim of the film), his tae-bo instructor daughter (giggle-Tae-bo), an angry old lady with a small dog. who should be fed to a cat (guess WHAT eats ...?) and an incredibly nasty gigolo that might have been believable in a 1964 film, not something more recent. Much of the acting was very bad, and the characters were there just so you could laugh hysterically when they died. <br /> <br /> General - blatantly bad. Bad on many levels. Bad bad bad What??? Bullets do not even make the Chupacabra retreat, but the Tae-bo Bimbo can punch you and scare you ???? Hey Sci-fi Channel, are you desperate for scripts or what?
