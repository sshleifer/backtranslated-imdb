In 1989, here in New Zealand, wrestling was a mega-hype phenomenon, and the leading star was the orange elf HULK HOGAN (one of my uber-heroes at the time), so it seems obvious to me now why I loved this movie in 1989-90 when it came out here. HULK HOGAN A.K.A Terry Bollea is an incredibly bad actor and Zeus A.K.A Tiny Lister is worse !!! The plot follows a standard WWE (then WWF) about 88-91 story line culminating with the good standard guy knocking down, hulk up and then being defeated again story line just to follow that good guy calls all his inner strength gained from eating vitamins, praying etc etc) to ride the epic back ..... Beautiful standard formula here. Worth watching just to reminisce about your youth !!!!
