Horrible script, which apparently was directed by ... anyone? The Marines can not fend off the monster with machine guns, however, back when a 15-year-old karate kicks his face a few times. It's supposed to be a luxury ocean liner, but the Fancy Dining Room looks like a coffee shop in a hospital. It looks like they rented a school for the summer, and took out chairs and things to decorate the set. In the final shot, they are pulled from the water into a boat and, less than 3 seconds later, are apparently about two miles from the ship when it sinks. How are movies like that made? I think anyone can be in a movie these days. Aaron James, NYC
