Currently, Asian horror films are among the best in the world, known for their atmosphere and reflection of contemporary society. This is not one of those movies! Instead, "The Record" is a mediocre horror film highly derived from American films like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Scream." The plot is familiar - 5 teenagers accidentally commit a terrible crime, but cover up by swearing secrecy. A year later, they are being chased by a maniac with knives (with the decided disguise of a sterile hospital mask and an orange jumpsuit). It does not help that teenagers are a generally nasty group (this is one of those movies in which the killer's motives seem quite reasonable) and there are numerous stupid settings to keep the story going. The direction of the film is not subtle, more influenced by MTV than by the current Asian horror films (such as "The Ring"). The last third of the movie is not so bad, however, delivering some decent suspense scenes, although there is probably a lot of "twisting" in the end. 4/10
