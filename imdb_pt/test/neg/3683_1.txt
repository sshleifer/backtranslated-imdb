The gates of Hell opened and spat this movie, then closed again. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie makes me appreciate other movies I've seen, like all the other movies. Nothing makes sense in this movie. <br /> <br /> It would take a lot of time to mention all the plot issues. In fact, except as a warning, it is not worth wasting a little of the almost endless space available on the internet writing about this movie. From now on, I'll check the IMDb before watching any movie. <br /> <br /> Hot, IMDb is forcing me to write more about this movie. I think I should warn you about Edison Force while I'm at it. But if you had to choose between the two, choose Edison Force.
