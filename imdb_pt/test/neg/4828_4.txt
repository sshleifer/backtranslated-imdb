I watched this movie about thirty years ago and stayed in my head so far. When I came across this on DVD, I did not hesitate much more, because I have a predilection for the first films of Belmondo. But what a bad surprise! Some films should be allowed to resign from public exposure, to preserve a certain memory, and not to shock the public. <br /> <br /> Widely acclaimed as one of Chabrol's rare cynical works, the only lasting impression I have ever received is ... Boredom. Some movies really do not age in style. But what about movies that had no sense of style? <br /> <br /> The flaws in the script, the uninspired acting - presumably due to the lack of direction -, a kind of production design, which does not deserve its name, less than mediocre photography and, last but not least not least, the worst editing job I've seen in a while, makes it truly hard to bear. <br /> <br /> My impression was that there were a lot of people with lots of money and equipment, but obviously no idea or any skill at all. It's really a surprise, that this has not abruptly ended Chabrol's career. Do not blame the general bad taste of the 70's, this is trash in its own right and a worthy competitor for the most useless waste of celluloid ever.
