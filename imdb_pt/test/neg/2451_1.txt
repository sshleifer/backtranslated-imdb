I think I'd rather have my stacks cut with a couple of rusty cutters than enduring another 5 minutes of this movie. In fact, I can not even be bothered to go into details! I do not know how they managed to put the needles in the wood actors to heal them! Better for everyone involved if they had just destroyed the island after finding out about the virus, so it would have lasted as long as the commercial break, and we could have moved on with our lives. One more thing was this rubbish ordered by the god channel? Like all they seemed to do was compliment the bleeding lord most of the time. Avoid like the plague! In fact I would prefer!
