If it's true that the film costs only 150K, that explains a lot. But that does not explain why there is no real plot. In the middle of the movie I honestly did not care if they got out or not. I just wanted to finish the movie and go to bed. The ending was really dumb and made me wish I had just closed the movie and gone to bed early. Very good performance considering there was not much to follow. If you like really bad movies with horrible lighting (even for a cave) and poor camera work (even for a cave) ... then you really will like this movie. By the way, if the boy's plane crashed in 1980, when he was about 10 years or more, how could he have forgotten how to talk, and built so much anger? Would not he have wanted to get help from the first people he saw, even if it was 14 years later?
