After a snowstorm, the roads are blocked and patrolman Jason (Adam Beach) arrives at the restaurant of his friend Fritz (Jurgen Prochnow) and advises his clients that they can only follow their travels the following day. Among the strange strangers, Jason meets his ex-girlfriend Nancy (Rose McGowan), who has just left her husband in Los Angeles. Throughout the night, without any communication with his base, Jason faces distressing and suspicious situations with clients, and finds some corpses, indicating that among them there is a killer. <br /> <br /> "The Last Stop" could be an ordinary thriller, but the script is simply horrible. Most of the characters are despicable people and the motives of the astounding serial killer are never divulged, and viewers have no further explanation as to why the killer decided to kill the guests. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Trapped"
