Yes, I spelled it right. This movie is so predictable, the actual word needs additional letters to exemplify predictability. From the moment the main characters and situation are introduced, it is the paint-by-numbers where this plot will lead us. The harbinger was as subtle as a two-ton sledgehammer. You could have several parts of the dialogue and anticipate the role you would play in the end. <br /> <br /> Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhardt did decent jobs in less demanding roles and Abigail Breslin played the beautiful role admirably. It's just that the film did not bring anything new to the romantic comedy genre. The novel was tepid and the laughter was weak and few. Of course, it's an OK movie if you have nothing to watch but you will not miss out on anything, miss this one.
