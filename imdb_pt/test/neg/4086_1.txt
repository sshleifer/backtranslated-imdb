The only redeeming feature of this film is Steve Carell. Like John Wayne, I've never seen Steve Carell distancing himself too much as an actor, but that does not matter. It always plays a perfect role. <br /> <br /> As Marty Feldman once said, the comedy must have internal consistency. You can have 4 men onstage seated in trash cans, and that's OK, but if you bring a fifth man on stage that is not in a trash can, you should explain to the audience why he is not in a can of Why does Evan not accept his role as God's messenger? Why, when he accepts, is he so deeply embarrassed by it? Why is no one more impressed with the way animals follow Evan (they are explained by the thoughtless doubters as "trained animals" possibly from a circus). There is a terrible flood in the end, and most of the people we see jump into the ark and are saved, but surely thousands of people would have been killed by the flood; there is no post-disaster emotional atmosphere in the end. Instead, most of the congress has finally seen the light and is about to prosecute the only incorrigibly bad deputy for "speculation." <br /> <br /> I have to admit: I also liked the fish in the aquarium reacting to Evan's presence
