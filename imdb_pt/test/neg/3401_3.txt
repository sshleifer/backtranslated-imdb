How is this a documentary? Much more like a walking ghost ride that one can take in any southern city. The quotations were generously discarded without the first effort to identify the source. George Orwell was the most identified. <br /> <br /> The documents were sent without ever having been produced in any way. Fraudulent and flat shots, depicting actions of period films, were set aside, alongside reels of historical films, without separation of reality and self-promotion. Film reels, which were entirely unrealistic and unlikely for the time in question, were thrown, as if trying to imitate Blair Witch, hoping to raise a house of ghosts on what would otherwise be just a dead house. <br /> <br /> Is not this a big disrespect to the real victims of tuberculosis, a dance in their collective graves in the name of commercialism? The line between the actual footage and the manufactured self-service is very small; the drops of doubt so insignificantly minimized; the scientific frontiers so blatantly ignored ... how could this be listed on my TiVo as a documentary? <br /> <br /> It is a holiday promo, and in this everything is successful. <br /> <br /> Hell, I would visit the community if I could find it in Google Earth. Not scary, said an earlier poster. Not too serious too, says I. Fascinating history. Fragile film.
