If you like stupid jokes and a terribly predictable storyline, then maybe this movie is for you. Courtney Thorne-Smith, Jack Warden and several other supporting cast members actually have talent but were completely stifled by the fine paper script. This is a usually boring and uninteresting waste of time from a movie.
