My bad movie guru (and the president of the Exposed Film Society) introduced us to this last week. There was no denying the demented glow in his eyes as he pulled out his brown paper bag and announced what he had reserved for us: "The Most Dangerous Game," filmed on a budget of about $ 2.95 . <br /> <Of course, $ 2.95 went much further in 1962, but still ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, there is certainly a lot to dislike about this movie. It is filled with serious technical gaffes (my favorite was the "repetitive musket" that fired twice in two minutes without the aid of a recharge). The hero is a coward who stands still while his injured friend fights the henchman and is killed. <br /> More? OK - The plot is a mess with no continuity to speak. The movie loses five minutes with a "special guest star," which serves as the physical embodiment of the villain's madness and paranoia, but never shows it again. The hero is smothered by the unconscious footman, but makes no mention of him when he wakes up and finds his host. The mute girl is captured, put on the shelf ... and then the movie (and the hero, who put her in that situation) just sort of "forgets" her. <br /> More? Well, the scenarios are cheap and the special effects are cheaper (makeup is an exception to this). Much of the plot is accomplished by the monotonous and monotonous narration of the narrator, which has a less dramatic impact than the menu recital at Denny's. Most of the dialogue is simply ridiculous and flushed, as if it were translated from Japanese. ("I demand that our conversation be pleasant !!!") And color values ​​tend to change from photo to photo, as if the stock of cheap movies and problematic lighting equipment were the order of the day. (Note - the latter may have been the fault of a bad impression, rather than the film crew). <br /> <br /> But there were some good times here and there. The make-up effects were surprisingly good in contrast to the rest of the film, the actors WERE interesting, especially the silent maid and the countess. And yet there was a definite and frightening atmosphere to be found, very unpleasant and disturbing. <br /> <br /> So, what was the deal with this movie? I thought about it a little, and realized that director / screenwriter Pat Boyette basically tried to put a story of the old comic horror "EC" into film. This would explain the flamboyant dialogue, the gaunt character development (comic, physiognomy = even more character than in the film), the crazy inner logic of history ("CE" horror stories went out of their way to include an unpleasant "shock" ending, and was not great in psychological realism, "excessive reliance on narrative voice (which belongs to the panel captions), and the interesting makeup effects that mimicked the grisly images that the old EC artists did so well. would be willing to bet that when Boyette saw his protagonist during the cast, he instantly saw that the guy was so close to being the equivalent of the slim and clumsy characters and gave in to faces that artists like Johnny Craig and Jack Davis drew like a human being reality and could still exist in the real world. He used costumes and lighting to emphasize the cartoon aspect of visuals and transformed m live characters from comics EC. (See: the protagonist's blank beauty, the earl's strong features, strangely tanned skin and pointed chin, platinum disc on top and bony black bonnet etc.). That would explain the film flaws. Boyette knew how to "frame" things, but he did not know how to deal with three dimensions and moving bodies. Boyette knew how to tell a scary story within the confines of a comic book page, but the nuances of the movie and the live actors escaped him. He would not be the first person with this problem, of course - see what Joel Schumacher did with "Batman". But he did not have a big budget to hide behind. <br /> <br /> In any case, I imagine that Boyette has gotten away from this train crash and probably spent less time thinking about "Dungeon of Harrow" than the people posting in the message boards of this movie. He has made, within limits certainly vague, what he set out to do, and you have to respect him for it ... even if you do not mind "Harrow."
