Karen and her boyfriend Jerry move to their new apartment in Los Angeles. They discover an old bronze bed that Karen likes, unfortunately has a really sinister story involving perverted sexual murders. "Deathbed" tries to be a frightening supernatural tale, but it will fail miserably. The action is slow, the acting is nothing special and there is no suspense at all. Even the sex scenes are thighs. The climax is quite bloody and violent then splatter fans should be satisfied. However, the first hour of "deathbed" is deadly boring and offers some tired horror movie conventions and cheap scares. Definitely one to avoid. My rating: 4 out of 10 and this is being generous. Watch "Re-Animator" or "Castle Freak" instead.
