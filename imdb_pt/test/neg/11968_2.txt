So unfortunately my partner and I watched it !!! He was appearing on a Sky channel called "Zone Horror," which basically shows horror films from B 24/7 movies. It was a boring Friday night so I decided to have a laugh and take a look at this one. Besides the atrocious acting, the terrible plot, the terrible effects, the shoddy camera work and the ridiculous brain of all this, alright, LOL !!! In all seriousness, it was a laugh, catching holes and laughing at silly actors. There is a bit of semi-nudity that animated the movie a bit, unfortunately it was the "uggo" who stood topless as my companion calls her: oD If you are bored one night and this happens to be playing, take a chance, you can to like :)
