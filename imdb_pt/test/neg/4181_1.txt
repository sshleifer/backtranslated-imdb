The first DH was not great, but I really did not expect it to be. But this horrible movie went beyond criticism. I really try to look on the bright side and give movies like this a chance, but I just could not find a good thing about it. I appreciate what Bill Cowell was trying to do, but this movie was very annoying. The story of the movie is not so bad. In fact, it's a bit original. But the film's form is as bad as many people say. In my opinion, this ranks up there with "The Off Season" and "Dracula 3000". I know a lot of people actually throw trash and make movies like that, but I really can not think of anything else good to say about it.
