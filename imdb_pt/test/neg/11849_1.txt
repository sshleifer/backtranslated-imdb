<br /> <br /> ********** SPOILER ALERT *************** <br /> <br /> If you like JURASSIC PARK 1, 2 or 3: <br /> <br /> If you enjoy really bad movies for their entertainment value, if not for their quality (case in point, John Carpenter's DARK STAR is highly recommended) <br /> <br /> If you like dinosaur movies in general, then stay away from this cinematic wallpaper! The shameless use of footage of CARNOSAUR 1 and 2 composes most of this miserable attempt of a dino / slasher film - Take the scene, for example, where the security guard finds his destiny in the clutches of the Alpha T-Rex. For some reason, it drops about 50 pounds and looks 10 years younger. Why is that? Simply because that scene was taken directly from CARNOSAUR, which was a crummy movie to start with. <br /> <br /> The ending was a copy of CARNOSAUR 2, for those who had the misfortune to read video loser. Once again, we see Mr. Rex battling a bulldozer - which alternates like a forklift truck - through the da-da-da-daa miracle! - filming of the above mentioned CARNOSAUR 1 and 2. Of course the ending is exactly the same - the beast falls to death as the complex explodes in flames. <br /> <br /> A real insult to the intelligence of anyone. <br /> <br /> But it's still better than watching ROSIE O 'DONNEL SHOW Rating: 1/2 * out of ***** <br /> <br />
