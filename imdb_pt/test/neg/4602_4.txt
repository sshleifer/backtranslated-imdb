Clearly this film was made for a new generation who may or may not have had a sense of the work of Charles Bukowski. The autobiographical character Henry Chinaski in Bukowski's stories was brilliantly portrayed perfectly by Mickey Rourke in 1987, in Barfly, also starring Faye Dunaway. Anyone who has seen 'Factotum' will certainly see 'Barfly' to take a closer look at how Bukowski wrote his character. "Factotum" lacks the greasy delicacy of Bukowski's script and the fearless despair of his lonely hero. The inadvertent humor that spreads in the dark despair of Chinaski's misadventures does not work for Dillon, as he did so admirably for the blood-soaked and filthy Rourke. Rourke's character makes the pain and pleasure of the previous night's misbehavior a setting for another ugly and tiresome day in the life of a drunken unknown and misanthropic writer. Dillon's character misses these marks in favor of a handsome, handsome, relatively clean-looking writer who hardly goes through any time in Chinaski's story. Dunaway's despicable heroine, Wanda, is the perfect complement to Henry. Women in 'Factotum' can not hold Dunaway's 'anguished goddess', and the use of more profane sexual matters in 'Factotum' proves to be more of a rude distraction than a hat tip for Bukowski's ruthless and unrepentant hatred. portraits of dysfunctional relationships. I was shocked at how many of the same scenes were used in 'Factotum' (Marisa Tomei buying all things and charging for the old one is an exact copy of 'Barfly'). <br /> <br /> If you want to see Bukowski's best stories on film, see Barfly and Love is a Dog From Hell (which is also known as Crazy Love).
