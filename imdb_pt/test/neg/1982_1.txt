When The Spirits Within was released, everything you heard from Final Fantasy fans was how horrible the movie was because it did not look like Final Fantasy. This is a different story, for better or worse. Family settings, characters, music, story and top action scenes should thrill fans of the original game. The problem is that it is not a good movie by itself. <br /> <br /> The direction during the fight scenes is often sloppy, shifting the ridiculously fast camera angles in an attempt to make the action seem more frenetic. , but only to make the scenes seem confusing and confusing. <br /> <br /> CG itself is exceptional, but I can not say it's the best I've seen since Spirits Within had a lot more details about the characters, although I have to admit that the characters from Advent Children they moved much more naturally. <br /> <br /> The plot is virtually a black hole. It is a gigantic deus ex machina designed exclusively to bring Sephiroth back for one last fight. Ancient characters reappear, but serve no real purpose other than pleasing the fans. The development of characters is non-existent and the film does nothing to solve any of the plots left hanging after the end of the game. But it's packed with fighting scenes with magical looks, invocations and limited pauses, which is probably what the fans wanted anyway. <br /> <br /> In the end, Advent Children is a very flashy action movie, but totally brainless. which serves more as a side story for Final Fantasy VII than a real sequel. <br /> <br /> By the way, do not think you're hurting my feelings by voting Not Helpful. It just makes me feel superior knowing that fanboys / fangirls resent much of my objectivity.
