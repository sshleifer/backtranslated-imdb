A virtual carbon copy of the cave saves a little less budget effects and a slightly different storyline. I knew the movie was going downhill when I saw the fake fire lights reflected in a facial close-up of one of the actors. The conflicts between characters and subplots seemed to serve nothing, and did not add anything to the film, except for less moments of silence. The acting was not as bad as the typical B movie, and there was some credibility in their fear, but as professionals, they seem to be psychologically unstable too for their chosen profession. Overall, it's not worth spending $ 4.50 to rent.
