There is an inherent problem in commenting or reviewing a movie like this. I remember feeling the same after not liking Dogma. If you do not like a movie that is strange and controversial as Dr. Mulholland, you are seen as "not understanding". Of course for those who have watched this movie, you know that the main point is not to get it. <br /> <br /> I have heard from several different sources that the unique and pleasing aspect of this film is a dream. like quality you have. In other words, the plot is not structured like other movies. With Dr. Mulholland's case, it looks more like a blurred collage done by a third grader who procrastinated until the last second to make his art project. It does not make sense, it should not, but I know it was to be a TV series in the beginning. It seems that Lynch had a pile of unused movies and decided to mix them with a lot of new things. You will notice that, in the end, nudity, sex, and dirty language increase. All the things he would not have filmed for television. <br /> <br /> For a better film not counted in a traditional and linear way, rent The Thin Red Line of 1998. This was a great movie, not so. Rating: 2 out of 10
