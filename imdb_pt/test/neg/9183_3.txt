This movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie. The unhappy "Orientals" are not content to leave the West; so they hire a drunk wagon master (John Candy) to get them back to the east. The vision jokes were not funny enough to carry this. And Richard Lewis gets on your nerves very quickly; but I honestly do not like him for anything he does. Ed Lauter is hilarious as the clumsy villain. <br /> <br /> The film was dedicated to Candy. He died of a major heart attack ten days before the film was completed. Digital support and enhancement allowed Candy's character to be seen in the final scenes. Candy was a very good comedian and gave us some good knee strikes, laughs at his career. This film was not just the caliber of its best. <br /> <br /> Also in the movie, you will recognize: William Sanderson, Gailard Sartain, Ethan Phillips, Ellen Greene and Rodney A. Grant.
