First, let me say that I have no idea who Nora Roberts is. So the book may have been great, but the movie is not. <br /> <br /> I've spent my entire life living in the Peidmont area of ​​North Carolina. I've never heard the southern accents as ridiculous as those in this movie. I lived in two small towns in North Carolina and Charlotte and Raleigh. On occasion, you will meet people with a strong southern accent, but I have never encountered a city where everyone speaks as a bad imitation of Gone with the Wind. <br /> <br /> In response to Gore_Won's atheist community. His comments reveal more about his distorted psyche than about the film. If we were to stretch our imagination and pretend there is something realistic about this movie - which does not exist - then the truth is that bad people like Tory's father will always find some justification for their actions. The author chose religion as a counterpoint to Tory's supernatural abilities. His assumption that "the true character of the Gospels" directs a man to beat his daughter is about the most perverse and uninformed interpretation I have ever heard. Before you start talking about the Gospels, maybe you should read them first. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. The dialogue is flat, unnatural and unbelievable most of the time. In particular, many of the things that Kade told Tory are inadequate and do not match the climate, context, or manner in which they are said. <br /> <br /> The "thrilling twist" at the end of the movie is lame. , predictable and lacks credibility. Some have also claimed that Jacqueline Bisset does a wonderful job in this film, but the truth is that the bitter mother character is also an obsolete, predictable and one-dimensional character. Is that Bisset's fault? I do not know. <br /> <br /> If you have a choice between watching this movie and a 20-year reprise of the Muppet Show, I highly recommend the Muppet Show.
