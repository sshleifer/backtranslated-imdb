I suppose I was actually expecting a Bollywood remake of "The Fog" from the title, but this is actually more of a Bollywood remake of "I Know What You Did Last Summer," with some elements of "Scream" , sort of kind of, and not very good either. In addition to some very entertaining numbers of music and dance, this is quite awful. It obviously has a decent budget and is still wasted on reheated leftovers that were not so tasty to begin with. A young woman is threatened by a scary guy not to enter a beauty contest because he wants her sister to win (she fortunately does not look as scary as her brother), but she comes in anyway and wins, and of course man scary comes after her, and is dead, after which comes an exciting game of "hide the body". Of course, the body disappears and no one seems to know why, but someone knows, and they are waiting for the ending to reveal a ridiculous turnaround. Interspersed with all this tired rehash are some nifty dance numbers, especially the commemorative dance number at the party for Simran, the girl who won the beauty pageant ... it is very colorful, it is well done & downright fun, and totally wasted in this terrible movie. I'd rather watch an old movie from the Ramsay brothers than this junk, though somebody has considered that they do not need to be made available for the most part, which is a crime in itself. But not as big a crime as this movie. I took one to the team watching this, so take my advice, do not bother. 2 out of 10.
