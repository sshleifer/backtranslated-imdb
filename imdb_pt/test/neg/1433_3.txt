This movie was one of the most boring horror movies I've seen in a long time (and I've seen a lot). Personally, I enjoyed the piercing on everything that was original, but off that was quite unwatchable. I could not stand Dee Snider as an actor or a singer. I looked like he was trying with everything he said to make it a memorable quote, which they were not. I can get movies for free and I still do not think it was worth the time to get it.
