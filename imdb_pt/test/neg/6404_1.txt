This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I did not come in with high expectations, but as soon as I started I thought it might be o-k. It was not. Jim Carrey seemed to try, but he spoke all his lines as if he were a devilish cartoon character. All the other actors seem to try their best, but they are kind of wooden. The plot has a good base, but the melodramatic lines make it monotonous and stupid. I was laughing all through the second half of the movie, and after five minutes of it I got tired of it. Most of the plot twists that you can see from several miles away. Not worth watching. I really wish I had not wasted my time with this.
