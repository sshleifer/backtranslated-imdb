A pretentious narrative like this always uses the same technique: 1) Throw opaque and unstructured wires to perplex the audience. 2) Dealing only with "big" topics like life, death and God. 3) Make it look deep with scenes of life, death, sky, etc. 4) Depend on an intellectually weak audience to give you the benefit of the doubt. 5) And finally, laugh all the way to critical acclaim. <br /> <br /> This pretentious film is false-intellectualism at its most daring. These filmmakers not only do not answer questions, but are also afraid to ask questions. The film is performed together by wisps. Directions are lifted and released awkwardly. Pop cultural references are shaken and arbitrary. There is so little to point out that any critical attempt will fail. <br /> <br /> Critics who have found an intellectual basis for this movie are afraid to admit the truth: they have no idea what this movie is. Good news: not even the filmmakers. Satisfactory attempts at answers to deep questions about human existence require wit, intellect, poetry, and genius. Unfortunately, this film shows none of these traits.
