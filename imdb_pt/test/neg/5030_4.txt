As you might not know, EÃ§a de Queiroz is one of the most celebrated writers in Portugal. He was witty, he spared no one in his critics and now must be rolling in his grave. And this is not because this film is bad, that is, but as a result of the treatment given to one of his masterpieces "The Crime of Father Amaro." It is treated as cheap and disposable garbage. <br /> <br /> When it was announced that it was a "modern and urban" version of the book I feared for the worse, normally modern in these contexts means taking the liberty of opting to make an adaptation, half ass of him in the boring way possible. And so the moral and social dilemma of a priest having a secret and forbidden case is replaced by extra-long passages from people who traffic drugs and sing hip-hop for no particular reason or pertinence to the plot. It's as if it might as well not have been. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there's a lot of sex, so you can at least count on it when you put it on. Remember how all 80's films, regardless of genre or tone, always found a way to snub some nudity? If it was a thriller and they did not need it, they would simply find a way that when they were capturing a criminal he "happened" to being in bed with a woman who was bent on shouting (naked, of course) when the policemen entered Ahem, Free is the word I think. Not that there is anything wrong with nude scenes, but here they make the creators of the film look desperate simply because there is nothing more for the movie, it is totally devoid of what you call dramatic content.
