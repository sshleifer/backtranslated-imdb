From little alien sound lasers to an accident with a primary school bus, "Nightbeast" is best rated as a mixture of fake blood and bare chest. The film's almost pornographic style seems to be a failed attempt to recover from a lack of cohesive or effective history. The acting, however, is not so bestial, many of the young aspiring actors show admirably a hidden talent. Particularly Don Leifert and Jamie Zemarel, who cast a much-needed light on this otherwise terrifying film. Nightbeast would never have appeared on the set if he knew the terrible movie that made talent in this small Maryland town.
