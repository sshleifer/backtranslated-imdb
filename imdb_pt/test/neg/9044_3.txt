Why did the Italians make the best films in the 1950s and 1960s, and then during the 1970s and 1980s, they did nothing but zombie and cannibal movies? Probably because the art films did not make any money. , The Cannibal Movie, unlike the Zombie Movie, which was created by Americans and "exploited" by Italians, is a purely Italian creation, conceived as a showcase of mondo exploration, and to make as much money as possible (without artistic integrity way here). Eaten Alive came during the heyday of the movie Cannibal. The director, Umberto Lenzi, had not yet reached the point; its classic genre, Cannibal Ferox, was still a year away. In the plot similar to Ruggero Deodato's (read: torn from) cannibal classic of Cannibal Holocaust, a woman (Janet Agren) receives a news from the police that they received an 8mm film from her sister . She disappeared in Africa and it is suspected that the tribal ritual described in the film may have something to do with it. Mel Ferrer, as Somethingoranother's teacher, tells her that a man named Jonas (Ivan Rassimov) started a Jonestown worship in New Guinea, and that's where the sister is. The woman hires a guide (Robert Kerman) to take her through the jungle to find the cult and her sister. And, you do not know, the jungle is full of cannibals. <br /> <br /> A phrase should be summarized: if you saw in Cannibal Movie, you saw all of them, mainly because these films blatantly steal each other (Lenzi copied the Cannibal Holocaust to make this movie, and reworked it to do Cannibal Ferox; Deodato copied parts of it to Hit and Run). And as everyone shares the same material, they all have the same traits: horrible photography, boring scenery, terrible dubbing, exaggeration and exploitation, exploitation, exploitation. Gender fans will have a ball as they are all gender veterans. Rassimov and Kerman take part in a cooking contest. The agren exists only to be naked, raped or in danger. Plenty for all the sick out there. The cannibals, who actually look like native cannibals, eat lunch disguised as human flesh. And, in the great tradition of Canibal Movies, any live animal shown on the screen is usually dead soon after. Overall, it really is not a good experience, but I'm sure there are psychopaths out there who find this excrement to be fun. I know I did.
