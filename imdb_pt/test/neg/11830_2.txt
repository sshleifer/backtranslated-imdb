"My Blue Heaven" is boring. The plot is insipid; characterizations and smelly dialogue; the musical numbers, although occasionally staged in interesting ways, are not only absurd, but also lyrically trivial, painfully brilliant, and emotionally hollow. Leaders, Betty Grable and Dan Dailey, are attractive professionals; however, despite all their talented efforts to elevate the grim and dishonest material, they fail. David Wayne and Jane Wyatt, for all their talent demonstrated in other projects, are more or less cyphers here. <br /> <br /> There is only one reason to watch "My Blue Heaven". One reason ... a star: Mitzi Gaynor, in his movie debut. Your total time on the screen is probably less than ten minutes, but so what? Her daring and promising on-screen personality, her feline beauty and her exceptional charisma shine gloriously and make these minutes the most memorable, moving, and most memorable moments of the entire film. If you cherish an opportunity to see a tremendous young talent on the rise, then check out Miss Mitzi Gaynor in "My Blue Heaven." <br /> <br /> By the way, I despise (and ask you to avoid) Drew Casper's obsessive-compulsive DVD reviews for this movie. Wordy, digressive, indecisive, fastidious, often discredited with what is touching the screen, and galloping everywhere with an excess of nervous energy, his comments are absolutely indigestible.
