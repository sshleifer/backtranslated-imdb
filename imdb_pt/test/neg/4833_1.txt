Actually, I'm not narrating the main plot in this comment, but with only 2-3 sentences I can make it a spoiler. OK, here are these - Speed ​​is just an 85% conversion from Hollywood Cellular movie to Bollywood using Vikram Bhatt software. Title has no correspondence with the story, only goes in the direction of the thriller. Only that!! He does not deserve even a single star for his imitation, his imperfect cast, his poor standard, and his predictable history. No doubt, I can now say that Viram Bhatt is slowly disappearing from his directorial status, as no mature public will appreciate his recent work including that. Beside him, Aftab Shivdasani also made his vision as kind of cartoon comics. Who knows how long it will last longer in the film industry? Sometimes the standard in performances and cinematography seems smaller than a C-level movie. But the most supportive role was played by Zayed Khan, who was somewhat identical to the role of Chris Evan as Ryan in Cellular. With innocent face, Sanjay Suri has no contribution in the film, since he has nothing to impress. That is why those who have attended Cellular I recommend that you never waste your time again with this imitation bag.
