What a truly stupid movie, all I can say is that the writer should really like magic mushrooms and LSD because this must be the result of one of his "trips." <br /> <br /> You follow the whole movie thinking Alright, this is very strange, but hey, I'm sure that in the end there will be a perfectly good explanation for all this ... Just to be disappointed to find, not , there is no explanation, and the turnaround at the end makes it more confusing. At the end of the movie, you will probably have the same facial expression as if you were in one. Paying for groceries to you and the marketer told you, that will be 11.95 please and started to elbow you in the balls for no apparent reason. There are so many factors in this movie that are unexplained and I think this leaves the viewer's imagination in a completely bizarre way. Do not get me wrong I like strange movies, 'The Cell' could easily be described as strange and distorted, but in my eyes it's a brilliant movie (although I have chosen J-Lo I do not like the most, even if I could not influence my opinion). This is not one of those films, and I think you should take into account the characters of those who praise this film. I can say that they are probably the kind of people who would go to an art exhibition, see a drop of pigeon droppings on a whiteboard and say "Oooooh what a masterpiece, the artist really found a unique way to portray eternity "In fact, all that is, is bird droppings on a plate. <br /> <br /> Keep the last part in mind when watching this movie, Thanks for reading!
