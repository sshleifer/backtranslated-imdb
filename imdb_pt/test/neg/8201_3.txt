This is a very low budget film, set in a location in a valley protected by the effects of radiation. The cast, an older man and daughter, a handsome visitor, a couple (a hard-to-buy person and girl), a rover, a donkey, and a man affected by radiation interact during the aftermath of a nuclear explosion. Added to this is an entity watching women take a shower. <br /> <br /> They all have guns, some of them get shot, some of them are said to have children, others are murdered and others just get away and well, this is the movie. Harvey Cormann's first film shows a certain simplicity in cinema. To avoid costly sets, actors go through curtains to get in and out of the house (ie the studio). The local footage filmed in the hills near Hollywood is the backdrop. <br /> <br /> I would not say that this is worth going out of your way to see, but interesting to see how films with human themes were made in the 50's.
