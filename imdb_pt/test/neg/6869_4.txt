Visitors are a difficult and difficult film to appreciate. It's so slow and heavy that sometimes I was losing fame during the movie. That was around 11 in the morning on a hot sunny day, I might add, not at midnight on a cold winter night, so you have an idea of ​​how slow this movie is. <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that it is not long. At 100 minutes, they are only ten minutes longer than the average for the video, and are only fifteen minutes longer than the top Darkwolf that I had seen very happy the day before. It just drags a lot, enough for you to lose interest. When you're not confusing the S-L-O-O-W development with the atmosphere, the visitor is good enough in action to almost make it oblivion how slowly things happen. While the flashbacks are cheap and annoying as a way to complete the woman-boats of Radha Mitchell, the haunts / aliens / whatever is really scary and effective, especially when her suicidal mother appears and begins to moan at night. Full marks for not splurging make-up the entire store as well. The one-person boat is a scary place, and sometimes the movie uses all the power of the place and the desert sea to scare you. <br /> <br /> Still, I find it difficult to recommend Visitors. I left there not only feeling like I had just watched a 4-hour movie, not 100 minutes, but also feeling like I had been cheated of some way, offering many explanations about the haunts (Mind games? Real ghosts? aliens from space?) Visitors do not choose one for definitive. Does anyone watch Radha Mitchell talk to her cat and Dominic Purcell burn for no obvious reason about some horrific unexplained event in the past, for nothing? Say what you want about Shyamalan, but at least he tells you what happened, as crazy / stupid as you might think. If you do not watch a lot of these movies, your new perspective will probably improve things a bit, but I find this slow, boring, and highly derivative. If you want to scare yourself, there are far better places to do it, if you want a clever thriller, there are many who are smarter.
