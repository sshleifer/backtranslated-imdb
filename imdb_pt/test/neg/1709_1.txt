This sweet murder is possibly the least funny movie I've ever seen. you can believe my word as truth because you're playing on television now. It's really one of the most pathetic productions I've ever seen. there is not a single redeemable aspect of this movie. just missing any mood. the only good thing that possibly has to happen is that it is so dull that it is totally memorable. Actually, I just sat on some ridiculous sub-plot and I can not tell you what happened. The only reason I can still remember seeing this movie is because it is so utterly humorless that it will stay in my mind forever based on it alone. <br /> <br /> One absolutely must miss. if your friend wants to show it, shoot him and save yourself from boredom.
