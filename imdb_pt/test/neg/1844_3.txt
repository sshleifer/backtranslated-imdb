I'm usually a very generous voter on IMDb and I do not bother to comment on movies I did not like, but that was really bad. I actually hung up 15 minutes before I finished, to watch "This Is It" (because my gf wanted ... I chose the lesser of two evils). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie: Imagine this movie as a collection of worse-than-average horror stories like "scary stories" that you find in a Reader's Digest in the room your dentist. <br /> <br /> I did not expect anything special terrifying or funny, I'm not the "I want to see blood!" - kind of person, but this "movie" is neither "horror" nor "comedy" nor fun at all It's probably scary / funny and fun to look at the "You've Got Mail" poster for 90 minutes while drinking tea of chamomile. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a "horror comedy" for people between 4 and 7 years old.
