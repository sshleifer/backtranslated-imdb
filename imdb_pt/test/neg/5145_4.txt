This well-meaning movie falls a little, and unfortunately in many areas. <br /> <br /> The setting is stunning with views of north-central Vermont providing the setting for this mid-century tale. Quebec Bill struggles to return to his past of whiskey in order to save his farm. Going back and forth between scenes of magical realism and direct action, this movie rarely reaches its footsteps. Kris Kristofferson as Quebec Bill seems quite flamboyant, or so are his lines; or his cross with Yankee and Quebec accents. Either way, it only comes out as a hard hard hit. His dialogues with Gary Farmer's Coville character shine, though. William Sanderson's Mouse Kinneson is solid. Charlie McDermott shows some real potential as the young Wild Bill; but his part is not big enough to take a scene and he never steals one. Luis Guzman appears on Lake Memphramagog (with an excellent performance of Lake Willoughby) as a monk in a hooded accent: who knows? And then there's Cordelia de Bujold: an oracle as her namesake, she channels Yoda as she chants phrases like "You're marrying a Quebec woman!"?!? Just very strange and not even sufficiently enigmatic. <br /> <br /> The end gets really hectic. Again a bad mix of magical and concrete realism. And Yoda never provides an answer that we can understand.
