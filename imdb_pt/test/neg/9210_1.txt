There must be a 0/10 option for the basement like this. <br /> <br /> It was painful to watch, but strangely persuasive in the same way. Impulsive because it seemed unbelievable that a movie could really suck so much. I kept thinking "should improve". It got worse. It's worse. <br /> <br /> How people were involved in producing such categorical garbage that I'll never know. The most amazing thing of all, though, is all these comments I see from people really loving the movie. Yes, the acting was good, but the film was very very very bad. Worst movie ever!
