Here is another low-quality movie from the Disney company. There is no Disney spirit anymore. The story is boring. All emotions are false. It is not cute or moving. The Disney company was at one time a kind of magical company that provided dreams for children. Now it's all about making money. What a shame for the people who exploit the Disney name for their personal benefit. It is the fall of an empire. And by the way, Pixar is not Disney!
