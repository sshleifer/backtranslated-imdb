I am a big fan of the genre The ABC Movies of the Week. I'm only 27 years old, which means I was not even born until the end of the series, but I'm trying to collect as many of them as possible on DVD. I have about a dozen or more. I had read wonderful things about this movie, here and elsewhere, that I was really excited to see it. I just received my DVD in the mail today and watched anxiously. I admit that the first or two phone calls gave me shivers - the voice of that boy would give no one the devil! But it started coming out quickly, and the whole divorce sub-plot was stupid. I also discovered that Michael Douglas was the antagonist about half an hour before the movie ended. Once the story was told about how Elizabeth Ashley's character had locked her mother up, I knew something was suspicious. Besides, no one ever thought to ask why he suddenly appeared that night when the fire occurred in the barn? I'll admit I thought he was training a kid at school to make the calls. I did not guess the part of the dumb kid or the pre-recorded tapes (did they ever say who the voice really was? I doubt Douglas could have his voice so loud?). <br /> <br /> I'm just giving this movie a four out of ten because I really enjoyed most of the acting in it. Ashley, especially, is great. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because this movie has such a big premise, but, well, that's what happens sometimes when you expect too much for a movie.
