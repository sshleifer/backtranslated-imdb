Lois Weber's film "Hypocrites" was and still is a daring and daring film. I liked it and was very impressed with the footage and his story. The priest sees the hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show the "naked" truth. People are horrified when he reveals the naked statue depicting the truth, after failing to take them to it and the few who have done it, help along the way. People do not want to face the truth that they are doing something wrong, but it shows them putting things before God, going to beach parties acting inappropriately, their materialistic forms and other things that people of our world tend to do . is not morally correct. In the end, having no followers, he must enter the gates of heaven alone. This movie seems to me very bold, in the fact that a naked woman is shown everywhere, especially considering the length of time this movie was made. The images and symbolism portrayed in this movie I found incredible. The way they made the naked woman translucent and using a naked woman to symbolize the naked truth shows a lot of creativity and art. Showing the different sins of people as they walked the road and refused to follow the path, each with different excuses, setbacks and / or higher priorities, was a great way to represent people today. This film does a good job of conveying the moral message to your audience. Lois Weber has a tremendous way of capturing the attention of her viewers with her creativity, symbolism, visual and auditory capabilities. Even the piano music throughout this film is very beautiful and fits in with the whole theme.
