Strangely, it's Fred MacMurray, who plays the "crazy" part in this crazy comedy. Carole Lombard shows a good performance combining lighter moments with undercurrent of drama and seriousness. <br /> <br /> As always, Fred MacMurray remains a mystery to me. The camera is not a fan of him, he is not that attractive, and he does not have the style and the resourcefulness to play that role much like Cary Grant. <br /> <br /> Ralph Bellamy is excellent as the kind friend. coming to life through his relationship with the character of Lombard. One can only imagine why his character would not want his gentle and reassuring love, instead of the almost certainty of MacMurray's ineptitude. But this is Hollywood! <br /> <br /> The image almost works, but missed the mark, mainly due to the performance of MacMurray. It would have been lovely to see Grant or even Clark Gable in his role. Lombard and Bellamy are largely believable and friendly; MacMurray is hard and makes you want to keep it at arm's length.
