I was stuck in traffic (I live in Sicily) on the way to the theater (on a military base) to see Superman Returns, I was 15 minutes late, and the only other movie I was playing was "See No Evil", there was no poster up, and only a short description of the movie on schedule ... but my girlfriend and I decided to check this out. As soon as I saw this was produced by WWE I just knew it was going to be terrible. The few people at the movies were laughing most of the time, and it was the first movie I honestly considered coming out, and I saw "The Ringer" ... Okay, I would have gotten out of that movie but I was too busy sleeping. The bandit's death in the end was very good, but other than that, it was just stupid.
