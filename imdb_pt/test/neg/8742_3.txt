Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz. A young mother Selma Lidz (Andie MacDowell) is battling a very serious illness and her self-proclaimed husband inventor Sid (John Tururro) is a little needy in the department of emotions. Unhappy with the new domestic situation, his sensitive son Steven (Nathan Watt) decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles Danny (Michael Richards) and Melvin (Lou Cutell) until his mother is well. Steven seems to be happier and even interested in the habits of his strange uncle's life; he even decides to change his name to Franz. Set in the early 60's, this drama is a bit comical ... change it to crazy. Not being a fan of MacDowell, UNSTRUNG HEROES guarantees my attitude; although I have enjoyed the film and it is not a total waste.
