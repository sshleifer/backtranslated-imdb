After the general, a film that romanticized the life of the Dublin gangster, the general to such heroic proportions that made the average person of Dublin sick, Kevin came along and his attempt to portray Mr. Lynch or Martin Cahill, also known as the general, the acting is so bad that this criminal drama becomes a comedy for the native Dub, and a tragedy for the Kevin Spacey fan. in short, is the film worth a look .... No, unless you like to act poorly with hilarious 'Irish accents, ah, sure to be sure'. The story is snatched from the commercially successful 'The General' which, despite the glorification of a well-known Dublin animal in Martin Cahill, is still worthwhile on a domestic scale because it shows the true working class of Dublin and on an international scale . because of his true Irish acting and killer cast, including John Voight. All in all, 'Ordinary Decent Criminal' is anything but a decent movie. Avoid.
