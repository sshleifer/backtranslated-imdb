To begin with, I have to admit that I've never been a big fan of the Dutch film genre. Unfortunately watching De Dominee did not change my mind. It shares some common flaws, such as having a very predictable and linear graph for my taste. <br /> <br /> Worse, though, is that the cast has its dialogues as if they were stage actors in one play. Unfortunately this is also common in many Dutch films and, at least for me, makes it impossible to feel any kind of involvement with the main characters. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays Adri (I'm sorry, I forgot his name at the time) is at least delivering decent performance, and it's one of the reasons I do not rate this movie even worse. Another reason is the fact that at least it seems to have had some budget, and the production looks professional. Ironically, the fact that the acting is often very articulate may not be a big problem if you do not speak Dutch, although I have already warned that the plot is not spectacular either, but at least it can make it an acceptable movie to watch.
