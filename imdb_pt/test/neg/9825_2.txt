Even though the trailer and poster of this movie imply that Sally Hemmings was an important character, I might not have been so shocked to discover that she was just a minor character (and I mean Minor) if this movie was said by Sally herself. family! I mean, if you're going to tell the story of a member of your family who was ignored by the story, would you really tell that about the man who relegated you to obscurity in the main character? Your other lover (who happens to be white) as true love interest? I know I would not! I'm as pale as they come and I'm usually a big fan of Ivory's movies, but I could not bear the treatment of that movie with poor Sally Hemmings.
