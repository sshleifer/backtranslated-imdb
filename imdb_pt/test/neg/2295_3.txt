This Swedish splatter movie tries parody / imitate American horror films such as "The Evil Dead", "Gremlins" and others. Writer / director / actor / cinematographer Anders Jacobsson and writer / producer / actor / effects supervisor Göran Lundström (I missed something?) Were obviously inspired by Sam Raimi. But camera work is a poor copy of what can be seen in "The Evil Dead" and elsewhere. Some other users wrote that they liked the humor of this movie, but I did not. <br /> <br /> The film disturbed me a lot of what amused me. He tries to combine thriller and comedy, and the final product has left me with a sense of oppression, though it has not been scary nor a bit shocking. The combination of different elements of the genre made this film very strange. I was never sure if it was to be scary or funny. <br /> <br /> The story is very inventive, except for the confrontation in the hospital, but I did not like the way it was staged for the reasons mentioned above. . The effects of makeup and gore are pretty good and at least the "Loose Limbs" sequences were a lot of fun because in these scenes the filmmakers did not try to mix scares and jokes. <br /> <br /> A strange movie that you hate or love. Rest in pieces, Evil Ed. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10 (made me stick with American productions)
