Like two great actors impinge a piece of garbage like this on moviegoers. My only conclusion is that they and their director believe that ANY movie they star in on SHOULD only be seen and applauded, <br /> <br /> Now the movie - probably the worst "thriller" I have ever seen. The actors showed minimal emotion; the plot was reasonable for a time interval of half an hour (not 91 minutes). The FBI agent was almost a silly parody - his partner was apparently mute and did not say anything. To paraphrase Robert Redford, the villain was crap! The film was drawn and meaningless - the only question was whether the hero would die or not. A truly bizarre part of the story - The waiting family seemed to last for at least several days; the hero and the anti-hero seemed only to take a day. <br /> <br /> All in all - waste of time
