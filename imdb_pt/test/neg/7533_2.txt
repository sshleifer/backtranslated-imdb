With Pep Squad getting an average of 4.7 on the IMDb, it's no wonder that Steve Balderson defames this site as well. But the fact is that Pep Squad is a poorly crafted "black" comedy (both words in quotes for a reason). It's a movie full of over-acting (Cherry, Beth's Mother) along with some lethargic performances (Beth and Julie's boyfriend). A movie in which you can track cars six feet away in a red jeep and never get noticed. A movie full of not-so-clever cleavage and nude photos that make you wonder, "Does the director find this funny or clever?" Above all, the characters are so thin and poorly developed that the film becomes quite unpredictable, but probably not on purpose. Pep Squad can not decide whether it's going to be a comedy, a drama or a satire (patriotic music, I understand ...). The film fails to be serious, because the idea of ​​killing by any position in school (this being the Dance Queen) crosses the line of madness (not to mention flag shots and shootings, a poor attempt to be controversial and nervous) and failed to be a comedy, for all the jokes forced and clumsily placed (big butt mother, black director "unglued", and excessive swearing badly delivered by the main cast). Watching the documentary "Wamego: Making Movies Anywhere" just made this film more worthy of embarrassment, with praises praised by the ... director and father of the director ... hmmmmmm. Not a black comedy or anything. I think Kansas will have to wait.
