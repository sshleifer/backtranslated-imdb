The plot here is simple. The country boy, Lem (Farrell) goes to town to sell the wheat crop, falls in love with a waitress, Kate (Duncan) and marries her, bringing her to a hostile father and a group of reapers hungry for women. There are shades to know what they wanted and MICE AND MEN here. Dating, which occurs in two long sequences in the restaurant, consumes the first half hour and is lethargic. Lem is so weak that he allows his father to mistreat his wife, who is proposed by Mac (Richard Alexander), one of the harvesters, to go away with him. Duncan and Alexander are the only good things in this tedious potboiler, which lacks the perception and cinematic beauty we expect from Murnau. Farrell's character has no backbone, so we ended up cheering for a "real man" (Mac) to get Kate out of everything. With the sympathy of the distorted audience, the film loses its narrative progression. The father's conversion at the end of the film is unreal and unbelievable, creating a planned outcome. This movie is for fans of the stars and the director only - the general public need not bother.
