A really wonderful cast and a very talented technical staff squandered their valuable career time and our equally valuable leisure time by bothering to support this totally predictable and clearly stereotyped piece of junk. The film is based on a very good and very current idea, but both the producers and the director simply applied the standard formula of Hollywood's "disaster film" and thereby ruined any potential value of production. <br /> <br /> Tide and very strong gale conditions combine to produce a high storm that overtakes London and floods most of the Thames Valley. The plot revolves around a heroic scientist (Tom Courtenay) who warns the authorities of the danger and finally saves the day, a glamorous police chief who runs the whole show and a deputy prime minister (David Suchet) who tries to seem important. <br /> <br /> But it's all so unreal that it feels like a break for tea after only 30 minutes. The glamorous young police commissioner demands complete authority over the army during a declared state of emergency and receives it (as if!). The experienced general has just been left out as a complete idiot who has to lick his boots because of his obviously superior ability. The problem is that our supreme wife, responsible for millions of lives, spends most of her time preoccupied with the fate of her two daughters who made a trip to the southwest of London and did not call to say that they were well. So our powerful woman puts her team to look for them and decides that the only priority of the entire army and rescue services must be south-west London, not any other neighborhood in the city. It is clear that the Minister, the Army and the whole entourage accept their prioritization without question. One can only assume that they all had property there. When her children are found after endless reports and efforts by her team, she is told by our male hero, "Thank God they're safe, that's the main thing." It does not matter the millions of others or all the other responsibilities that she ought to control; as long as his children were safe, all was well. <br /> <br /> This film is just another excuse to push the old macho sexist trap that women are intelligent, thoughtful and clearly capable, while men are good for nothing except physical bravery, irrational force and knowledge very specialized. And yet the only simple instruction she could have given the population; that is, going to the nearest tall building and climbing quietly up to the 4th floor or above and waiting for instructions when the water comes down was never given by this super heroine - or even by anyone else. The whole problem was so simple to solve and yet millions of people apparently did not think of just going up! Pathetic garbage.
