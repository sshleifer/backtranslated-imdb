* Spoilers here * Where do I start with how silly this movie was? 'Mole-sized people, living under the garden attacking residents of a big house' !!! When I sat down to watch this movie, I did not know that the protagonists were not poltergeists, but 10-inch goblins that seemed very easy to kick hard and far. I kept watching, because I like watching movies until the end, even the most terrible ones. This movie was terrible. My girlfriend, who went to sleep within the first ten minutes, and thought it was a good help to sleep, I thought it was hilarious that I had bothered to watch everything. Goblin goblins, even in large numbers (the thought is silly I know) are as scary and threatening as flat glue. They could only knock out a guy fatally and kill a cat before they exploded, The End. I mentioned it sucked right?
