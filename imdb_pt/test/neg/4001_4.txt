Usually, I love these thrillers "Stranger Within". Some good examples are "Fatal Attraction", "Single White Woman" and "Audition". Done right, they can be a lot of fun, and worth an hour or two of solid shocks and scares. Of course, the opposite may be true: poorly done, they can be boring and stupid. "The hand that rocks the cradle" is one of the last. <br /> <br /> Bartels, Claire (Annabella Sciorra) and Michael (Matt McCoy) are getting another family member. But the busy Claire is persuaded by Michael to hire a nanny. One day a woman named Peyton Flanders (Rebecca DeMornay) appears, and because she looks perfect, the Bartels hire her. Of course, once she appears, her idyllic life is slowly undoing ... <br /> <br /> This movie suffers from a myriad of problems, but the biggest one is handling the villain. Peyton is never believable. Part of this has to do with how it is written and how it works. The things she does that should put us on the edge are so invented that they are laughable. De Mornay does not help much. She portrays Peyton as two different people. While it is true that she should be the perfect nanny while hiding her psychotic tendencies, De Mornay's performance creates a division between the two facets of her character. <br /> <br /> The other actors are good, though. Annabella Sciorrra is great as the asthmatic Claire. Sciorra is very natural in the paper, but unfortunately, the script to disappoint. Matt McCoy is almost invisible. However, Julianne Moore is charming as Claire's friend, Marlene. Moore is a firework, but unfortunately she's only on the screen for a total of five minutes. <br /> <br /> Curtis Hanson is a good director, but you would not know that. The film has some decent shocks, but it's barely rhythmic, and the climax, while it generates some tension, is kind of laughable. That said, he is working with a script that, at best, could be critically called pathetic. <br /> <br /> Trust me, when it comes to babysitters, stay with Fran Drescher. This should have gone to the direct bin for video.
