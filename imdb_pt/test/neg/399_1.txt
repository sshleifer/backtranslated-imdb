I was entertained to see that some of the reviews here were covered with ** SPOILERS ** The joke in my family is that the only part of this movie that is not given in the back of the box is given in the title. Maybe I'm just a dense 17-year-old American who would not know art if I bit my leg, but I prefer movies that have at least a few words. This movie makes the second half of 2001: A Space Odyssey well convertible. This movie is so slow that it's not even art, it's just annoying. We follow this scary guy who's following this boy around Venice. The end was incomprehensible until I read the end of the book. A movie should not make you refer to the book, it should be able to stand alone. This movie has no way of standing. It does not even have the bones of a plot to lean on.
