We chose to see this movie as an alternative to The Polar Express shown at our local IMAX movie theater. What a waste of time and money! First, it's not cute. The snowman sometimes seemed demonic. Other times, he was simply a zombie. He did not show expression or emotions most of the time, and his hollow blue eyes were just scary. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Dad says that in the beginning is a movie about the spirit of giving. Santa Claus and a snowman declaring war on each other is a movie about giving? I'm all for a little parody, but this was not funny or funny. <br /> <br /> The idea that the snowman's flute is his voice is different. Too bad you never see or hear the snowman play his flute ... not even a "thank you" to Santa. <br /> <br /> The only funny parts of the movie were the outtakes at the end of the movie. movie. Too bad they did not use them in the movie. It would have been better.
