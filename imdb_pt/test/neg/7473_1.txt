I saw this on a drive-in when I was 9 years old. All I remember are some scenes (those in which the main character Elle is being chased by a guy with a mask) and afraid of being beaten. Seeing now, my opinions have changed. It is a pathetic horror film about an offensive directed by Gloria Grahame (sad) and dealing with a young and untapped Elle who is sent there after her mother, the city slut, was beaten to death with a hammer (shown graphically). The film has teenagers (actually actors in their twenties) being beaten, tortured, killed, starved, attacked with cleavers, raped, etc. The brutal murder of the hammer is the opening scene and then it gets worse and worse. There is nothing to recommend about this crap. The plot is stupid, the whole dialogue is bad and the acting ... the less, the better. How did this patient go with a GP rating (now PG)? I would get an R now. Useless. One last thing ... a truly repulsive twisting end suggests incest!
