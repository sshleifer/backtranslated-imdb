Technically speaking, this movie sucks ... lol. However, it is also hilarious. Whether or not it is intentionally funny, I do not know. Horrible in all respects, it's also the only movie I know of that has 1) a fat boy being played by a skinny actor in a (very obvious) fat suit, 2) an attractive 30-something actress playing a character who should be in its late 60's, and 3) the highest praise for daisies ever plastic yards. Do not take this movie seriously, just watch the laughter ... a great party movie.
