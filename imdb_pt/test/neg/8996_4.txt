Naach A more detailed review can be obtained anywhere else on the web. This is a good portrait, although I do not entirely agree with it. Taran is a commercial guy and therefore seen from his lonely angle. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma (RGV, looks like a political party) has created a marvel in Rangeela, so this seems to be a pale reflection of that. one in some parts ... I will not even compare Urmila and Anthara .. both are good! The former has a better acting talent, although the latter is achieving well. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I like the character of Anthara. She is true to her art, untouched by any unnecessary emotion, and definitely not very practical. She's a dance scientist, in fact, she's so sure of her theories that even comparing her to a scientist would offend her. Hey .. Donald Trump .. maybe you have to leave Melania, here is Anthara and you already built a Taj Mahal ... is not that easy? Abhishek, on the other hand, is a practical fellow, who wants money, power, fame, etc. So, these two, although they were struggling to enter the film industry, can not get along, given their different styles and approach to life. This is very typical, but what I like about the movie is that it tells what an Abhimaan would say in his full runtime, in a scene! What's new? This film takes a different angle from the film industry and how different people are. There is always something different about RGV films, this is different too, it is very slow by its standards. In parts, it drags one almost to sleep. <br /> <br /> Noticeable It is hard to notice anything other than Anthara in the first half of the film. I think that this skin show was necessary for the dance sequences involved :-) Also, it seems that Anthara is a professional in Yoga, she is very flexible, almost like a Prabhu Devi. Aby Baby is improving as an actor in every movie. I'm sure the blood of your movie is paying rich dividends. The title song was very good, the music overall was above average.
