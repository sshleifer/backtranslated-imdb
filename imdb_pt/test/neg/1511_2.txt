(As a side note, I would like to say that I saw this movie at my annual church camp, where the whole group of young people laughed at it.I bought it when I saw it on a shelf a year later, even if only for the humor. bad attempt to make an evangelical film.) Lay it Down falls far short of the expectations of many movie fans on several different planes. Most of the problems lie in impersonal acting. Regardless of the good cars in the movie, or the truth in Christ's sacrifice for you, as a film and witness tool, Lay it Down hardly ever delivers. <br /> <br /> Most of the good reviews of the films are supported by Christians who agree with the message. While it is easy for a Christian to agree on points awarded, the public hardly ever witnesses life outside of a clich√©. The fight scene between Ben and his brother is terribly dubbed. And there are at least three gross errors in the subtitles. <br /> <br /> I encourage anyone to watch the movie a second time with the director's comment. This really helps you understand why the movie was written like it was. The director's views on secular society are practically opposed to what would meet the needs of a moviegoer: he shows a pedantic understanding of non-Christians as well as some points of religious conflict; most of the edition, he admits, was rushed, but "satisfactory"; he felt that overly used transitions and themes were effective; and was completely happy with the performance. <br /> <br /> He also inserted motives of which he was proud: - Everyone (read: most) of the names are significant. Ben Destin = "I Was Destined", Gus Pelman = "Man of the Gospel", Nicky D = Nicodemus. -The car making donuts symbolizes the circular nothingness that is a life without Christ. -When Ben comes out on Pete's bike, he crosses his crutches to form a "cross." <br /> <br /> I'm not doing any of this. He throws things like that between saying while street runners and things like "blow their minds with guns," and how "God is in control when you are born and when you die." Yes, this was not a typo. He really says that. <br /> <br /> I have (little) pardon reserved for this movie. The "cool cars" and "good message" do not jack to make this movie good. However, the film was made from a group of non-professional individuals with a budget of less than 1/100 of "The Fast and the Furious," and the time limit was relentless. With that in mind, I give it a score of 2/10 instead of the 1/10 that I so much deserve.
