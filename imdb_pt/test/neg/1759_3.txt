I found the first 90 minutes of this film to be very interesting, although some parts are ridiculous (eg the character of Philip Seymour Hoffman). The last 60 minutes were unpleasant and I began to lose interest in the film. The last hour lasted forever, it seems. <br /> <br /> The film is well represented and I can see why Rene Zellweger has won an Oscar since his character was so interesting. The film is also beautifully filmed and the story is emotional. However, I found the message bad: not surprising these days in Hollywood. In this story, "Inman" (Jude Law) deserts the Confederate army during the Civil War. His reason: his girlfriend misses him and wants him at home. He is also getting disillusioned with the war. (Can you imagine if every soldier who was on a similar boat abandoned the army in the two world wars ?!) However, in this film, of course, all this is perfectly acceptable. So again, what liberal filmmaker ever had a good thing to say about the US military? To add to their leftist bent, they portray a group of vigilantes going after deserters as cold-blooded murderers. Well, in the world of movies, as we know: the good is portrayed as bad and the bad is good ... and only the liberals portray the deserters as heroes.
