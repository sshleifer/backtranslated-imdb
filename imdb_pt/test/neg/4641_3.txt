This movie was terrible ... How can anyone even think that this movie was like the ones back in the "good old days" when Tim Thomerson was not even in it. And to make things worse, they used clips from old trance movies. This is just terrible. No trance movie is complete without Tim Thomerson. I love Fullmoon movies, and I've been watching them since I was 4 years old. I've been through everything they've done and this movie almost made me miss it. Now I have a few lines to fill, so I'll continue. His way of creating new trancers is completely stupid, as is the way to get Jack back in time. What happened to the TCL Chamber? And finally! What happened at the end of trancers 5, where lina says and I quote "Jack gave me something special" And she and a few other wide stares in her stomach. I do not know ... maybe a baby is there. There were so many other places to go, but fullmoon S'd the Bed
