I should start by saying that I have a love-hate relationship with musicals. Some of them are fantastic, some are downright bad. So I expected Hair to fall into one of those categories. However, this did not happen, falling in the middle. <br /> <br /> The songs are not brilliant, although the song "Sodomy" has made me smile a lot, and everything is quite old fashioned. But the movie did not appeal to me like the others like Rocky Horror. Although it is a bad example, since for years I hated Rocky Horror, then suddenly I have achieved and loved since then. Maybe the hair is the same. Although I doubt that the Rocky Horror exposure is so great because of the content of language and nudity, I doubt I have the chance to grow in myself. Gettit Hair ... grow ... oh, serve yourself. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could not see the last fifteen minutes or so due to a technical flaw, which was a shame, since I liked to see how this ended, especially after reading some of the comments here. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie for casual cinema, but definitely one for music lovers. I really hope they do not redo it, since I think any re-make would do away with a shallow, pale version of the original. <br /> <br /> It is worth searching for lovers of the genre.
