This movie was absolutely and unmistakably terrible. The plot was so predictable and boring and the script so tacky and pretentious that, in the end, I wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest pen. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write reviews, but I was amazed at the number of positive reviews you received. Although I admit that the acting was good in some parts, the shortcomings of the script far outstripped decent acting. The only reason I watched this was because some of my friends were watching it, presenting it as probably the worst movie ever made, judging by the trailer. We were not disappointed at least. His only saving grace was that it contained my new favorite line: <br/> <br/> BRANDON: I just want to meet you. <br /> <br /> GIRL: You just want to get into my pants. <br/> <br/> BRANDON: I want to get into your mind, your heart, your soul. I do not see you wearing any pants in this equation. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would rate this movie as the worst movie I have ever seen that took itself seriously.
