This love story between an American journalist and a Euro-Asian lady does not contain many conflicts, since she is mostly Westernized (having studied in London), or fireworks, since she behaves quite restrained. The little interest that the story manages to raise is further overturned by his wooden dialogues. They are supposed to be two cosmopolitan intellectuals, but they speak as if words are put in their mouths by a Hollywood hacker who is not much himself. The film also suffers from an incredible lack of realism - a completely deserted beach in little Hong Kong crowded, invaded by a million Chinese refugees? And an American journalist presumably accomplished in his 40s who does not know what a hysterectomy is? Hollywood Ideas. Finally "the music". After hearing about twenty times throughout the film, starting with the credits, he tends to lose some of his emotional impact, sorry to say.
