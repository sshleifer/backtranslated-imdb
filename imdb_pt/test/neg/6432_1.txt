I hired this movie out of my local film library, not really expecting anything flash or fantasy. Since it was a "B" grade film, made with a very tight budget. The opening scenes of the film were quite original and so was the plot and that's what made me hire the film. However, the film becomes very annoying and frustrating at some points. The story had many holes and the acting had its fair share of disappointments as well. At the end of the movie, I was praying for a greater power to knock me down, as I was extremely bored, but more important, frustrated. with how the story ended. I still do not understand what really happened and I do not particularly care. In conclusion, the devil cried with disgust at knowing that hell (his domain) was used as the basis for such a bad movie.
