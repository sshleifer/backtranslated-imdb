As the other guy said It's sux, you can count the words that were said throughout the movie in one of your hands, Too naked, she got naked like 7 or 8 times in 1 and a half, well beyond the nudity you'll find a porn movie behind that movie, he fucked all his movie, bad acting, bad story, bad language, Carmen was cursing the whole movie, then you leave that movie, pornographic scenes and dirty language, A Laps in the movie, a great silence every once in a while The only good thing in this movie are the beautiful places where it was filmed, otherwise it's an hour and a half of your life that you're going to lose if you're going to watch this movie Good luck It's really Sux
