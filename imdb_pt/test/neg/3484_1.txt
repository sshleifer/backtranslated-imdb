One of the worst surfing movies I've ever seen. This movie is so bad that I do not know where to start ... Okay, let's start with the premise - a continent guy who barely knows how to surf to Hawaii and goes on a big wave contest that he more or less hopes to win. A good analogy for those who do not surf would be that of an inveterate overweight smoker banging on a pair of sneakers and entering the Los Angeles Marathon with expectations of victory. No way! And, the contest is held at The North Shore, which evokes images of more than 15 feet of waves, but on the day of competition, the waves are perhaps 6 feet. The acting? What are you doing? If you need to see this plot on TV, do not waste your money renting it. If you want to see a good surf movie - it's flawed, but that's another story - rent Big Wednesday.
