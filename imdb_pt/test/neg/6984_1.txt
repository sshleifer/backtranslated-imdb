At the opposite end of the spectrum of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is David Hemmings' absolutely inferior adventure regarding the rescue of a World War II era aircraft with a valuable cargo. Assets include beautiful New Zealand scenery, Brian May's animated soundtrack and some helicopter flights and jet fighter jets. The bad, however, far outweighs the good. Donald Pleasence has perhaps never before; half of their dialogue is almost unintelligible. George Peppard tries an Australian accent (I think), then gives up half. Lesley Ann Warren is more annoying to her. Ken Wahl is, well, Ken Wahl. Dialogue is painful to hear and Hemmings' direction is largely inept. The script is not only obvious but terrible. Jokes fall, the scenes carry no punches and continuity is virtually non-existent. According to the final credits, two men were killed while riding boats during the making of the film. What a waste.
