Mickey Rourke Hunt Diane Lane on Elmore's Killshot Leonard It's not as if Mickey Rourke really disappeared. He had a series of appearances before returning to the scene. He was memorable in: Domino, Sin City, Man on Fire, Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Get Carter. But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler (2008), we see a complete presentation of the character just hinted at in Get Carter. Whenever we can meet him, Rourke remains a lean, muscular but sloppy ball. <br /> <br /> This is a story and production of Elmore Leonard. Leonard wrote notable films as the teaser of the 3:10 Western thriller for Yuma, Be Cool, Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, 52 Pick-Up and Joe Kidd. That means we have tough guys, some good guys, some not so good guys. <br /> <br /> It also means that we have tight, realistic plans with characters doing what is best for them in every situation, turning complications into violent conclusions. . Killshot is no different. Sturdy and slender ball killer, Rourke chases Lane's unhappy and unhappy witness. Think History of Violence finds No Country for the Elders. It's not as intense, bloody or bloody as these two, but it's almost as good. If you like these two, including David Croneberg's equally wonderful Eastern Promises, you'll also like Killshot. <br /> <br /> Director John Madden has not made many films. His last few were enjoyable, if they were not successful: Proof, Captain Corelli Mandolin, and Shakespeare in Love. Diana Lane has not had a powerful role in film since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in Infiel. Lately she's charming and engaging in romantic stories like Nights in Rodanthe, Must Love Dogs and Under the Tuscan Sun. Here she's right, balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension. <br /> <br /> This is a small part for Rosario Dawson. However, Dawson does a good job with it. You see a lot more of Lane, including an underwear scene to rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut. <br /> <br /> While you are in the criminal drama section, also get Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang and Baby gone, and before the Devil knows your dead. The latter has wonderful performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney. <br /> <br /> Killshot failed at the box office. More is our luck. It is certainly worth a rental of 3-4 dollars if you like this genre. 6/20/2009
