More agitated, heavy-handed, full of speeches, preaching in the nose, and more stylized in a way that only MTV could be guilty of, Stop-Loss is a hectic junk. I expected a lot more from young, talented actors such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Philippe, but screenwriter / director Kimberly Peirce does a job portraying the ill effects of the war on American youth. I'm sure she did some work researching the Iraq war and the young people who fight against it, but you would never have imagined it when watching Stop Loss. In many ways, this mess reminded me of Catherine Hardwicke's Lords of Dogtown, a waste of solid matter, equally inept, overly stylized and resembling a TV movie. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
