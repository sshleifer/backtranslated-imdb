My husband brought this house from the video store, so I could watch something while I was at home sick. The sick type where you could never focus on a book, but a silly, light and romantic movie sounds good (this is a bowl of chicken soup). Well, he meant well. <br /> <br /> My first thought (as some others post here too) was that the house must be fake ... it's not just secluded alone on the beach, but on moorings for loose sand, and so close to the ocean that the surf waves go directly down from the house! This seems so obviously dangerous (in the country of hurricanes, in THE FALL), so potentially disastrous that I was sure that the filmmakers had simply copied the whole thing (or used the magic of cinema to put a cute B & B in the surf) . <br /> <br /> But I have to tell you, thanks to the "interwebs", I can say that the house, "Serendipity" is very real, is indeed close to Rodanthe and except for some curtains and shrubs, appears mostly as it does in the movie. You can rent it by yourself, out of season, for $ 1,710 per week (or about $ 3850 in the summer)! Go ahead! But ... interestingly, the house has serious problems. The second thing that impressed me after being "washed" was "what happens to the plumbing / electricity? In that surf?" And, sure enough, "Serendipity" was convicted of a disruption in sanitation, caused by an ocean flood. . (They're rebuilding.) <br /> <br /> And the house is not from the "Civil War." Not to mention that Viola Davis, playing "cliche black best friend," is not remotely old enough that her GRANDMA could have built something in the Civil War! HELLO! That was 150 years ago! Try great-great-GREAT! (In fact, "Serendipity" was built in 1988, laughingly recently.) The basic film is built on a typical Nicholas Sparks, which means a lot of coincidence and chance. It is also directed in a very favorable way for "women" - you know, we women who love B & Bs, antiques and trinkets ... who dream of romance and guys who look like Richard Gere and dance in the moonlight. Do not give us plot, or development of thoughtful character; Just create some mechanisms and bring the love scenes! <br /> <br /> Gere plays a plastic surgeon who lost a patient during routine surgery for a benign cyst on his cheek. Of course, she died of an overdose of ANESTHESIA, so you wonder why the surgeon is guilty and not the anesthesiologist! HELLO! Where is this guy? Why is the wrong doctor feeling guilty? <br /> <br /> Gere came to pout and confront the woman's husband, and is staying in the remote B & B ... that should be there, because the ONLY ONE PERSON IN THE CLOSURE ... Diane Lane! She is a lonely divorcee with rotten kids and an ex-husband who wants her back. While she is trying to decide on this, the best black-clich√©d friend has her subbing as hostess at B & B. Now in the real world, if this montage ever happened, the doctor would look like Ernest Borgnine ... and the lonely divorcee, like Rosie O'Donnell. He was vacationing with 22-year-old girls on the beach while she was in a bad mood and was thinking about going on a diet. But this is not the real world; I digress. <br /> <br /> The couple confesses everything, falls in love, a hurricane hits ... they make love, fall in love, he has to leave, he dies and she cries a lot about it. The end. <br /> <br /> There I saved you; now you do not have to torture yourself or any known male (husbands, children, boyfriends) to sit down with such nonsense. Someone very much wondered why Diane Lane, a perfect tiny woman (which filmmakers seem to like to cast because she is beautiful and lean enough that most women would like to look like her but she is 45ish and not over- the-top, so she's not threatening) is constantly covered in large canvas-like shawls. That would make sense if she was chubby, but she is not. <br /> <br /> Anyway, someone throws a pretty paisley shawl over this movie. So we do not have to watch. Conclusion: read a book unless you are very sick. If you are very sick, go to sleep.
