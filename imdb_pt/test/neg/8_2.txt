I'm not a big fan of musicals, although this technically might not qualify as a musical. But I thought I'd give it a shot, since I love war movies. It was mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> Hudson seems totally out of order in this role. It just did not work for me. Julie Andrews probably played her role as best she could, but I find it difficult to buy her as a misleading, conniving spy. Sorry, I know it's classic stereotype on my part. But I have to say that I think this is the most beautiful and feminine Julie. I've always thought of her as more matronly, but this is certainly the result of her roles in Sound of Music and Mary Poppins. No doubt they were desperately trying to get her out of this typography in that role. She was very seductive in appearance here, but I still have not bought her as a spy. <br /> <br /> I could not stay focused all through the movie and saw myself going in and out - and talking to those in my bedroom (which I usually never do - I'm always shutting up everyone). So that tells you how little it caught my eye. Do not waste your time!
