Two things are changed from then on. First of all I am no longer a child, and according to most of the new Seagal movies are just terrible. This is in my opinion the worst film ever made with Derailed starring Jean Claude Van Damme. There is no plot in this movie, the plot is just an excuse to shoot some terrible action scenes that are painful to watch. I love action movies but this is not an action movie .... This is not a movie ... this is a group of scenes irritants that are connected in an annoying way to kill viewers love for action movies. I'm sorry but I do not have any respect for who liked this movie. He has a serious intelligence problem then. I hope Seagal will make new good movies in the future. Good luck to him!
