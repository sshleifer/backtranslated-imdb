Tom Cutler (Jackson) is a retired cop who now works as a Cleaner-upper crime scene. In his last job, he cleans up a new crime scene and destroys evidence and does not know that the crime was not officially reported. This can not be good. <br /> <br /> You hear of Cleaners all the time, but usually when a crowd or gang is involved when bodies, etc., need to be removed and the area cleaned. This is different in that Tom Cutler works with the police to clean up after the police have made the investigation of a crime scene. Hey, somebody has to do this. You know the police will not. The film makes that clear and it is up to the family to clean the area. <br /> <br /> This is almost a good thriller, but a plot involving Tom's daughter (Palmer) makes this story a little strange. I think they had to fill up some time. Oh, they brought that parallel lot to connect with the other side, but it was still a reach and a little weird. See? <br /> <br /> This was almost a good thriller, because there was a remarkable lack of tension, suspense and the pace was a bit draggy. The music also did not help, as I noticed that the music was more appropriate to observe people making a long journey. You know, travel music. Take it? THERE IS! <br /> <br /> Everyone's performance was excellent in this almost a good thriller. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes, Gender: No, Nudity: No, Language: No
