So many people loved this movie, but there are a few of us IMDb reviewers who found Mirrormask extremely uncomfortable to see and be very annoying. I fall into the last of these two fields, and I'll try to explain what made my nails bow so unpleasantly. <br /> <br /> First of all, to clarify - I like the books of Neil Gaiman. Sometimes I find his humor sarcastic, ironic and a bit nerdy, and I really prefer his work when he's playing it straight and leaving the jokes alone - but even with his occasional flaws in 'Daddy' jokes, I think creativity and his imagination are something a little special. <br /> <br /> Curiously, one of Gaiman's strongest works is Coraline, a gothic fairy tale for children that has lots of jokes and a lot of tension and shivers. His latest novel (Anansi Boys) exaggerates the funny stuff, and tends to read at times how Terry Pratchett does the Sisters of Mercy (not the nuns, but the band). Mirrormask inhabits similar territory to Coraline, and when I saw the stunning visuals in the trailer, I was a little excited that someone had managed to transfer Gaiman's spectacular vision and imagination to the screen. <br /> <br /> In praise of the film, some sequences look impressive. However, visual effects are occasionally ruined by CGI animation that looks like a student project of Media Studies. Background backgrounds and scenery are usually amazing, but some of the character animations look awkward, amateur and cheap. In an early dream sequence, the spider is animated beautifully, but the beast-cat that feeds on books looks poorly rendered and is very "computer-generated." Compared to the animation pattern found in productions like 'The Corpse Bride', Mirrormask occasionally looks very amateurish. However, in defense of Mirrormask, the budget was small for such a grandiose view, and some noises in the effects can be understood and forgiven. <br /> <br /> What can not be forgiven is the stilty, stagy, cringeworthy and pretentious dialogue. The actors struggle desperately with dialogue - and there is so much of it that they are constantly harmed and stumble into it. The conversation is made completely supernatural, jokes come up again and again, and exalted speeches seem to be the writer's only method of storytelling. Combined with the fact that the actors are working against a blue screen (which always adds an element of 'Phantom Menace') - this makes the film almost impossible to be displayed. In such an unrealistic scenario, actors need to work twice as hard to be believed and, for the most part, fail terribly. The girl who plays the leading role puts in a valiant fight against the impossible dialogue between theater schools and occasionally shows real promises but is never enough. The horrible 'Oirish' cod of the Valentine character (with whom she is forced to spend an excessive amount of time on the screen) puts any chance for this young actress to rise above the material. It seems to be Valentine's job to explain the plot to younger viewers, and to add a bit of light relief. Personally, I do not want it anywhere near my 15-year-old daughter. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong with this movie? Answer .... Rob Brydon. What is annoying (for us English) is that we know that Rob Brydon can act! We've seen him holding the screen for half an hour on his own (doing the "Marion & Geoff" monologues), and in the first real-world movie he's fine. However, put it in front of a blue screen and it loses all sense of character and becomes the worst ham I've seen in years. A real shame. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong? Answer ... the soundtrack, sub-Courtney Pine, saxophone and non-listable, very loud in the sound mix that never quit. God, the music is incessant, noisy, distracted, irrelevant, and if that is not enough, it has a wanky slap masturbating everything. This makes the dialogue very difficult to hear, but this can be a blessing in disguise. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong with this? Answer .... The whistle mime artist. In modern society, there should be no place for mime, apart from certain secret places in France. Every time the camera bends over the idiot, whistling, juggling, and making idiots, I understand why the residents of Edinburgh get a little anxious and angry when the festival season comes back. <br /> <br /> My final criticism is that the film is pretty boring. Surrealism is often monotonous? or requires your audience to slip into a state of dream acceptance, zen, or the public to be constantly impressed by bigger and bigger surprises. A story with a bit of rhythm involving characters that we could believe in and care about would have helped a lot to give this film the emotional center that unfortunately was missing while preventing the eyelids from falling. <br /> <br /> Finally, apologies to all those who found depth, meaning and admiration in this film. You managed to suspend your disbelief, saw the CGI shrill, ignored the bad dialogue and the abysmal performances that resulted and understood the grandiose and imaginative vision of the creator. I wanted to, but I could not see beyond the real world flaws that dragged him down. <br /> <br /> I hope Neil Gaiman will get it right next time, if he can (or wants) the opportunity.
