CUJO is a cinematographic adaptation of a novel of the same name written by Stephen King. <br /> <br /> I've never read the novel, but just scanning the comments page gave me some pointers. I noticed a reference to the change in the end. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is as follows - a St. Bernard dog is bitten by a rabid stick and makes a killing. <br /> <br /> The plot seems quite worn now, having been made in several films. However, it may have been something new when the king wrote the novel. Or perhaps King's novel has distorted the story that was never shown in the film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the first 40 minutes of this movie have nothing worth mentioning besides the dog being bitten. Nothing else happens - nothing scary, nothing funny, nothing to add depth to the characters and nothing interesting in any other aspect. I found this section difficult to sit on and was constantly screaming on TV, "Come on, get started!". The events I was seeing on screen were reminiscent of a TV movie of the drama genre or an extended episode of a TV soap opera. Unfortunately, there was only one family in the movie getting some focus, so it could not even work on a novel level. The dog was the best character in the movie, but there was not enough time in this section. There was nothing to indicate why this dog would go on a kill later. After the 40-minute mark, something finally happened. The dog suddenly transformed from an adorable pet into a vicious killing machine. He began to attack some people. There was also an interesting cat-and-mouse chase when two characters got stuck in a car, unable to leave because the dog would attack them. Even in this second half overly long, the suspense would increase long before he died again. It was just a situation repeated several times until the film came to its conclusion. <br /> <br /> Without revealing the ending, I can say that it was very stereotyped and unworthy of a Stephen King story. <br /> <br /> The suspense scenes when they are onscreen are thrilling to watch. Some great camera angles add threat to the dog's vicious nature when it attacks people. This is particularly important because, as others have already mentioned, a St. Bernard dog is not as scary as, say, a Rottweiler. Unfortunately, the movie does not use suspense music to support the images on the screen. The music is very melodramatic and not full of suspense. This may fit in a TV movie, but it seems incredibly out of place in what should be a dark tones movie, presenting a living nightmare to the viewer. <br /> <br /> This leads me to a wider problem with this film - photography. Camera work and especially the choice of colors make this look like a very cheap TV movie that one would expect to see as the daytime film on Channel 5 here in the UK where I am writing this comment. <br /> <br /> The two best actors have good performances that help give life to the film's bland segments. Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro should be credited for doing a great job with the poor material they receive. I could forgive a few brief moments of overacting, paying more attention to the dialogue, which could not have allowed any other interpretation in my opinion. I will not judge the other actors because they have practically nothing to do. As someone who is a fan of SALEM'S LOT and STEPHEN KING'S IT, both film adaptations of Stephen King's famous novels, I had high expectations for this movie. But it turned out to be a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would not recommend Stephen King fans or horror movies in general to watch CUJO. This is one of those times when I have to recommend the book instead of the movie. I hope this brings the story to life in a way the film could not do.
