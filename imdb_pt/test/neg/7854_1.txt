I'm a fan of good historical fiction, and I was thrilled by the thought that someone would pick up a number of well-written books and film it. Writing screenplays is not like writing regular fiction, but when you have a book that you are adapting, it would be cool to actually follow the plot. <br /> <br /> The portraits of the Vespasians (the royal Emperor, and his 2 sons Tito and Domitian) were horrible. They acted as a Caligula cookie cutter, and were the 'bandits' in this adaptation. There was a scene with Tito dismissing justice as if he were Caligula (of the film of the same name). The way the Vespasians are portrayed in the books, for the most part, follows the accounts of historians writing in that period - they were just and sensible. , not stained by the imperial insanity of Claudius. Helena (the love interest of Marcus Didius Falco) gives as a reason to divorce Pertinax (one of the traitors mentioned in the title) was that he was a traitor, still in the books was because he ignored it and she felt that it would be better to marry someone who valued her as a person. Marcus in the movie gets a slave named Justus, still in books that he could barely afford for his apartment, let alone have a slave. There was certainly no romantic interlude between the nonexistent slave Justus and a gladiator woman ... <br /> <br /> In general, if you want a good cookie cutter, Roman stereotypes take Caligula if you want a good Roman of classic story point of view, take me, Claudius.
