The title, though unique, will undoubtedly remind true horror fans of Tod Browning's immortal classic about a circus troop and how they were misunderstood by the outside world. I can assure you, however, that this "thing" has absolutely nothing to do with "Freaks" or even the art of making professional films in general. This film was recommended to me, supposedly because it is raw, disturbing and thought-provoking, despite the low budget production figures. Okay, right?? The person who recommended me can now consider myself my personal enemy! The low budget factor is correct, but that sums it all up. "Freak" is terribly slow, poorly done and every character that is introduced is absolutely unbearable ?? and this includes the freak as well. Two brothers on their way to a new life find a deformed mental patient who escaped the transport truck to another hospital and returns to the house where he killed his mother at the age of nine. This could have been an interesting slasher with good isolated shooting locations. but instead Tyler Sharpe decided to make the family drama boring and meaningless. The main actress's attempts to seem emotionally devastated are rather laughable and the total lack of suspense and action can hardly be attributed to the limited budget. Total failure!
