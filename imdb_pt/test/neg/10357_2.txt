Some people say this show was good in the early years! I disagree with them all. The show is just plain stupid and pathetic. My mother hates, I hate, my father hates, I do not know about my sister, but okay. Here are a few reasons: 1. CHARACTERS: Babies being used as adult-style characters are stupid. Babies are just precocious and irritating. Adults and adults are stupid and unpleasant. The worst character is that Angelica Pickles (she actually does it in her ear when you've had a long, hard and miserable day at the office) and also Kimi Finster who appears later; she is too optimistic and a pain in the ass. She can not decide where she is French or Japanese: it does not matter to know; You're an American citizen you know and that's it! Oh, of what I'm talking about, all the characters in this show suck! <br /> <br /> 2. THE STORIES: The stories are not very original and dumb. Do it as the babies go out on a big adventure, yes to the backyard shed. In one episode, that goofy brat, Tommy Pickles, the Leader, invaded the control room of a television and literally almost destroyed it. Do not give the kids any idea of ​​destroying the normal T.V Station control rooms (they pay a lot of money for them in real life). I can imagine what the broadcasters must have felt when viewing this episode, they will probably start looking at their machines throughout the day for fear a baby might slow down. Sad! <br /> <br /> 3. OVER RATED!: The show has been dragging on for years and people are still inventing stories and new series and spin-offs for it. Get out! The Simpsons have been going through almost the same amount of time, but are far better and funnier than babies. The show is simply over rated! People, where's your good sense! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I surprised TV stations around the world who want to broadcast this series to this day. The show is total rubbish and should never have been produced. The two films for these drawings sucked the same way! 2/10
