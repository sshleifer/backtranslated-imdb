... if Disney had stayed away from it. See, I think this movie has some potential. Well, the situation of the main character at least. Get the whole Jordan Cahill deal and you'll have the start of a decent movie! Of course, you also lose more than half of the movie, but, okay. It is not such a loss. <br /> <br /> So, here it goes: You get a typical suburban teenager (Danielle Panabaker, who is actually a decent actress) whose best friends scream a lot, especially a "pop sensation" (I suppose it's a direct quote the film almost always involves that particular phrase) called Jordan Cahill. Except, of course, the TPSTG wants more out of life. Enter the character of Brenda Song, a sophisticated individual that is exactly what the TPSTG needs (honestly, I do not care about the real name of the character, I like the acronym more). The two new friends will see Jordan Cahill (one to drool, one to make fun of the ruffles), and leave with his cell phone. Hijinks follow, and everything ends well in the end. <br /> <br /> If only Disney, or any major movie studio for that matter, does not have such a low opinion from 8 to 14 years old. Or maybe if 8- to 14-year-olds waited a little longer for the movies directed at them. It's such a crap that makes me more than a little unsure of who gets angrier (a little movie called 'High School Musical' comes to mind ...)
