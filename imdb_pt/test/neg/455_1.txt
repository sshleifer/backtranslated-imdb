No surprise, except for how quickly ABC reacted to the gloomy rankings. According to published reports (Variety), the program received the worst indexes in the history of the ABC television network. <br /> <br /> And I quote: the talent competition of the song "The One", ABC, opened on Tuesday night to cancel Now evaluations. <br /> <br /> The article went on to say that the show received a "shocking low of 1.1 rating / 3 share in adults between 18-49 and 3.08 million viewers in general." <br /> <br /> This makes the debut weaker for any reality show on any network and also below all the arcs of the series in ABC's history. <br /> <br /> From the first moment I saw the commercials for this, I knew I would fail. We do not need another American Idol clone. But ABC should have given this program a fair chance to succeed.
