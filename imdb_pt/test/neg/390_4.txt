The best scene from "The People Across The Lake" is the genuinely scary night scene that shows a house, a murder and a lake. After that, it is very downhill from there as far as the horror is concerned. One family (mother, father, sister, and younger brother) is fed up with the (slightly) dangerous suburban environment, and decides to move in near the titular lake. Thereafter, the film features a lot of doo-doo resembling the happy family near the lake, occasionally with some corpses appearing here and there. The two scenes in which they discover the bodies are quite convincing (in terms of strangeness), but they are in contrast to the rest of the events (with only things from the daily life of the family settling in). The truth of the matter (the mystery about who is doing the killing) is learned too early, leaving only the family unknowingly and the viewer yawning during the last end of life (presenting a discovery in a basement and running around the house), as if thing made for television suddenly remembered that it was to be a horror movie. It is not badly made; the content and the story are not interesting enough. The only highlight in the cast is Barry Corbin, though his performance / character is a little too silly to be taken seriously. Blond cutie Tammy Lauren (daughter) may be a recognizable face for avid terror addicts too, as she also starred in "Wishmaster" (1997), and made for TV tours such as "I Saw What You Did" (1988) and "The Stepford Children" (1987). She does not have much to do in this movie, though. Ignorant, but watchable, if anything.
