No wonder so many people have fallen in love with it. When I watched this movie, some spectators by my side sobbed whenever you "supposedly" sobbed - or at least felt "touched." Like when Hunting said he did not love the girl. Like when the character of Robin Williams (sorry, I forgot the name of his role) was telling Hunting repeatedly "It's not your fault" (oh Lord, just thinking about this scene gives me shivers). I could not have cared less about what would happen to the characters. Many people cry for Hollywood-made characters they can not even identify with (think Titanic, Yuck!) ... but it really only made me shiver and want to leave the theater. I think I simply refuse to be psychically and emotionally manipulated by all of this. <br /> <br /> People are not me being condescending ... these characters are, and for no good reason because they are unreal. Even worse, nothing is new or surprising. Even the character of Robin Williams is all clich√©. <br /> <br /> I gave 1 out of 10. It's probably not that bad; it's just pretty mediocre ... but a lot of people went to the other extreme and gave it a 10, so I figured a simple balancing vote would not hurt.
