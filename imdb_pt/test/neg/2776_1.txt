In the Muslim country of Khalid (fictitious), his benevolent leader / dictator, Reed Hadley as Amir, is dying of cancer. Amir dies and a desperate plot unfolds. His body is wrapped in foil and taken in a clandestine operation (the population does not know of his death), consisting of his doctor (Mohammed) and Mohammed, out of the country to perform a risky brain transplant. The surgery is being performed by the disgraced Dr. Kent Taylor, who believes there is no chance of failure and has two assistants. One of them is about 3 feet tall (Master Blaster actually ran Barter Town) and the other is a crippled and traumatized 7-foot giant called Gor. What could go wrong? <br /> <br /> I forgot to mention the American woman Amir, the blonde Barbie, Tracy or that Dr. Kent has a dungeon with slave test subjects and delusions of grandeur? How about a brain transplant that was not done? There is a lot of treatment in all this and the people are dead, but I will not lie to you anymore: MISSION CARRIED OUT. The ends justify the means. If you can accept this, you will not have to lose 80 minutes. I hope you're warning enough. Do not say I did not warn you. If you must watch, then do not watch alone and have enough medicine waiting. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
