This movie had no credibility for two reasons. One, no mayor of a large city and New York is certainly as important as possible. He would allow a city in his city to degenerate into such a violent place to live; especially for voters who might have a lot to say about their future job security. All the victims of the film were mostly elderly, Jewish or defenseless. At age 62, I've never seen a movie that portrayed as much a lack of respect for authority as this movie. Even "Escape from New York," which was fictional, up front, that is, they said it was science fiction, they did not resort to such deep violence. In this film, most of the older victims were victimized and still had guns, but were unwilling to use them. Also, in this film and I have not seen the previous two, it is more illegal than the movie "Escape". Second, gangs, as far as my research shows, have never been as cooperative as this movie makes them so out of the ordinary. On the one hand they pick up a gang member from another gang who works in their area and he is killed. However, when the heroes start firing at the local gang bangers, the next gang is welcomed with open arms. Outside gang members are always seen as strangers and are stuck. We must believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang, other gangs want to be involved. Why have outside gangs come to help? I believe that more than one gang came from outside to help. What did they come for? Another question, why was the gang leader arrested and why do the prison inmates ask permission to attack the Bronson character? This was not a great movie and I could continue but I will not.
