This is a student movie and sucks. I would use a much stronger language to describe it, but then the review would not be published and the world needs to know - beyond any possible reasonable doubt - this movie really sucks. <br /> <br /> There seems to be a difference rule used when measuring the early work of an already famous director. As if it were somehow cool that we were too stupid to understand since he finally understood right now. I'm not buying this. The initial film "Bad taste" by LOTR Peter Jackson is lousy and this "first name" work of another famous director really is bad in the same way. These "first works" are representative of all the crap, from the budget to the scripts and the actors, etc. everything is at the bottom of the trash from the bucket. Do not be fooled by the big name. <br /> <br /> If you like to see a handful of 70's hippy burnouts pretend they could command a ship with the worst special effects you've ever seen - this is your movie. I can not believe this thing won a gold parchment award for the best special effects. This is a joke right? Or a joke prize? <br /> <br /> If you want to watch what this movie WANTS was rent a season or three of Red Dwarf you smeghead.
