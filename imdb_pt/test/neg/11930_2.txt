In the animated series: Aeon Flux was an amoral rebel who was completely detached from everything and everyone. She was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, witty, caustic, confident, sarcastic, lethal, indomitable, ambiguous all at once. The original Aeon had layers on layers of depth. She almost never let her personal emotions show up. The original plot was delightfully ambiguous and thought-provoking. You could never tell what Aeon's motives were. Aeon was an anarchist militant, while Trevor was a radical idealist, so they could never have any semblance of a stable relationship. <br /> <br /> In the film Aeon Flux works for the Monicans and their political motives and personal motives are very clear. She was beautiful, loving, vulnerable, easily controllable, emotional, and very predictable. The Aeon in the film had a depth layer at most. The plot was obvious and invented. Everything is completely set for you from the beginning. There was virtually no conflict between Aeon and Trevor, at least in terms of personal philosophies. The only conflict between them was that they were on different sides. <br /> <br /> The movie was a horrible disappointment to me. I felt betrayed. They took the idea of ​​one of my favorite animated characters of all time, took all of their depth and personality and filled it with Hollywood clichés. The essence of the animated series was completely lost in this film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm not giving this movie is "1" because the visuals are amazing. It was cool to see some of the familiar animated scenes, like the eye fly made with CGI.
