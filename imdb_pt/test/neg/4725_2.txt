The following "review" is one of the wrong side of the tracks, ie two things: you will not hear anything other than compliments coming from me and do not be fooled by my rating. I could also tell you that this review does not contain spoilers, but technically ... that's a lie. <br /> <br /> Well, ... Damn the review. I'm just going to digress a little. It's been a while since I had so much fun with such a bad movie. And if you can not enjoy this piece of total nonsense, then you simply have no sense of humor. Firstly, this movie was meant to be taken seriously, and that's the main thing the fun is coming at. The story? The son of a doctor is terminally ill. Daddy-Doctor decides that a hart transplant should be the only way to save your child. So, in true crazy doctor style, he decides that a gorilla's heart will do the trick. Of course the gorilla's heart is "too powerful for a human," then the transmuted boy becomes that hideous Monkey-Man who immediately frees himself up and makes a killing and rape (because that is simply what any excited animal would do is not "The makeup of our Monkey Man is hilarious, there's simply no other way to say: the faces of the guys look like shit!" I'm talking about human excrement here, the solid brown type! besides real images of an open-heart surgery, we also have incredibly fake (but rather unpleasant) blood and blood effects: a decapitation, a tearing of the eyes, a tearing of the throat, scalping of someone's skull, ... It is hilarious, and indeed quite incomprehensible because NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES has come to the notorious list of UK Video-Nasties because all the nasty things portrayed in this movie are just ridiculous enough to be taken seriously. Oh, and there's just a bloody monkey running around too, by the way. So it goes without saying that LA HORRIPILANTE HUMAN BEAST is a much more accurate title to this terrifying and compelling story of science that has gone terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> When not attempting to bump into poorly staged acts of bloody violence or random portraits of female nudity, this movie manages to be a lot of fun with ingredients like nonsense dialogues, cheap cardboard sets, stupid plot and incredibly poor acting . Just a few random examples, maybe? About sets: It can be clearly seen that set designers used the same walls, doors, windows (etc.) several times to build several different interior sets (eg: One side of the hospital room - the window side - where is the unconscious wrestling girl, looks suspiciously similar to the side of the basement laboratory window from where the Monkeyman escapes, the set designers also took one of the side windows of the laboratory, made it a little bigger and just put it in the room of hospital conferences, all the walls of any building are the same ashes; Then there is the park setup. Clearly shot in a studio, you can see (on several occasions) that the grass is loose. Whenever there is some fight / fight / rape going on, the grass just changes and shuffles and you can see the gray concrete from the studio floor below it. Just a few random lines coming out of the actors Bocas: - In the conference room where all the doctors are debating the disappearance of the Girl of the Unconscious Wrestling (a disappearance that, of course, would mean bad publicity for the hospital ), Daddy says intelligently, "We find ourselves in a situation that is difficult." During the same debate, a medical colleague cleverly observes "A Sleepwalker! Any Sleepwalker Rises," providing a solid excuse for the disappearance of the Girl of Unconscious Wrestling. After investigating the detective, through the incredible process of his logical deduction, concludes and tells his superior that the killer must be a half man / half beast, his superior responds that it is absurd, adding the line "It's more likely that lately, more and more, you're watching on your television many of these scary images" ... Truly one of the best lines in the movie. Other sources of laughter: The two scenes were Daddy-Doctor and his assistant Igor kidnap the zoo's gorilla and the hospital's Unconscious Wrestling Girl - these well thought out acts Abduction are like taking candy from a baby. Daddy-Doctor talks a lot about God, does not he? <br /> <br /> - Daughter to call dad-doctor "papa" on more than one occasion. An old lady shouting "Aaargh !!! A dead man! A dead man! A dead man !! A dead man !!!". - The plot periodically stops to wallow in scenes of struggling women, only to continue again and do nothing with this concept. Of course, Dad-Doctor replaces Sonny- The heart of a gorilla boy for the second time with the Girl of the Unconscious Wrestling, but do you think something spectacular happens after that? Like Ape-Turd-Man's frizzy breasts or something, trying to rape men this time? Ape-Turd-Man begins to show some maternal love near the end of the movie ... Ape-Turd-Man begins to show some maternal love near the end ... almost (and I say "almost") in the true KING KONG style (ie the top of a building and people on the floor pointing and screaming). <br /> <br /> Okay, I guess that's enough now. I chipped more than my two cents here Vomitron Rational Classification for this sleazy piece of hilarious dreck: 2/10 Vomitron Rating Wrong Side of Tracks: 8/10 Go see this movie, people. worth it!
