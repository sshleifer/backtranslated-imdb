Do not pay attention to the compliments of this film here. It's Van Damme's worst movie and one of the worst of all I've ever seen. It would be attractive to someone who does not need depth and who requires nothing but shots and explosions to be entertained. Seeing that this is directed by Peter Hyams, made me realize that Peter does not have talent as a director. , but he's very good at shooting explosions and stuff like that. However, movies need other elements as well; for example, a story. This one did not have one. That may explain the horror of some of Hyams's latest films, hardly better than this, actually. <br /> <br /> One can not help but wonder how some people were put behind a camera.
