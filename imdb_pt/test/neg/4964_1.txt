Looking at these ratings and seeing all those high indexes, let me believe that large amounts of red corn syrup will please any idiot who dies with the brain. This movie is beyond useless. All the cliches of a horror movie without any substance. I'm sure I could go into detail about the movie, but why bother when you can sum it up? Obviously everyone wants Mandy Lane and she apparently does not want any of the guys. Throughout the movie you will see this. <br /> <br /> When she stops being a friend of the typical boy trapped in the loser's zone of friends, he gets drunk and when she goes out on a trip to the middle of nowhere (of course) he starts hunt them down by one. Sounds decent so far right? But what made this movie suck beyond belief is when you find out that not only is your losing friend the killer, but so is she. The plan was beyond ridiculous. Let us together kill all our friends and then kill each other. They do not give a reason why they want to do this, and given Mandy Lane's "Goody Too Shoes" behavior, it makes you scratch your head even more about what's really motivating these characters to do whatever they're doing. It's sad .. this movie had a lot of potential, but the director or writer apparently can not relate to the audience anyway.
