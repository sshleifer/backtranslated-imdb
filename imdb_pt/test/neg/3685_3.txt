This line is a good summary of this movie. If you've read and watched 20 minutes from the movie, you'll know exactly how the rest of the movie will behave. Some researcher named Surgei (pronounced SirGay) is looking for hell in the underworld of Moscow. However, he seems to have disappeared, and his friend Oven goes with a team to look for him. Could they find a more annoying storyline? Some bad actors taking care of an old man in the underworld. The acting is really bad, the novel really does seem meaningless and false, there is often not a good reason for the way the characters are acting, nothing is scary and most of all: nothing interesting is happening in the entire movie. They just walk, ask some gang leaders and other guys on the way, walk a little, complain a bit, meet the old man, and then run and finally find their way out of the underground. <br /> <br /> The only thing that provides me with giving this movie the smallest of all ratings is the atmosphere. If you just want to see a movie for this, this might be a good choice. It is dark and mystical and obscure. However, the rest of the movie is really boring. You sit around all the time waiting for the movie to start or something happens. In fact, some things are happening, but they are not very well executed. For example, I did not really realize when one of the characters disappeared, and I swear I was not sleeping or something. And I do not understand what's dangerous with these kids ... They run underground underground, scratching walls with clubs (I suppose that's scary in some way). <br /> <br /> Just watch this movie if you need some somber atmospheres.
