I was disappointed with this documentary. I thought it would be about the second chess match between Grandmaster Garry Kasporov and Deep Blue the supercomputer designed by IBM computer experts to beat any human chess player. Kasparov was and still is considered the greatest chess player The film takes us back to 1997, where Kasporov agreed to have a rematch with "Deep Blue" after defeating him a year earlier. But instead of focusing on the game, it focuses more on what happens before and after. the game, but not many. Many of the films focus on Kasporov's paranoid obsession that the game was rigged as part of a conspiracy theory and that he lost the game unfairly. The film also includes interviews with people who are not interesting at all. They even talk to the manager of the building where the game took place. Who cares? I also found it very dry and slow. Ultimately, this movie was unsatisfactory. This is just my opinion, of course. If you like conspi racy theories, this movie may interest you. For people not in chess or conspiracy theories, this movie would probably have no value. I'm a chess fan, and I just stuck because of it. I give "Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine" 4/10
