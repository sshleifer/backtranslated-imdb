BLACK EYE (2 outta 5 stars) An action movie from the 70s, unimaginative, seems to have been made for TV ... only an occasional word and a subframe about lesbianism suggest that the film was made to appear in theaters . Fred Williamson plays a tough old cop guy who becomes a tough guy private. He is faced with a couple of murders and attempted murders linked to a mysterious cane. There are some fistfights, a Bullit-inspired car chase, a rather original elevator scene, and even the time for Williamson to confront his girlfriend's rich and lesbian lover (Teresa Graves). There is also a scene with Williamson intimidating a poor old man ripping some invaluable autographed photos in his souvenir shop. Yeah, all right, tough guy ... maybe you can find a cripple to beat after? Obviously destined to profit from the success of "Shaft" (this and about six thousand other films), this film does not have enough edge or originality enough to make a good impression.
