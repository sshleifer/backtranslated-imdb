Some people like to say that Deep Space 9 is the best of all Star Trek shows because it emphasizes the character's development and continuity, as well as presenting a more complex background and continuous frames. In a way, this makes it more satisfying, but in many ways the program fails completely. <br /> <br /> The series begins as a soap opera on a space station, with two entire seasons of generic science fiction stories balanced with banal subplots about the characters. The characters are good, and most of the actors are decent, but I think the writers tried a lot to make them "normal". By "normal" they really mean "ordinary and tedious." <br /> <br /> At the end of season two we are introduced to Dominion, who stands menacingly for a while before finally getting into a fight with the good guys. in the fifth season. This is the main "story arc" of the program, but occupies only a fraction of the whole series. We still have lame episodes, heroes still get stuck on strange planets for forty-five minutes, and there's a huge amount of low-brow comedy with the greedy and ferocious Ferengi. Many episodes are simply monotonous, and some are countless. Dominion, the main villains of DS9, are engaged in galactic domination for the convenient reason that, well, they just do not like anyone. All war is presented with a naive lack of moral complexity and imagination. Impressively pyrotechnical space battles often appear from the third season onwards, but they are carried out in a ridiculously simplistic way, like two huge fleets of super-advanced spacecrafts that fly at each other and explode. The DS9 writers (including the talented Ronald D. Moore, later known as "Battlestar Galactica") showed their monotonous show when starting a war, but deep down it's still pedantic soap. <br /> <br /> DS9 remains a very frustrating experience. The continuous storyline is too flat and obvious to be really thrilling, and the characters never really develop in interesting ways. "Babylon 5" and "Battlestar Galactica" fulfilled the promise made by DS9 and did everything much better. For Star Trek, stay with the original and the Next Generation.
