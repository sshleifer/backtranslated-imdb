This movie was terrible. The acting was lame, but it's hard to tell if anyone was acting well since the writing was so bad. This is one of Johnny Depp's worst movies - I highly discouraged anyone to watch it. <br /> <br /> If you need to see Cry-Baby, I recommend silencing and simply taking a look at Mr. Depp for an hour and a half.
