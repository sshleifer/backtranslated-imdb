Although it's one of two Tales of Voodoo Volume 1 movies, there's no voodoo or something supernatural in it! The box labeled "Hell Hole", but the screen title is Escape from Hell Hole. The title is confusingly similar to Hell Hole (1978), also known as "Escape from Hell Hell Hole". A group of women bathe in a river and apparently the worst thing they have to worry about is a peeping tone that easily dominate. No nudity in this or any other scene, however. <br /> <br /> A woman named Cardena drives in a car and seems to be known and appreciated by all women. She invites Indri to come and live in the city with her and her uncle M.G. When they get there, it is clear that M.G. wants to take Indri's virginity. M.G. runs some sort of prostitution house, and he is in charge of a corrupt branch of the military, or runs a paramilitary uniform, or prefers his guards to wear military-style uniforms. <br /> <br /> Women who refuse you or cause problems to be put in prison. Indri is sent there. Women are tortured and sometimes raped by guards. <br /> <br /> Several frustrated escape or rescue attempts are made, but inevitably fail despite the obvious advantages women have: they far outnumber the guards and relatively few. of guards have automatic weapons - most have semi-automatic rifles or pistols. <br /> <br /> WIP enthusiasts may like it, and the fact that it was made in the Philippines gives it something new, but on the other hand. Eh.
