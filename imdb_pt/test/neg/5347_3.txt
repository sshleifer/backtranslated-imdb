Chip Foose is an absolute genius and the end result of the projects is really incredible. Co-hosts do a good job. I particularly like to see the "project" come together. The end results are much better than when they left the assembly line with today's mechanical and cosmetic advancements. However, I get a little annoyed that the "projects" seem to belong to the already rich and / or famous. It's a shame that those who are retired can afford the commitment. Let's see now, Vince Neill from Motley Crew gets a car for his friend. Hello! If he (Neill) was a true friend, he would have paid to have his friend's car restored. What a joke! Another episode shows an apparently well-behaved middle-aged girl getting her 56-year-old cadet named Betsy. The husband of more than 30 years was behind everything. The couple looked like the money was not missing. What a pity. I think the lunch guys like me will have to save up for the day that will never come. I happen to own a 1953 Ford project chip. Will someone get me?
