It opens - and for half an hour, runs - like an educational program in the Old Testament, though not without humor. The film finally begins to grow wings when the biblical song is discarded. In a mixed success scene, Martin Donovan (Jesus) decides to deny the kick-off of the Apocalypse and the final quarter of an hour is a kind of humanist "Why all this upheaval?" play-out, gilded with an optimistic conjecture against a (retrospectively, miserably ironic longevity) of the WTC twin towers. <br /> <br /> In addition to Donovan's authority, acting is divided. There is the dramatic melodrama of the rest of the cast: this, though formally planned for the biblical presentation, is appropriate for the modern and paranoid comedy that Hartley is craving. But I was also pleasantly surprised by the contribution of PJ Harvey (credited as well, and in danger of existing within the film just as the pop star entity that she is, not just in a set scene at a record store and a dangerous soundtrack which contributes). It remained cool - a sort of disinterested lack of focus - in the manner of many pop icons that were filmed (I'm thinking of the Jagger of Performance here), but nonetheless maintained a compelling integration with the cast and project. Ultimately, affirmative, but this bittersweet essay is a bit too much like one and depends more on perseverance than the imagination of your audience. 4/10
