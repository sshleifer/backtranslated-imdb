This is the worst war movie I've ever seen, possibly the worst ever. I find it incredible that some people rated him as 10. He has an impressive lack of rudimentary features of realism. Almost every clich√© of war film appears in this film and it is done poorly. On the other hand, I would not have attended to the end if it had not been so bad that I had fun.
