Where do I start with the Killing Mind before I mention the good bit? This movie is about a young FBI psychologist, or something, who for some reason is going to work for the LAPD for now. There are a few recognizable faces, like the "I love you guy" guy from Wayne's World, playing with a cop (good shaving age too!) And two guys who always seem to play cops playing ..... you guessed it, cops. One of them was one of the police at Gross Point Blank following John Cusack on the spot, and the other is the FBI guy with specifications in Final Destination, who is also on the Fugitive as another cop. I know the FBI, the US Marshalls, the CIA, etc. are not police officers, but they're all the same. They enforce the law to some extent, which makes them law enforcement in my book. Feel free to disagree with the definition of a cop as much as you want, they are still seen as those who are trying to overthrow the bad guys. Anyone, I digress. The woman is working alongside these policemen who seem to just sit in a library in the basement or something, and for some unknown reason decides to reopen a case that was not considered by yonks. She saw the corpse as a child, so naturally she decided she could reopen the case because she was personally attached to it! I also like how the person profiling the psychological state of other people witnessed a murder scene as a child. Surely that's the kind of thing you can screw up with somebody's head? She begins to ask questions of some journalist who covered the story when she was open, although he appears to be about the same age as the woman, so he was presumably writing for a newspaper when he was 10 or writing some school reports. And then she decided that he would be the best person to ask about it. <br /> <br /> So we see that in addition to reopening the homicide cases 25 years ago, she tries her hand at petty theft, as she sprints through discreetly through a busy street wearing a balaclava. Way to mix, idiot! Anyway, she and the cops with the ice cream in the park chase after him, and as he crosses a bridge with a woman and a child standing over him, the thief takes the baby in his mother's arms and throws the baby in the river. That, if you have not guessed yet, is the best part of the movie. I'm not sadistic, and I have no hatred for babies or anything, but the scene looks so stupid that I promise you'll wet the pants laughing at it if you watch this movie. It gets better when Final Destination & the Fugitive cop jumps to rescue the baby and then declares to his friend "It's a baby!" As he did not know that before jumping, he is beyond me. <br /> <br /> In any case, she pursues the thief, but loses it. Later, she recalls that a random dog did not bark at the thief, so she assumed it should be his and decided to track down the thief by the dog. The dog had no marks or anything on it, so how did she know where to find the dog, and so finding the thief is another matter that I will not enter. It was soon after that that I stopped watching. The story was moving very slowly, and after I stopped laughing at the baby throwing away, I kind of lost interest and lost what was being said. <br /> <br /> Saying this, I'll go ahead and take over. that the killer was the guy journalist because he seemed a little cunning, and she spent a lot of time with him, and anyone who observes Columbo knows that the person outside the police force who spends most of the time with the investigating officer is his villain In addition, other people's criticisms say that the killer was pretty obvious, so I'm sure it was him. <br /> <br /> So, in general, a movie of pants, but worth watching just for that glorious scene.
