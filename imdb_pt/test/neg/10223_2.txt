Walt particularly liked quality. So how come the Disney producers would release such a terribly edited, shaken movie (even for the family!)? GREAT GREEN had a good concept. And, as is Disney, you know how the film will become clear. But the big green is horrible. The jokes are silly. And Steve Guttenburg, still alive, makes another terrible presentation on his resume. <br /> <br /> Children with a lot of time on their hands in the small town of Elma receive an opportunity from their new teacher to play football. Children do not know anything. And, gracious of us, we got to see Steve Guttenburg trying to hit the teacher from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Camera acceleration does not work. GREAT GREEN is full of speeding up the characters to get the movie on. Children are not idiots. They will catch you if you give them a enough tip without showing all that junk. Guttenburg, for the first time in his life, should have declined an offer to participate in this film. Also the beautiful Olivia d'Abo should have called that too. GREAT GREEN can be known as "The Great Pump".
