Words can not express how poor this movie is. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, the acting is terrifying, basically the whole movie is a joke. <br /> <br /> With a duration of 97 minutes It is about 96 minutes more. <br /> <br /> It could have been a little sketch in a comedy show, but the premise is too fragile to work through that period of time without boredom coming on the scene. Avoid this one, rent a good movie!
