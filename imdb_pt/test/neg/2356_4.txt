Saboteur was one of the few Hitchcocks I had not yet discovered and I was less than half-oppressed. The French title "La Cinqui√®me Colonne" (The Fifth Column, a very evocative phrase for organizations of espionage and subterranean sabotage) set my expectations quite high, as did the final images at the top of the Statue of Liberty. <br /> <Basically, the Saboteur is as carefree as the 39 steps (note that this is another evocative phrase, even McGuffin's title), but it lacks a lot of humor (so the characters are more common) and it's definitely not so fast. Like a chase movie in the US, from Los Angeles to NY, the Saboteur crawls from one sequence to another. The sequel to the villain's lovable ranch? Beautiful ranch, lovely villain, but very tame overall, this does not contribute to anything. The encounter with the blind, the mix with the circus staff, the sequence of Soda City, the sequence of NY balls? They fall to the ground, bringing more characters with very little added value of suspense. <br /> <br /> One big problem I can point to is the relationship between leaders Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, who is not developing as Robert Donat. and Madeleine Caroll in 39 steps. Therefore, the entire narrative structure is floating, depending on the addition of new scenes. And new scenes are only nearing the end, as it is not clear whether the hook is the escape of the police hero, the villains or their action to prevent conspiracy sabotages. In 39 steps, it was clearly scripted as 1 / run away from the police (so you know the hero can not just go to the police) and then 2 / run for his life and then the villains to prove his innocence. <br /> <br /> If you want a better Hitchcock of the 1940s propaganda, I would advise you to choose Foreign Correspondent about the Saboteur. Both are chase movies with a contagious ending as well an exciting and not only tourism in Foreign Correspondent as well as wonderfully efficient scenes (the umbrella crowd, the tulip fields, the strange mills ...).
