Worse than a mediocre thriller about a woman who has been abused and who remains on the street after being circumstantially linked to the death of her husband and sister. Determined to prove that the husband is alive, she follows the calls throughout the state, and her risk increases with each stop. Chasing after it are the traditional "good-cop" and "bad-cop" partners. One is convinced of his innocence the other more interested in closing the case and get home. This pair is often able to corner the suspect, but can never capture it. All the major players are in a remote city in the desert and the truth begins to reveal itself with deadly consequences for some. <br /> <br /> Wow! This was a bad movie. The cops could not find a suspect if he or she was in the police station (this happens twice) and everyone is as one-dimensional as possible. Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br />
