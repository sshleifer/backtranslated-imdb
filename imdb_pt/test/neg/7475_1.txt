When the opening shot is a disrespect for the US flag by the United States Marines, a film has a difficult road ahead but unfortunately went from there. There is a credible military adviser, who is also apparently a retired US soldier, making it even more disconcerting that this incredible breach of protocol and law has gone unnoticed. Even more disconcerting is the way they simply described how a marine is reported as KIA, then buried, in a short time, without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body, or whether there was even a body. The US government is still finding missing people from World War II, and it takes months to identify the remains. The slaughtered soldiers remain MIA for months or years and are only declared KIA when the remains were positively identified, or after years of bureaucracy. We are expected to believe that this happens in a matter of days or weeks. Maybe this happens in Denmark, but not in the United States. Clearly, none of the people involved ever had the least involvement or respect for the US military. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are a number of other laughable moments when the characters come up with zingers out of nowhere. There must have been some really broad meetings between the author and the actors as they struggled to find their motivation for such nonsense. Having a script that worked may have helped, but this seems to have been invented locally by working from Cliffs Notes. There is no way to know if the script was originally horrible, or if it was the author, or the middle management kids in the studio who are responsible. Anyway, this is a horrible movie that should never have been made.
