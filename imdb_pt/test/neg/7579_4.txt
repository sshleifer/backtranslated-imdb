I should explain that, in regard to this trend, to steal Asian horror movies, this Shutter is above The Grudge and Dark Water, while it still does not reach the same amount of creepiness as The Ring sets. <br /> <Although movies, like life, do not exist in a vacuum and therefore are compared to other suspense / suspense / horror films. Honestly, I'm not writing a long synopsis here and I'll say that this movie tries to rely on music-induced scares rather than atmosphere and the "ghost" itself is not that remarkable. The plot is pretty basic and predictable and it's nothing to write home about either. While there are some suspense scenes that creatively creepy, most of the film is pretty vanilla. If you liked The Grudge and it's not, then you might like it. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
