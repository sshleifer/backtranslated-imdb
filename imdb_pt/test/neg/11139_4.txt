Of Andy Warhol's portraits in the films I Shot Andy Warhol and Basquiat, this is the kind of movie I would predict Andy Warhol could do - airy, illogical, snobby, amoral. The plot of the (almost non-existent) film that is sometimes unbelievably unbelievable is offset by the film's gross and real cinematography. The film has a way of being unreal, but dictating reality to the viewer. The only important part of the film is the development of the relationship between Joe and Holly, and every thing should be seen as a characterization device. There are some comedic scenes that I admit to being funny, but Trash is just about a study of characters from uninteresting people that is mildly enjoyable if you do not mind watching nudity and i.v. drug use.
