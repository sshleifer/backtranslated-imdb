'The Shining' has intelligence, visual talent and an iconic performance by Jack Nicholson. 'Absent', however, has none of these things; though he borrows from his classic ancestor; namely a man passing by a door and a woman running around screaming while holding a huge kitchen knife. Unlike Stanley Kubrick's great psychological horror film, "Absent" is a work that resonates with a singular lack of genius. It is magnificently, comically awful; makes the Spice Girls movie look like a vital work of art. 'Absent' is the story of a family moving to a gated community in the suburbs. It's all about being okay with the world. They will live in peace and tranquility; they will quietly take care of their business, away from those old city streets. But not. The character of Ariadna Gill, Julia, begins to be frightened by those things that insist on hitting the night, in empty supermarkets and closing doors; and her husband, Samuel, played by Jordi Molla, instantly changes from a relaxed family man to a bearded butler to do and with wide eyes, injecting Julia with a drug to keep her under his sudden pleasure. Molla, very respected as an actor, is absolutely terrible at this. Comical, rather than menacing, he just can not express a threatening expression. He has just come across a slime ball in the bar that drinks too much. So, is there anything to redeem this movie? No. The script is clumsy, the plot non-existent and the cast without merit. Completely without tension and full of scary moments now, 'Absent' is an exercise in how not to make a psychological thriller. It's ridiculous and exaggerated, but as one of the most involuntary hymn films of recent years, it's worth watching.
