I really wanted to like this movie. The second film in the series had this silly feeling in the movie, which was fun (of course, I was drunk too). I watched this movie with the highest expectation of a similar experience of high cinematic hilarity, the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I WAS WRONG !!!!! This movie is a tremendous waste of film, and I LIKE THE SECOND ONE !!!! From the effeminate villain to David Bowie's scare wig, to the quarrelsome, unpleasant female villains with laughter who could take ink from the garage door, all this was just a painful mess. I really felt bad for Sue Price because the material was below an actress of her stature (who pretty much says it all). A horrible and terrible movie (this is not a recommendation).
