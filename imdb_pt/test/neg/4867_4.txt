This all looked promising. A rising presidential advisor is framed by a series of murders, as he was warned that a conspiracy is taking place inside the White House. He stars the excellent Donald Sutherland among several capable actors. However, very few people have a good word to say about it. <br /> <br /> The whole thing really needed some depth. You may get the idea that the president is being very leftist with his ideas, and some within the government want him to stop with those ideas. Conrad seems to simply want the country to be governed in its own way rather than the path of the elected leader. <br /> <br /> However, the action scenes had some logical holes - the sewers and elevators already mentioned, and the methods of murder quite casual - and Linda Hamilton's character is completely uninspired. The 'deviation' from the 'my father' president was ridiculous - that would give the president about 10 years when that happened. Worse yet was his predictable final scene with Bishop. <br /> <br /> They could have made a challenging and inventive political thriller, but either they bottled it or they failed. They could have gone to the city in special effects, but the good ones were wasted. They could have achieved much more overall. This was barely worth the Â£ 1 that cost me.
