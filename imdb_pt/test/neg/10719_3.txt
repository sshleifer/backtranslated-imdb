This movie was perhaps one of the most un-original and bland movies I've seen in a very, very long time. To be fair, I was not expecting some revolutionary comic book formula, but I was anticipating at least being entertained. With expectations so low, how could I be disappointed? <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey, possibly my favorite actor (not sarcasm), did little more than tread water on this film. He seems to have temporarily returned to his funny roots and created a character not unlike his Fletcher Reede by Liar Liar. This new character, Dick Harper (also known as Fletcher 2.0), is a poorly written and miserably written puppy. If you see yourself smiling while watching this pitiful and essentially boring character, it is more likely that Carrey is struggling to bring a third dimension to him. Carrey's strange pose becomes humorously clumsy - and, ultimately, sad. <br /> <br /> Tea Leoni as Jane does little more than supply the Abbott to Carrey's Costello. I usually find Tea Leoni refreshing and underused, but not in this case. Jane Harper could have been played easily by any actress from the age of 30 to 45, and it is in this lack of specificity that Jane's character becomes uninteresting to watch. She simply has no defining traits other than following the general theme of the film, which seems to be ... Wait, no, this movie has no theme. Unless you count "Big Business Is Evil" as a theme. I thought this was more than a given. <br /> <br /> Richard Jenkins and Alec Baldwin deliver convincing (though tired) support performances, but neither seems to really invested in the role they are playing. It is very clear that Alec Baldwin was striving so hard to play his role as the sinister C.EO. as he puts on eating a sandwich (which he seems to be doing a lot lately). <br /> <br /> Slightly tangent but Alec Baldwin played any role in the last few years that did not require him to be a powerful idiot in a suit? <br /> <br /> Anyway, take my advice if you have not yet witnessed the horror for yourself: save your money. This is the one to pick up on HBO in a few months. Dick and Jane are present, but there is nothing fun.
