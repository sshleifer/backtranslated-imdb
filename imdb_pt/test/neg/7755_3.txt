This started as a good sketch comedy. The first shows were very good and I was looking forward to a long run. What was really funny was the imitation of Mariah Carey and the takeoff in Beverly Hills 90210 with the hair fight. The heavyweight battle Delta Burke vs. William Conrad was also good. Unfortunately, the following shows were at low speed. The writing became uninspired and as predictable as if the show had acquired a cult following in its young mandate. Nothing new was being offered and the recurring skits were boring. An example is the family of weapons (or whatever it was called) that became a weekly resource. This outline was not so funny to start with, more so to be a regular resource. An example of a quick and promising start of a sudden drop.
