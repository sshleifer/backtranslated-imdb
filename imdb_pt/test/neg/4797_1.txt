I went to see this movie about Matchstick Men, actually buying the tickets for Matchstick Men and going to the other because it looked like a fun movie with action, romance, thrills, jungles and exotic places. They did all this, but made many films with a conception of history. <br /> <br /> All I can say is WHY they did not just make a direct narrative instead of some sentimental flashback story. <br /> <br /> Here are all the movies I've seen the movie was derived from: Sure, Indiana Jones and Romancing the Stone, but also True Lies, Proof of Life, that old 80s Tom Selleck movie , Bananas (Woody Allen), and Hero (from the use of digital extras). <br /> <br /> PS The only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds his room exploded.
