They prove that the police, when they can not find the actual perpetrators, always blame their parents and accuse them of sexual abuse of their children. These films always portray the press as a bunch of animals and cause parents to come out of court to feed the hunger of the press to humiliate suffering. Has anyone ever heard of a back door of the courtroom in these films? Here you have a medium who tells you exactly what happened and where the body can be found, but the police are not told and no one pays attention to their findings. <br /> <br /> Cops are portrayed as idiots who do not. they know what they're doing and there's always an outside detective like Ed Asner, who is late in the case, believes his parents, and solves the mystery. <br /> <br /> In addition, after the parents are released, they do not spit on the faces of the idiot cops who put them in jail, took their son away and accused them of killing their own child. <br /> <br /> It looked like I'd seen this movie MANY times before.
