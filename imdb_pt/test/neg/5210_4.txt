Director Nico Mastorakis has created a cynical cynicism (by his own admission) that is too cynical to impress anyone but a sophomore fan. <br /> <br /> The most extreme, confronting gender pictures, to paraphrase a character in VIDEODROME, "have a philosophy"; that's what makes them dangerous. <br /> <br /> The philosophy of the ISLAND OF DEATH is to play many "shocking" elements in a cinematic mix and move slowly. The result is a dish with no taste, but with an ugly appearance. <br /> <br /> Do not confuse with the brilliant Sawbreaker WHO COULD KILL A SON? (sometimes called ISLAND OF DEATH), Mastorakis's effort is mounted on a Greek island that is the scene of various forms of slaughter, a bit of bestiality and some pervasive generalization. <br /> <br /> Everything moves in a sinuous rhythm and violent pieces are misdirected. Announced as "The movie that the censors did not want you to see," I would venture a hunch that the censors never saw it, they simply read the presskit until their knees pulled up.
