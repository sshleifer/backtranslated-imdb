This movie, which is a "Life in the Fast Lane", is easily one of the less fun movies I've seen in a long time. I think this was done in the minds of women who are sick, twisted and tired who represent about .00000001 of the population in the United States. The characters are all one-dimensional, even the lead. After she stabs her boyfriend in the head with scissors, a cheap (and unsuccessful) chuckling is tried by stuffing a cork into her boyfriend's skull to stop the bleeding. Ah, smart! Patrick Dempsey (whose films are almost always an act of class - sarcasm) interprets this "demon" that changes his life - but from what we have seen, his life was a series of stickers to begin with. No emotion, no laughter, no story. The only reason I give Note 2 is that Jeffrey Jones is fine as a priest and there is a bit of style (zero substance) in the camera work. Otherwise one of the 5 worst movies I've ever seen. Grade 2 of 10 AN F! I think even the most drugged junkie would laugh at a toilet seat would not have liked that movie. I can not emphasize enough how far you should stay away. <br /> <br />
