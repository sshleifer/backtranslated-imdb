Bugsy Siegel was 31 when he went to the west coast. In addition to his dreams about Las Vegas, he joked about acting. He was a handsome guy and about 7 years younger than his friend George Raft, so it was not such a crazy idea. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty was 54 when he made this film and despite the hair dye he is too old for that part. Beatty was miscast; Bugsy should have been played by someone like Alec Baldwin. Bugsy was a tough guy feared by his contemporaries; Beatty simply does not beam a threat. <br /> <br /> This was a vanity project for Beatty, who did not come to terms with the fact that he is no longer a man of leadership. <br /> <br /> The other big problem is Mantegna like George Raft. The raft had a distinctive voice and mannerisms, none of which Mantegna tries to match. You never believed that Mantegna came from the streets. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty and Robert Redford have pretended to be younger for years by the massive use of hair dye, and now it will be a sudden shock. turn gray and touch the character's parts.
