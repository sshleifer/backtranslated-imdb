I did and lost two and a half hours of my life that I could never recover. <br /> <br /> I honestly have no idea what the critics and fans see in this movie. And that's not because I can not appreciate "art". I love a good movie with deep messages, brilliant cinematography and great direction. <br /> <br /> This movie is not one of them. <br /> <br /> My main complaint about this movie is that it's so horribly slow to the point of boring your audience to death. On the other hand, the dialogue sequences pass too quickly and there is not enough exposure to let people who have not read the book know what is happening (My mother took pity on me and explained everything before watching it). Would they have killed them to hire a storyteller? At least for the beginning and the end? <br /> <br /> Let me explain to you: (Spoilers everywhere) <br /> <br /> In the first two minutes you're treated to a black screen without music, waiting for the real movie to the next minute and a half, you will see several pictures of landscapes of savannas and savannas. As the audience could not figure out how to set the scene, unless they saw the shooting set up three or four times. <br /> <br /> The next eleven minutes are occupied with the monkeys grunting. They fight, they see the monolith, they fight a little more, they attack things with a bone. Supposedly they are prehistoric men whose evolution is being influenced by the singing of the monolith. Not that you could tell if you did not read the book. <br /> <br /> * Finally * we enter space. Only to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships, slowly turning to the Waltz of the Blue Danube (a waltz very fast and rhythmic as I understand, but here it seems absolutely agonizing). Finally, we succeeded in achieving an innocuous dialogue and an enigmatic exposition of the government, which did not allow people to land on the moon. We were wondering about this for another 14 minutes of Blue Danube and wiring ships and camera tricks with anti-gravity. <br /> <br /> Next come four minutes of watching a ship travel on the surface of the moon and dock at a space station. We have a bit more exposure in a scene from the meeting room that follows. So we went back out traveling in the rhythm of a snail on the moon. A second monolith is revealed, again filling our ears with that awful touch (I had no idea it was a real piece of music!). The monolith does its little show of lights and then the plot jumps forward. <br /> <br /> Seven minutes of observation from the ship to Jupiter to travel. By now my brain had turned into mush. Could it be moving more slowly? It may be "realistic" to portray it as such, but we still do not need to see five or six different images of the same thing to understand the concept of its "realism." Let me talk about this "realism"; I applauded when the astronaut's secondary character died. Not because I'm a sadist and I like to see people die, but because after five minutes I was so annoyed at the sound of their damn breath! I should care about this character, feel when he dies! Instead, I found myself waiting for a happy silence, anyway. <br /> <br /> Anyway, we come to the most interesting part of the movie - the part with HAL. Forget Dave, the protagonist of the woodpecker. The real star of the show is that coldly impersonal, frighteningly ruthless, mercilessly merciless, malicious guy from a computer. He is great. And the sequence "Opening the compartment doors" is wonderful. But it's too short. And it was not long before the director once again got involved in very long things. <br /> <br /> Four minutes to HAL die. And he dies. Slowly, painfully, losing his intelligence every minute, his voice getting slower and slower, singing "Daisy, Daisy," all with a low, steady whistle that becomes as annoying as heavy breathing. <br /> <br /> Seven minutes of flying colors as Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I could feel my brain melting and dripping from my ears! Seven whole minutes of absolutely nothing, except one guy killed the psychedelic version of space travel, again with that accursed chorus! We have the idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why drag it so long? Unless he wanted LSD users to become psychotic and have flashbacks. <br /> <br /> I will not even try to explain the ending, mainly because I did not quite understand. Supposedly he is in an alien research lab and they are teaching him deep and deep things as he observes getting older and older and then they send him back to Earth as some kind of baby from the celestial space cosmic. None of this appears in the film. For all you know, it's just a sequence of images without purpose or plot. Much of the movie went like this. <br /> <br /> The first time I tried to watch this movie, I gave up in half. The second time I suffered with this painful excuse for a movie was to help my sister evaluate the sequences to see how long they lasted. It's so boring. <br /> <br /> Call this crummy "art" movie if you wish. I would not do. I saw more interesting "art" in the local museum. And I'm never again undergoing such suffering.
