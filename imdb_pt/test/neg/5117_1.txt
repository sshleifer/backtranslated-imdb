What can you say about a movie that makes "The Erotic Witch Project" look like "The English Patient"? Once again, the plot and the characters are secondary, but the plot is almost an exact copy of "TEWP". <br /> <br /> Four sisters of the buxom brotherhood and a male goofy guide enter a forest to look for the naked girl, and the women become sexually charged. The naked girl leaves porn and an inflatable doll, as in "TEWP". They get lost, the idiot gets lost and the girls come back to the hotel. There they re-enact the end of "The Blair Witch Project" while cameras are played and the guide is seen playing hopscotch, an essential game for the skinny plot. <br /> <br /> At least three of the sister sisters here have abnormally large breasts full of dimples and stretch marks, along with fairly obvious surgical scars. The only "natural" girl here is humiliated by the director. In a very unsightly and endless credit segment, the shopping scenes in which she could not hit a line are repeated several times ad nauseum. <br /> <br /> Julie Strain appears with a scared wig to play naked girl. This scene seems to be added later as no one could be credited with casting. In the background, while the women move and knock, you can see the fence of someone. This may be the backyard of director Jim Wynorski. <br /> <br /> That's just a bad thing. The lesbian love scenes are kelvin degrees colder than "The Erotic Design of the Witch". Most of the love consists of four women crushing their eight collective breasts together. I think they are trying to form a silicone-based way of life that would rescue them. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then the creators of "The Blair Witch Project" must be really crazy. <br /> <br /> This is not evaluated, and contains physical violence, strong profanity, female nudity, sexual content and sexual references. <br /> <br />
