Sad in every way, this poor excuse for an increase in Connery's career was not even the success Warner wanted it to be. For 20 minutes and full of embarrassing moments for everyone involved, this movie and "Robocop 2" is proof that Irvin Kershner had no real control over "The Empire Strikes Back". Connery had not been a success since he walked away from Bond in 1971, but that did not bring him back. "Octopussy" was released several months before this movie, and easily surpassed it. Imagine this - a Roger Moore Bond not only better than a simultaneous release of Connery, but surpassing it (and compared to "Never ...", "Octopussy" is at the same level as "2001". <br /> < (as the worst example being that ridiculous video game sequence - MY GOD - WHO CARES ?!), and even worse than "The Golden Gun Man", senseless scenes that creep nonsense. and the most outrageous collection of "No Girls Talent" in the legendary "Bond Girls." Someone SERIOUS think Kim Basinger is attractive in this movie? There were girls in my school who never got dates that looked better than her in that. Barbara Carrera - just plain stupid - but the way Kershner guided her to walk all the time did not help her, she is the molt that would become the impressive "Onatop", which was the best feature of "GoldenEye," but that means nothing while you fight laboriously for this movie. "Casting Leit The fact that a black agent is such an excellent idea, but the interaction between friends and Connery must be very bad. Two actors have never appeared together so awkwardly - they witness the scene in which, to escape the local authorities, they dress and pretend to be exercising - I can not imagine another scene in any film that has tried so futilely to laugh.
