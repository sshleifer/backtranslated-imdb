I just saw Lonesome Dove, Return To Lonesome Dove, Streets Of Laredo And Dead Man's Walk. All excellent. This piece of junk is cheap and poorly represented. <br /> <br /> In the previous series, Captain Call and Gus McCrae came out with respectable cowboys. Despite the fact that Caption Call is played by a different actor every time they quickly conquered me. In Dead Man's Walk, boys are credible as the younger versions of experienced Texas guards. At Comanche Moon they are just a couple of plump country boys. I had to stop watching. <br /> <br /> I suspect that many of the brilliant critiques for this show were written by the people who made this smelly pile. It's a sad end to an otherwise great franchise.
