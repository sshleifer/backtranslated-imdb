Horror comedy fans will like this one. Others may get upset quickly and turn it off. It's kind of a movie of friends, with exaggerated violence and gore, deliberately stereotyped characters and a lot of craziness. <br /> <br /> It seems to have been made with a budget of about $ 100, for a bunch of frat guys after a big beer party on tap. There is a leader who is a frustrated nerd, and his talkative friend who mocks him about 30 times a second. There is a monster truck chasing them for hundreds of miles, which is the highlight of the movie. Whenever this thing and its driver wearing deformed mask appear, it is a great scene. There is a mysterious girl who appears randomly in her backseat, and many giant guys in overalls hanging from red bars around her neck. The nerd's friend never shut up and puts them in a mess after another. His argument got on my nerves, but other aspects of the movie make up for it. <br /> <br /> The gags of the vision mocking of several films of "psychoassay and try to criticize someone" are everywhere. Choose which one is most riffed: Hills Have Eyes, Saw and Jeepers Creepers were some that I recognized. <br /> <br /> It's nice insanity if you're in the right frame of mind. Sensory-blending brewskies with your friends can make viewing this one more fun; It is a good bet that it is the condition of filmmakers when they put this thing together.
