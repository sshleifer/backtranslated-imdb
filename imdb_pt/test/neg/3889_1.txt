Days of Heaven is one of the most painfully boring and nonsensical movies I've ever seen. By no means, shape or form would I recommend it to anyone ... unless you're trying to get your kids to sleep or, God forbid, give someone an aneurysm. If I could go back in time and do something, I'd set the rollers on fire before being sent to theaters. Because? The plot of Days of Heaven is simple, but extremely vague. Long sequences without dialogue make up much of the film. The characters are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate. The climax of the story does not touch you: by now your brain worked so hard to discover the plot and set of hidden metaphors that your ability to think is gone. The only things that work are her eyes and, unfortunately, her ears, that must hear the sound of Linda, the little girl in the story, who speaks like a man. Now I'm dumber to see this movie. Do not let this happen to you.
