SILVER CITY (2+ outta 5 stars) As a big fan of John Sayles' work for many years now I feel safe to say that this is the worst movie he has ever done. That said, the movie is not exactly * awful * ... just uninspired. Sayles plays on familiar elements of his previous films (corrupt politics, illegal immigration, selling juvenile ideals), but fails to reunite them in any new or meaningful way. Even the dialogue (usually Sayles' strong point) is disappointing this time around .. sounding clichéd and forced in almost every scene. The movie looks and sounds like episodes from a TV series that did not go beyond the third episode. There are tons of big stars on hand ... and they try their best to make their little parts come alive ... but the stuff just is not there this time. While filming a campaign, a hopeful governor (a poor and obvious substitute for George W. Bush) fishes a dead body in a lake. An investigator is hired to try to alienate people who may have deliberately set this up to discredit the candidate ... but he soon discovers that there are deeper and more obscure (and more cliché) secrets to be discovered. Sayles made films with much better similar themes in the past ("Lone Star", "Matewan", "Return of the Secaucus Seven", "Men With Guns"). It's a shame he went to the well once more and came with contaminated water. A good phrase, spoken by Richard Dreyfuss: "Danny, you're a loser, this has been established without a shadow of a doubt, so try to be good, okay?"
