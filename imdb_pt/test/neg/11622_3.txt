The plot outline for this movie is similar to the original. Someone is kidnapped, the prince is incestado to save her, Odet turns into a swan, the turtle / toad / parrot first the "bad" mage in the best possible way, and in the end ... In any case, there is not much novelty Here. Except for the lack of well-known voice talents. Sorry, neither Palance nor Cleese and therefore Jean-Bob was a disappointment.
