Seriously ... I'm impressed by the good feedback that this show has here. All we have in this show are two stupid kids who get a lot laughing and do funny things on only 2 of the shows, while most of the others suck ... so they comment on music videos that I can not stand in person while they love or like . <br /> <br /> In most episodes, the only things you will hear are the recurring "let's score points with some puppies," or "I'll kick your beavis ass", or the best yet and usually used quote "that was cool," and most of all, his irritating laughter. <br /> <br /> If you want a good animated show, try The Simpsons, Ren and Stimpy, South Park, this show is not worth the time or energy to watch this real MTV show.
