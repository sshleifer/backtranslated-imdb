I had the dubious opportunity to see this movie on TV. It's the perfect example of how to get a terrible script and turn it into one of the worst movies ever made. Not only is the acting bad and the terrible effects, the film has more logical flaws than ten pounds of imported Swiss cheese. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie as an example of how NOT to make a movie and which director does not use in one of theirs. <br /> <br /> I turned off the TV in the last ten heady minutes of the program. Calling it "pathetic" is a gross understatement.
