Solo begins when a team of American soldiers enters Soth America to blow up a rebel airstrip, joining them a robot named Solo (Mario Van Peebles) who can use any weapon already made, is fifteen times stronger and ten times as much faster than any human being. Something is wrong and Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians that Colonel Frank Madden (William Sadler) is not happy, back to base and General Haynes (Barry Corbin) orders that Solo be closed and rescheduled. One of Solo's main directives is self-preservation, so he decides to flee back to the jungles of South America, where Colonel Madden and his men are sent to recapture him ... This co-production Mexican-American was directed by Norberto Barba and one has to say Solo is horrible. David Corley's script was based on Robert Mason's novel 'Weapon' and is a clich√© after the other, robots were popular at the time the ground was made in Hollywood and the box office, so Solo steals the likes of Robocop ( 1987), Universal Soldier (1992) and the two Terminator films, in addition to having the same basic configuration and story of Predator (1987). This is the usual rubbish about an emotionless robot that grows the sense of humanity by being close to people, at first he does not know what a joke is or why one person cares for another, but in the end he develops emotions and begins to make friends, it sounds like Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) to me. The characters are poor and Colonel Madden in particular has absolutely no motivation to hate Solo and why he would kill other American soldiers and disobey orders to destroy him. You know I saw this on cable TV last night for free (thank God I did not spend money on that) and I looked up at the TV guide and you know what I said? My TV guide described Solo as a "terrible science fiction action starring Mario Van Peebels" which, when I think about it, is a perfect description of Solo. In less than ten words my TV guide hit the head, I mean it's a science fiction movie, it sure is starring Mario Van Peebles and it's definitely terrible. Enough said really. Director Beard does not do anything particularly special here and the action scenes have no real excitement and the sci-fi elements are virtually nonexistent beyond the fact that Solo is a robot. So the military misses Solo and Colonel Madden is sent to recapture him, right? I'm not being funny, but would not the military have put a 'self-destruct' mechanism inside the Ground if something like that happened? Surely, at the very least, would Solo have a tracking device inside him so the military would at least know where he was at any moment? I'm not being funny, but these people can get to a walking robotic talking soldier, but are they not smart enough to realize that a tracking or self-destruct device can be useful if something went wrong? The violence is light, there are some OK fight scenes, but this is really very weak. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film looks good and is done competently, it was actually filmed in Mexico. The creators of the action film Dolph Lundgren, Agent Red (2000) edited footage of Solo in the film. The performance is poor, Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play a robot without emotion ... William Sadler deserves more than that, it was only a few years before he was looking for the fantastic Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990). Solo is a really lousy science fiction film that is basically a big scam of Hollywood sci-fi films like the Robocop movies, Universal Soldier and Terminator. I do not recommend it and I'll start paying more attention to my TV guide when it comes to choosing movies to watch ...
