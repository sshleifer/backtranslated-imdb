Ah! I just said that the "classic" movie has a storyline that catches the eye! Well, it's true, so get over it! This film was a vanity project for Joseph P. Kennedy in which his mistress starred and money flowed to make her an even bigger star. Today, only a fragmentary copy exists - one that was retouched a few years ago. However, even if the film was in perfect shape, STILL would have broken for many reasons. And, without further ado, here are some of my reasons: First, Gloria Swanson, 31, plays a girl in a convent school - maybe 16 or 18! Come on - she seems to be old enough to be the mother of many children. <br /> <br /> Second, the film is based on the stupid concept of "love at first sight." While some people believe this, it is ridiculous to believe that a prince would throw everything into a woman he did not even know! How silly! <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film is histrionic and the plot is crazy! After leaving school, Kelly goes to East Africa and then becomes "Queen of prostitutes" - and later, after the evil queen back to Europe dies (this is convenient), the prince manages to get out of prison. Kelly and marry her and she then becomes the queen of a true honest-to-kind country! Give me some time - this is RIDICULOUS, even on silent movie days this plot was a moan! <br /> <br /> So in summary, this is a bad movie with great production values ​​(lovers need to LOOK WELL) that is parading like a classic! There are so many BEST silent films out there - see them first and avoid this nonsense.
