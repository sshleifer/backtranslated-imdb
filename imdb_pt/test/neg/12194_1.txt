Just what is the purpose of this film? It starts out as a movie, changes the track, deceives us with a resolution for that movie and ends up as another movie that is nothing more than a pale and pale imitation of so many other horror movies you've seen. The overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of arrogance. Tarantino's script, directed by Rodriguez, two guys who have already shown talent but who now seem to believe in their own hype and assume that whatever they do should be good simply because they did it. But it does not work that well. You're only good while you're still doing good things. There are so many questions to ask: What are George Clooney and Harvey Keitel doing to get involved in such a pointless point? Clooney initially makes an intriguing villain ?? totally relentless and efficient? and it would have been interesting to see where this was going. But, of course, we never do. And Clooney from the vampire movie changes to a completely different character. This is not clever or witty, it's just bad and bad work. Keitel seems quite sick everywhere, and no wonder. Did anyone in the studio take a look at the script before this project was released? Tarantino is utterly unpleasant as a sexual deviant killer (and why he, as a writer, assumed that we would find rape, murder repulsive, and the death of a funny harmless hostage). At all levels? except the technician? This movie stinks. Avoid.
