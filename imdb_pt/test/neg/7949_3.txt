Why redo the original "Assault"? To my mind, "Assault" was Carpenter's real masterpiece. He had all the elements that good Carpenter films contain. External threat in a small group of individuals. People take up the challenge because they are forced to do so. Isolation! Just remember, the guns in Carpenter's original made no sound, so much more threatening than conventional devices. And now this remake. Focusing on the psychology of the "main character" and his relationship with the main character II (evil, but honorable). The anonymous threat in Carpenter's film was replaced by a rather conventional conspiracy / corruption fund. The "rowers" simply did not understand the main plot of the original. And so it produced something very common.
