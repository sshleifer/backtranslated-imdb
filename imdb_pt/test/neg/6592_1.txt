You may suspect that the plot of this movie was written in the filming process. It starts as a "punks versus vigilante" movie, but in the middle of the movie, the plot changes abruptly when the vigilante becomes an honest man with his honest girl and his honest academy and has to fight against the corrupt "businessmen". Want to turn off the gym at any cost to build a mall or something. So the plot changes again, and we forget the corrupt guys. The villain is now the friend of the protagonist, who thinks he is a ninja. The guy becomes "crazy bad" and wants at any cost to win a Martial Arts Contest. Watching this movie is like having a nightmare with the television on.
