By the mid-1990s, the career of animation director Don Bluth seemed to have dropped to his all-time low. Before, Bluth had made a number of popular animated films, many of which are still being loved today, such as "The Land Before Time" (1988), "The Secret of NIMH" (1982) and "An American Tail" ). But beginning with "Thumbelina" in 1994, his films seemed to decline more and more in quality and popularity and one of the many unfortunate inscriptions is the 1995 box-office hit "Pebble and the Penguin," a film that did not attract audience members. as well as parents and children under the age of seven. Frankly, the latter are the only members of the audience that I can understand by taking advantage of this rather bland animation feature. <br /> <br /> The story is absurd. The film stars a grumpy, stuttering, stuttering penguin named Hubie (dubbed by Martin Short), who falls in love with a penguin with a surprisingly healthy flower on his head (Annie Golden's voice). As in real life, the penguins present their bride-to-bes with a pebble as a substitute for a ring. But when Hubie is dragged by the current, he joins a lonely rockhopper (James Belushi) with a dream of flying and they run up against time to return to Antarctica before it's too late. The reasons why they may be too late is one of the many underdeveloped elements of this weak story that would still be weak, even if they were there. <br /> <br /> It becomes very clear from very early on why this animated children's musical does not and will not work for anyone older than say six or seven years old. It simply does not have any of the qualities needed for a good animation feature. Number one, the movie looks bad because of a really bad design style. The animation of this film is very caricatured (even with regard to animated films); it is dark, dark, there is no vibration in the colors, and moreover, the design of the film and the elements in it are universally fun and laughable. Take for example, the penguins who star in the film. With just a few exceptions, each penguin looks absolutely nothing like a bird. Hubie, for example, seems absurdly ridiculous with his broad cheeks, a squat beak, big eyes, and that absurd hat he wears wherever he goes. Combined with his hands-like "flippers," he looks like Chris Farley in a penguin suit. Outcome: He is an ugly and poorly designed cartoon character. But the most absurdly absurdly designed character is the evil penguin, Drake, who frankly looks nothing like a penguin. He is a muscular man wearing a penguin mask. It has a breast wider than Arnold Schwarzenegger's, and teeth larger than the teeth of leopard seals and killer whales that serve as predators of the film. Basically, he's a two-dimensional, recycled villain. He lives in a skull-shaped cave, wears a cape, laughs a lot, and gets angry when people laugh at him. Outcome: who cares? And what is also bad, and perhaps worse, is that this is an animated musical and there is not a single memorable or memorable song to be found anywhere within its runtime. The opening hymn was not harmless but harmless. But after that, the songs became duller and dull and there was one in particular that made me grimace all the time. It is the moment when viewers press the fast forward button whenever it appears. <br /> <br /> I felt "The Pebble and the Penguin" everywhere, except for the few moments when Hubie and the Rockhopper Rockhopper Penguin is endangered in the jaws of leopard seals and killer whales who, fortunately, have no dialogue and are treated like animals instead of cartoon characters. But in a way, for this reason, I can not wholeheartedly recommend this movie to children. This is the reason. The film shows that killer whales are the natural predator of penguins. My concern is that children familiar with "Free Willy" (1993) may be offended or discouraged to see their favorite sea-dwelling portrayed as a bloodthirsty carnivore. The leopard seal was a better antagonist, and it was funnier to watch his jaws open wider than a rattlesnake, and how he seemed to smile as he growled. But the point really is, those moments with the predators - and there are only a few - are the only interesting moments. And they're not very interesting, remember. <br /> <br /> In short, I can not recommend this to anyone under the age of seven. My advice: if you have kids around, rent them for them. They can have fun.
