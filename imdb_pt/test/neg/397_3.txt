This show was shown in an early morning time on SPACE, a science fiction cable station. It surprises me that someone pays for it or transmits it; is incredibly amateurish. <br /> <br /> The whole show is a sequence of little monologues or scenes performed on a set that looks like a cabinet with a lot of circuit boards attached to the wall. There is very little continuity between scenes and no plot. A typical scene revolves around some joke or special effect and is only a minute or more. The dialog box makes little sense and special effects look like Photoshop filters. The actors are all adults, but I've seen literally high school plays with better writing and series. This program is a constraint. <br /> <br /> Maybe each scene will work as an interstitial; a fill between shows rather than commercials. Tying all the scenes together makes the limitations of the material extremely obvious.
