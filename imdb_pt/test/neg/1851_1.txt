If you are planning on going see this movie then my advice is - no. <br /> <br /> For me, the film failed to make the grade at all levels and was a reminder of how awful most British (and Irish) movies are. Unforgettable gut is the best I can say. If he had been on television, he would have gone out to do something more interesting five minutes after the start. I watched this movie with a group of friends and, after reading the previews of the press, I was prepared not to be critical and hopefully go through 90 fun minutes. But oh dear ... <br /> <br /> As a comedy was not funny, as a thriller the stupid story was sloppy and lazy. Like a totally unbelievable love story. Above all, as a piece of 'gloriously over the whim' lacked both style and charm. Gambon and Caine did what they needed to earn their money playing er ..... Gambon and Caine. It's just me, but besides playing gangsters from the east and taking the kids, Michael Caine makes you cold? To be fair, some of my friends thought it was 'okay', but if you go, my advice is to take some drinks (or puffs) beforehand and leave your critical faculties safely locked at home. <br /> <br />
