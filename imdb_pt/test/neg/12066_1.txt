NOTICE!!! SOME POSSIBLE PLANNING SPOILERS AS POSSIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> Okay, if you have not figured out the plot yet, I'll give it to you. Two couples go out to a camp site, but a masked clown appears and causes all kinds of chaos. <br /> <br /> Now it's time to give some advice to these couples. <br /> <br /> 1. Never, never go to Camp dubbed Camp Blood by locals. 2. Do not have sex or do not stand in front of the killer. 3. Do not go after the killer if he runs away. 4. Do not shout profanity at the killer. 5. Make sure your cell phone works before you go camping. 6. Everyone needs to bring a sharp or dangerous weapon and carry it at all times. 7. Wear loose, comfortable clothing and wear a good pair of sneakers. No tight and bonding attire and no high heels or sandals. 8. Wear glasses or contact lenses if you need, so as not to stab the wrong person. 9. Always carry your car keys on you. 10. Erase a fire when you go to sleep. 11. Watch your step. If you stumble into something, it will break a bone. 12. Check the rear seat for unwanted tips. 13. If the killer has you cornered, at least have a fight. <br /> <br /> And guess what? At least one, but generally all four main characters break all these common sense rules. They are the dumbest characters that have ever graced a movie. <br /> <br /> Now for a few brief comments. This horror movie was on a very tight budget. So four of the seven or eight actors play more than one role. The performance, writing, direction, sound, lighting, camera work, plotting, editing, etc., are the last of the line. But like the classic movie JACK O, this works out in a bad sooooooooo much fun and exaggerated level fun. So rent it and have fun and laugh. My rating: 5 out of 10.
