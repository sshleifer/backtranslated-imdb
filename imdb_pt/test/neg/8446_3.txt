"Two wildlife photographers are traveling through the Amazon River basin on their last mission, while attempting to capture the area's wildlife in the film, our photographers intersect with an animal hunter, who is chasing the animals for another reason. his illegal activities, the hunter decides? "according to the synopsis of the DVD cover. The handsome Peter Brown (as Jim Pendrake) takes the beautiful blonde Ahna Capri (as Terry Greene) and her handsome brother Tom Simcox (as Art Greene) into the Venezuelan jungle to admire the view, and take photos of the wildlife. After joining the hunter of great hunters William Smith (as Caribbean), psychological dramas appear. <br /> <br /> A crucial scene, with Mr. Brown resting in the "v" of a tree, and sharing a cigarette with Mr. Simcox, is well staged. The circular direction reappears in the later "struggle" between Brown and Mr. Smith; and is effective. Simcox's precocious sex play adds nothing to the story; could have been cut, to take advantage of what seems to flirt between the characters Brown and Simcox. An attraction between Brown and Ms. Capri could have been reproduced as well. <br /> <br /> The song, including Jim Stein's "Love All Things That Love the Sun," is good; but the film needs to be tracked to crop animals that do not appear on the screen. And there's a lot of superfluous material on display. "Piranha" is a case in which less would have been more.
