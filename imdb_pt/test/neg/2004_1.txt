I will not reiterate what many others have said about this film; I will try to add some new points. The Coolio-as-vampire is a nod to fans who are familiar with their turn in Blondie's music "No Exit" in which he takes on the role of a rap vampire (it really works as a musical concept and is in fact a great song). Casper Van Dien is no worse than Brad Pitt and is actually more handsome. And really what does someone go for a Brad Pitt movie apart from eye drops? Even here, although this is poorly filmed (check out "Starship Troopers"). And, of course, Udo Kier, having played Dracula in the movie Morrissey / Warhol, has little more than a special guest. Enjoy if you can.
