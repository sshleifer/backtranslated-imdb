Dr. Chopper begins shortly after the mother of teenager Nicholas (Robert Adamson) died, he is still cut on this, but each cloud has a silver lining and in this case it seems that his mother owns a hut on the lake Tatonka self proclaimed 'friendly place for happy people' that she did not tell him. Then Nicholas, along with his girlfriend Jessica (Chelsey Crisp) and three friends, Jimmy (Butch Hansen), Reese (Chase Hoyt) and Tamara (Ashley McCarthy) go for a fun weekend. Unfortunately things do not go according to plan, the cabin ends up being little more than a shed and its neighbors end up being Dr. Chopper (Ed Brigadier) and his two nurses who go around killing anyone they find to use it. them into horrible experiences ... <br /> <br /> Going straight to the video / DVD Dr. Chopper was edited and directed by Lewis Schoenburn and this movie seems to be having a hard time here in the IMDb with some fairly severe summaries , while I think Dr. Chopper as a horror movie is very useless. I do not think some of the criticisms I read are entirely justified. The script that takes itself very seriously is credited to Ian Holt (whether he likes it or not ...) who has a part in the film as Detective Crocker according to the cast list of IMDb, although I can not remember any character of that name. Maybe he was one of the cops at the beginning? Anyway, the basic story is fine, I suppose, although it's a little dull and lasts for a long time, it's typical fare slasher with some sort of evil character running around pounding our annoying American teenage cast, you know what to do now. In addition to some brief underdeveloped nonsense about Dr. Chopper using body parts to replenish his own deteriorating body, there is not much history here and the script seems to exist just to invent situations for the girls to take off their tops, there are the inevitable sex scenes sequel where some girls have to complete an initiation in a topless brotherhood and there are even some lesbians here too, one of which is seen without their full complement of clothes. Oh and when I say topless I mean they are not wearing tops but they all wear bras so you can keep in mind that there is no full frontal nudity in Dr. Chopper. So you really have, it's a medium story that has a slightly surprising twist in the end that is wasted is filled with stupid characters and cliches that exist just to show off some cheap scenes and girls in bras. To be honest, I expect a little more from my films, but then again, maybe I'm just being picky. <br /> <br /> Director Schoenburn is fine, in fact, this is not the worst-looking movie I've ever seen although it still seems cheap. There is no style here, I do not think it was scary and there is no atmosphere either. The blood is contained and restricted to some corpses and severed limbs, there is nothing new here or any particularly convincing special effect. Dr. Chopper is also one of those films in which the decisions and motivations of the characters are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Technically this is a bit tricky, but it is reasonably well done with what was probably a very low budget, the forest sites are properly insulated, even though the police office looks like the front room of someone and the two nurses' outfits at the beginning look like stripper clothes. The acting is fine, it could be better, but I certainly have seen worse. Dr. Chopper actually relies on a doctor who walks on a helicopter motorcycle, but unfortunately this is not enough to satisfy me, despite being a reasonably competent production lacking any blood, nudity or a Decent plot sinks without a trace.
