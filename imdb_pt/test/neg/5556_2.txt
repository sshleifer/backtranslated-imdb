Okay, I've seen the Hershall Gordon Lewis movies before, but this one really takes the cake, it's really bloody and disgusting, not to mention disgusting as the strippers are made, I'm talking about bad acting that makes the plane 9 from space if look like hamlet, the only saving grace is the late great Henny Youngman as strip club owner, yeah, take my wife ... please. the stripteasers are sexy for 1972, I believe they used that same plot again in Roger Corman's movie; stripped to kill in 1987. I liked the previous HGLewis movie 100 maniacs, which was sort of a mini masterpiece but poor acting, no prizes here but be aware that this is a splatter movie that paved the way for Friday 13, and saw. in a disturbing scene, a half-naked stripper has her ass beaten with a meat softener. Here's a morbid thing. Lewis strikes again. 2 out of 10.
