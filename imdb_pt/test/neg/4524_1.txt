What a sad surprise. Being a diehard fan of the original series (starring Don Adams) I was really looking forward to it. Poor fool me. This is dumber and deadlier than the bottom of a monkey. <br /> <br /> To say that it was bad would be a severe euphemism. It is / was the worst movie (well the first 30 minutes of one) I have seen for a long time. I could not stand more than the first half hour, preferring to watch my hard drive fragment. <br /> <br /> I can tolerate bad ... bad is O.K., sometimes even cute. But with a fucking Hollywood-invented (and this has to be the worst in many years) I will not put it. This movie is a gross insult to the collective intelligence of mankind! My five-year-old daughter could have written better - and she's not even disheartening !!! I'm really tempted to try to watch the rest, but I'm afraid of doing better things ... like making pizza dough and watching it grow. <br /> <br /> What a sad disappointment. No ... I'm out! What fraud! As Mel Brookes once said; "Piece of shirt!"
