After watching Darwin's Nightmare, one must have the impression that Tanzania is a hell, with its almost slave population delivering the best fish to well-fed Europeans, leaving the fish bones to the hungry population. In exchange for the fish, they receive weapons manufactured in the West, which the mainly unemployed population eagerly awaits to use, because being a soldier is their only source of income. <br /> <br /> So, is everything dark with trade as the incarnation of evil and the source of all misery? Not really. Fortunately, Darwin's nightmare shows only the dark sides and completely spares the positives. In fact, the documentary says almost nothing about the economic and ecological importance that victoriaperch has for the region. <br /> <br /> For the countries around Lake Victoria, victoriaperch is the second to third most important source of income. The wages of the fishing industry are well above average. Tanzania has banned huge trawlers to secure the employment of thousands of fishermen. Adjacent states have reached agreements to keep fishing at a sustainable level. The towns on the lake are benefiting from the taxes that fishermen have to pay for every kilogram they fish and taxes on factory exports and profits. In addition, Tanzania has banned the export of traditional local fish, which still plays an important role in feeding the local population. <br /> <br /> By ignoring these positive signs, the documentary dissuades Western consumers and investors and therefore threatens to exacerbate the situation. The situation in Africa. <br /> <br /> For a more detailed reading, I can recommend two articles that the German newspaper of the alternative wing wrote on the subject: http://www.taz.de/en/2006/09/02/a0013. 1 / textdruck http://www.taz.de/en/2005/03/17/a0151.1/text
