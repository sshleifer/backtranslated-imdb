Enjoy the opening credits. They are the best thing about this second-class but harmless time-killer, which features reasonable performances from the likes of Eric Roberts and Martin Kove. The main part, however, goes to newcomer Tommy Lee Thomas, who seems a little diminutive for this type of action, but who nonetheless occasionally manages to design a kind of bizarre-cocky belligerence. The first time we see him, he is bare-chested, sweaty and engaged in this favorite activity of beefcake - chopping wood. After that, he has seven more shirtless scenes, including one in which he is hanged by his wrists and hit with electricity to Mel Gibson in "Lethal Weapon." He could use a better script, however, since the way he exposes the truth about corruption and violence within the prison is never very convincing. There are also millions of dollars in conversations that are apparently linked to this research, but never explained. There are some advantages, though. Sending "John Woodrow" disguised as "John Wilson" is fun in a presidential name, and co-star Jody (Ross) Nolan looks promising as a prisoner who, at the beginning of the process, is shown hanged by his wrists and carried by punches by a corpulent guard. One final note: the film's low budget is painfully responsible for the lack of "extras." Despite the impressive size of the prison, it only seems to have about 12 prisoners! For the record, the corpulent, balding guard wearing Jody Nolan as a punching bag is played by Bill Fishback, and the young blond haired guard who manages electric shocks to Tommy Lee Thomas is played by Marc Chenail.
