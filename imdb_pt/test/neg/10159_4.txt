Okay, now I know where all these police / homicide TV shows came from. I believe they can be traced back to this movie. "Scene Of The Crime" looks more like a TV episode or a serial episode. Complete with characters and stock situations - the famous cop who collides with his superiors ... the elderly cop who does not want a job at the table, despite the lack of vision ... the carefree beginner ... the double crossing lady , etc. <br /> <br /> I like many of the actors here, and they do a good job, but overall I found this boring movie because I'm not a fan of the genre. I kept tuning in when they were discussing the case ... something about bookies and informants. And, yes, there was a stripper, played by formerly healthy Gloria DeHaven. What I want to know is: why did she keep calling Van Johnson "Uncle Wiggly"? Uncle Wiggly was not a rabbit? A character from a children's book? What the hell does that have to do with anything? I guess I do not understand the half-hard jargon Film Noir-ish. <br /> <br /> In fact, a lot of the dialogue made me mutter "no one talks like that!" However, I could relate to a scene in which the wife of the policeman (Arlene Dahl), who worries every time she goes to work, realizes that maybe she should not have made her husband the center of her life. Yes, I know this feeling of loving someone so much, being so dependent on them, that there is a constant fear for their safety. So there are moments of truth in this film, under the stylized dialogue and atmosphere that is trying so consciously to be hard and REAL, that it really seems unreal to me. <br /> <br /> A bit of background: film was made when Dore Schary took over MGM from Louis B. Mayer, and began putting an end to the healthy musicals that made MGM so great. Dore Schary was determined to bring more "realism" to the films. I kind of hate Dore Schary. Maybe we can blame him for all the pretentious and dark films being made today, plunging into ugly "truths" about life, focusing (and, in my opinion, helping to perpetuate) the worst of mankind than the best. No longer cheering us on the way the classic films were designed - providing a necessary distraction during the Great Depression and World War II. <br /> <br /> Well, damn it, we still need this kind of distraction today! There is still a lot of depression and a lot of war. And what are people turning to today for when they want to escape? Trashy, cerebral reality of the TV. Many thanks, Dore!
