I was forced to watch 'Changi' last year in Year 10 of Australian History. Looking around the classroom, both classes, all 40 students were almost asleep, all 40 heads on the table whispering to the person next to them. I refuse to believe that, being only 16 years old, which my opinion does not tell, after having studied in World War II, I not only felt ashamed and ashamed when watching this Australian television. I was out of my mind with the terrible effort that this miniseries applied in the use of movie elements. The acting was bad, the script was very inaccurate and the score was horrible. Please do not watch this movie, it's biased and very racist (for the Japanese).
