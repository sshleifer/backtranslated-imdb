When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I really wanted to see it. I thought some of the other director's works were very good, but I must say I was disappointed. The plot involves a young woman living with a widowed father and two his two children. They move to a well-kept community, but not everything is as it seems; a species of Twin Peaks. The woman begins to see, or not, things and people. During the first roll, I had a chance and thought, "Can not that be the whole reason?" Well, the ending ended, or rather, down, and gave us what I felt was a truly weak final act. The sound mix and the quality are excellent. I saw this at a THX Certified Theater and I was impressed ... by the audio and only by the audio. The image is missing substance.
