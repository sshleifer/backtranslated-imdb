Circus could have been much better if they had reduced the number of twists and developed each one better. The film features a very talented cast that usually performs well, however it loses the audience basically everyone back stabbing everyone else and not stabbing them at the same time because they are stabbing someone else and working with ... I missed you? Well, the film is even more confusing clearly written by a first timer writer, has some redeeming qualities, although in the performance especially Famke Janssen shines like Lily, but unfortunately gets a lot of useless screen time just there, doing nothing ..... the dialogue is a bit tacky and the sometimes annoying accents, but still worth watching, if you are fan of any of the actors, especially John and Famke, who receive more time on the screen, remember to watch it with a notebook so you can write who is double crossing that every second ....
