I found this a very disappointing experience! But I've added a better style option similar to the foot of this entry. <br /> <br /> This "Journey of Bliss" is intriguing. There's drama. But it's full of stereo types! <br /> <br /> So, it serves ONLY THE FEELINGS OF JUDGMENT WITHOUT CONCERN WITH TRUE JUSTICE AND JUSTICE AND TRUTH, BEYOND THE BLACK AND WHITE JUDGMENTS THAT FIT THE 30 SECONDS OF "NEWS" NOTICES THAT PREVENT ALL OURS MULTIMEDIA EXPERIENCES bulletins, true or deceptive in such representations! <br /> <br /> It's so EXAGGERATED that it reminds me of the fairy tale of "Little Red Ridinghood"! Consider the innocent young woman without identification crossing borders questioned by a guard but released without any evidence to venture into seeking her 'Romeo' who did not give her an address VERSUS the pathetically inapt substance lack in the hoarse voice of the 'helping hand 'making friends with his unlikely story made by the layer! <br /> <br /> It seems to serve the directors and management team that no one has faith or prays to God, even in their moments of despair! <br /> <br /> So, in those initial settings, he orchestrates and tells a lot of what's to come! A nightmare journey that betrays the essence of substance without fairytale resolution, without truth, integrity or credibility! ... So a turnaround and it's all over. What a disappointment! If you want to see a VERY superior movie that investigates similar themes with MUCH more credibility, with a much more powerful vision, watch Paul Cox / Norman Kaye's 1983 film "Man of Flowers" !!! <br /> <br /> Unlike here, you will NOT be disappointed!
