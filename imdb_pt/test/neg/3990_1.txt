Once again, the posters lied to me. <br /> <br /> The marketing of this film was deeply at odds with the content; 'explosive'? When I read the synopsis of this film, I expected to see a city full of grotesques, all men red and swollen with alcohol, dotted with heroin needles and folded with chronic masturbation; in such "vice of addiction" would come the shaved hero, shining Gabriel. Instead, the movie was the complete opposite of what I was led to expect. The first few minutes of the movie showed us that Middletown is a small place full of poor people doing the best they can, moving around a bit to make ends meet, drinking to forget the pain, or watching fight of cocks (chickens, not penis) to ward off boredom. In other words, the people of the city were desperately ordinary. The only grotesque (deliberate?) In the play was Gabriel, the brainwashed Presbyterian preacher, played by Macfadyen, whose face is so constructed as to suggest a permanent air of bewildered fury. If I were kind, I would suggest that the preacher's voices at Paisley were a spirited comment designed to make us despise Gabriel and his faith. Unfortunately, Brian Kirk is such an inept filmmaker that you quickly despise everyone in the film, leaving the audience worrying over more than eighty minutes of obscure boredom. My only rest from this waste of celluloid was a "guess the accent" game broken with "local spot" rounds. Are we surprised that Gaybo ends up robbing his brother's son and suffocating his father? Of course not; he is a preacher who criticizes the Bible and therefore psychotic. All the people in town look shocked at the end of the movie, but I suspect they just realized what kind of turkey they put their names on. <br /> <br /> The Film and Television Commission of Northern Ireland has a budget to spend, but there are better projects than this weak venture. The only nice thing I can say in favor of this movie is that it managed to replace "Superman Returns" as the worst 2006 movie; a hell of an achievement. <br /> <br /> v1: 20061114 v2: 20080107
