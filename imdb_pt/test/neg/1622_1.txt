There is simply no redeeming quality about this film. Okay, some of the costumes are cool, but they're nothing you can not, let's say, see in Conan's movies. And what about the actor's hair? I can not believe this is part of a series! I'll say one thing about this movie: it was considered bad enough for a satirized fair by the initial cast of MST3K and I suggest to anyone who is curious enough to see how bad this movie is to watch that version of the film for moral support if nothing else.
