Sayles had a very interesting movie on his hands with Silver City, however, somehow got very muddy as he progressed from beginning to end. Chris Cooper did an exceptional job incorporating the essence of his character, a type of Dubya, but he did not get nearly enough time on the screen. Instead, we found ourselves in a commotion with a character who felt less personal, less developed, and generally very confused. The path that this Danny Huston takes us inevitably becomes the downfall of the movie. Many characters are presented to us in such a short time. These characters were randomly involved with the progression of the plot, which became very complicated with each passing minute. Sayles knew what he was creating, I feel like it was not being translated well onto the silver screen. <br /> <br /> Sayles is a master of his craft. His films continue to inspire and evoke thoughts, even if they are not commercial successes. The problem with Silver City is that I think he found himself going too deep with little money or time to explain everything. At the beginning of the film, I had an idea of ​​what was going on, but as more and more characters were introduced, as more and more plot twists tried to occur, I lost the feel of the movie in the end. While the ending was very bright and very dark, I needed more explanation. I think some of the reasons I lost my line of thinking with this movie was due to the cast of Danny Huston as our guide. He was pathetic. I did not see him as a very exciting person to lead us on this adventure. He seemed to go through the motions, but he could not really do much. This was the first fall of Sayles' important film. <br /> <br /> Although I admit that the characters played by Richard Dreyfuss, Miguel Ferrer, James Gammon and Daryl Hannah were interesting, I just needed a better guide to help me understand their roles in this political scandal. Danny Huston just did not cut it for me. Out of the characters, Sayles needed a stronger script. Sometimes I felt that unless I was deeply rooted in the political world, some of the references were well above my head. All the rationale for Silver City was built and the corruption behind it escaped me. I'm a simpleton who loves advanced movies, but this did not make much sense to me. There were several times when I found myself asking, "Why" instead of seeing the whole picture. I felt as if the individual stories were as clear as glass, but the whole picture was dusty and dark at the same time. Sayles needed to focus more on the bigger picture than on smaller issues, which eventually tarnished this film. <br /> <br /> Maybe you got into this movie with the wrong idea. I was hoping to see another version of the primary colors, but instead I saw something less sincere and more technical. Without giving up the finale, I thought the final scene was one of the most beautiful moments in the history of political cinema. The brilliant symbolism stayed in my mind the last two days after watching this movie, while the rest of the movie quickly moved away from my mind. Maybe a second show was better for me, but for some strange reason Silver City just did not click on me. There seemed to be many gaps that were never explained or explained. A set piece is always good with me, but when characters are introduced without explanation, they just lose steam. This was one of those rare occasions. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was really annoyed with this movie. Being very democrat, I wanted to see one side of politics that I did not know and another side that would make you laugh. I wanted to be swallowed up by the world of corporate money and by the Dufus who are elected. I wanted a clever humor framed by the words of George W., but instead all I found was a very confusing story intended for a certain audience of which I will never be a part. Sad, this picture had so many wasted promises. <br /> <br /> Note: ** out of *****
