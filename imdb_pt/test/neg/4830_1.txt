Welcome to the world of Vikram Bhatt, the man who was already successful and had several successes with small actors like KASOOR, RAAZ and also the multi-actor AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA and his film with Aamir GHULAM <br /> < > A sneak peak about these movies are that they are all remakes of Hollywood and some decent ones like what worked <br /> <br /> SPEED is a remake of CELLULAR and that is also terrible <br /> <br /> A look to the stars, we have the salable one, but now out of work Urmila and Sanjay Suri, then we have the failure Aftab, Ashish Chaudhary, Zayed Khan and others. <br /> <br /> The film could be a decent but many thriller problems are The narrative has several captivating scenes like Zayed hijacking a mobile phone company and many others and the stunts are also laughable, while the twists in the end are laughable too. The film also took a long time to reach the cinemas that lose their spark <br /> <br /> The direction is horrible The music is outdated <br /> <br /> Zayed Khan screams, makes faces and tc what he always makes Urmila is good on his part, Sanjay Suri is not so convincing Ashish Chaudhary strives in a negative role and he is fine Aftab is horrible and he makes you laugh in a negative role Surprising the same director gave him his only successful solo KASOOR Sophie is horrible Tanushree is a non-female actress.
