Well, let's be fair. Accompanying a cult classic like Road House is no easy task. Now subtract Swayze from the equation and you will have a monumental task. So with Patrick not on board, whose idea was to follow anyway and make that piece of crap? I'll blame the director who did not even provide 5 minutes of decent footage throughout the movie. I was really shocked that they had Will Patton (Armaggedon) to board. Johnathon Schaech did a good job with the lead, but the writing was atrocious. Discarding her dark brunette (Crystal Mantecon) in the first 5 minutes of the movie made me want to eject it right there. But I stayed with the movie hoping to catch a glimpse of that good-humored humor that worked so well with Double Duel. No such luck. The cover of the DVD is hilarious, they show these two stacked blondes who make a 10-second appearance on the film. Costar Ellen Hollman really puts on decent performance as well. But again, the effort is futile on a piece of garbage and disgrace like that. Has Jake Busey ever been cast for a decent movie? Could not they pull at least a few actors from the first film to some kind of nostalgia treatment? Even one of the old security guards or two, or Jeff Healey for a performance, would have been nice. Get this movie out of your queue right away. -LostFlix
