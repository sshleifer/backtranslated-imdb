Roger Spottiswoode is not the worst director, and did a good job on the underrated sci-fi thriller "The Sixth Day" (aka "The Box Office Downfall of Mr. Schwarzenegger"). However, "Air America" ​​has to be one of your most inept projects. <br /> <br /> It appears as a fusion between drama, comedy and war movie - it's not a very convincing mix. Actually, I thought he was arrogant. Robert Downey Jr. (during his prime) stars as a pilot recruited from a secret CIA organization that operates during Laos in the Vietnam era. Mel Gibson plays his co-pilot and he comes across the knowledge that they are dealing drugs, and which are not. <br /> <br /> The film was released sensationally because it starred two famous faces and Aerosmith re-recorded. the Doors classic "Love Me Two Times" for the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The redoing of the song is pretty bad, which suits the movie.
