Interference begins as unemployed Martin Sanders (Andres Bagg) hears something strange on his phone, he hears a mysterious man talking to a prostitute named Diana and making a date with her. Soon after, Martin reads a local newspaper and sees the front page story about a prostitute being murdered and remembers what he heard. Martin confides to his friends Laura (Virginia Lustig) and Aaron (Oliver Kolker), but they do not believe him. Then, just after the same thing happened again, the phone call, the man, the prostitute and his death reported in the papers. Martin decides he has to find the killer and stop his killing, but who is it? <br /> <br /> This Argentine production that was apparently filmed in just eight days (for so long?) With a budget of about $ 3,000 (why so much?) was written and directed by Sergio Esquenazi and I can not believe in some of the brilliant comments of Interference on IMDb. Out of 195 user reviews as I write this 113 of them rate this bunch of crap 10 out of 10, I'm sorry but there's no way someone should be giving a bad this movie a totally literally perfect count of 10 out of 10. If a Score for a movie about IMDb is fixed, so that's it, I honestly do not believe that if you showed Interferencia to 195 ordinary people that well over 100 of them would rate Interference as being absolutely perfect, not at all on Earth. User comments are also surprisingly positive, all by IMDb users who have written only comments for a movie. The only user (besides me) who actually wrote more than one comment gave him a minimum of 10 which sounds almost right. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but I would bet my life on the fact that most of these positive comments are from fake accounts created just for that big crap. Where do I start? How on Earth can I adequately describe how bad Interference is? The plot is a mess that basically lives or dies for terrible twists while most twists turn a plot in your head and change the perspective of everything that happened before an intelligent and relevant way and are genuine surprises here in Interferences the twists the first half of the movie and makes it absolutely useless in a kind of 'this really did not happen' and the distortion is so poorly managed that it lets you ask more questions than answers. What made Martin mad? Why did he imagine the phone calls? Why did he imagine a murderer? Why did he picture the headlines? No explanation is given for Martin's behavior during the first hour or so of the film, there is just this absurd revelation that everything was in his mind and that's it, that's all the exposure that exists. So there's a twist in the story about Martin's missing wife and his lover before Martin, for unexplained reasons, starts killing his friends for no apparent reason. I'm sorry, but Interferencia is so bad, it's so annoying, it's so poorly written and thought that I honestly can not think of anything positive to say about it. Sorry man, but that's how I feel, simply Interferencia is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and it's a complete mess conceptually and technically. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb Interferencia was hot in just eight days to be honest, it does not look like any of that. No, it looks like it was filmed in five days! The whole movie is a monstrosity, Interferencia has probably the worst night shot I've ever seen. It's as if no attempt has been made to illuminate the scenes, it's as if the creators had just entered a dark room or the basement or something else and simply filmed the scene, regardless of whether you could see anything. The outdoor scenes during the day have this horrible and unnatural blue green tone to them for no apparent reason which just seems dizzy and becomes increasingly irritating. This strange hue is not repeated in inner scenes, so they are also quite shocking and noticeable. There is no real horror or fear, in fact I would say that Interferencia is more of a thriller than a horror. As far as gore goes there, there are two decapitated heads in a refrigerator, a knife is stuck in someone's mouth and nothing else. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, did she have a budget of about $ 3,000 that makes Interferencia one of the lowest budget movies ever commercially released? Some people think that just because a movie is low budget all reasonable viewing standards should come out of the window and we should accept any old, wrong crap! To watch this on DVD you will still have to pay good money and I personally think we have the right to expect some kind of good product. If it can be released and praised as if it were Oscar-worthy, we can all release our filming for the end of the year (including embarrassing karaoke scenes and scenes of total darkness as we forget to take off the lens cap) and win prizes at the next Cannes Film Festival! The acting is horrible, although the female protagonist Virginia Lustig is really sexy and helps ease the pain of the last twenty-odd minutes, since it shows a little. <br /> <br /> Interference is an absolutely terrible movie, seriously beg you do not be fooled by all the false positive comments, there is no way someone is not involved in it or have some kind of agenda that gives you 9 or 10 of 10. An amateur mess that's really horrible to sit through. Sorry, but that's how I see it, sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind ... you've been warned!
