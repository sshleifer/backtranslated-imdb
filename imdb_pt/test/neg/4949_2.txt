I was watching a Forensic Files marathon on Court TV. The episode was identical to the plot of this movie, to the secret of incest and the case-with-sister subplot. I do not remember any warnings based on a true story, but the case has written MOW everywhere. Apparently, it tells the true murder of Ruby Morris by her husband Earl, sentenced to 25 years in prison for his murder. Just to show you, the truth may be stranger than fiction, because I thought the plot of life was invented and more than "a stretch" as far as credibility goes. I'm with the other posters that said the acting was bad. I did not realize this with all the players, though. It was really the main character, the daughter, whose performance was poor.
