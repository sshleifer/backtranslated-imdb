This is the worst movie I've ever seen, so bad it's amazing. I'm glad I never saw that black helper in any other movie: OK, it was not his fault that someone gave him these lines, but he could have turned down the role and tried to learn how to act instead. How did someone get the money to ride this movie? Is there a Hollywood corporation that handles junk for male college students without a brain? "Oh yeah, they're going to love this: there's no plausible plot, some Kung Fu moves, Chuck Norris, a black helper with bad lines, a little Israeli beater (or is he an Arab or does anyone care?) And the devil ". Brilliant, and thank you to all concerned for enriching the human race.
