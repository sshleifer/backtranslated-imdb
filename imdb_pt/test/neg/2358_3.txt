If I had no expectation of this film, he could have received a 5 or 6. As it stands, I give him 3. The acting is bad, the factual accuracy of the drugs he discusses is lacking, and I do not feel any empathy for characters. <br /> <br /> I watched 'Adam & Paul' right before watching this movie, and I laughed and cried on several occasions. This movie has not reached a similar chord. The directors of 'Human Trafficking' may have some awkward ecstasy experience, but there is no demonstration of actual semantic knowledge related to the drug here. In fact, I find the struggle to make current drug laws less politically oriented is offensive and counterproductive. <br /> <br /> Watch 'Requiem for a Dream' if what you are looking for is an amazing touching movie. on drugs.
