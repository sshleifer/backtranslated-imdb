regardless of what someone says, it's a b movie, and the effects are poorly done .. if you're a fanatical vampire, I suppose it would be OK, not 10 out of 10, you guys here can not honestly say that. we should see this as a movie, not read as a book, then the effects and characters are important, just like the story. The story is good but does not carry the movie, no wonder it has a low rating. I write this because I chose to see this movie when I saw some good reviews here on IMDb, but I was very disappointed. do not get me wrong, I found the movies with amazing blades, and I loved the movies from the underworld, but these characters are not forthcoming. vampire makeup is poorly made and the effects are worse. This sucks. I could not have been so disappointed if I had not read reviews here that told me how great it was. the reviewers must have something to do with the producer or something, seriously, if you think this is incredible, you do not mind acting or making up. This is better as a book. 3 out of 10 for an OK story ..
