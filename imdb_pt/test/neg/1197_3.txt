According to the synopsis on the back of the DVD case; Jonothan Ross 'laughed until a little wee left'. I suspect it has more to do with being full of it. <br /> <br /> I've never watched the series for one reason or another, so maybe I'm missing out on some essential tips. About this movie; I watched the first 45 minutes or so. I laughed once, smiled once, then picked up the newspaper while I waited for something more fun to happen. Nothing did. <br /> <br /> Evidently destined to be a surreal parody about life in the post-Python style, gross humor, this falls absolutely flat. There has been a comedy series on television in the last few years, not least of which were 'Bottom', 'The Fast Show' 'Dibley's Vicar' and 'Father Ted', each involving a bunch of bizarre but characters and sketches hilarious. Any of these could knock that shit out of an armed hat. <br /> <br /> If the series were similar to this movie; I'm surprised they got the funding. Fortunately, it was one of those Â£ 2 Tesco purchases and is now in the local charity shop. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is; Do not believe the experts, never pay more.
