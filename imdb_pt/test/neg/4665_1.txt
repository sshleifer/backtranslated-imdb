This movie has bad writing and bad editing. It's hard to follow what's happening because nothing that any of the characters make makes a lot of sense. Some major calamity occurs every 30 seconds. As a result, none of the "action" sequences are interesting. The film has two hours of "play out" scenes that are connected only by the fact that they share common actors. This movie does not have enough sense of humor to be a good "bad" movie.
