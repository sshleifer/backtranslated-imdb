the hills have eyes that are not a great movie for any stretch of the imagination. For one, the villains seem almost normal, not what one would have expected the crazed madmen to look like. for another, the pace is very slow at times and there are many scenes of the characters repeating themselves. By that, I mean there is a lot of work in the movie, with a lot of rushing aimlessly. The film did not have a clear direction. The plot of the film is not original, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre came out a few years ago and is a far more effective film in regards to horror. The film has little to do with scares, and the vibrant soundtrack served only to grate and distract everyone. once, suppose that the song was used to cover up the fact that little happens in much of the film, although it failed in its purpose. Basically, I kept looking at the time every few seconds waiting for something to happen or to end. when something finally happened some promis The movie had been ruined by mere chaos and loud noise. I sat through it because I like to give a movie the benefit of the doubt. Yes, there are some loud shouts, but people die, but who cares. Coming to any kind of reward, if you can call it that. My friend liked it, so at least one of us got something. The hills have eyes, not the worst movie we could have seen, but I doubt I'll watch it again. This movie was remade in 2006 and I will also have a review of that version. Anyway, this movie was painfully slow at times, while other times it was chaotic and repetitive. Unless you like to watch dry paint, occasionally interspersed with Someone running around your block, shouting your head off, stay away from this movie. A better bet would be the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1973) 1.5 * out of 10 * being generous
