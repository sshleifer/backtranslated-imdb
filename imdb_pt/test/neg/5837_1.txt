I like science fiction films, and even low-rated movies, made for TV, bargains, movies that I still find interesting. Well, I found this in a bargain box and brought it as a selection for a movie night with a group of friends. <br /> <br /> I was literally emabrrassed that I brought this movie. From the beginning, the acting is bad, the story is bland and the plot is almost non-existent. All of this leads directly to what the movie really was: a softcore pornographic graphic film. <br /> <br /> The film began with a prison where all the prisoners are sexy women working in some kind of mine. First hint that this movie is not serious: attractive women in a prison being forced to do physical work. Okay, right! Whatever. : P Once the "plot" continued, it was overshadowed by senseless scenes of people having sex. In the middle of the movie, my friends and I stopped watching, it was so stupid. The next day, I thought I would give the movie another chance and watch the rest. I watched about 15 minutes and gave up again. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a decent movie, science fiction or even a science fiction movie, DO NOT look Lethal Target! If you want to see low budget pornography that is light on the plot, then see Lethal Target.
