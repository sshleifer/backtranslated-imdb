I can not believe I've seen such a bad horror movie since ... hell, I can not believe I've ever seen such a bad horror movie. The acting alone was enough to make a person shrink. The bad acting went far beyond the cheesy horror movie. It was just awful. And did you check those horrible special effects? When the demon (which looked more like a cheap doll) came off the wall, I could not tell if I should be scared, or laughing at my ass. As a big fan of the horror genre, this movie was more than disappointing. I could not help but notice that the director is from Portland, OR, who happens to be my own hometown. I must say that I am deeply ashamed. If I could, I would give this movie a negative of 500.
