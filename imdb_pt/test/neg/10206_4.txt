In Holds Barred is that movie that when you were nine or ten years old was the coolest movie on this side of Arnold Schwarzenegger. But when you grow up and watch, you feel embarrassed for being so naive for liking it. You feel cheated, ashamed and stupid. If you have a younger brother and show him that and he says he's gay, give him a high five and take him to the strip bar for his eleventh birthday.
