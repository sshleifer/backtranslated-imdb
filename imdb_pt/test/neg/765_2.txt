I was under the assumption that this was the cat-and-mouse duo, but it was not, instead, something that should not have been done even for their time. They disguise themselves in the "blackface" style because they fly to Africa and even act like Stepin Fetchit and all the others together. There are some cartoons that are racist, but they are classic, being a mixed woman I have the right to say this, but if you are in the historical aspect of these cartoons try Merrie Melodies "Black Coal and Sebben Dwarfs" or "Angel Puss" you you will not find them on DVD because distributors have promised not to put them in the mainstream, but you can find them on a site like YouTube. I do not recommend small children seeing this, but if you want to see how America was racist and ignorant, these are better suggestions, not to mention that this particular drawing has little animation, I know it was 1932, but I've seen the time. "Airplane" unnecessary. -1 of 10.
