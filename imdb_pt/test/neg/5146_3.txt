During production, this LWT series was titled 'Rocket To The Moon', a title that everyone in the set at the time thought was cheesy enough. Then came the news that he had been renamed "Reach for the Moon," as if this addition of this new word evoked strong metaphorical meanings involving the relationships and aspirations of the characters. This same lack of subtlety and understanding is clear across the fabric of the entire series, and the same tedious and tedious plot of the love triangle is actually extended over 7 episodes! Any television program that decides to use the "love triangle" plot for a single episode is forcing it, but to foul it over seven episodes is unforgivable. There are reasons to note, however, with the Isle of Wight landscape certainly providing a beautiful backdrop, and the seemingly effortless performance of Lynda Bellingham hitting all the right marks of comedy. This, however, is not enough. Several performances are noticeable, especially when placed against static and unemotional wasteland, to which Jonathan Kerrigan refers as his face. I've already mentioned Lynda Bellingham as a 'nervous mother' (yes, that's about character development and history), but I was impressed by actor Maurice Roeves (who is by far the most experienced actor in the world). cast, having appeared in everything from classic films like Richard Attenborough's 'Oh What a Lovely War' and 'The Eagle Has Landed', and TV including Baywatch, Holby City, The Bill, Eastenders, Cheers, Doctor Who in the 80's , Star Trek, and even going to Hollywood with Sylvestor Stallone at the 1995 Judge Dredd whose performance reminded me a lot of the real professors I met - often incapable men whose lives are tinged for a very sad time. It's comforting to see that Roeves is still working, appearing also in the 1998 British film 'The Acid House' and even more recently alongside the wonderful Maria Bello and Sean Bean in 'The Dark'. The prominent reason to watch this series, though their appearances are very few. Another actor who tries his best to elevate the show is Ben Miles, in the role of the "typical man" brother, sex-crazy (again, that original character!). As with Roeves, the CV says it all. After raising that, Miles has appeared in the Hollywood film "V for Vendetta", and the 2001 film "The Affair of the Necklace", alongside Brian Cox, Adrien Brody, Christopher Walken and Jonathan Pryce. Unfortunately, the reasonably capable actors I mentioned are resigned to relatively small roles compared to the dramatic driftwood that is Kerrigan and Saira Todd, who seem to have been in Casualty for a long time, and have not yet learned to act. Even the tolerable Frances Gray is made to suffer in the presence of such theatrically fetal mannequins, and unfortunately for her the lasting remembrance I have of her on the set, it is AD's to ask for another take from a relatively complex take, because during her subconsciously 'took the panties out of their crack!' Known faces appear in every episode - CBBC's junior actors, and dramas like "2 Point 4 Children," and other commercial goers like Ben's ("they'll remember me for it"), Lynda 'the Oxo lady Bellingham and others I do not even want to remember. Each episode tries to "deal with problems" such as teenage pregnancy, disruptive students and rocket building (!) ... things that Grange Hill was doing best when my parents were young! Overall, this series was a disappointment and a wasted opportunity to create a genuinely interesting and well-developed drama series. Unfortunately, for them, they followed the easier path, both in writing and most of the time in the cast. I would recommend both 'Waterloo Road' and 'The Street' to fans of a good drama - the last, in particular, who got it. If you like the Isle of Wight, do not "reach the moon", look for the holiday brochure - it probably contains more character development!
