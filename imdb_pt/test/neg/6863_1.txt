I would be one of the few people who owns a copy of this classic. But I do not have only 1, I actually have 2. It's SO good. <br /> <br /> Well, when I say good, I mean bad. But I'll try to do a complete overhaul. I even watched 'born a ninja' than one of the other commentators here mentioned, to compare it to this. And born a ninja is actually worse, but not so funny. <br /> <br /> And that's always funny. EVERYTHING about this movie is bad. ALL. The plot is absolutely stuffed (note the 'you'll need to keep me alive if you want to know where to find your wife'). EACH action sequence is stuffed as well. Our hero danton is more than a hero; he can stab people with branches, pick up 3 bullets in the heart within 50 cm of distance without bleeding, and tie a rope in a tree that, when an enemy steps on it, ties a knot in the enemy's leg, picks it up, and throws it 50 meters in a pile of thorns. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad it's impossible to comment on it, but you should roll, especially Dantons 'jump off the ground and growl at the bad guy'. Oh yeah, and the bad guys: somehow, it looks like they're resurrecting 5 times each in the movie. Maybe it's just because there were not enough actors, but in a movie of that caliber? I doubt it. The plot is about how Danton was a soldier in the Vietnam War, and now his colonel is hunting down real people to train his mercenaries. The colonel only gets danton, so danton fights. This is just the excuse for a rambo clone, with most of the film being danton slaughtering soldiers. And I really can not explain the plot anymore because there is nothing else for the movie. Still rocks though. <br /> <br /> What else could be wrong? Do not make me start. Hand grenades that actually happen at the feet of the actors because the explosion is the size of a game. Scenarios where there are 5 people chasing the danton, then the camera cuts back and they are 7. The way that every time the danton carries the grenade launcher he is against the same background even though he is in completely different places. And the worst part is when Danton pushes the plastic rocks over the enemies, and an enemy is completely untouched by the boulders, so he does not know what to do, so he kind of dies without even being touched. It's ridiculous !!! <br /> <br /> But funny. Very, very funny. This is one of the few movies I recommend to everyone, because if you do not find it funny, you're 1 in 1 million. And for the rest of us it's magic.
