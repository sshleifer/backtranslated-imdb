Although this is not a classic comedy of all time, it's a great movie to watch if you watch it on a rainy Saturday morning without much happening. <br /> <br /> Harold Lloyd plays Ezekiel. Cobb, an American returning home after growing up in China, where his father was a missionary. He returned from China to find an American wife and plans to return to China to continue his father's work. Undefeated is involuntarily recruited to run for mayor of his corrupt hometown when the existing political machine that controls the city realizes that he would make a perfect nonsense against the current mayor who is also the head of the underworld of the city. They think Cobb has no chance to win and so the current mayor still manages the city and manages his plans, which makes them rich. <br /> <br /> Lloyd is not doing the physical comedy here, as he did in his silent films. He makes a compelling portrait of Cobb with a discreet and reserved dignity. was good of all involved and the story and script were also very good. Being made in 1934, the film has a rather racist language when it talks about the Chinese and also has a typical black character era, but these stereotypes are not as bad as I have seen in other films of the time. <br /> <br /> Although not the best Lloyd movie, this movie is fun and Lloyd is very good as Cobb. You will not be surprised by this movie, but it may be enough to boost your interest in Lloyd and make you want to see more of your work.
