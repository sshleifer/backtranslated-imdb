I was very worried about this movie, it was scheduled to play at a Jewish Film Festival, and was reported as being very hostile to Israel, while wearing clever humor and irony. <br /> <br /> I was relieved that the film was not a diatribe, however, as a film work was deeply disappointing. The movie was full of random events, some of which eventually connected, most of which did not happen. Some of the events were very clever and fun, but some were merely random and tasteless. <br /> <br /> There are repeated scenes between two lovers, where they sit in a car, speechless, and play some hand game. Maybe in some cultures this is erotic, but it's like watching the thumb fight. After the third time, this really became tiring. <br /> <br /> I've always found David Lynch totally free, using strange stories and images to make the public think he's so sophisticated he does not understand. His work; in fact, there is nothing to understand. The same is true here, the stories do not contribute to anything, and there is not much to be done politically (in one scene, a noisy Israeli soldier humiliates Palestinian conductors at a checkpoint.Is this news?) <br /> < I do not understand why this movie has generated controversy, nor why it has attracted attention. It is an inferior job and see that it was a waste of time.
