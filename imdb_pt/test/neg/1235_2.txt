I'll give it a second chance, but I was very disappointed in the first one. He would not hold a candle for the other series. It has a lot of meaningless dialogues that adds nothing to the plot. I agree with others that it does not seem to develop a story that is interesting. It's slow and slow and I only know what the Comanches are planning to do. Maybe everything fits into the second half, but I'm going to have to force myself to watch and find out. I am from the Apache heritage of the Texas / New Mexico area, but I do not recognize much of what is happening. Maybe I'm just ignorant of the facts, but this is not doing much to educate me.
