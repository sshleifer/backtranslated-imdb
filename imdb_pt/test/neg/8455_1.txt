This movie only happened on HBO yesterday, so I watched it. That was a mistake. I think I got sucked in and kept watching, although it was a lot like a train disaster, terrible, awful, but somehow you just can not look away. shaudenfraud I think! ; ). <br /> <br /> This is the story of a photoshoot for models on some Caribbean island. One by one, they are all murdered. A baby cleaner, one is blown up in a waverunner, one goes over a cliff ... so these are no accidents, but for some empty reason, the police are never called and no one thinks that maybe they should "wrap" the filming. and go home, not just in respect of the dead, but perhaps out of fear of their own lives. No. They just keep shooting, because that's what's most important. Forget the dead models, we have a magazine to produce! <br /> <br /> One of the subplots is the owner of Evil magazine, played by Lee Majors, Rex is his name. He is the most obvious suspect and every time a model is killed he spins his mustache and says "well, I can not say this will not be good for sales," so absurd. Another subplot is when it is revealed that Rex is one of the baby dady models, only when he learned of the baby did he try to persuade the girl to abort but did not resent him for suggesting it. <br /> <br /> They try to give false leads and point to a guy named Raule, apparently because he is the only one with an accent and "looks scary". <br /> <br /> In the end (sorry to ruin, but this movie came out years ago, so if you have not seen so far ...) one of the women was found with the face down dead in the pool. This was the last drop !!!! Vanessa Angel, forget your characters name comes to Rex with a gun, they fight, the gun fires and now she's dead too !!! While she is lying on the floor, her partner tells her that with all this bad pressure the magazine will be worth it and it's all his fault. He makes him sign the magazine for him. Once he voila! All the dead models come back to life and you think the whole thing was an elaborate ruse to get back to the Rex. <br /> <br /> Oy! What a ridiculous movie. As someone said; If you want to see something like this April Fools Day is so much better!
