American Graffiti is one of the best movies ever made. I've seen it at least 30 times and I'm emotionally affected by it every time I see it. (I graduated high school in 1962.) <br /> <br /> However, American Graffiti is one of the worst films ever made. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe than anyone associated with A Great Original Movie was involved with this terrible sequel. The part of the film set in Vietnam was extremely inaccurate. (I served 18 months in Vietnam with the 101st Airborne Division.) <br /> <br /> The whole movie had nothing worthwhile in any part of it. <br /> <br /> If anyone wants to make a case against making sequences for great movies, more American Graffiti would be the prime example of what can go wrong.
