"Black Vengeance" is an alternate title for "Ying hung ho hon" AKA "Tragic Hero" (1987). I just saw it on VHS along with the first part of the story, "Gong woo ching" ("Rich and Famous"), also in 1987. (The poster and two stills presented on the page are for a set of 4 DVDs of movies starring Rod Perry (The Black Gestapo), Fred Williamson (Black Snake 2), Richard Lawson (Black Fist) .The fourth film is called "The Black Six." Oddly enough, while the characters retain their original names in "Rich and Famous, "in" Black Vengeance "the character of Chow Yun-Fat is named Eddie Shaw, Alex Man (Man Tze Leung) is Harry, and Andy Lau is called Johnny. It is also unclear the fact that 1994 is given as the dates "Tragic Hero" was released before "Rich and Famous." There was some reason to release the sequel Despite the comments from some users, I liked these movies, although they do not "The Killer" and "Hard-Boiled", which are really amazing. However, if one day I come across a set of 2 DVDs of "Rich and Famous" and "Tragic Hero", I will not hesitate to buy it. I hope those comments on "Black Vengeance" have been clarified, which was also for me a mystery about where she belonged to Chow Yun-Fat's filmography.
