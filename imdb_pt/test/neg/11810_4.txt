Ken Burns' "Baseball" is a decent documentary ... presents a clear origin of the game, a great representation of baseball's early years and heroes. There's a lot in this movie for any baseball fan ... That being said, the movie has several glaring flaws. <br /> <br /> 18 hours is simply too long for human attention. Of course, Burns extended his film to fit his "nine innings" concept. It's not even a tight 18 hours ... the pace in each segment is slow, almost bleak ... the music is always nostalgic and melancholic. Baseball is never exciting and fun? Why are all players and their achievements presented in the form of a tragedy? Talking head after speaking head turns each tone into an emotional disgust, talking about baseball as a metaphor, baseball like Americana, psychology and baseball theology ... enough! This is syrupy, dull drivel. Billy Crystal is here to sell us all the Yankee Hokum he sold us before. Ken Burns uses the National Anthem as the theme for the series, and manages to play "Take Me Out To The Ballgame" so many times that you can vomit. We understand that, man. <br /> <br /> Clearly Burns is a false-liberal neo-Hollywood, so he probably spends a third of the film in the black leagues ... these segments are spent chastising the whites of yesterday for not being as open-minded as Kenny is today. For shame! He rebukes baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties, but does not realize that America was segregated in those times! Burns falls madly in love with Buck O'Neil, a former black league player, and drools over every bit of film in which the elderly O'Neil is poetic about his playing days. Nonsense ... <br /> <br /> Burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation. "Baseball" ends up as a civil rights advertisement, soft and voluptuous, disguised as American. Of course Burns is not a baseball fan ... otherwise, he'd know we watched games laughing and clapping, not crying and reciting soliloquies ... are you listening, Mr. Burns? There is no crying in baseball.
