I was really looking forward to this movie, but unfortunately it did not live up to the expectation. <br /> <br /> A good movie has the audience identifying / empathizing with the lead actor. Unfortunately, this was very difficult to do with Samantha Morton. <br /> <br /> The plot seemed very disjointed and did not flow as it should / could have done. <br /> <br /> Keifer Sutherland seemed to be little more than dressing in the window and made me wonder why he agreed to play what seemed to be a small part. The beautiful setting and the performance of Tem Morrison and Cliff Curtis was the only advantage. <br /> <br /> Maybe for being a kiwi I put the highest bar for movies made locally. Maybe the change of director / supposedly difficult to work with the lead actor has distorted my opinion. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just trying to make excuses for a movie that could have been great. <br /> <br /> A lot of maybe that still does not explain why this movie was anything special. <br /> <br /> It could have been great, was not it.
