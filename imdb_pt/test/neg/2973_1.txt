Why is it that the instant noodles are not instantaneous, that was the disconcerting problem that I put in the lap of the brave sherpa of a leg; He angrily replied that pasta was not his purse, also I replied "What the fuck?" He looked more perplexed. <br /> <br /> Some of you will wonder, why does the Sherpa have only one minor member? <br /> <br /> The sherpa, which we will call Sherpa 5, for data protection. reasons, it hurt the toe. "As!?!" I hear you ask, I'll go on, as we learn from the review of Donkey Punch (2002) Irene through dirty nudges and dirty winks etc tried in vain to teach the slight quirks of checkers to all the angry Sherpas. Sherpa, 5 who is known only for his violent takeovers against democratic principles during the post-revolutionary years of the now United States of America and its consequent effect on the mentality of its population in the postmodern empire that now exists through the invasions of countries smaller than that, was taken into a river of violence because of his lack of understanding of ladies. According to an eyewitness, he jumped like an irresistible banjo in the Mardi Gras wielding a stick with nails, after the ensuing fight, five llamas were discovered missing the left testicles, 3 Sherpas were found under a Bush and Sherpa gooseberry 5 had the nail fastened on his big toe. <br /> <br /> The lifestyle of a Sherpas is as modest as a nun with only rudimentary health facilities at 15,000 feet above sea level. Consequently, when the first aid cabin was opened only a promissory note for a spam can, and some crocheted panties were found. Sherpa 5 jumped around like a darkness in a bow in agony, until Irene burst out like a hen's cock and suggested that she soak her sickness in the llama spit. Sherpa 5 agreed to the procedure, to sedate him, a 100-year-old Glenfiditch bottle was produced, some say it was left by a furious Scot, who is believed to be an ancestor of the angry Sherpas. One under the influence, the toe was bathed until it was furrowed, clad in the lightly soiled diaphragm of Irenes and a blue tack. Some of you may think this procedure would not do the Sherpa well, and you would be fully justified in upholding that vision. Just four days later, gangrene was defined and, a week later, the leg was removed through the use of even firmer elastic bands.
