This movie was terrible. I thought it would be OK, but it only got worse and worse. From the early scenes, it seems to be heading toward another predictable, safe rom-but by the time it hits the house, it simply disintegrates. None of the characters had depth and the only person who believed in anything was Tom, although the way he distracted himself so easily only annoyed me after a while. The dialogue is ridiculous and the structure of the film almost completely non-existent. In an insulting attempt at comedy, the writer / director introduces a new character or event in virtually every scene, none of which is realistic, which makes it very confusing to keep track of what is happening. The plot is just an excuse for a movie: guy likes girl, house stays at home for parents to meet the girl, destroys house, girl stays. A complete waste of time.
