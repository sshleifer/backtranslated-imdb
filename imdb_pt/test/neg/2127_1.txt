Yikes. <br /> <br /> I saw some bad movies in my day, many of them in the company of Mike, Tom, Crow and the others from MST3k. The same thing happened with this movie and although I found the movie funny, it would not be so much fun without the MST3k comment. <br /> <br /> The film is an excellent example of really bad films coming out of Europe during the eighties. Horrible music, horrible acting, horrible plot (how little there is), horrible dialogues and really, really, REALLY, horrible editing. Cripes. <br /> <br /> This can be called a turkey if it were not for the fact that it is not unique at all. It's pretty much the same kind of movie that almost every one of a director's Italian hackers did. <br /> <br /> So, try getting the MST3k version. It's a very fun episode with Mike and gangs in good shape.
