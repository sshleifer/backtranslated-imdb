Funny thing. Charlie Sheen, Donald Sutherland, Sam Waterston and Stephen Lang had incredible performances. Who can forget Sheen as the naive on Wall Street, or Sutherland as the cynical surgeon of the Korean War in MASH? Waterston and Lang also had success in the TV and film career (Law and Order, Killing Fields, De Niro's Tribeca, etc). So what in the world would some of these beautiful actors be doing in a stinking bomb like that? <br /> <br /> The plot of a Washington coup of the Shadow Conspiracy is not really that bad, not original perhaps, but not so bad. . Of course it was already done (Seven Days in May - a great movie!), But with a few tweaks, it could still be fun. <br /> <br /> The main problem of Shadow Conspiracy is in execution. At the beginning of the film Sheen, extreme political strategist, ridiculously and implausibly solves a potential public relations gaffe, blackmailing a congressman. Later, shootings with Lang's mute killer ripping apart half of what would be Georgetown are explained on the news as "gang wars." Has anyone remotely associated with this movie ever lived in Washington? Sheen is about 20 years very young, very young, to be so senior in a White House Administration. Sheen's response to avoiding a political crisis is so loaded with false machismo that it seems that he attended the acting school David Hasselhoff. And when was the last time that gang wars spread to Georgetown? We are talking about a section of Washington where citizens voted against the Metro stop so they could maintain their exclusivity. <br /> <br /> I agree with another reviewer that this movie would have been unbearable without the fast forward button. . I recorded on HBO a year ago and then made three separate views to go through it. <br /> <br /> In summary: do not buy this movie. Do not even rent this movie. If you come to Blockbuster, run as fast as you can.
