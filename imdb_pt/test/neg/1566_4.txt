GEORGE AND MILDRED was a spin-off from the mid-1970s with MAN sit on the house. Although I have not seen the series since the last broadcast, I remember being quite entertaining, with most of the comedy springing up from the eponymous couple going live next door to the snobby Fourmile family, a kind of LOVE THY NEIGHBOR without the cynical racist jokes . Having seen this "big screen version of the program", I wonder what the big screen version is? Certainly not from a popular mid-seventies sit under the same name. For some reason, the film brushes aside all of the television characters' interactions by getting George and Mildred off the street where they live and being caught up in a plot involving some serious gangsters who want something George inadvertently caught and that leads to some embarrassment . situations and lines like: <br /> <br /> "Did he give it to you" <br /> <br /> "It's not the first time a man has resisted my charms" <br /> <br /> <br /> You have the impression that screenwriter Dick Sharples (who has never written an episode for the original sit-com) has never seen an episode of the source material and has the confusing show with the CARRY ON series of movies. In many ways, it resembles the same mistakes of the last film LOST IN SPACE, because it has absolutely nothing in common with the series that generated it.
