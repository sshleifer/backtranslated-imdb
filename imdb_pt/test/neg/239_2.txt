Oh, man, they sure knew how to do it back then. Hollywood forgot the basic ingredients of bad movie production: the cardboard steel and the god fearing the hero of action scientist! <br /> <br /> This movie was so close to a masterpiece, unfortunately it was not, as it did not rely on lightning and Moon invaders. The MST3K version tried to fix this by adding a pilot from a show called Captain Cody, where a guy in a rocket-propelled jacket fights bad people with makeup on the moon, but that was not quite like that. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the comments from the guys in the theater were not as funny as I'd hoped they were. All in all, a big disappointment.
