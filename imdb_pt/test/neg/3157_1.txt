I dont understand. I just do not understand. "Barney and Friends" has been attacked by millions over the years, and I'll admit, I was one of those lambasters. Any child who watches this program does not realize that what they are watching is just a piece of crap. Barney is very annoying and very selfish. Add Baby Bop, and it gets even worse. Add B.J., so you have a very scary television nightmare. Then you get the kids. They are old enough to know what Barney is trying to teach them! What are they doing there in the first place? It would be funny if Barney and his friends showed up on the show Jerry Springer. This would certainly be one of the craziest moments in television history! Even more significant is that this show marked the beginning of the end of public television as we know it, as we have seen less and less of the most informative and interesting public television programs that aired in the 1970s and 1980s. What a difference a son makes selfish of a weapon. When this program leaves PBS, a great sigh of relief will be felt among millions of people, but a huge impact will have been made in the annals of television history. A message to Barney himself: You may not realize it, but your days are numbered. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, there are other options. Best choices.
