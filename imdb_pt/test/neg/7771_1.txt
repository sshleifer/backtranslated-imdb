In 1970, feminists invaded the Miss World beauty pageant in London and made the occasion stop, throwing flour and eggs on stage. Because? Because, rightly or wrongly, they felt that the event was humiliating and demeaning for women. I offer no criticism of your actions. It is a free world in which we live. What I want to know is: why do not their modern equivalents invade the studios where programs like this are made and do the same? 'Sex & The City' is about four egocentric women from New York: Carrie is a fashion slave who turns into a kitten when a man clap her hands, Charlotte yearns to find the perfect man (they do not exist, love) so she can use sex to bond the poor devil, lawyer Miranda frightens men with absurd things like "out of touch with my emotions" and lastly, we have Samantha, the living incarnation of the old ad of Martini "anytime, anywhere, anywhere". Feminists hold these characters - particularly Samantha - as a shining example of modern femininity. Well, if yelling rude words in bustling restaurants is progress, I think feminists should take a long look at themselves and what they should represent. <br /> <br /> If Sex & The City were the creation of a man, he would have been taken off the air because he was sexist. Instead, like 'Charlie's Angels' before, this led the supposedly clever women to think that this worked as a positive force for good. There is something very clinical and cold about the show. 'The Benny Hill Show' was also sexist, but at least it was funny.
