An art teacher comes across an old wooden bed made of gingko trees and puts it in his apartment, but it has a terrible history and it is hunted by an ancient spirit that sustains its human form ripping people's hearts out. <BR> <BR> This beautifully crafted horror? Well, in fact, it's more fantasy / romance than anything else that creates some creeps and provides stunning visuals, but the plot was not interesting enough and the stereotyped script had no life at all. The problem was that I spent most of my time trying to keep my finger away from the fast forward button. I would have certainly accelerated the slow pace of the movie, but again, I would not know much about what was going on, which was reasonably difficult to discover or keep interested in the first place. The performances ranged from very melodramatic or simply bland, and probably because these characters are not convincing, obsolete, and coma inducers. The real story of the old bed and the spirits is incredibly boring and messy, with a lot of focus on a fragile romance, being ridiculous when it should not be and is usually built in a common way that just does not have the power. or conviction of taking the film. What makes up for the shortcomings of the story are really artistic images, which looked great, but the use of some images left me a bit puzzled by what they really mean for the film. What strikes you is the faded color scheme, but sometimes the actual screen looks grainy or snowy. Although, from this, show the gross intensity of the production valves, but also add some polished effects that go well with the smooth but sometimes nervous punctuation. The work of the camera was quite diverse (although it did not add much to the feature), but during some of the more lively scenes there were many closes or dark lighting that made it difficult to understand what you are seeing. Also exhibited are some pleasant moments of blood and blood, but not openly grandiose or distinguishable from most other films. <br /> <br /> Lethargically strange film with luminous images that look like something out of a painting, but still not particularly attractive. Beware, this can put you in a deep trance!
