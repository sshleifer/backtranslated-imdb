This is so blatantly a ripoff made for Black Widow's TV (1987) - even the titles of insects are so similar. <br /> <br /> If you want a better movie "get married for money," check out Black Widow. , starring Debra Winger and Theresa Russell. <br /> <br /> This movie is cheesy at its best ..! I just had to watch it entirely to see how it ended.
