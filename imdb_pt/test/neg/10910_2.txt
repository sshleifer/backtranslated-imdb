Certain filmmakers can not err in the eyes of national critics, which is one reason why you should never pay attention to them. This movie is a perfect example. Critics like director Eric Rohmer. <br /> <br /> This movie is a boring novel about a woman and a teenager ("Pauline") that she is taking care of during the summer, and the relationships they have with some men. It's talking, talking, talking and talking more. <br /> <br /> For those who look at the cover and expect to be excited, there are some quick shots and some profanity, but otherwise, this is a harmless game of French morality. A friend of mine lent me this tape. He thought he was making a sexy French movie and was disappointed. I was so disappointed because it was also very annoying. <br /> <br /> How that gets great reviews is almost unfathomable.
