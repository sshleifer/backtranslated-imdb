I would love to sit down and write a clever and thoughtful comment, but I think I would spend more time in the writing process than the filmmakers. I live in Los Angeles and am sorry to say that the characters seemed to be very underdeveloped and overly egoistic. There was not a moment in the movie where I could escape the feeling of watching the talk of unemployed actors at a modern Los Angeles cafe. One of the worst "indie" movies I've seen with so little to recommend that hearing it win at Sundance has effectively removed any prior interest I might have in attending, much less consider a positive Sundance review to be meaningful. Watch at your own risk.
