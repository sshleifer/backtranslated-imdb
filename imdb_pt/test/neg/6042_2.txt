Someone said WEBS is very much like an episode of SLIDERS, and I have to agree. Spoilers: I never liked the actors in Sliders, and rarely saw, except when nothing better was happening. WEBS is the kind of movie to see if you have no other options. Read a book. WEBS has these types of TV actors who seem to be there as part of their PROBATION or Work Release Program. Some low budget TV movies have actors who at least seem enthusiastic. The WEBS actors seem to be getting a minimum wage and working on a time clock. They have that desperate look, "The-Paycheck-Better-Not-Bounce." Queen Spider looks great, except it is rarely seen, and there are no other spiders (and no webs). Spider Queen bites people, and they become Zombie Spiders, which means they try to keep their eyes wide open when they're attacking humans. Humans are all fighting each other for several different reasons, and they are not friendly. After meeting all the "humans" I would have recommended school charm to the characters. All that the WEBS made me feel was APATHY. I was numb with the characters and expected some special effects and interesting gore. Blood was minimal and the special effects were reserved for the ugly spider queen, who looked fine. If the WEBS had a lot of Spiders eating humans, it would have been more fun. Apparently, they could only budget "spider zombies". WEBS is a sad entry into the field of SPIDER driven movies. It may qualify as the worst Spider-Man movie ever, because eight-legged Freaks had great special effects.
