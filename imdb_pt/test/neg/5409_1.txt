If you like to get some fleeting glimpses of cleavage in some attractive women, there may be a second or two of fun with this movie. If you enjoy seeing ill-conceived and executed "action" scenes, there are many. If you are blind and deaf, I still advise you not to have this movie in your presence. It's certainly the worst or very close to the worst movie I've ever seen. And it looks like there was some money spent on it. Talk about throwing money away! As an editor, I hope the "publisher (s)" of this "movie" is never allowed to edit a movie, book, or even a post-it. As a writer, I hope the author (s?) Is never allowed even close to a broken pencil. You might think I'm not recommending you to watch this movie. Not so. Tape it (so you can stop your pain when you need it) and find out how bad a movie can be.
