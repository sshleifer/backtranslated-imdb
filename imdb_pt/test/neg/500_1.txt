I watched this last night with an open mind. Sorry to say it's still bad. First, the movie is very noisy and you can not hear what people are saying. The accents are bad, especially Richard Masur. What is the French girl doing in that movie ??? Miscasting at its worst. Walken's makeup is strange. The Harvard scene is useless and unnecessary. Kristoferson's character is unpleasant and I wanted him dead and gone. Meanwhile, the Walken character is killed very early and easily (despite the makeup). The settlers are all stupid. GET ORGANIZED you bunch of hipsters, people are coming to kill you !!!!! John Hurts character provides some humor but that's all. <br /> <br /> I have nothing good to say about this excessive piece of crap. The only good thing is that it ruined the director's career and killed United Artists. <br /> <br /> Still Crap after all these years.
