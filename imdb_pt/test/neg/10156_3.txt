oh well ... it's funny. it should have been a sadistic comedy, many horror films do not have good sense, but I think a retarded cave man would deviate from this situation. Do not really expect Hitchcock or something close to that. this is a good one for friends, but I would not recommend it for anything else. This movie does not have all the substance of a true horror film, suspense, shock and good characters. the killer could not be the uncontrollable force I'd expected him to be, and he seemed to be the middle-aged "D" capable of being smarter than the stupid people. and the really funny thing is the horrible acting and the lack of emotion of so-called "victims" just expect this in the daily amusements.
