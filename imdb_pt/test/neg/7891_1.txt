This is a film about a Negro buying an airline and turning the company into a company focused on Africa. They even portray the owner as not only controlling the airline, but also controlling part of the air terminal at the airport. One day this guy earns $ 100 million the next time you see him, he's walking around the airport acting like the airport owner. Everyone calls this parody movie, but nothing about this movie screams parody! This movie is a failure and will always be in the $ 4.95 bin at Wal-Mart. <br /> <br /> I can not even understand why MGM would spend $ 16 million on that movie. This movie does not even guarantee the direct status for the video. The writers (one black and one white) should be banished from Hollywood forever. They not only stereotype black people, but portray them as ignorant human beings. I would be embarrassed to go to a movie that constantly humiliates me. Do not waste time at the store, Wal-Mart, pay-per-view or Sunday afternoon when the movie is shown on TBS.
