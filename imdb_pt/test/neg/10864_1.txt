This is easily one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time (and I recently saw Starship Troopers 2 !!!). I did not find anything to redeem this movie. The acting, which is probably the best aspect of the movie, is fair at best. Michael Madsen is in his persona of standard character. Denis Hopper does not seem to know what he should be. Vinnie Jones's accent is bizarre. One positive thing is that Leonor Valera looks fantastic. Her acting is very poor, but I doubt that's why she's there. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is truly terrible. It's just crap. I do not know who signed this, but they really need to get professional help next time. <br /> <br /> This film is the evaluation system the IMDB should be able to include zero stars in ten. Avoid at all costs.
