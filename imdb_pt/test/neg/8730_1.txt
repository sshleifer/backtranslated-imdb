I sat so on TV waiting for the names that would be worth the time ... but dear Gussie, who thought that this script deserved to be produced? The basic idea is excellent, but the execution is terribly bad, with a constantly illogical sequence of scenes, an ending that is almost ridiculously melodramatic and poor Rock Hudson wanders through it with an understandably confused look on his slightly fallen face. It looks like a bad B movie from the 1940s ...
