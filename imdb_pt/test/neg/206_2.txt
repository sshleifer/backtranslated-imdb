An assault film with Jean Reno, Matt Damon and Laurence Fishburne ... looks great on paper? I suspect it must have done when someone green lit the production of this movie, but the final product is terrible! <br /> <br /> The story is monotonous, the action is boring and for a film of just 88 minutes, it just seems to drag on. I could feel my life escaping and I was sure there was something better I should be doing ... some paint to dry somewhere, perhaps? I sigh. I'm a big fan of Jean Reno, but what the hell was he thinking when he signed up for it? There are so many other great action movies out there ... go watch one of these and let this movie be best forgotten.
