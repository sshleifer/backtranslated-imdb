This movie was really bad, clear and simple. As a movie like this is widely publicized, it's a wonder to me. <br /> <br /> It's a decent idea, but it did not work. Edward Burns is a decent actor though. I liked your little role in Private Ryan's Rescue. <br /> <br /> Let's get down to the big question here. <br /> <br /> The visuals were incredibly bad, I thought I was watching an old "Dinosaurs In 3D" CDROM point-and-click adventure demo in Windows 3.1 I mean, I saw cut-scenes in console games pre-2000 dinosaurs that have better looking dinosaurs than that. I mean, dammit ... the original Tomb Raider T-Rex looked better than this. <br /> <br /> The monkey-lizards were laughable. I thought they were some kind of ripoff creation of "Killer Instinct" I've seen better puppet monsters now that I think about it. <br /> <br /> You know, there are a ton of made-for-TV movies that are better than this. As a gem like Scifi Channels "The Shining" manages such a small audience, but this load of "CGI, easy to do 4 Kidz" is exposed in the open? I do not care if it's a Ray Bradbury story. Lameeeee
