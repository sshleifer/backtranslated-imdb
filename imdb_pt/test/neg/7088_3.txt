This is another of the 1950s Hollywood anti-communist polemics. Robust American Gene Barry, adorable English Valerie French and three others are abducted by an alien and given shells containing fantastic power - and fantastically vague. What will Earthmen do with such power? Throw it in the sea or use it to wipe out all of humanity? Anyone who knows American cinema around 1957 knows the answer to what the commissioners will do, but the story matures when Americans really test things in the middle of the Pacific. So a scientist, alone with the supreme power in the universe, comes up with his own theory and uses it! His arrogant attitude afterwards is nauseating, and the cheerful disposition of everyone is terrible. <br /> <br /> Here is the spoiler for this dog: the capsules inside the shells have a mathematical code that tells the teacher that they only kill "confirmed enemies of freedom"! That's right - do not worry about the ethical riddle of killing everyone that an alien pill decides to be an enemy of freedom; just do it! Alive! There is no fellowship! Female silly - and you threw yours in the sea! Ha ha! Kiss me, baby!
