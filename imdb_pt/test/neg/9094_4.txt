A chilling, bloody tale of a couple who inherited an Italian castle of 150 rooms while still mourning the loss of their son. The marriage of the couples seems to be in difficulties due to the car accident that took the life of his son and left his daughter blind. In inventorying the castle for a future sale, a horrendous, tortured and deformed creature loses its life in the guts of the 12th-century castle. Pretty bloody with great atmosphere of horror and some sexual tones. Starring Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Jessica Dollarhide and Elisabeth Kaza.
