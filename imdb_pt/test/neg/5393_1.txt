Like many, this pile of manure caught my eye as I surfed the canal. It's a horror movie set in the forest, it has a stupid title, but hey "Michael Rooker" is in it, and he's been part of some great horror movies, I know he would not let me go wrong ... Ugh! The most insulting part of it is that I actually watched it. I see director Johnny Martin is a stuntman, well, this trick is just crap, and how he managed some of the actors to make this watery bowel movement is the biggest mystery of all ... I can understand Casper Van Dien but shame in you Rooker. His good name in the horror community has been tarnished forever, and his agent must be dismissed immediately. I'm sure this piece of fecal matter is available on DVD, but if you like the 99-cent menu at McDonalds, you'd earn more for your money there.
