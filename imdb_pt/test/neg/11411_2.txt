Wow. I just saw Demon Wind recently, and I do not think I'll ever be the same again. He has the power to inspire nightmares, but for all the wrong reasons, in fact. <br /> <br /> Never before has humanity seen such a gratuitous change in the constitution, for no damn reason. Or, similarly, very zombie makeup (?) That makes you hungry for those green Halloween marshmallows. <br /> <br /> Or a naked old lady, by the way. But then there was "The Enlightened One." <br /> <br /> The plot here is so amateurish that it actually almost has a bit of charm, just like the dialogue. The last scene of the movie is so silly that it is beyond description. It's as if some drunken college student has joined a few friends and decided to launch the Bruce Willis-type dialogue along with (I guess?) Teen dialogue from some Elm Street movie. The result is shocking, and it would be really funny if it was intentional like that. <br /> <br /> Oh, what the hey. I'll laugh anyway. <br /> <br /> Hell, join your friends and watch it. But be absolutely certain that you are drunk first. Or you can go crazy. Particularly if you are a college film student. <br /> <br /> Congratulations.
