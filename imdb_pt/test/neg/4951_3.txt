After watching "Still Life," a short film directed by Jon Knautz, I was genuinely excited by his movie debut, "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer." "Still Life" had perfectly captured the essence and feel of an episode of "The Twilight Zone" and I was eager to see what Knautz could do when she took on the horror comedy genre. The campy nature of the name and promotional materials suggested something along the lines of "Evil Dead" or "Army of Darkness"; a fun, bloody, 1980s horror movie with many monsters. While that was what Knautz was looking for, he would fail to capture whatever entertainment or entertainment value these films had. <br /> <br /> The problem with "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer" is that he does not have a full understanding of what made these horror comedies, which he tries to evoke, so great at first. Two-thirds of the execution time is devoted primarily to the movie hero Jack Brooks, a plumber and college student as he goes to class and tries to cope with his uncontrollable outbursts of anger. There is no monster in sight for most of the movie, not even a drop of blood or the slightest attempt at anything related to terror. Even if "Evil Dead" or "Dead Alive" had subsequent amounts of blood eliminated, they would still be fun. "Jack Brooks" is not. It's just annoying, which is the worst thing a movie of this nature can be. Jack Brooks himself is not that interesting, at least not enough to justify the amount of screen time he gets. Everything you need to know about it is revealed in the movies in the first ten minutes, and from there whenever it's not beating a monster's pulp (and rarely does), it's not worth watching. The film leads to nothing, following it around psychiatric sessions and fights with classmates. <br /> <br /> Eventually, things happen. Jack Brooks fights some monsters, some heads are crushed, some humans are slaughtered and then it's over. Just like that. All in the range of about fifteen minutes. That's a good fifteen minutes. The monsters are all quite inventive (and made entirely on camera) and there are a few big jokes (the best being a crushed zombie head), but after spending seventy-five minutes of pure boredom, fifteen minutes will not cut it. <br /> <br /> That's really all there is to it. I could talk about acting that is reasonably well done (especially the horror icon Robert Englund in a non-traditional role) and how creature prosthetics are a good return to the days when movies do not use CGI but really do not matter . "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer" is totally annoying and while Jon Knautz obviously has the talent to create a good movie (again, the last fifteen minutes are killers and "Still Life" was awesome, check it out), "Jack Brooks "completely missed the mark. It has its successes (acting, makeup), but that does not change the fact that it's not much fun. The screening I got this from the director had the cast in attendance. One piece of information I picked up was that a sequel was in development and that this time it would focus more on fighting monsters as opposed to "creating a hero." My advice: skip this and wait for the continuation.
