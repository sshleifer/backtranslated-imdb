Since The Magic is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution, one should sit back and enjoy the scenery. Set on a "remote island of Greece," he stars Michael Caine, a school-teacher for boys who gets into mind games with local mysterious man Anthony Quinn and his girlfriend, eccentric Candice Bergen. Quinn, looking like Pablo Picasso with white hair and striped sailor shirt, is actually quite good, but it seems that Caine is ready to explode. Bergen, though impressive, should not put a British accent NEVER. She's not very good at that sort of thing. Guy Green's direction is good, but unless you have infinite patience with the circular logic of the movie, you will not like it. A real sour note is the cast of effervescent Anna Karina in the completely uncaring role of Caine's girlfriend. After seeing her in the likes of The Woman is a Woman and an APART band, her presence here is quite shocking.
