1 st watched 2/25/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-George P. Cosmatos): Thriller of predictable action where any frequent movie goer could guess what was to come. Charlie Sheen is the good old man of the president who, by chance, is not appreciated by the rest of the presidential team. Of course, he gets embroiled in a situation where he is molded several times and he has a friend in the White House, played by Sutherland, who of course does not stay that way for long. His other friend is a reporter played by Linda Hamilton (who has very little to do or say in this meaningless role) and, of course, his biggest and best friend is the president himself (Sam Waterston), who remains a friend to the end despite of all else being killed around him. Brainless, but full of meaningless action, despite loads and loads of acting talents (all very well wasted).
