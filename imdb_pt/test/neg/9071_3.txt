The cast of "All That" returns in good spirits at "Good Burger" a place similar to an old-fashioned fast food restaurant. The comedy is great, the fun is uninterrupted and, despite being clich√©, it is a drawer for children's and family comedies. <br /> <br /> A movie for all ages, this movie is for fun, laugh and be beautiful. very much a lazy movie for a rainy day, because that's what I'd save this movie for, a rainy day. The US broadcast it today, and since I know the cast of "All That" is in it, I thought it might be a little funny, but in good fun, like Keenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell (probably one of the best duets of time) were great together, the pieces came together, and everything went well, and that made the family fun good together with a lazy day of work to get off the bad day. <br /> <br /> Can I take your order?
