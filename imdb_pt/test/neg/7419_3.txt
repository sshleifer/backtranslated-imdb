One minute in THE UNTOLD and the techniques of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PREDATOR have already been started. Does that mean we're going to see a lot of trees? We sure will. Are we going to see an Austrian bodybuilder blowing things up? Well, this movie has the budget of a TVM, so the answer is a resounding no. Someone like these soft porn shows like BEDTIME STORIES? Good because there's a scene that reminds me of this kind of show. Unfortunately, the only thing you see is cellulite. Do you like it when the screen goes black during a TVM? Great, because this happens between all the scenes of THE UNTOLD. In fact, this happens during all the scenes as well. Did you like MILLIONAIRE - A MAJOR FRAUD? Fantastic because one of the characters looks like Major Charles Ingram, the bearded, the competitor who tried to steal the million-pound show. Seriously, one of the characters looks like Major Ingram. I kept waiting for him to say, "It's a bear, it might be a bear, but it could be a big foot," a cough, yes, it's a bluff, it's definitely a big one. I'm going to film. Final answer Chris "<br /> <br /> Oh, and did I mention that all of the above are good? <br /> <br /> UNTOLD is not the worst bigfoot movie I've seen, this award goes for the NIGHT OF THE DEMON that I've seen for more than twenty years and I think I've only seen less than a dozen movies that are worse all of that time, but that said THE UNTOLD is still a very poor movie in almost every respect , as well as some other pieces where the scenes are put together in the wrong order.This is a very bad movie that deserves much less than its rating of 5, 1. I give him 3 out of 10 and I'm being very kind
