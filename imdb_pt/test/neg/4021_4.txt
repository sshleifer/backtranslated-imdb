I've seen about half a dozen of the low budget westerns in the B queue that Ken Maynard did in the 1930s, and I'm constantly amazed at how poor the actor he was. How did he become a cowboy actor? They say he could walk very well in the silences, but he does nothing particularly impressive in these latest sound films. Still, maybe he got the calls because he was big and could walk. <br /> <br /> Phantom Rancher is not as bad as some of the other Ken Maynard movies I've seen, but it's still not much. Some of the other characters refer to him sometimes as a "young boy," where it seems to me that he is as old as the other older actors. <br /> <br /> And if that's not silly enough, there's a pretty significant script problem in this movie. At one point, one of the characters makes an observation about how the ghost prevented the poisoning of a well, something that had not yet happened. Only a few minutes later, we see the scene in particular. No, it was not a flashback. At first, I thought that perhaps when Treeline Films was downloading the DVD, they might have reversed two of the rolls. But in those days the film rolls contained about 11 minutes of film, and the full reversal took only 3 or 4 minutes at most. Everything else was logical. So it seems that this was a genuine problem of continuity in the original film. Maybe that's the reason why Colony Pictures did not last long.
