Wow, what a cheesy movie! It starts looking like it's going to be a sertanejo slasher, with the camera following dogs running through the forest. Then it gets a bit boring and follows the story of some girls moving into some house haunted by Indian spirits. We then took lots of pictures of a partially dressed girl and another naked girl in the bathtub. Suddenly, it gets really tacky when the "zombie Indians" come up from the earth and start terrorizing the girls. We even have an Indian samurai. <br /> <br /> This movie starts very annoying, although I have found the history of the four Indians who buried themselves alive quite interesting. Once the Indian zombies (or whatever you want to call them for they are not technically zombies) start to terrify the girls is when all the fun begins. This is not a special movie and can not be taken seriously, it's just something fun to watch when you're bored or when you're drinking with friends. I can not help but think that it would have worked better as a short story, because the first half is tediously annoying.
