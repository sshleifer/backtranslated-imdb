This movie has lots of action and little heart. Let's forget for a minute that almost every aspect of the Russian Revolution is wrong - after all, we only have less than an hour here to tell our story. In fact, the tsar abdicated after World War I, and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until Leninists seized power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war. Now, let us return to our history. <br /> <br /> Here we have the revolution being "rumors" in Russian newspapers in what still seems to be a functional country until violence suddenly erupts and ends the life of the noble Baron Nikita Nikki. Krasnoff (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.). He flees from his home with his ex-servant Tanyusha (Nancy Carroll) in tow, and they begin to make a new life in Constantinople. Before the revolution, the Baron used to play a game for the girl, not out of passion, but out of boredom as a kind of amusement. The revolution does not change that, and he keeps trying to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl. It certainly does not make the public like this guy to see him playing with her. Tanyusha follows the Baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries take over the Baron's house, and she knew no other life than wait for Nikki's hands and feet. Once in Constantinople, Nikki quickly gets tired of life as a poor worker, and that's when he meets his former lover, the Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina, who has a plan to take them to Paris, where the Tsarists gathered after the revolution. Unfortunately for Tanyusha, Vera's plan does not include her. <br /> <br /> This film succeeds in completely ruining the considerable talents of actress Nancy Carroll. She does a good job with the little she's given, but that's not much. Lilyan Tashman is the highlight here, although she has only a small role as the Russian vampire Vera. Lilyan was as often accepted as she is here, but her earthy voice and glamorous appearance make her the center of attention in every scene in which she appears. Guy Kibbee even appears in a humorous piece as an American tourist who is curious about the Russian royalty he was forced to eject from his homeland.
