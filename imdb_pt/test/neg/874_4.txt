Is not it a bomb? The only thing missing was enriched uranium. In fact, the script "might" have worked if the lead roles had been presented to younger actors, but the drama of an aging Diane Lane, acting like she was a teenager (or even in her twenties), was too much to the stomach. Every time she (Adrienne) jumped into Richard Gere's arms and pulled both of her heels back, I could almost see the grimace of pain on his face, while he probably thought, "Oh, my back pain ... that cat. it sure weighs no more than 50 pounds! "Anyway, both characters were clearly unpleasant, especially Richard Gere: an engrossed plastic surgeon (Dr. Paul Flanner) who was in some sort of" soul-searching "after an operation with a dead patient (an older woman from a small farm). Then there was her husband and angry son with whom he had to deal with to explain what happened. Dr. Flanner is on his way to find her husband angry (at her husband's request) when meeting Adrienne. She has recently separated from her unfaithful husband (shock) and is helping a friend by watching his beachfront cottage. Of course, that's where Dr. Flanner ends up getting and they both end up falling in love with MADLY (especially after she discovers he's a rich doctor and plastic surgeon). Between romantic interludes and a nauseating dance / music routine that Lane (Adrienne) performs while listening to an old LP (without CD's?), Both try to understand how their lives got so messed up. Dr. Flanner was not very much a father either, and he has a son (who is also a Dr.) who resents him for not being there for him while he was growing up. (Of course, Dr. Flanner was more interested in his medical career then in creating a brash and disturbing boy.) To shorten a long (predictable) story, Adrienne helps Dr. Flanner to face his inner demons and confront her husband and son of the woman who died at his operating table (after going for a "routine" cyst removal from the face). Dr. Flanner is finally able to tell his husband (Scott Glenn is extremely nice) that he is sorry for what happened - even if it was all the anesthesiologist's fault. "I told him she was too old for too much juice!" Glenn's character, (Robert Torrelson) seems to accept Dr. Flanner's apology. It's hard to say because your emotional response is so passive at this point that you wonder if he's even listening to the good Dr. or thinking of some area he needs to plow. Increasingly circumspect, Dr. Flanner then decides he needs to visit his son (who is now practicing pro-bono medicine in a third-world country) to mend their relationship. Unfortunately, this means that he must temporarily bid Adrienne away. Of course, while entertaining the natives in Timbuktu, he writes a love letter every hour to Adrienne (who almost faints like a school girl every time she picks up one) and tells her that the hardest thing he had to do was say goodbye to her. Of course, apologizing to Robert Torrelson for the death of his wife was the second most difficult thing. In the end he is slain on a mud freak slide (poetic justice as in the mud pack?) And she gets with only the memories of what could have been ... hopefully no more sequences of Gere / Lane!
