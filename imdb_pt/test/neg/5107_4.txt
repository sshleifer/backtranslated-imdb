When I first heard that there would be The World is not enough video game for the Nintendo 64, I was so excited. When he finally left, I was one of the first to rent it. I rented it for 7 days and spent the whole game !!! The game was easy and gave many tips. A great dissapointing sequel to Goldeneye. Accept my advice and DO NOT RENT THIS GAME. <br /> <br /> Of course guns and gadgets are cool, but you get tired of a leisure watch that seems to have been taken out of the GoldenEye with the exception of being a red color instead of a blue color, sorry for a dart gun, a horrible stunner, and a stupid claw hook that can only stick to things that are yellow and black. <br /> <br /> I think RARE should be made this game instead of EA, which should stick to games that are good at doing, like sports games, and should stay away from first-person shooters and let the teachers do the work.
