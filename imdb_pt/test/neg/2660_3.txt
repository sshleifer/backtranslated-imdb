Nothing could be more appealing than the idea of ​​a good love story with Kristin Scott Thomas and Harrison Ford. The cool and refined English beauty and the hot-blooded American male - what could be more adorable? Well, this is not this movie. Immediately they ruined this by climbing Kristin Scott Thomas as an American congresswoman. This is like climbing Hugh Grant as Babe Ruth. Or Colin Firth as Al Capone. Kristin Scott Thomas is exactly the kind of woman you can not imagine shaking hands with fat addicts in filthy slums, or squeezing into stinking crowds and kissing babies. She would have been far better interpreted as the English widow of an aristocratic senator, the kind that belongs to the hunting club and goes to flower shows, but has no idea how the other half lives. <br /> <br /> So there's Harrison Ford as a normal cop. Surely he is strong enough for the role. But the idea that he is going to romance this dazzling beauty of high society is a bit difficult to swallow. Why could not he be, let us say, a hard-working but wealthy reformist politician with worker roots who inherits the Senate seat of Kristin's late husband? The two are initially very nice to each other, but because of the duty, Kristin is cordial to him, and he, in return, begins to show her one of the cruelest aspects of life - things that her husband has protected her. Her political awakening coincides with the bustling passion of a younger, leaner lover who appreciates her refinement and refinement far more than her aristocratic husband. Now this is a love story! Instead, you gain an empty and meaningless thriller, where the action creeps and nothing happens. Well, there's a ghetto-style "drive by scene," where Harrison is almost dead, but it's so abrupt and inexplicable that it's more like comic relief than welcome. The sky is always gray in this movie, and our beautiful and exquisite Kristin always seems a little chilled. When she should be dreaming of passion, she looks more like dreaming of a wool blanket and a cup of tea! She also seems a little drowsy most of the time, as if she really preferred to be asleep in bed than to Harrison Ford. <br /> <br /> Considering all things, I would say that you can not blame her.
