This very well-made film commits the unforgivable (which is ironic, given the theme of the film). No one entering this movie knows what they are looking for. Worse than that, 3/4 of the way to the movie, no one even has a clue why, because everything up to that "moment" is a different movie. As a fan of the front row of Dutcher's first two films, competing easily for the Top 2 Mormon movies (competing with Saints and Soldiers and now the New York Doll - I saw this in a display), Dutcher made me want to watch your movie for a long time. I was there. I wanted to believe, I believe I would see the next big Mormon movie, one that would hold the Numero Uno place for a long time. But not. Three quarters in the movie made the leftmost curves and dragged me along for something I never wanted to pass. He takes the Mount. The Everest of all moral issues, yes, both, with little time or emotional ability left to approach them properly, but instead beckon to both with a nod to Jesus as if this would turn out all right, instantly. (It's true that Jesus saves.) Do not accuse me of not believing that. This is not Dutcher's problem.) Is the movie filmed well? Indeed. Do the actors act? They acted their pants off. Was the music appropriate? Everything, but whatever it was, was about the final credits. Everything about this movie was excellent except the story, which was so wet and wrong, that everything else did not matter. (By the way, I learned "idiot" from the New York Doll, a very decent show). The third act of the film was neither desirable nor pleasant, nor affirmation of faith. I know Dutcher was turning to do this, but I was so far from the movie that nothing, nothing, could have brought me back. The unbelievable absurdity of dozens of details in the final minutes did not help. Anyone who has been on a mission knows what I'm talking about, especially anyone with a Spoiler Alert is familiar with events involving someone being sent home early for moral and / or psychological reasons. It's as if a parallel universe suddenly pops up where normal rules or behaviors suddenly do not apply. <br /> <br /> There are millions of good things in this movie, but they were created and embellished just to be trampled and thrown away in a setting of "ooh, this really will get them" elitism. So unforgivable. I can only hope that when Dutcher puts the finishing touches on his next film ("Falling", apparently), he remembers that movie critics can only buy so many tickets and that fans pay the bills. That is why the first Army of God was an absolute success. Dutcher's shock and attitude proves that when it comes to the Great Questions, he is above his head, having neither spiritual nor creative maturity, nor the sense of business necessary to take them. I pray, I pray, he learns his lesson, and in a few years he and all of us look back with disgust, and we rejoice that he has taken his head from where the Light does not shine and actually, these and other issues and change the world forever because of it.
