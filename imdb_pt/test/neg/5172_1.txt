Oh, honey, exactly what we need from another Essex-Cockney rubbish effort narrating the rise of the UK footy hooligan / gangster rave that followed, of course, the West 'am (East Londan / Essex style). No one told you that they won the cap of the world? And then, of course, the inevitable downfall in the rave culture of the United Kingdom. Blah blah blah. Why like and who would like to fund a movie like this I do not know, but let's pray it was from private financiers (let's see ex-drug dealers, merchant bankers - we all know how to call them, and the rest of the mockneys) rather than publicly funded media. Hopefully with the recession we will not see something like this again. If we do that, we'll be calling the death knell for British films and of course we'll all be able to blame Britain's Guy Ritchie, Mockney Country's number one gangster.
