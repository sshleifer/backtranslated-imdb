Yes, it's pure junk. It might be interesting for every guy who likes experimental cinema (like me) to see babble and do nothing for almost two hours, but it gets really painful when you realize you actually paid for it. Probably, this is one of those movies that you love watching your complete void and nihilism. I accept this for its shock value, decades before Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction.
