I did not know what to expect when I started watching this movie, in the end I was pulling my hair out. This was one of the most pathetic movies this year ... in fact, in the last ten years. David Dhawan should give up his career as a director. I still have yet to find an original screenplay that David Dhawan has worked on. This was a bit full and ripped off the Hitch. I have nothing against the remakes as such, but this is so bad it makes you even hate the original (which was pretty decent). I can not understand what actors like Salman and Govinda saw in this script. I read somewhere, that this should be Govinda's return vehicle. If this is true then only God can save your career. Salman just exaggerated to the utmost. Govinda, who I think is a very high caliber actor, was completely wasted. Katrina Kaif and LAra Dutta had nothing to do but wear designer clothes and did not laugh or reason. Please stay away this way!
