The plot of this movie revolves around this underwater builder who is a real bastard and he wants to launch his new submarine that can travel thousands of feet deep. unfortunately, he can not. Oh yes, and he is haunted by the memories of his mother and father being eaten by a megalodon when he was a child. the guy meets a very tasty scientist, and they and this crew of about a hundred people depart on the main character's submarine to kill the same megalodon who killed his parents. now the shark in that movie is a really fake CGI shark. basically this is like Shark Attack 3, except most depressing. If you do not understand what I mean, listen. The movie's opening credits show the main character's "home movies" when he was a child with his parents before they were killed, and there is a really sad and depressing piano song playing in the background. you'd expect to see a shark or something. a brief shade of the CGI shark floats every few seconds, but that's all. Also, I do not remember a happy facial expression during the entire run of the film, most of the film takes place in the dark depths of the abyss, where the story gets even more bland, and all the characters (the shark too) die in the Last. I was thinking that Sabato could kill the shark and save himself and the girl, but no, they all die, and the movie ends with the whole exploded shark, and the submarine (Sabato's body crushed and burned on him ). sinking into the abyss. If you are a happy person and do not like being depressed, avoid this movie. if you are the opposite, then congratulations, you have found your movie.
