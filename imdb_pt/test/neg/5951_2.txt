I totally agree that the reconstitutions kill what could be a great show. I admit I had seen 1 or 2 episodes last season and it was not clear that everything was re-enacted. But when I caught an episode recently, it suddenly jumped on my BIG TIME and I lost interest immediately. Then I noticed the warning at the beginning before an episode that followed. Has anyone followed the program closely enough to tell me, have they actually made the "acting" and reenacting more artificial parts on purpose, or did I just not realize it before? I'm usually very good at noticing these things, but the recent episode was so obviously artificial that I practically stumbled over it. Now I have no interest whatsoever in watching and completely giving it up. It simply has no real value, if everything is scripted and acted. And at least lately, it seems VERY badly scripted and acted. The above comment says who cares if it's all reenactments, I do. Without the visual truth, this is just a bunch of "you know what happened, once this guy". It is better to read the information in a book.
