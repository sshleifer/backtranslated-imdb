Finally, I can connect the dots between Return of the Jedi and Phantom Menace. We see here where Lucas lost contact with what made the original Star Wars movies look great and started to come down in the plot, except for the guts that ruined episodes 1-3. This movie is more like one of those 1980s low-budget swords and wizard movies than anything worthy of being associated with the Star Wars saga. As with the Jar-Jar character, this seems aimed at kids (and the toy market). The battle scenes are particularly bad. It was depressing to see the incredible talent of Sian Phillips being so damaging after his classic performance in Claudius.
