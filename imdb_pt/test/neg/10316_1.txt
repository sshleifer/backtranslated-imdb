I broke my own rule by buying this movie from the $ 5.88 box at Walmart. Basically, if a movie has a big star, and you've never heard of it before, it's usually for a reason. Well, in the case of this movie, the reason is because it sucked! They plastered the photo and the name of Sandra Bullock across the cover of the DVD as a bait, and this caused this goldfish to enter. I was thinking of donating the album to charity, or give it to the library, but I do not think I'd like to subject anyone else in the world to this movie. Worst lines: "What do you mean army friends?" "What do you mean, your father?"
