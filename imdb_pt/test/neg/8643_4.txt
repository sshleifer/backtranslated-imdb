I rented this movie because I noticed the cover in the video store. I saw Nolte's time, Connely, Madsen, 40, and I thought "hmm, it can not be that bad". Unfortunately, after watching it, my impression was "not very good". <br /> <br /> It's kind of a ripoff from Chinatown, but the worst part is that, in addition to Nolte, the other team members did not get it. sufficient screen time. But it's a decent movie to see once I think. And Melanie's role was small enough that she did not have a chance to be a nuisance.
