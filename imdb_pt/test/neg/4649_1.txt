The legendary Cameron Mitchell about an actor / makeup artist who is burned by the head of a studio when a drink is thrown on his face while he lights a cigarette. Reduced to a marked mess and wearing an eye patch Mitchell works at the Movieland Wax Museum. He also kidnaps and kills people using a solution that paralyzes them so he can turn them into views. Genuine bizarre bad movie that defies description. Notice how the various wax figures try not to move, observe how the whole tobacco placed in various southern states is consumed, notice things get weirder and weirder. It is a terrible train accident of a movie and you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen. A bad classic movie that will surprise you, even though it leaves permanent scars on your psyche.
