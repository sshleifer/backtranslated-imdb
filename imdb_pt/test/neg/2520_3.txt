I first heard about this movie when Patton Oswalt talked about it on his CD "Werewolves and Lollipops". He said it was a lost classic that is completely ridiculous. Being a terrible movie lover, I knew I was in for a treat. <br /> <br /> This movie is undoubtedly one of the strangest I've ever seen. Certainly one of the strangest movies in the movie. Basically, a demon took human form years ago by a woman, the woman died or something, the demon cried blood, blood fell on the bed, the bed is now owned and now eats. Along with fruits, flowers and chicken, it also has a taste for people. People can range from horny teens, mayors, gangsters, employees, or orgy professionals. There is also a sick guy that the bed has eaten but put his soul behind a photo in the room. <br /> <br /> Most movies allow you to discover the plot through exciting action. Death Bed has another way: it basically tells you through the narration exactly what is happening while slow and unsightly murder scenes happen. Also, I must say that everyone who is eaten in bed is surprisingly quiet. I would think that if a bed is eating you through the paths of a science Thursday experiment, it would hurt a little. I think nerve endings were not invented until 1981 or more. <br /> <br /> The story is crazy, the direction is slow and horrible, the sets are scarce, the acting is quite painful and the brother is one of the unintentionally ugliest actors I've ever seen. It would probably make a great festive movie if alcohol and sluts were involved. Certainly you should not miss it.
