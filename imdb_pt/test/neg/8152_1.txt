Being (somewhat) an independent filmmaker, I really understand what these guys were trying to do and it sounds like a good idea. In the paper. In the 16mm film, though, it's horrible. I did not know the thing was made in the mid 90's because the film was so grainy and bad I would have sworn that this was one of those 30 year old movies where a porn producer tried to get into the market. And the sound! Ugh, I do not know what kind of microphone they were using to record, but it looks like someone is walking over dead leaves throughout the process. I do not think I should judge very harshly, after all, how many feature-length films did my company publish? None but I would like to think that we would have at least a good picture and sound quality to keep up with our poor acting, writing and directing. A + for idea, F-- for execution.
