The scene that defines this movie is when the fat guy resigns, but the evil doctor gives him just one more duty, check out the dinosaurs. Remember that he no longer has this job and therefore absolutely is not paid for it. Keep in mind it's a damn dinosaur and the doctor he should trust is evil and does not like him. But it's still like, fine.This just set the stupidity in this movie.A Melissa Brasselle proves that seriously anyone can get away some breasts and be in movies.I can ride mountain bike between them, but hey, in addition , the people of Paraguay are very cool.Eric Roberts gives his worst performance so far, there is no adjective to describe how bored he is Corbin Bernsen saves what there is to save and you get to cheer for him but they have to follow the formula , of course. And I wonder how much your life sucks when you play as one of the guys in the army? How low can your acting career go? The special effects are so embarrassing ssingly bad you expect a sign saying "Studio 3" to get into the frame.It's not even honest pulp, it's all taken from "Carnosaur" that even sucked by itself.And then I wonder why that anyone is allowed to make a movie.
