"Marathon" has a very interesting premise, excellent ambient sounds and good scenery. Unfortunately, the film, besides these aspects, falls flat on the floor. For a woman who tries to complete so many crosswords in a day, she spends a lot of time standing, sulking and without making jigsaw puzzles. I believe there is more walk shown in the film than your work on these puzzles. Also, while I understand the point of showing so many scenarios, there is simply too much of it. The film is incredibly boring and unfocused. Not worth buying, renting, watching on television or watching in any conceivable way. I lost interest so quickly that I'm not sure why I sat through the entire movie in the first place.
