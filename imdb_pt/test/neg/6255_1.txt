This movie was just plain bad. I can forgive low budget movies for being low budget, but it was not funny, it was not smart, it did not have redeeming qualities unless you really like to look at fake breasts. I do not know what this genre is classified as possibly erotic horror, but if so - well, it's neither sexy nor scary. Tying him in the Slumber Party Massacre movies was useless; I had never seen the previous films, and apart from a scene trying to tie her up, I had no way of knowing who the psychopathic killer of 'Cheerleader' was or why they were bothered to include it, especially since (and I I do not think I'm revealing anything here), it was really obvious that the cheerleader in this movie was not him. As for the real killer? All I can say is lame. Really limp. When you find out why the killer is attacking the team of cheerleaders (and the squad's technician, and two junkies who were on the bus ride they're picking up, and the bus driver just because of this, apparently) you're going to sit down there and will-- WTF? Worst excuse for a wave of murder ever. The "actors" (two hunches for which I added the quotations) generally resembled low-budget pornographic rejections, which they probably were. These poor people trying to invade the movie "legitimate." One of my friends had this to say about the actor who played Buzzy, the bus driver: "He looks like the guy who, you know, really goes into it, and his face is all red and stuff." We had a good time in that. Half the other actors had all the skill and subtlety of the actors in the production of the sixth series of "Annie" I just saw. The other half seemed very bored to death (especially in the deleted scene, this redhead ...), and at ten minutes I was also in the movie. <br /> <br /> Note: the DVD contains a deleted scene, which would have placed the movie from the censorship for the NC-17, had it been left. It was totally free, and as adult entertainment has no quality whatsoever. The only reason to worry about it is to laugh a lot of the evil.
