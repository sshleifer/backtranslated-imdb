The first half of this movie was very good. It was interesting and full of suspense. The second half was really bad. The story of comic book revenge has taken a full turn and we see many comic Nazi characters and some malicious "good guys" detonating them. There is a lot of violence in this movie. I am not scrupulous about violence, but I think it should at least have some purpose in a movie. There was little purpose for violence here except to create a genre film in which we see many people being hit by rifles. Somehow we should have fun with it. <br /> <br /> I've watched Reservoir Dogs recently. There was a film in which violence was effectively employed. It was realistic within the world that the movie created. There was never an exaggerated sound effect. It was a crime movie that went straight. Inglourious Basterds should have played straight, but they did not. I was rolling my eyes at the way the violence was exaggerated with sound effects and extra bullets in the head and face. <br /> <br /> None of the backstage of any of the Bastards is actually explained, they are simply Nazi hunters. We really do not like any of them because they're too busy cutting scalp and throwing people in the face. It's all about "revenge" and very little else. <br /> <br /> There were two and a half hours to work here, but few of the bastards were actually examined in depth. This looks like it was simply a film of pure and simple revenge. We saw that in Tarantino's last film, "Death Proof", that I did not care either. He suffered the same problems. The characters were almost interchangeable. <br /> <br /> The first half again was very good. I wanted to see the feats of Inglorious Basterds in Europe. I was gifted with a very lick movie about the resistance movement plotting revenge against some Nazi comics when they all go to a movie premiere in France.
