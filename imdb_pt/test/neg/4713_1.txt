I remember seeing it in my local Blockbuster and got it because I was curious. I liked movies about mythological creatures. I like movies about werewolves, vampires, zombies, etc. This is based on half-caste, a half-human half-leopard creature that attacks the people of Africa. <br /> <br /> The movie is horrible! The actors are terrible! There is no script! Everything is improvised! The whole thing is filmed at night because they say it's the only time you see it. It's obvious bull * bleep *! They film at night to make it scary. But they could not scare me. After the first person was killed, I put it back in the case and took it back to Blockbuster. One of the most annoying movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now you're probably saying that I have no right to review a movie if I'm not done yet. Well, this is one of the movies that did not deserve to be seen all the time. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10. This is really BAD!
