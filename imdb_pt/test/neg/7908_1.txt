I hate to comment on something that I have not finished, but if I save a person from what I have sat for almost an hour before turning it off with disgust, it will be worth it. <br /> <br /> I decided to watch it with an open mind, knowing it was in the bottom 100. <br /> <br /> Bad idea. I usually love coarse humor, or at least I can tolerate it. I love the so-called "black" comedies. I'm not easily offended either. <br /> <br /> It started well and quickly came down. I laughed a few times (for example, when the main character got stuck in the airplane bathroom), but that was it and did not make up for the strong disgust I felt. <br /> <br /> I did not laugh when the dog was sucked by a jet engine. I usually can not see the mood in dying animals (except at Animal House). I did not laugh at much of the evil either. I hung up after an incident involving a blind man and a baked potato that I do not mind repeating the details, except that the wave of nausea has not yet passed me by. <br /> <br /> Simply put, it was full of smut and just is not funny with almost no plot. This is one of the times when, if you do not have something cool to say, you should get the word out. <br /> <br /> Do not say I did not warn.
