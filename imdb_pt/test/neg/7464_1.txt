Linda Lovelace was the victim of a hatter of sadistic women, Chuck Traynor. I do not understand how having sex with a dog (which is animal abuse, too) can be found to be fun or funny. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was coerced into making these films. I know some people will criticize this comment, but I strongly feel that these types of movies fuel the fire of hatred and more misogynistic feelings towards women. This society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. We call ourselves "civilized," but I think we have a long way to go before we can scratch the surface of being civilized.
