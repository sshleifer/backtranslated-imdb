Reading most of the other reviews, I tend to agree with most of the reviews. The only thing I would add is the disjointed way the film was Directed and Produced. I think some of these new wave movie makers think they're being smart using unusual camera angles (sometimes irregular) and moving from one scene to another. He fits well with these film festivals, and with some of these indie-type critics, but spoils the movie for me. I noticed in the comments, a comment saying that none of these film-makers have become blockbusters. That may prove my point, since the movie has that 'rushed to finish', which makes you wonder why such a beautiful movie seems to be without a smooth flow. As for the commentary on Kiefer Sutherland being a big name to put on the poster, I bet he cringed when watching the final cut. This is a story with real potential, spoiled by trying to be different in its production. Worth watching, but not many would return to a second sight.
