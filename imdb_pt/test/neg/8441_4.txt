Piranha begins as expected, stupid white people will discover new lands and exploit them. I thought for a while it could be a cannibal movie. It begins like many others, showing only photos of the untouched Amazon rainforest. As far as I know, it might be Florida. At this point you imagine some animal mutilation or the natives will appear. Instead, you get the acting talents of William Smith, who acted in LA Vice and Die Hard Angels. He plays the Caribbean, an acclaimed hunter, whom I would describe as Jack Palance Light. He is taller in stature, but not exactly the kindness of Jack Palance. As for the natives, you do not get as many. Where's the bitch? Should I even ask that question? The Caribbean now hunts humans, I think. He really does not chase anyone until the end of the movie, just look at them. The Caribbean competes with one of the tourists on a motorcycle in a super-dramatic Smokey and the Bandit style. The motorcycle challenge happens for no real reason other than an action sequence. I can not tell you how many times I've seen a tourist challenge a stranger to a jungle motorcycle race. Actually never. They live, do they die? Will you mind? Anyone want to run on bikes? Caution: This film contains an extremely dry appearance. My advice is to rent a classic from Jack Palance like Craze.
