I checked it for free in the library, and I still feel stolen. Yes, Sandra Bullock is actually only five scenes, totaling only 5 minutes, and even those are quite painful to watch. The rest of the movie is so bad that you will spend most of the time waiting for it to end soon, but only if you are one of those people who have to finish a movie after starting it. Everyone else will just hang up. Do not worry, you will not miss a thing. Bullock's lines (assuming you've been duped to watch this because your name is stuck in the case) are essentially parrots from other lines of characters, such as this dialogue: Lisa (Bullock) - "Danny, please tell me what's going on. "Danny -" I do not know. "<br /> <br /> Lisa -" What do you mean you do not know? " <br /> <br /> Danny - "I do not know - it's something to do with my dad." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "What do you mean by your father?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I do not know - he fucked or something." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Why am I here?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I'm sorry, Lisa. I do not know." <br /> <br /> (moments later) Danny - "Some friends of my father's army ..." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "What do you mean army friends?" <br /> <br /> See what I mean? <br /> <br /> Bottom line - Just say no.
