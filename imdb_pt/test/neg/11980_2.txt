I'm a big fan of the game Farcry, a big fan. Still occupies a place in my list of the 10 best games of all time! The plot was new, fresh ... A really brilliant foundation to base a movie on ... or so I thought ... <br /> <br /> Farcry the Movie is no less than another attempt by directors to discount in a successful game franchise (see Doom: The Movie, and many more ...). The Video Game begins when the player (Jack Carver) wakes up in a cave next to the sea after being shot by an RPG of an unknown soldier. Jack then finds a communication device where he (Harlan Doyle) guides him through islands, wrecks, forests, facilities and volcanoes, to find his (Valerie Constantine), the whole battle fighting super mutant soldiers and genetically improved animals. <br /> <br /> The movie plays very, very different: 1: There is an unnecessary 30 minutes (1/3 of the film) of "background story" before we even get to the scene of the 'exploding boat'. 2: Jack then walks to the beach, kills some henchmen, then walks away ... Nothing like the game ... 3: There is no communicator with Doyle at the other end ... 4: The "Modified Soldiers "look like albinos with singlets in ... And there were no mutant monkey-like creatures leaping out of the bushes. 5: There are no sun-filled beach scenes, no aircraft carriers, no communication station on huge cliffs, LITTLE refers to any game content (characters / items / vehicles) , in fact no attempt to follow the plot at all. 6: The scene of the game's climax volcano is replaced by an old industrial building. 7: There's a final scene ... where everyone (except Krieger) lives happily ever after ... WHAT IS IT! <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this movie at all costs! If you are a gambler, you will hate this movie going all your soul. It's a movie clearly meant for men, so girls, stay away ... So if you're a 12-29 year old man, you've never played Farcry, and you're not disgusted by the directors' attempts to carry books / games to the movies ... So this is for you ...
