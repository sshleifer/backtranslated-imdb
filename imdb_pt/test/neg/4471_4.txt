Steve Martin has always had my respect for being a very funny comedian and a good actor, and I loved "Plans, Trains and Automobiles" and "Bowfinger" - but "Bringing Down the House" is definitely not one of Martin's funniest jobs, and it does not seem like you're trying to be, which is just sad ... <br /> <br /> I do not know; maybe I did not like this movie because of the fact that I rented it together with "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" and "Phone Booth", both excellent, or maybe it's because I'm much better accustomed to Martin, or maybe either because I'm in a bad mood today ... Regardless, this movie was not very funny or fun, and I never got more than a smile or a weak laugh in the movie Gags, which is really a shame, a since the previews of this comedy were so promising! I was expecting "Bringing Down the House" to be a total comedy party, and I certainly expected Martin's more slapstick comedy and interracial laughter. Instead, we are "treated" to see Queen Latifah swinging across the screen, trying to do her best with her totally uninspired character. The funniest thing in this clunker is Eugene Levy, but even he does not get the screen time he deserves. <br /> <br /> I'd really like to enjoy "Bringing Down the House," but I did not like it and I'd find it very hard to recommend it to anyone other than the diehard Steve Martin fans. Skip this and rent "Airplanes, Trains and Cars" instead ... <br /> <br /> You will have a much better time.
