This kid son of a sequel was terrible to say the least. You would think that production would have been better 10 years after the original was released, however the Retro Puppet Master was not directed or written by the original writers and contained a poor story, lack any empirical connection with any character, and slowly dragged the scene for dinner. Without strong plot buildup, very weak climax, you will find yourself slowly getting restless throughout the movie if you can sit throughout the reel. I could never understand why a horror movie continues to make sequels after the release of its "final chapter." I hardly suggest watching this movie, but if you should not, I would not recommend having someone sit with you.
