I consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies. The more bizarre and imaginative the film, the more blood and courage, the better, and I really fall for cheap movies if they are done the right way. Luther begins well enough ... his origin in the circus, a scary run in a supermarket, an attack by an old lady, and his disturbing occupation of a woman's farm, all set the mood. A hot / sex scene happens when the woman's daughter and her daughter's boyfriend arrive at the house. When Luther steals boyfriend's bike, the movie gets worse. <br /> <br /> The characters are presented with numerous opportunities to: A) save their loved ones, B) get the police to help, C) escape, or (most importantly) D) KILL LUTHER !!! I can not feel empathy or fear for characters who are too stupid to help themselves. Chareters despise the chances of arming themselves with guns and knives while Luther is away. A police officer eventually arrives and is equally inefficient in stopping Luther, even though at one point he has a rifle aimed directly at Luther while Luther cluck and does his interpretation of the Polish chicken dance. I found myself uselessly training my television: "Make sure he's dead!", "He's gone, get out of there!", Or "Just kill him already!" <br /> <br /> Luther is a bloodthirsty savage, but he is hardly Hannibal Lecter. If you can not fool this leader, you deserve what is coming to you. In the middle of the movie, you will become so lethargic with the fate of the malicious that only the morbid curiosity will keep you to last until the friendly end. This movie was considered one of the 101 best Fangoria movies you've ever seen ... Well, Fangoria is half right in the case of Luther the Toto.
