Seriously, I can not imagine how anyone could find a flattering thing to say about this movie, let alone find in themselves to write the brilliant compliments contained in this comments section. How many meth was Bogdonovitch during the filming of this movie? Was he giving a bonus to the actor who spat his lines with the greatest speed and least inflection or thought? The dialogue is bad, the plot atrocious, even for a "crazy" comedy, and claims that the film is a tribute to the classic movie comedy is about the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Cinematography is below the quality and innovation of what was shown by the worst movies made for TV, the acting is horrible (although I get the impression that the flaw is so directly in the director's lap), and talking about what, Did I mention that the direction is so random and inscrutable that it defies the definition of the word? The whole thing is terribly bland (even in the much-besieged world of such mischievous monsters), soul-sucking, a waste of two hours of your life that you'll never get back. Be afraid, be very afraid ...
