I was hoping for a documentary that spanned the science fiction era from 1950 to 1965 and received a big old commercial full of leftist political insinuations by James Cameron and the baby boomer mogul who boosted their own work. "Watch the Skies" in the past referred to the "Giant Bug" and "Space Exploration" movies of the 1950s, including favorites "Earth vs. the Flying Discs", "Thing of Another World" and "Planet Forbidden" as well. such as "Them", "Deadly Mantis" and "Tarantula". There are lower budget examples that are rarely mentioned as "Space Monster", "12 for the Moon" and "Cosmic Man". <br /> <br /> would have been a much better documentary if the few remaining actors, directors, stunts and collectors, in addition to the non-Hollywood boomers of the time, were interviewed. I just wish there was a "0" rating available, since a "1" is too much for the generous.
