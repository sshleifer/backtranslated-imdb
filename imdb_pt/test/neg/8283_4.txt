An interesting horror film with several suspects. <br /> <br /> Includes a typical girl showing off her breasts (Denise Cheshire) as she turns into a swimsuit, suspicious frightening - any of them could be doing the action, it is expected that the chest is exposed receive a pass note (Linnea Quigley), a very unusual forward pass, more bare breasts, an athletic event that will NOT be at the Summer Olympics and a macabre secret. <br /> <br /> It all comes down to a failing end. There is no more. This guy is not going to die? I bet Anne (Patch Mackenzie) does not plan any more home visits so soon. <br /> <br /> If you like horror movies for teenagers, can you be a pervert, even if all the actresses are over 18?
