You know the movie could have been so much better when the animal - in this case a puppy - is the best actor on the screen! The acting in this film is so bad, so amateur, that the dog was embarrassed watching this. He ("Rusty", our Golden Retreiver) could have done a better job than the people here. <br /> <br /> So far, this is almost a banal story: boy meets animal, pet is neither desired nor desired by one of the parents, but the "pet" ends up saving one of the children and is now a hero and an official member of the family. Sound familiar? <br /> <br /> I remember that this movie was a great success, but I never got to see it until the mid 90's on VHS. I was shocked at how bad it was. Why so much noise in a movie? Was it because there was so much suffering in the early '70s that a good family movie stood out in the crowd? Possibly. There was not much healthy entertainment in the 70's, and many people are idiots with funny animal stories. Who could resist this beautiful puppy? I do not. But the film I can resist: it's a Grade B story with horrible acting. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for small animal lovers and I mean "lovers" because even the owner of an ordinary animal will fall asleep trying to watch this movie in this day-and-age.
