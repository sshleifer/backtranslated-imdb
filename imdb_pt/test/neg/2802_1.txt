I was at Blockbuster and saw a movie called "Dark Harvest". The cover art looked great, the plot was not so bad, and the slogan (You reap what you sowed) made the film look pretty good. But I was stupid that day because I did something I should never have done. I rented an "Independent Video Horror Movie Straightforward" Walking on my very best rents, I went home, put Dark Harvest on the DVD player and it started. I realized that I would watch the trailer after the movie was made (BAD IDEA), but I went ahead and watched it anyway. NOW for review. * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * First, the acting of the "boys" sucks, and the scene when the 2 (main characters) are talking, the lighting is terrible, and the buildings even look fake! Now they go to this house, where the relatives of Sean Connel (I think he is the main character, I do not care) lived there. Suddenly, one by one, they all begin to be killed by ... (sigh) A KILLER OF KILLER !!!! AHHH!!!!! The scarecrow is obviously the low-budget setting, and the scenes in which the scarecrow is computerized seem so fake that they are hilarious. It makes dinosaur noises and everything! And then in the end ... they shoot the scarecrow with a gun (which is red for the love of god and looks like it was bought in a local dollar family) and it stops for a while and then ... (sigh) EXPULSION! !!!!! <br /> <br /> Save time, I'm saying this movie sucks. if you need to spend an hour and a half, look at the wall, because looking at the wall is A + fun compared to that mess. It's very funny, though. General grade: F If there was something minor ** F - ** Than I would give it.
