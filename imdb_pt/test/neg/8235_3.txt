Luther the Geek (1990) is a boring horror film and is really bad even by Troma standards !! It's about an aberration that bites the heads of chickens and kills people by biting their necks, and he really thinks he's a chicken himself !!!!! Luther is released from prison after 25 years because apparently he has been a "model" prisoner and deserves another chance in life (which is VERY hard to believe after you see how he acts and treats people throughout the film). After killing an elderly lady in a supermarket parking lot, he manages to sneak into a woman's car, and continues to torture her, his daughter and her daughter's boyfriend at his family's home in the country. <br /> <br /> So we're treated to a long, boring film with a horrible performance all the way before a useless cop appears to try to kill Luther once and for all !! Oh, and the film has a ridiculous and laughable ending too !!! I love low budget horror movies and I think "The Toxic Avenger" is a classic of all time, but I'm afraid that Luther, the Geek, is boring, illogical and boring, not too gore too, just a few bites in the neck and that's about it! 3/10
