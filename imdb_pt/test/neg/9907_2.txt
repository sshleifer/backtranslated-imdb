The only reason I know this movie exists is because I wanted to see what Nancy McKeon had done since The Facts of Life ended. When I looked for her name, this relatively new TV movie came out. After much research, I was able to locate a copy and was completely disappointed by what I saw. D acting degree, bad script, terrible effects - it was like watching a more stupid version of the Day After Tomorrow that lasted 3 hours. Despite the long running time, the characters remain relatively underdeveloped, we do not care about them at all and in most cases we long for their death. Combine this with terrible lighting and cinematography and you have a real disaster of a movie. How they convinced so many actors of "names" (ie Dianne Weist, Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy) to appear in such garbage is mind-boggling. In short - I want those 3 hours of my life back !!!
