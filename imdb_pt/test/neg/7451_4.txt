This movie started great; the first 30 minutes are very funny and clever with some interesting characters. That's the good news. The bad news is that the film gets too repetitive and completely stupid. <br /> <br /> What we end up getting is a Santa Claus with "magic" powers, with many New Age nonsense thrown into the mix. It's just ridiculous and hardly the kind of "Christmas movie" I would expect from Jim Varney's "Ernest." <br /> <br /> To be fair, I still had a decent amount of laughter and it's free of profanity, but not a movie I could recommend.
