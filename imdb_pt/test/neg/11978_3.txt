So I'm not a big fan of Boll's work, but then again, not many are. I liked your Postal movie (maybe I'm the only one). Boll apparently purchased the rights to use the Far Cry long before the game even ended. <br /> <br /> People who liked to kill mercenaries and infiltrate research labs on a tropical island should be warned that this is not Far Cry ... This is something that Mr. Boll planned together with his legion of schmucks .. Feeling lonely on the set Mr. Boll invites three of his countrymen to play. These players use the names of Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller. <br /> <br /> Three names that really made them very big in the movie business. So the tale is like this, Jack Carver played by Til Schweiger (yes Carver is German everyone salutes the bratwurst eating guys !!) However, I think Tils acting in this movie is pretty fucking .. People have complained about how he is not actually staying true to Carver's entire agenda, but we only saw the carver in a first-person perspective, so we did not really know what he was like when he was kicking a **. , the plot in this movie is beyond the demented. We see the wicked mad scientist Dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier, making genetically-modified soldiers or GMS as they are called. Performing your top-secret search on an island that reminds me of "SPOILER" Vancouver for some reason. That's right without palm trees here. Instead we took some woods of rich and pleasant woodcutters. We do not even go out before I start screaming (mehehe) I can not go on anymore ... If you want to stay true to Bolls nonsense, then go and see this movie, you will not be disappointed to deliver the true Boll experience, meaning Most will suck. <br /> <br /> There are some things worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good job in some areas of the film, such as a beautiful boat and fight scenes. Until all the chromed / albino GMS squadron comes on the scene and everything just makes me laugh .. The movie Far Cry smells of oddity (this is poop to you simpleton) from a fa, r if you want to take a good bit forward .. BTW Carver Gets a very annoying helper that makes you want to shoot him in the first three minutes he is on the screen.
