dear god I suffered having to watch this movie FOUR times in my sisters house and it was terrible a story of sex and weapons and inexplicable action very cheap unless you are under the scope of a gun being told to watch it avoid Ja Rule proved that he can not act Ving Rhames also gave the most terrible acting of all his films, there was not a part of this movie that made me laugh or made me jump or feel any emotion I would be surprised that people really liked it, I look like some terrible movies in my life but that would be in my five worst movies since the music was not good and the story I think was invented by a couple of guys who ordered a pizza and sat down wrote ten points and then did an absolutely terrible movie
