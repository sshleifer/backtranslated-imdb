I saw this movie when it first came out at the movies. We were all anxious to see Mark Hamill relaunch his career, but we left wishing we had not bothered. A lot of people left after about half an hour - I wish I had too. The basic premise seems well, but the plot has been ridiculously involved and tortuous, and runs out midway. It's completely memorable, not a movie you want to have paid to see. If you're really bored and you're on TV, then it'll help you kill a few hours (or help you doze off!). 2/10
