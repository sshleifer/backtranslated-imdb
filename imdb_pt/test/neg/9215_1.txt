In my opinion, the end is what completely ruined the whole thing. The initial idea of ​​having someone suddenly realize that they were the son of God and the second coming was a little clever. People began to believe that he and his friends became the new disciples. People went crazy, demons were having people, all kinds of fun. Of course everything went wrong. It was bad enough that they had to take on the impossible task of examining a vast amount of writings to find the "third testament" in five days, but in the end it became that ridiculous humanistic fantasy. I will not ruin everything, but I will say it is as if it had been written by a teenager with a very limited knowledge of theology. I hear they are doing an American version of this story, I just hope they change the final eye.
