Having appreciated Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqatsi, I was anxious for this third part of the Qatsi trilogy and see what direction it had taken. Rarely has a film so spectacularly failed to live up to its predecessors and lost its way. Although it attempts to represent "civilized war" in the form of sport, science, commerce, and other forms of competition, it lacks the global scope and even the coherently developed themes of its predecessors. War is chaos, but even wars have one goal in mind and this film has little structure and unclear objectives. <br /> <br /> Naqoyqatsi is flawed for being a chaotic mix of pictures that little does to develop your theme. On the plus side, he wisely avoided using some of the iconic images of the wars of the last century. <br /> <br /> Naqoyqatsi is also so insular that several times I had to remind myself that I was not watching an ad promoting the American movie. lifestyle. Perhaps this insularity reflects the current "War on Terror". In representing "sport as war," the team's prominent logos ensured that the US was portrayed as the winners. So missed the opportunity to portray some of the many sports around the world and show that humanity is united in its use of sport as a form of civilized war. <br /> <br /> In addition to the news, the film seemed to have been shot in a budget on the edge of New York and there was little recognition of "life as war" in the rest of the world. The waxworks gave only a nod to the existence of important characters outside the US. The creators have lost the point that globalization does not mean Americanization. <br /> <br /> Philip Glass's soundtrack sounded like any other Philip Glass score I've heard (with the possible exception of Koyaanisqatsi) and at best can be described as "harmless", neither adding nor diminishing, the chaotic image.
