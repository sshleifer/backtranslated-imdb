As a Spanish tourist in Los Angeles and a lover of fanatic films, I made a terrible mistake. I went to see "The Women" The remake of one of my all time favorites. I have seen the original many times, in fact I have it. My rush to see the remake was based on Diane English, the woman responsible for "Murphy Brown". But it was: how bad can it be? She must know what she's doing. Well, I do not know what to say. I do not understand what happened. Botox women are a rather depressing subject. Meg Ryan or who played Mary - she looked like a grotesque version of Meg Ryan ... another actress perhaps wearing a Meg Ryan mask - she brings nothing to the character than Norma Shearer did in 1939. The new is a weary little prototype convincing of what has become a farce within a farce. "Friends" Annette Bening, Debra Messing and Jada Pinket Smith are as disconnected as anything I've ever seen and if that was not enough: Eva Mendes as Crystal, the character created by Joan Crawford in one of her best and funniest performances. . The cast of Eva Mendes is, in fact, the poster of how wrong, how ill-conceived this commercial attempt appeared. I did not give a damn about Candice Bergen and Cloris Leachman
