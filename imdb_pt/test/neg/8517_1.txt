I saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual shit a few years ago, and now he's going back to the local movie theater. He uses every clich√© in the Beginner Edition to look as intellectual as the director probably imagines. You get your slow tempo in slow motion, brown color scale, slow panoramas through bombed environments, blank, suffering facial expressions, overly symbolic images and the unfortunate end required. <br /> <br /> It's a complete flaw, a perfect unintentional caricature of the typical Russian art film. The director, Aleksandr Sokurov, has excellent command of the technique, but he has no eyes. He does not see when he crosses the line into the realm of the pathetic. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wet dream for those who hate art films. It lives up to every stereotyped view of the genre that exists. <br /> <br /> If it were bad in a fun way, it would be a turkey. But for a movie that is so bad that you leave after, we need a new term. This movie is a Sokurov.
