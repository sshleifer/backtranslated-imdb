That's total. If you pick up The Devil's Rejects and suck it all up nicely, and add a bunch of twisted bondage pieces, some rape scenes, and like one or two sincerely creepy scenes, and you would get this movie. People are calling it a ripoff from '86 The Hitcher, but I do not see any of it. Even Hitcher's worst mistakes are still better than this. The main problem on display here is that there is really nothing here other than some of the director's fetishes being displayed as circus exhibits. Is all you need a movie of girls being abused and tied up, shrunken with fear? Well, rent this movie! <br /> <br /> However, I'd rather just watch a good movie, which clearly is not. The sad thing is that there are some really good emotions waiting to be discovered here, but only a few. For example, the suspense in the beginning before the absurdity of slavery began ... very good if you ask me. And the scene in which the cartoonist kills the nymphomaniac (can not remember the names) is chilling, very brutal in some ways, even challenging The Devil's Rejects to unbridled fury. Why the rest of the movie can not be that good? There is? I really need to stop renting stupid crap like that. Final message: Just let this garbage dump die and forget it forever. Not recommended.
