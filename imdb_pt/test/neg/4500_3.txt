Gamera vs Viras was done lazily and much of what suffers as a result. <br /> <br /> Space aliens try to dominate the Earth and are stopped by Gamera. So they send another ship that manages to kidnap two boys. The aliens then take control of Gamera and lead him to attack humanity. <br /> <br /> First of all I must say that I really enjoyed the monster fight at the end between Gamera and Viras. Viras looks like a big squid with a beak. He does not have energy weopons and does not fire any lightning bolts, but he can close the appendages over his head to make a sharp and sharp weopon. So overall, this is not a bad monster for the Gamera to fight and it's decent. Viras really hurt too much Gamera stabbing his bottom of his shell with the pointed head and I'm surprised that Gamera was able to survive it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Gamera vs. Viras decided to use footage from previous Gamera movies to fill the time for this movie. They show the battles between Gamera and Barugon and Gamera and Gaos when the aliens look at the previous battles of Gameras. However, when they show the battles of Gamera with Gaos, they show the battle between Gamera and Gaos in the first city, so they show the final battle between the two. After they show the reused images of the final battle between Gamera and Gaos, they show the FIRST battle between Gamera and Gaos !!! Talk about showing battles in non-chronological order. They did not even have to show the first battle they should have just stopped after they showed the final battle between the two. <br /> <br /> Another issue is that they decide to show scenes of Gamera attacking cities when the aliens order him to attack Tokyo. Then they show the scene of "Gamera vs. Barugon" where he destroys the dam. After the show scenes of "Gamera The Invincible", that's a big problem for me. Mainly due to the fact that "Gamera The Invincible" was in black and white !!!! Using images from a black and white movie in a COLOR movie is really lazy and that's not a good thing. <br /> <br /> Also the dubbing is bad again. The two kids are not as annoying, but it would be nice to see a Gamera movie that does not involve kids. <br /> <br /> Thus, excessive use of footage from other Gamera Films is a deterrent to this movie. The final fight is incredible, so basically I recommend jumping for the final ten minutes and watching this movie. The rest is something that has been seen before.
