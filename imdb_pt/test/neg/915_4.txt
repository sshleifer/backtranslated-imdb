It is difficult to assess the first effort of a writer / director. After all, it's more of a movie than I wrote or directed. James Hunter wrote a story that was interesting but suffered with an uneven flow. <br /> <br /> After all, the idea that a man (Ja Rule) has to choose between bandit life and go straight is common, and even fall in love with the daughter (Tatyana Ali) of the man you killed was made. Doing it again requires something that is original, and originality is missing in this film. <br /> <br /> I was attracted by the inclusion of so many favorites: Aunt Carrere (Trues Lies, Wayne's World), Pam Grier (Jackie Brown), Frank Langella (Dracula, Good Night and Good Luck) and Ving Rhames , Dawn of the Dead). They did not disappoint in their performances, but they had little to work on. <br /> <br /> Direct video is becoming more and more common, but that does not mean it has to be a waste of time. Maybe Hunter's second job will be more enjoyable.
