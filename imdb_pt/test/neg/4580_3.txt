I just saw the movie tonight on a preview and it's a kid-only movie. It does not improve or add to the original Disney movie anyway. There is a flamboyant Scottish pastiche style throughout, not aided by weak writing (where motifs are grouped by the spadeful) and acting that is patchy and often uninteresting (despite what looks like a decent cast). I have no problem with the wee dog - although there is a certain "Skippy the Bush Kangaroo" (see below) quality about his shots. <br /> <br /> * For those who do not know, "Skippy" was an Australian children's TV series from the 1960s, where kangaroos would be an essential part of every story. It is said that, to make poor old Skippy "act", they put a rubber band around the muzzle, which he tried to pull off with his paws - sort of seeming to be communicating with the human actors !!! Bobby has a similar scope and you simply do not buy his series of heroic rescues. <br /> <br /> The advice would be to take children between 8 and 12 years. Below that, they may be afraid. Above this, whether they or you love, good luck to you, but this is strictly cardboard clipping-film making for the less demanding. It's a missed opportunity as there is a real pathetic and cuddly in Bobby's story and this movie can not deliver it.
