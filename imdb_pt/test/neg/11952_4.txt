This movie had all the potential and results of a great feel, a great love story ... the cast is perfect, the visual work, the original premise works, the characters work .... but the story moves from one chess move to the next in the most predictable way ... no character in the film has depth or depth explained by the director. All we know about Catherine Zeta-Jones is that she's obsessed by her world ... no one is allowed and no one defies her world ... this is obvious ... but the remaining characters have their own dimensions never been explored or exposed ... The character of Aaron Eckhart had a lot more to offer for the story, but it was not allowed, Abigail Breslin's character is so easy to understand that his performance is a little predictable and false ... in the end everything comes back to the turbulent and strained world of Catherine Zeta-Jones, for whom the audience never quite falls in love ... honestly, her turbulent world is not much more than a selfish, obsessed and spoiled picture that most people would not have much time or sympathy for the real world. The director needed to make her a hero and never do .... in the end, it's Eckhart's character who ultimately wins because he wins. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, just a movie that could have been much better with more depth of personalities allowed, explained and exposed. <br /> <br />
