I rate this as the worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> If there ever was a movie that I would wish on my enemies, that would be it. The plot is ridiculous, there are only 2 characters, and the coincidences between these characters just force belief. <br /> <br /> These factors combined to make this movie an extremely boring film. <br /> <br /> Wife and mother left in the film about 15 minutes. I realized that such a boring, slow movie must * have an interesting twist, and was quite disappointed when nothing exciting materialized. <br /> <br /> Briefly, I considered sending the filmmakers an invoice for my 2 hours of lost life.
