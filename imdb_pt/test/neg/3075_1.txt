Years ago, I got a well-made TV movie titled "Linda." It was made in 1973, and starred Stella Stevens in the title of Femme Fatale. Imagine my surprise when, over ten years later, I once again saw the same story unfold on TV late at night. However, it was this 1993 version, starring Virginia Madsen. Do not get me wrong, I can deal with remakes, even obscure ones. But this poorly written and poorly filmed retreading made me feel sorry for Madsen and co-star Richard Thomas. Unlike the original, the dialogue here is clich√©, making me think, "Why did they bother to rewrite it?" Second, camera work is very heavy, and the film stock is poor. Sometimes I remembered the student film competition at the beginning of Christopher Guest's "The Big Picture." Finally, the cast seems bored (Madsen) or suffering (Thomas). In fact, the only one who seems to enjoy the job is Ted McGinley. Of course, with his hair perfectly combed and his teeth covered, he's really distancing himself from his previous work on "The Boat of Love." Bottom line, to get a critique of Opus the Penguin in Bloom County: "This film does for the film what Jonestown did for Kool-Aid." <br /> <br /> Thomkat
