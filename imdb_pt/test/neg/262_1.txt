There is no redeeming quality for this movie. They did not check a single fact - not one about ... anything. I'm sorry for Larry Miller, and more so for his agent for not being able to find a better place for him. <br /> <br /> Adults are all idiots. The effects are cheesy and devoid of any sense of reality. The music is honestly tacky. The plot is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I want to see something good with your family, see anything else. Take some time and check for mold in your attic. My ten-year-old son is teasing this movie while we watch. He is unfortunately learning that not every movie is worth watching.
