One of the worst movies ever made ... If you can get through these movies without falling asleep, then you're doing great, considering that no matter how much you turn up the volume, you can not hear what the 'actors' are ? saying and if you can see what's happening from the terrible movie (I mean, hell, if you can not find anything that works better ... use a domestic movie camera ... AT LEAST YOU CAN, DIGITALLY, SAY WHAT IT IS HAPPENING!) <br /> <br /> It is beyond my imagination how people make a film like this to escape the cracks, and escape on video ... and still more ... how do people do not know the how terrible it is ... good god ... (!) <br /> <br /> After what I just told you ... If you're waiting for me to give you a summary of this piece of junk, there is nothing to tell. .. a group of motorcycle campers get lost in the woods and a lot of people terrorize them ... or something ... what is more an action movie than a horror ... this 'movie' (?) is of no interest ... i If someone really likes this, I literally feel for you .... Absolute garbage ... not even one of those cheap and funny movies to watch the rent .. 'Plan 9 of the Outerspace' and have a ball
