If you're making a movie from any book, make sure the characters are consistent with that book. This film not only challenged the biblical story that was told for thousands and thousands of years to children in one way or another but clearly took liberties that no adaptation would likely tempt. At least the Lord of the Rings is close enough to the books that people most understand the story if they read the books than this "Noah's Ark" tried.
