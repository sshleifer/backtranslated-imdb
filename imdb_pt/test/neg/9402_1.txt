Please do not go see that. I had several laughs throughout this movie, but they were all due to unintentional comedy. <br /> <br /> There were only three characters in this movie, so it was amazing how bad the character's development was. Pacino played Pacino again and got worse most of the time. The scenes in this movie look like they've been put together from 20 other bad movies by a very poor editor. There is no continuity, and I found myself wondering why I did not leave it for 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> I would suggest never seeing a film directed by D.J. Caruso. That really was awful.
