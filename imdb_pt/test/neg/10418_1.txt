I'm sitting here writing this review and the movie is not over yet. Actually, I just checked and it's 45 more minutes left. But no matter, there is no need to see until the end. I'll write this review and laugh while the movie hits the bottom and you're faced with some sort of presumably awful conclusion that I do not mind seeing or knowing. <br /> <br /> What explains my history hostility to this movie? The characters are not credible. The plot is not believable. The pretense of the film is sick. Basically, all elements of the movie are fake. Buscemi obviously thought he had something to add to the dozens of films that have explored the worn-out themes of dysfunctional families and the apparent lack of meaning in life. However, Buscemi was very much mistaken, because this movie does not contain anything new. It is very difficult to be depressing, but fortunately no one can be depressed about it, because it is obvious that there are no such people around the world. <br /> <br /> What is depressing, however, is the knowledge that somehow this movie has been voted several undeserved prizes. Disgusting!!!! In short: stay away from this worthless movie at all costs.
