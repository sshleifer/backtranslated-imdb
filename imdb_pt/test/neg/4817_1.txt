Totally cerebral action, made in the Philippines. This belongs to the mode of Filipino films that have tried to become like American films in the international market. After a bland start, the movie takes off and never disappoints. In fact, it's a copy of the worst movies Chuck Norris ever made: an American prisoner in Vietnam is brainwashed by the Soviets who implant a microchip in his brain so he is programmed to kill the pope, then US president. One of his old friends (played by the faithful Max Thayer) is sent to stop him. Completely ridiculous action scenes, putrid acts (Nick Nicholson's performance as the evil Soviet commander is unmissable!) And an implausible plot compensates for one of the most cheesy action images ever given to the general public.
