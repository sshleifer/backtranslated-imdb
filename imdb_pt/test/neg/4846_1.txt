I had never heard of Dead Man's Bounty when I saw it at the DVD store a few weeks ago, and I thought I had stumbled upon an unrecognized jewel since it had Val Kilmer in a truly unique role. Unfortunately, it was not more than ten or fifteen minutes in the movie that I realized that this is a disaster of epic proportions. The first clue you'll see of how this movie is genuinely horrible comes close to the start when you have a bunch of dirtbags in an old bar laughing like a bunch of hyenas in a scene that lasts about five times. It's unbelievable how bad it is. And, unfortunately, it does not get any better. Val Kilmer appears prominently on the cover of the film, perhaps to get him to think he has a part in the film, but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man is forgotten in favor of focusing on one bunch of silly bandits and the most inept conceptualization of a single-city sheriff I've ever seen in a movie. He is played by Boguslaw Linda, who is unable or uninterested in covering his Polish accent, making it immediately impossible for the film to be performed in the old American West. <br /> <br /> Does Poland have such a border? I do not know. My knowledge of Polish history is not my strong point, but I can tell you this, the sheriff, as is known in the film, is the worst representation of the police I ever remember seeing in a movie. He is presented in a truly ridiculous scene where he is wearing some kind of blindfold and a room full of men taking turns punching him in the face. Before they start attacking him, he explains that each can hit him once, and after the first round, each will hit him again, and if he can identify who is punching, he loses. What the hell is this crap? I'm completely at a loss to explain why a scene like this would ever be placed in any movie. Throughout the film, the sheriff continues to appear more and more beaten and bruised and drunk and beaten, until at last he does nothing but occasionally appears, stumbling on the screen and mumbling "no. "without ... the law?" You see, there is a lot of talk and preparation for a hanging, whose details are as meaningless as the rest of the film. It happens, by the way, in a city which consists of nothing more than two wooden buildings falling apart, facing each other across a flat piece of land that is more a path than a road. My understanding is that it is a part of Poland that must seem quite accepted as the American Southwest, where none of the characters except perhaps the dead could have come. <br /> <br /> I have heard that Val Kilmer accepted the role because he was intrigued by his unique role, and also with the use of the dialogue of director Uklanski in favor of a trust in the juxtaposition of Smart images in unique visual assemblies. <br /> <br /> Yes, whatever. It seems to me that Kilimer was unable to overcome what must have been the truly satisfying feeling he must have received when he was offered the role. Personally, I would really feel that I had achieved some level of success if someone approached me and offered me probably a few hundred thousand dollars to come and stand still for a while. I like to think he did not even read the script for this mess, because if I did I would have a complete loss to understand why he accepted the part. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie opens. with a man carrying the corpse of a man, played by Kilmer, seeking the reward. He soon finds himself embroiled in a ridiculous love story involving the town's prostitute, the alcoholic sheriff, and many chaos involving a series of stupid and idiotic characters. <br /> <br /> There is also an extensive and absurd lack of understanding of American rituals. In one scene, a man cuts a cherry tomato in half and crushes the halves in Kilmer's eyes (why, I can not imagine), and then a man makes a brief speech about Kilmer's corpse, in which he explains that he was "one of the best men we ever had," and then he starts cutting his head with a shovel. What the hell?? <br /> <br /> Still not convinced? Here are some more reasons not to watch it. In one scene, the sheriff seems to be covered with ashes except for the perfectly clean areas around the eyes and what can only be described as bright red lipstick. A man gets a head wound that soaks his head and body with blood. In torpor, it cauterizes with gunpowder. Intelligent. Near the end, the sheriff seems to have a broken arm. Sitting at the bar, he puts a rope around his neck and connects it to the injured arm, and uses his good arm to pull the rope, raising his beer glass from his bad arm to his mouth, instead of using the good arm. to drink. Also smart. <br /> <br /> Why does not he just use the good arm? I have no idea. This, like everything else in the movie, does not make any sense, like the title. Summer love? Are you kidding me? Avoid this mess at all costs. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, here's something for the Goofs page for IMDb ?? <br /> <br /> Mistakes made by characters (possibly deliberate mistakes of the filmmakers): This movie was made. THERE IS!
