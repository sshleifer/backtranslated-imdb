They used images of some real protest connected with a woman talking about a society without men to make it appear that these people were applauding the 'genocide' of men. The funny thing is that you can see a man cheering for his own death in the background. <br /> <br /> OK, the plot. One lady says there should be a society without men, and the crowd ahead (which contains some men) thinks it's a great idea. So all the men are dead or something. Then there is more. <br /> <br /> So this blond scientist creates a man, but removes some chromosomes so as not to be violent. The male grows very quickly and soon is a grown man. Not long after, he picks up the Volkswagen Beetle and drives to the city where he discovered it. Now you would think that the lonely man in a city full of lesbians would be the happiest guy of all time, but not at all. The police are after him. <br /> <br /> I did not watch the rest, but probably he ended up running against the clock and some people, or something bad will probably happen. Somehow, the man ends up in a stadium with other men who want him to lead the rebellion. These brave warriors hiding in a stadium might have had some sort of plan that would show the details of how they would individually get rid of a planet full of women, but I did not watch. And neither should you. <br /> <br /> If you wake up late and channel the surf and this happens, do not watch. Note everything but this. You will find these ads for Bowflex or those with women in bathing suits asking you to "pick up the phone to meet women like these" in your area will be more satisfying entertainment. <br /> <br /> (Oh yeah, there's a funny thing when they're getting in with their cars. <br /> <br /> I do not know what they did, it seems they drove very slowly and carefully, but then they tried to speed up the movie to make up, but he looks really weird.) <br /> <br /> The blonde was kind of cute and I feel generous, so ... 2/10.
