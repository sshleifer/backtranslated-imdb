Go to any movie fan and ask them the title of the film that was directed by Robert Wise, with direction of second unit of Yakima Canutt and Sergio Leone, was designed by Ken Adam and marked by Max Steiner, starring Sir Stanley Baker, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Brigitte Bardot, was filmed in color, scope and stereo, at Cinecitta in 1955, with a thousand extras - and they will tell you to leave and stop being silly. <br /> <br /> Tell him there is no such movie. That the names you quoted NEVER worked together - they were not even contemporaries. And that you just picked up the names of a movie publication randomly and are trying to confuse them. <br /> <br /> At this point you can direct them to IMDb and show them the cast and crew of "Helen De Troy". They will be surprised! This lesser-known epic sword and sandal has ALL these names and more - Niall MacGinnis, Janette Scott and good old Harry Andrews. <br /> <br /> And it sure is a weirdo. After the war, a thousand Italian extras cost about $ 25 a day and the toga dramas were a milestone of Italian cinema. The orgy scenes were filmed twice - one with tops, the other without (you can guess which version Britain and America got). I believe that even La Sophia is an extra in this. <br /> <br /> Either way, names get in the way of the mind. But it's really just a coincidence. All these names were just coming to the end of their careers (Canutt, Steiner) or starting with them (all others). <br /> <br /> Only Robert Wise and Niall MacGinnis were in the middle of their careers. <br /> <br /> For the record, Leone was not credited and learned his craft - Adam still had to invent the downward circle in the ceiling sets (a trademark he would put on all the first Bonds) - Baker had yet to star and help produce the likes of "Zulu" and "Robbery" - and continue to direct a Welsh TV company called Harlech - then to die tragically young. While Harry Andrews would continue to become one of Britain's favorite character actors - Janette Scott (daughter of Thora Hird) would never make the big time, but who can forget her in "Day Of The Triffids "(even if your bit was added later - to fill in and a happy ending) or" Crack In The World "? <br /> <br /> Sir Cedric was theater, but he knew how to rob a movie - and Bardot ... it was BARDOT, by gawdsake! <br /> But what were these stellar people doing in this camp, an old nonsense? Do not ask me. The two main stars were unnamed Italians - Helen had a mustache and Paris was beautiful - while the English were there just for support. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I think you can just mark this as a great FLUKE. In stereo. To be honest, if I had not seen - I would not believe it!
