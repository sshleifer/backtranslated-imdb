I felt I had to add a comment after seeing the panting breath of the other review. I was taken to see this movie as a child by my unknown parents, expecting a normal Norman Wisdom comedy. Instead, what you get is that insipid British sex comedy of the worst kind in which Norman (Norman!) Plays a swinger with the goal of getting out with as many "birds" as possible. Absolutely typical of the genre - poorly filmed and acted, without the appearance of a script beyond the worst kind of double entender, and very vague signs of 'naughtiness'. And all seemingly in that special stock of grainy films that is reserved for the British low budget films of the 1960s to 1970s. On the memorable thing is the annoyingly captivating theme melody that still pops in my brain after 30 years . <br /> <br /> Finally, in the last scene you can also see Norman naked - running down the Sand and looking frozen. I think so, at this point my mother took me out of the movies. I saw it again, many years later, and guess what, it was still terrible. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan or interested in his little man and his career, you apply the 10-bargepole Rule to that. Believe me, you do not need to see Norman Wisdom's ass.
