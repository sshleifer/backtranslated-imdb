Leni Riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the nasty propaganda that Moore tries to call "humor." That this film, and the other prevarications of Moore, actually attracted admirers, proves that, unfortunately, it is possible to deceive some people all the time. <br /> <br /> Let's see if we can attract foreigners. Let's see if we can extol obsolete factories. Let's see if we can add to the sum of hate in the world. Let's see if we can pretend we're funny. Let's see if we can isolate Charles Lindbergh. The only thing Moore does not have compared to Lindbergh is a GÃ¶ring medal. <br /> <br /> Of course, in this movie, Moore took a bit of self-deprecation in his work. In this movie, Moore mocks Roger Smith, General Motors CEO, as an indifferent and indifferent elitist. Moore could do that in 1989, but now that Moore has indulged in careless and careless elitism, this characterization of Roger Smith is ironic. Who would not really rather be Roger's friend than Michael Moore's?
