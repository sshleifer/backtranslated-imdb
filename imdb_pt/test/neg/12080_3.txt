<br /> <br /> This film was produced and released as the successor to a horrifying - though quite popular - California beach comedy called Hardbodies, but has little or no connection to the previous film and is best evaluated completely in its film. own right. It is certainly better than Hardbodies I, and it is more related to films like Venus and Summer Lovers, which were also filmed during the summer on the Greek islands. The combination of beautiful beaches in blue bays with gorgeous bare breasts adds insight to the seductive view, but (with the exception of travel diaries designed to help plan your next vacation) even these movies require a suitable plot to draw viewers attention through more than a few minutes. Venus was supported by the legend of the reincarnation of the goddess, and Summer Lovers had as its theme the viability of a menage a trois. In my opinion, both films have been much more successful than Hardbodies II, which has a very tenuous plot and relies too much on simplistic and semi-facial comedy. The use of slapstick quickly becomes tedious, usually leading to a series of small self-contained sequences that are difficult to integrate into a continuous plot. Mel Brooks did this brilliantly with Silent Movie, but few other movies succeeded in the same way, and Hardbodies II unfortunately did not. There is also the problem that the slapstick sequences do not cohabit happily with the idyllic and peaceful setting in which the film takes place. The airport's final strings were undoubtedly intended to provide a hilarious ending to this movie, but in my opinion they are an example of the worst kind of grumpy pseudo-comedy. They're also too long, so I left the movie with a bad taste in my mouth. This is a movie that could have been much more successful with a stronger plot and with most of its very heavily pruned slapstick sequences. As it was released, it certainly does not guarantee an audience higher than 3. <br /> <br /> There is little memorable in the acting, but the cast does the best within the limitations imposed by a row of sparse history and bad direction - it is in the latter areas where failure arises. <br /> <br />
