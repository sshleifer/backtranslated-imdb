Wow, that was hugely annoying. the protagonist (Christian Schoyen) has to be the worst actor I've ever seen. and another thing, if the character in the movie moved to America when he was ten or something and had been living here for over 20 years, he would speak much better English than what he does here. or to say it in my own language "Skikkelig gebrokkent". But it's cool to see Norwegian guys in a movie made in Hollywood. It was a shame they were hacks without talent. The plot itself is below mediocre. I have a suspicion that Christian Schoyen made this movie just to live the dream, as he clearly does in the movie, fucking one beautiful baby after another.
