First of all, I would like to make it clear that I will voluntarily submit to the display of terrible films. I saw what I thought was the worst of the worst. In my opinion, the movies could not get worse than the likes of D.E.B.S., Leprechaun 6: Back 2 Tha Hood and Terror Storm. Until I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> The Pirate Movie, without any exaggeration, is the WORST FILM OF THE WORLD. I was informed before seeing that the film was really horrible, but I did not believe the allegations. Believe me when I tell you that this movie is simply an abomination to the movies. <br /> <br /> It starts with a 3 minute clip of a pirate boat apparently in the midst of a battle with themselves. "The End" appears on the screen. Unfortunately, it's not the real ending of the movie. The film is about an unpopular, awkwardly nerdy girl named Mabel who carries around a ghetto blaster and is attracted to homosexual pirate boys. She drowns and has an overly prolonged hallucination in which she stars as a sparsely dressed skank who falls in love with Frederic, who just happened to crawl out of the ocean. He can really be homosexual. The pirate king has a codpiece studded with diamonds and ruby. He honks and squeaks as he squeezes. <br /> <br /> He's not singing in this movie. You may get the impression that this is a hilarious musical. It is not. Trust me. They are the worst songs you have ever heard, and by the end of the first original song you will be looking for objects to pierce your eardrums. <br /> <br /> There are "references" to other films in Here. By references, of course, I mean "obvious abuses". The inclusion of Indiana Jones, Inspector Clouseau, and the lightsaber were, in fact, anti-hilarious. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is, at its best, painful to hear. The direction is horrible, and at one point you can see the action block in the scene, which is not very well hidden. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if there is even the shadow of curiosity in your mind about this movie, get rid of it. There are times when people want to see how bad something really is, but this movie is not worth it. Put it completely out of your mind and never think about it again. If you cherish your mental capacity, then I beg you, NEVER SEE THIS MOVIE.
