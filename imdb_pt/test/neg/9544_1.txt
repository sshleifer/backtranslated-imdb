I would not recommend this to anyone except moviegoers who like to laugh at a movie, not at it. <br /> <br /> A very promising premise and a set of actors worsens progressively over a movie that ends with perhaps the worst end ever seen in a movie. I will not ruin it, but basically the most used set of movie cliches is done poorly and heart by the most disappointing last five minutes for any movie, ever. <br /> <br /> The film also includes the film. Most of the inducing scene of all time, the screen chemistry attempt between the two main roles, when we came across a close-up of Angela Jolie lovingly caress the finger of Denzel Washington. It may be the only thing he could move but exactly why the viewer is treated with a zoom of Washington's finger being caressed amidst a kind of dim light and the appropriate music for a sex scene is beyond me. I laughed loudly and shook my head. <br /> <br /> The direction of the plot relies heavily on Se7en, but here it runs in a much more simplistic and too obvious way. To call him a poor man Se7en would be a euphemism, this really is nothing more than a feat for the TV movie and even the best efforts of Jolie and Washington can not convince that this is a box office movie.
