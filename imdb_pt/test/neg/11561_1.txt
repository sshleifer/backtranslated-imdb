The Holocaust of the Robots is about the most ridiculous and pathetic attempt to make a post-apocalyptic movie I've ever seen. And I thought the Italians were the masters of miserable aspiring Mad Max. Some of these films like Escape 2000 are positively brilliant compared to this piece of poop. Is the plot meaningless? even with a narrator configuring each scene. And the boy rocks. Scene after scene with nothing of interest going on. The special effects (and I use the word "special" loosely) consist of sock puppets. Yes it's right ?? sock puppets! The acting is terrible. Angelika Jager is in the race for the worst performance I have ever seen. Of course, is she French or German or whatever? but the man is bad. I can not think of a single positive thing to say about the movie. So I'm going to stop there because ten phrases in this trash are ten. Many, and fortunately for me, I saw the MST3K version of the Holocaust Robot. Some of the things that made the movie so bad helped make this episode of MST3K a winner. For an episode of the first season, the riffs come fast and furious and reach their mark almost every time. On my MST3K rating scale, do I give this episode a 4/5 ?? Look for it.
