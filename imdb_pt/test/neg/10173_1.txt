As you can read, the only good comment about this movie is made by someone who really watches over your church! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie had a good science fiction start in movie B, everything was there to make a good entertaining movie, easy to watch, so everything looked like in this brainwashing mode Jesus- go-save-all The story begins with two main characters, two reporters, but it's quick to give the first role to that crazy Jesus who's there to save everyone's soul with this conniving attitude. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: this movie goes from entertainment to brainwashing in about 30 minutes <br /> <br /> Waste of time, waste of money ... AVOID
