Obviously with this movie going straight to the DVD I was not expecting much, but this movie is so bland it's unbelievable. The only part of the movie that you may find funny is before you even get to the island, where Eddie's son is expelled from the bathroom by a jet of water and you're done! Why do they bother? The first Christmas holidays with Chevy Chase were brilliant and hilarious. That is not. They tell jokes about a dog with flatulence, and a character named Uncle Nick, who is about 80 and still trying to go his way with beautiful women. When they approach the island on the boat, the island in the background looks so fake and Randy Quaid, though funny in the previous movie, just gets over it and it looks like he's trying very hard to be funny. You've been warned!
