There is no fun mocking the desperate situation of illegal immigrants! Or the desperate situation of workshop owners in this regard! That the richer than the god Brian Glazer did not see the irony of having the "heroes" doing exactly what the villain does - robbing honest and hardworking people of their life savings - does not surprise me! Hell, how do you think he has to be richer than God? In this alleged satire of greed, these mental dwarves reveal their own hypocrisy: the McMansions, the McToys, the McChildren, the McIllegals who are paid peanuts to take care of the McMansions, McToys and McChildren! But the main problem (aside from the revolting fanaticism) is the premise: as the former executive of a now infamous company, Dick would be the great scalp of all the corporate headhunters in the country! There are no soup kitchens for him! And with six-figure numbers, you'd think he would not get caught dead around a Gore / Lieberman poster!
