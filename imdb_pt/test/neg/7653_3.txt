I watched this movie with a bunch of friends at a Halloween party last night. I have to say that the sarcastic comments never end and I have to say they were well deserved. Although I thought the steering was well done, the madness in your dialogue is just a little too much cheese. I think it took about an hour for this before I even started to realize what the point was that they were trying to drive home. You quickly realize that this whole family is very peculiar and that something is wrong about them, it's a bit too slow. This movie could easily have been around 45 minutes and was much better. The only thing that made it bearable was the two bottles of wine that I drank during the course of the movie. Bring the horror movies, because at least I know what to expect from them. This was not my thing, too dark humor, and the material of cannibalism was somewhat crude and crude. I have to say that Randy Quaid played the role as well as he could have been, and I'll give him what he proposed to do as I usually see him as a drunken drunk or a fainted fighter pilot who likes to kill aliens. <Br/> <br /> In conclusion, I give this horror / comedy movie a generous 3 out of 10.
