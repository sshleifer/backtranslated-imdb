I really wanted Hollywood to come up with new, fast ideas. Instead, they go around, recreate and mess up a perfectly good movie with a remake. This movie is horrible from the DeMille version. All the way through this movie I was saying to myself, Huh ??? - What???? "I do not remember that part. The only exciting thing about this movie so far has been the separation of the Red Sea. And in Heston's version - it was much better than this version. Did anyone else see a nuclear or atomic bomb cloud disappear and disappear when the Red Sea was parting? I think so. Anyway, I could watch the last part tonight. I wish Hollywood would approach different ideas and subjects when they were making new movies. Instead of refueling old movies. <br /> <br /> They must have come out well enough alone. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: <br /> <br /> Well, I watched the last part. Moses made the second copy of the Ten Commandments with his own hand - or I was seeing things - please someone - send me an e-mail and let me know. HORRIBLE
