When Hulk hit theaters in 2003, it did not take long for the DVDs of the old TV show Incredible Hulk to come out in an attempt to profit from the craze. We saw a similar occurrence a year earlier when Spider-Man's drawings appeared on DVD to coincide with the premiere of the hero's big screen. Companies take the opportunity to take advantage of the financial advantages of a hot brand. <br /> <br /> So the fact that this image has never appeared on Wal-Mart's shelves as high-profile heroes beat the box office in the summer. of 2005 says a lot. I think everyone involved would simply prefer to forget. To be fair, FANTASTIC FOUR is not as bad as everyone says. Let me rephrase that. veteran television actor Alex Hyde-White (no, you do not remember any of his roles) leads the way as Reed Richards, the brilliant scientist who, along with his crew, gains bizarre powers after an accident in outer space. He is left with the ability to lengthen and twist his body to exorbitant lengths. His future wife, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab), may suddenly become invisible, while his brother, Johnny (Jay Underwood), may now light up at will. Then there's poor Ben Grimm (Michael Bailey Smith), the lovely lug whose body turns into a steely orange rock mass. <br /> <br /> Just as friends are getting used to it all, they are called to rescue the world from certain chaos. It seems that Reed's old colleague Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) is living up to his name, and that villain Jeweler (Ian Trigger) is not exactly helping old ladies across the street. Can our heroes save the day? Of course they can; Like any superhero movie, it's just a question of how and when. <br /> <br /> What impresses most about THE FANTASTIC FOUR is how amateur it is in almost every respect. The dialogue is so dumb and tired that it seems to have been written by a theater class. The acting is so polished that it makes a third-class novel look like Shakespeare. The special effects are surprisingly good considering the tiny budget but there are still some positive and embarrassing moments. When The Human Torch totally lights up your body, for example, the whole movie turns into a cartoon. I can just listen to this production meeting. "Oh no one will notice, they will be very intrigued by the action!" I mean really, a cartoon? At least give me a burning dummy on a rope! Before that, the scene where the four arrive on Earth after the crash of their spacecraft is pure teenage fun in the backyard. The team simply found a field and lit a blazing vaguely-spawning object. Is this the only remnant of such a disaster? <br /> <br /> Of course there was not much to work on in the script. There is a fairly consistent story here, but it's all so simplified. When Reed and Ben decide to go into space, they simply go to the Storms' house and ask if they would like to join them. Is it really that easy? This kind of thing does not require, oh, I do not know, years of training and specialization? Not in the world of these writers, who seemed to be inspired by the understated genius on display in the reruns of HOUSE FULL. But, worst of all, nothing compares to the painfully cliche of Dr. Destino. He was pulled from the terrible superhero cartoons of the 1960s to the evil laugh and clenched his fist at the table to punctuate his comments. No comic, let alone the Fantastic Four, has ever featured a villain so obscenely one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, FANTASTIC FOUR is saved from being a complete turkey because it is so innocent. You can tell the people involved, such as little talent or experience, that they really tried. They did not know that the end result would be so embarrassing. They were under the impression that this was their big chance, that people would go to the theaters. It is worth repeating that they practically had no money to work (and I'm sure half of it was devoured by the Thing's cool attire). All things considered, they have done well, and for their many shortcomings, the finished product is a good deal of fun for comic book fans.
