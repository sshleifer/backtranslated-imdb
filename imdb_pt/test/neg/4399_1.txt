The Dorm Daze of National Lampoon is easily the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen the movie Kazaam. Anyone who reads this and thinks this movie was good anyway, shape or form has no idea what a good movie is, and should never watch another movie again because they are really so stupid. <br /> <br /> It's hard to name everything wrong with this movie. Firstly, the plot is all over the place and can not follow all the multiple "misunderstandings" very well at all. The acting is horrible to say the least, and the whole thing was poorly made. Anyone who worked on this movie should not be in another child's movie Ever Again! <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to summarize this film in just one or two paragraphs because it is so bad, but for anyone out there reading this, please DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE !! If you want to watch a good movie, turn on anything else on the television. Even the US has better films than that. <br /> <br /> _friend.
