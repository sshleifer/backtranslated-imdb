This is a known fact, Mr. Seagal can not smile, he can act, he can kick the butt, there are weak smiles, no real smiles without laughing out loud and no real point of watching this movie confused. We see an overweight of Mr. Seagal as Dr. Wesley Maclaren, who desperately needs a haircut and his real daughter Ayako made an appearance as an assistant to his office. Story: Okay, so Wesley lives in another desert with his sweet daughter Holly. They sit and enjoy their tea with red flowers and omelets and across the city, a militia leader decides to make the whole sick city spreading a virus that travels through the air and kills in a matter of two days thinking he can survive it had an antidote. Problem, there is no antidote and what exists only holds the virus for a while. The CIA is contacted and even they can not help and only one person is not sick, Wesley's daughter, Holly. Then she is hunted thinking the cure is in her blood. Wesley manages to take his daughter and take her to his grandfather, who is a native Indian. Together with his sister-in-law Ann, they go to a base where there is a hidden laboratory to find a cure, but even the soldiers there are dying slowly and the others too, if they do not find a cure in time. And to shorten the moment, neither Ann nor Wesley are infected by the virus ... hmm. A weak fight scene. A terrible movie and all the men in it are in desperate need of a ladder master.
