I watched the first 10 minutes of this show I think I'm going to throw up now! One of the worst shows on TV. It's not even funny. It's so annoying that it's disgusting. I gave a second and third change could not even spend five minutes. Do not waste time. This is one of the many shows that need to say goodbye. Speaking of regular night shows you need to go. All shows on CBS. All shows on ABC. All the shows on FOX and Joe Buck. All shows on the new CW network. All shows on NBC (Accept the Law and Order series). All morning and afternoon talk shows. All TV shows from the court. And all reality shows out there !! All stupid game show. Final period! All Home Improvement Shows! And all the news from the media. everything is. It's a 24 hour loop of bad news. Yes, I have Monk's favorites, the law and orders that's it for me.
