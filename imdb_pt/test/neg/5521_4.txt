HAPPY DAYS was one of my favorite shows when it aired in 1974. But critics were quick to show their ignorance combined with a total lack of sense of humor for hitting this show because they thought it was a cheap attempt to cash in on success of American GRAFFITTI. <br /> <br /> There were some similarities between American GRAFFITTI and HAPPY DAYS. <br /> <br /> Both opened with Bill Haley's "Rock Around the Clock" and the Comets. Both occurred in a bygone era and both featured Ron Howard as one of the leading roles. But there were also some important differences. While American GRAFFITTI took place in 1962 in California and focused around a group of newly formed students about to take a big step toward adulthood, the HAPPY DAYS took place in Milwaulkee, Wisconson and centered around of a group of adolescents in high school. joys and tribulations of adolescence. <br /> <br /> The HAPPY DAYS originally opened with the juke box playing the original version of Bill Haley and the ROCK of the comets around the clock. But when the old men got hot thanks to American GRAFFITTI's success, and the original 1954 version of ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK, they entered the Billboard Hot 100 and became a hit again in 1974, royalty payments went through the roof. So a "remake" of the song (the correct term is now "new stereo recording") was quickly replaced. <br /> <br /> The current theme song for HAPPY DAYS was then presented for the second season if memory serves me right. <br /> <br /> Fans and enemies agree that this show is an escapist. The freedoms were taken and the details neglected, making this program less than completely authentic. <br /> <br /> This is perfectly fine. HAPPY DAYS is supposed to be a comedy, not a history lesson. But occasionally, writers sometimes tied their necks when confronted with controversial topics. An episode centered around the building Cunninghams of a shelter. Another episode was about a divorced woman moving into the neighborhood with the dream of starting a new life. The subject of prejudice was approached when Howard was invited to the marriage of a former army friend who happened to be black (at a time when prejudice and discrimination were unfortunately an acceptable part of the American way of life). The draft edition has come to a later episode! <br /> <br /> The show was originally released in 1955. One problem that was dealt with wisely was with the cast. Most of them were teenagers and, with each passing year, it was obvious that they grew up, so the series aged with the cast, taking the series from the safe waters of the Eisenhower years to the Camelot Age, all the way with JFK and then on turbulent second half of the 1960s. This, along with the writers running out of ideas, and later, cast members like Ron Howard leaving the series, wisely giving up while they were in the front, left me wishing everyone had done the right thing, shutting down the program and stopping. while they were ahead. This, along with the studio audience's idolatry that simply could not control itself every time the Grande Fonzie came on the scene, began to wear out very fast. <br /> <br /> This show originally portrayed the Fabulous Fifties as us How to Remember This Time. Time heals wounds, you know. Everything has its place, and while I'd rather hear the "original versions" of "new stereo recordings," these "new stereo recordings" worked very well on HAPPY DAYS. And that's when I regret buying the DVD! Unlike the full DVD of the first season, the original song of the second full season was replaced by different music. While it's great that the original episodes have been digitally restored to digital perfection, the removal of the original song destroyed what made this show so much fun to watch!
