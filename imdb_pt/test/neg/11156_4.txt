End of Days, starts well, Arnie plays a cop from the bottom up (a character very similar to Riggs in a Lethal weapon) and the story looks like a kind of serial killer action thriller that will be good entertainment. Unfortunately, he can not deliver, Arnie is as good as we have hoped, but as for Gabriel Byrne, I hope he picks his papers more carefully than that. cast as the devil; this is probably the weakest portrait of the dark lord of all time. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a little too dizzy for me, and the final sequence, besides being very weak, is visually one of the worst things I have. As we have seen in recent years, CGI has been better than this since the early 1990s. <br /> <br /> It just is not good enough. 4/10 (See if you have too, but do not expect too much, because it will not deliver)
