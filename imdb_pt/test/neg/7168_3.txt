Oh God! Book II is more of a bad remake of the original than a sequel to it. It's not so funny, the plot plays a lot <br /> <br /> like a comedy pilot situation rejected, and the use of the slogan "Think God" is a different variation of the idea that worked much better on the original. John Denver did not come back to this movie and it made a BIG difference. George Burns, as wonderful as he was playing God, does not have the same chemistry with the little girl he did with John Denver. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a rating of 3 out of 10, but only for <br /> George Burns, the rest of the cast is nothing special. <br /> <br /> If you loved the first, do not worry about seeing this.
