Even to say that this movie is the best work of Sebastien, just say everything you need to know about the man. Sebastien is a pathetic, silly, entertaining but very popular host on French television. If watching any of your shows is simply a torture for any human being normally constituted, his first (ans leaves only hope) movie proved to be even worse. Sebastien's apology for rape (the victim falls in love with his aggressor) is not only unreasonable, but simply unacceptable. I strongly suggest you do not bother to take a look at this photo (or any of Sebastien's future features), you'd just waste your time ... There's something on French television that does not smell right ... and this is Patrick Sebastien !!!
