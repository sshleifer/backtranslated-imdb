Lately, I've been watching a lot of westerns from the 1930s to the present. There are some low budget spaghetti westerns from the late 1960s and early 1970s. This movie had all the elements of a decent western: a good story with talented actors and everything. Although, it's a parody of that genre, and for me the way it was done just did not work and made a disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> This film can be easily divided into two parts. <BR> The first part is great; has a great opening scene and an interesting story evolves from a bounty hunter (aka the stranger) going after a thug who's going after a large bank charge kept in part by a banker. Throughout the film, these three characters form fickle alliances in an attempt to get the money. There are subtle comedic nods to earlier film plans of this genre, but the comedy does not upset the story as a whole. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie is where the comedy is exaggerated. and essentially spoils the film. The turning point is just in the part where the waitress causally rebukes the dwarf to stop firing at the clients while she waits for other clients apparently oblivious to the four dead bodies scattered around the place. From this point on, the film changes from a decent western spaghetti with comedic tones to a stupid, stupid parody. <br /> <br /> There are three horrible scenes of fistfights (one on the river, one in the market and one in the baths) that follow in rapid succession as if that were not enough. The fight is so false that it is ridiculous and, as the sound is out of sync with the image, it gets even worse. In the scene of market struggles, the banker jumps over the place on hidden trampolines and revolves around poles as if he were in the circus; He's a clown. Although the worst part of these fight scenes is music; is this light and cheerful mix more suitable for a square dance or a tacky episode of 'Hee-Haw'. These scenes practically unfeasible the main story. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was disappointing because it had so much potential as a decent western, but the comic book just mucked up. If you want to see a good western parody, see 'Blazing Saddles'. If you want to see a good spaghetti western, avoid this movie.
