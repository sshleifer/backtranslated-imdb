This is an absolutely horrible excuse for a show. Do people say that you are witty and intelligent? I do not see how? Maybe because the characters use fancy words? Perhaps because they are snobs, they use dry humor and have two-dimensional personalities. I went to an Ivy League school and nobody acted anywhere near as nasty as these characters. In fact, if I had known someone like them, I would probably have strangled them! Men act as little emotional pre-teen girls and all minority characters are based on stereotypes ... The characters are not completely AUTHENTIC. Simply put, they look like a family of trailers trying to be rich and sophisticated. This show is just another hit that prime time viewers regularly eat.
