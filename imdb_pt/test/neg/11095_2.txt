"An evil spirit takes care of a girl and spreads the panic in the museum of the Louvre", that's all I think, the summary of the movie and the movie itself! Which I think is one of the worst French or non French films ever made in film history! Nothing good here except for the song (just credits!), A few moments of tenderness from (Sophie Marceau) and of course the final of the movie. Not because it ends years of what seemed to be an uncountable year we've been watching THIS CRAPE, but also because it's as perfect as a magical CGI job that was too good to be true here! <br /> <br /> By the way, I want to change the plot summary to look like this: "An evil spirit takes care of some moviegoers to make bad movies." Just like this, for sure.
