The incident on and off a Mountain Road is Don Coscarelli's entry into the Mick Garris' Masters of Horror series. Coscarelli is famous for being the man behind cult jewelry such as the Phantasm series and the irresistibly strange Bubba Ho-Tep; but it does not bring any of the qualities that made these great movies for this TV episode. The plot is a sequel to the factory that follows the routine idea of ​​an innocent being chased by a madman. This time it's a young woman driving down a mountain road. After a head collision, she finds herself being chased by a white-faced maniac. The whole sequence of the chase is really ridiculous, with the young lady stopping every now and then to set up traps; only for the maniac to appear seconds later, and this is cut with scenes showing her with her husband - who happens to have a wealth of information on how to escape from insane killers; with lines like "Expect the Unexpected." The only real highlight for me was the presence of the High Man of Phantasm, Angus Scrimm. Coscarelli tries his best to implement as much terror images as possible; with things like a rotting corpse of a dead baby - but because it's all so silly overall, it's hard to take that piece seriously. This is the first episode of the series and the first one I've seen; I really hope they get better.
