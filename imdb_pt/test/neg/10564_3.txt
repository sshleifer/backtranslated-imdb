Okay, when I say "wow," I mean, "Jesus, please help me." I have an old copy of VHS that was printed before Troma received a copy of the title. The movie is about an alien landing on Earth to terrify us with a weapon that drives people to oblivion. CAUTION!!! And with that, I mean, watch out for those special effects. There are an incredible number of errors. The acting is terrible, but I would say the only one to put any effort would be the sheriff. The film itself is really grainy and dimly lit. In a particular scene, it's day off and then the shot shows the Night Beast firing his gun with the night behind him. Then show the day again. * I shake my head * I usually like low budget horror movies but I had to force myself to finish it because I never watch a movie without finishing it. The only accomplishment of this film was an alien that was not stereotyped. So for this, and ONLY for that ... I give him a 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie if you've had a bad day. You will be even more depressed with this failed film attempt.
