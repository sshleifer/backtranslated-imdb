Most of the reviews on this movie are positive, so I thought I'd try to fix the balance. I came out of this movie wondering what was going on. I now know and still consider it a bad movie. I initially discounted a sequence of dreams, as this seemed too obvious. I was glad that I had a free ticket to the movie or I would have asked for my money back. Movie reviewers and critics love this movie, which only confirms to me that most of them prefer to look clever than reviewing how an audience might like a movie. The 8+ rating of this movie is so misleading. In 20 years, this movie does not compare to big names like The Godfather. The film has great performances from both leaders, but that is not enough to save the film. (nor the lesbian scenes!)
