Ladies and Gentlemen .. Be sad (or be glad!) .. We are in the disgusting forensic series T.V-ERA !! Now count on me and anathematize our fate: "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation", "CSI: Miami", "CSI: NY", "NCIS", "Crossing Jordan", "Vinci Inquiry" Cosby Mysteries "! .. Do not we have enough already ?! From the late 1990s to the late 2000s, we have almost the same unhealthy series about the brilliant criminologist with a partner (or a team) who will solve the crimes by scrutinizing the autopsy ... and what a nauseating mission to do.Then you will surely have many, many repellent scenes, where we will see clearly, amazingly, the most horrific shots in the history of the The good old sci-fi ERA was like Columbus, Kojak, Magnum and Simon & Simon, or the good old Sci-Fi ERA, like The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman, Knight Rider. And oh boy we also have the hot and sexy such: cover up, The Love Boat, Baywatch, even one failure like Thunder in Paradise. <br /> <br /> All those were unforgettable, original, had good. .real good thoughts, action, women .. Until the X FILES came .. And then was the beginning of doom or to be exact: The Catastrophe! <br /> <br /> X Files Undoubtedly it was one of the biggest, but there were some minor drawbacks, we had agent Dana Scully (doctor and FBI agent) in each episode doing an autopsy ..., and of course, her lap (while the show was successful) became part of our room, so the money-hungry producers adored it with all the physical terror + the thrilling hunt for the truth. So they tried to repeat it in another not-so-distant classification: the Forensic! <br /> <br /> But she became as ugly, full of deformation and very raw as the BONES. In addition to the unusual present of Emily Deschanel, and bleeder as David Boreanaz (he was much better at angel), and all these corpses .. To the extent that every time I watched I found my self scream AAAAHHHHHH !! How awful terrible !! .. <br /> <br /> Please cancel .. You canceled before very good shows like (The Lone Gunmen) or (A Man Called Hawk). Here's a bad .. So, please .. Little Mercy and Enough Bones-ERA !!! .. or we'll drop dead ourselves from Nausea and Monotony !!
