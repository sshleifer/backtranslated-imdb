I'm speechless. Matty Simmons was able to do something that I thought was impossible. He made "The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan Island" look like "Citizen Kane". Painful can not even begin to describe this piece of ... I do not know. Remember, the premise sounded funny, but now that I've seen it, it's funny that dropping an anvil in your scrotum is funny. <br /> <br /> I will not bother to describe the premise, as the title says it all, just to say that I do not think there was literally a funny thing in this movie, not one, not even the monkey bite. How could one of the funniest characters in the Holiday franchise, the despicable white trash Eddie (Randy Quaid), be made so horribly awkward? I've never felt such sympathy for an actor in my life. I also felt sorry for the other actors who participated in this "comic" atrocity, Miriam Flynn (Catherine, Eddie's long pain but wife in the mood of the sun), Dana Barron (the original Audrey Griswold), Fred Willard and the dizzying Sung Hi Lee (maybe the only reason to watch the movie, even if only with the sound off), except for the old Commie, Ed Asner (Uncle Nick), it was coming. Unfortunately, the public did not. I just say "thanks to the skies" that Chevy Chase, who has been in a slump for years, avoided this splash of diarrhea, is the smartest career move he has ever made. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you are religious as I am, but I know that I will be praying to the Lord tonight to add 2 hours (if not 2 years) to my life to make up for the time I spent in front of the television that I will never return otherwise. <br /> <br /> Hot Water Burn Baby says ZERO out of 10 Stars (If you take a few bangs of the bongo and drink the water, maybe 1/10 of a 10 star)
