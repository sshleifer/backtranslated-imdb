After watching this movie, I decided that it is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. I knew this when I was subjected to three teenage girls screaming and exaggerating when they (OMG!) Were meeting again, and then watching the same thing, only made by women old enough to be my mother. And that was only the first few minutes. Yeesh. So here are my comments ... 1. Middle-aged women + ridiculous dance moves complete with hip thrusts and top clothes = not a good idea. <br /> <br /> 2. Pierce Brosnan could not get out of a paper bag. Neither could practically anyone else in this pile of excrement for that matter. <br /> <br /> 3. The songs were so random. It was obvious to me that they were thrown, wanting or not, into the incredibly invented and STUPID plot. <br /> <br /> 4. My three-year-old nephew could have written a better script. <br /> <br /> I was shrinking or laughing ironically during the movie. And I usually really like music movies. Of course they're meant to be a little corny ... but that was ridiculous. What a waste of talent. I mean, you have great actors and actresses in that movie ... I'm ashamed of them that this is now part of their career. I regret wasting my money and time with this crap.
