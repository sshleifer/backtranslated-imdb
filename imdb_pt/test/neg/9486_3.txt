This movie was good. Mary-Kate and Ashley interpret twin sisters (sorry for declaring the obvious) that against their will they are sent to Paris to spend the week with their rich uncle or something. <br /> <br /> Immediately two French boys (who seemed a bit innate) start talking to them and taking interest. Blah blah blah. It's a twin Olsen movie - we already know what's going to happen between them. Anyway, along with this, the twins know a FABULOUS French model because they are in Paris, the fashion capital of the world. They make bffs with the model and spend a fun shopping assembly in the city of lights. Yes. Plotwise, frankly, I do not remember what happened. I think I could say something, but hey, it's an Olsen movie. "Olsen movie" seems to be synonymous with "light entertainment". <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was annoying. I mean, can I really identify with two girls who are devastated to know they are going to Paris? Same? Besides, the jokes were not funny. However, I watched the entire movie. So it had to be a little fun. The fact that it was set up in Paris was what probably kept me watching.
