You have to be a fan of the little man, but I found Burlesque in Carmen bland, unimaginative and utterly bland. <br /> <br /> Chaplin is retelling Carmen's story and plays a big role as Don Jose. It's a story about the men and women they love, although it is unclear why anyone would love a woman like Carmen, as she is throwing men against each other. <br /> <br /> Like I said, I did not think much of it. Chaplin made dozens and dozens of better movies, so you can leave this one on the shelf. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I'm curious about the difference between this movie and the 1915 version ... or is it just an error in IMDB? <br /> <br /> In total: 3/10.
