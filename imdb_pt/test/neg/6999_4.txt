Challenge Rudd (John Wayne) and helper Dink Hooley (Syd Saylor) are itinerant cowpunchers who seem unable to stay in one place for long. In "Helltown," the boys are headed to Montana, where they meet with Rudd's cousin Tom Fillmore (Johnny Mack Brown), who offers them a job. It's a joke to see the boys wearing aprons when they start cooking with the herd, although Dare becomes self-conscious when Miss Judith (Marsha Hunt) rides to the camp. Judy is Tom's girl, but the attraction between her and Dare is evident at first. Fillmore has a herd of cattle to move in and promotes Dare to drive the car, partly to prove to Judy that he can not live up to the task. Meanwhile, villain Bart Hammond (Mount Blue) is eyeing the Fillmore cattle, but when his henchmen can not steal the herd, he thinks it's easier to earn the money Dare received at the end of the trail. Conning Dare to join a rogue card game with your Brady man (James Craig), Dare's money begins to evaporate hand after hand. It's only when Dare does not show up at Fillmore's ranch that Tom leaves to find his cousin. Exposing the cheaters, Tom, Dare, and Dink chase him before the bad guys can take revenge. "Helltown", also known as "Born to the West", was released in 1937 by "Favorite Films". Corporation, a couple of years after Wayne's Westerns series for Lone Star Productions. Only slightly changes the Lone Star formula; Wayne stays with the girl at the end of the movie, but here he was trying. There is a great scene of fleeing horses, where Wayne rescues Marsha Hunt, in which Johnny Mack Brown's horse does a full-blown somersault. Syd Saylor does a good job as a comic book friend, doing his best to sell lightning rods to innocent victims. He replaces the familiar faces George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt here, staples of the Lone Star movies. The charisma of John Wayne is beginning to unfold here, preparing him for the jump to the superstar status he has finally attained. <br /> <br /> "Helltown" was based on a novel by the legendary Western author Zane Gray. If you're looking for more films based on Gray's stories, try Fighting Caravans with Gary Cooper, "The Light of the Stars" with Victor Jory, "Drift Fence" with Buster Crabbe, and "Heritage of the Desert" with Randolph Scott .
