Writer-director Emilio Estevez shows a definite lack of talent here with this supposed, non-redeemable comedy. The script is completely hopeless, much less the fact of being unoriginal and poorly worked. Comedy simply does not work. When Estevez is not using tasteless sexual jokes, he is borrowing used jokes and redoing them very badly. You'd think that Estevez's team and his brother Charlie Sheen would be nice ... but ... it's not. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is uninspired and bland, never getting a laugh, and barely getting a smile from the audience. Do yourself a favor and leave this on the video shelf. <br /> <br /> Thursday, June 25, 1992 - Video
