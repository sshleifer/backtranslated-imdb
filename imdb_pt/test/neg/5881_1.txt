This movie is terrible. It has absolutely zero laughs. Hebrew Hammer (Adam Goldberg) leaves to save Hannukah from Evil Santa (Andy Dick). Perhaps a pretty promising basis for the plot, in fact, the film does not move beyond this premise. Although there are some (very few) nice touches and the plot is relatively consistent, it is crafted, banal and ultimately bland. This despite the fact that Goldberg, Dick and Greer (Hammer's client / love interest) have a fairly considerable screen presence. Despite being played for what can be described as exaggerated jokes, this movie is consistently muck middle-of-the-road muck. DO NOT waste 85 minutes of your life on this subject. (Note- the music was good ..!)
