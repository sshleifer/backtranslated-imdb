Drifting teens on summer vacations in a small town in Ohio can not find meaningful ways to fill their time. Some consider driving to Chicago; others are content to drink and intimidate their peers. In a random act of alcohol-fueled arrogance, the bullies attack a homeless man and steal a strange book. The manuscript text eventually contains archaic spells destined to summon demonic forces. A night or two later, one of them reads an incantation and is quickly possessed. He turns into a ruthless killer and begins to silently attack his former colleagues. <br /> <br /> "Demon Summer" is an amateur production with a microscopic budget. Production figures are low, but the filmmakers were smart enough not to be ambitious. Little in the way of special props or shooting sites were needed. The acting is especially weak and there is virtually nothing original in the script. On the plus side, special makeup effects are surprisingly good by low budget movie standards. Despite this, blood is minimal. Make-up effects aside, just for this movie, even for injured dogs. Not recommended.
