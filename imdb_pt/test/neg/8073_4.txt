I remember vacationing in Florida when this movie aired. I set up my VCR to record it. The anticipation was killing me. I knew about the movie since it was announced, half a year before. We returned from Florida 4 days after the movie aired, and I immediately watched. I tried as hard as I could, but I did not try. <br /> <br /> I'm a HUGE 3 Stooges fan. And as such I know a great deal about them. So it was not like I was hoping to learn anything from the movie, and I did not know. I was more interested in the pictures and seeing how accurate their information was. There were a lot of things wrong with this movie. The actors, the script, the scenarios, the ALL could have been much better. <br /> <br /> Paul Ben-Victor is a tremendously talented actor. But let's face it, Moe Howard was out of his reach. He does not look like him, he does not sound like him and therefore he can not act like him. Michael Chiklis is also very talented, but his interpretation of Curly did not work very well with me, although when Curly fell ill, he did very well. John Kassir's portrait of Shemp might have been rehearsed better. It was more of a bad impression than a portrait. Worst of all was Joe Besser. They made him thinner and more annoying than he really was. It was just laziness. I do not like Joe's shorts because, as the movie illustrates, he was hardly ever hit. But he was not that annoying, and DEFINATELY was not that skinny. The best performance belongs to Evan Handler. He had the most faithful picture of the stooge. The problem with Larry's character, his hair is very curly and very red. I know this is very technical so I will not tell it on my list because I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> Back to Shemp, who happens to be my favorite. It is written like a chicken whining, trembling. It is true that he had many phobias, but he was not that bad. He did not leave the group initially because he was afraid of Ted Healy, although he did not like him, Shemp left because he received an offer from another studio that he simply could not refuse. Instead of the truth, this movie chooses to make him wet the bed, in Larry no less, run into a closet and shamefully withdraw from the group. Another problem is that Shemp made almost as many Columbia shorts as Curly did as a puppet, but only one, Fright Night, which was his first short, is shown. His career was almost completely ignored. In addition, the bad editing caused a terrible and unforgivable mistake. Shemp was born in early 1895 and died at the end of 1955. Would that make him the age of death? Well, here's a tip, it's not 59 as the movie says. <br /> <br /> Now for the writing, which I think was flawed just because this movie was rushed. Some of the lines are dumb and could be developed and / or introduced much better than they were. The only line that really got me was at the end of the movie, when Moe is showing the prosecutor how the eyepoke is done. <br /> <br /> "That's how we do, we make contact with eyebrow bone, not eyes, it seems real in the film though." this line was poorly written and misplaced in the film. It's to be one of those lines that make the public say "OH!" In awe and I'm sure it did with some people, but the end of the movie was not the place for this line. A better place you ask? How about they show up at Columbia for the first time and be introduced to the sound effects machine? I know there was initially no sound to the eye, but Moe, for example, might have said, "What about that?" and Curly or Larry eyepokes. Jules White then says "Are you okay?" or "How did you do it?" There were a lot of wrong lines in this movie, which is a sure sign the script was rushed. Another involves the origin of the name Shemp, although this is not so bad, and so I will let that slip. <br /> <br /> What does this movie do well? It illustrates how the footmen were injured by Columbia, what they were. I'm not sure if Moe was a scout boy, but this was the kind of dramatization that is done to make the viewer sympathize with them. I know this movie was a drama. I know that not everything will be crisp and clean and absolutely perfect. However, some of the things they invented and the real things they ignored were in serious conflict with each other. For example, Curly's stroke does not even come close to what happened in real life. I know, I know, dramatization, but the point of drama is to make real events more dramatic. Curly's hit in real life is more dramatic than what they showed in the movie. Here's what really happened. Curly was sitting in an off-screen chair while a scene was being filmed, they called him to the final scene of pie fight, but there was no response. Moe went to fetch him and discovered that his brother hunted his head half paralyzed, unable to speak and tears streaming down his face. Moe then said "Babe"? and tried to help him out of the chair. Poor Curly falls to his knees. Then the ambulance was called. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was not terrible, but it certainly was not good, or even OK. This film portrays the clowns impotently and loosely and sometimes goes overboard with dramatizations. There is a very long list of inaccuracies in this movie. If you do not believe me, check out a guy named Stooge's list on the threestooges.com news forum. It's a long page and a half. Some things in the movie I can pass up. But others were unforgivable. The Three Stooges were geniuses, and a lot of comedy today is based on what they did. Do not believe me? Check out the Simpsons, and even more Ren & Stimpy. But this movie can not capture its genius. It is more inaccurately captures its difficulties, which is important, but if the title of the movie is going to be the Three Stooges, have to portray its ingenuity and originality more than anything.
