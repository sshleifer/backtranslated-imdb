What can you expect from a direct movie to a DVD? You know what you're getting into when you rent it. The quality of cinematography reminds me of reality shows. <br /> <br /> Why are they always so close to the actors! And why are they always focused? There is nothing to look at. (And the actors are so awesome, so the scams.) <br /> <br /> Writing and dialogue are simply terrible. This intro scene with the British guy is hilarious. Just try to hear these words, they hardly make sense, they just circle. The lines from the rest of the film look like romance outfits and science fiction novels, as if the writers had no idea what they were doing. The characters definitely sound like they have no idea what they're saying. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie. I feel bad for the actors involved in this project. Embarrassing!
