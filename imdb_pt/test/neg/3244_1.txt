I'm ashamed to admit in public that I've done the movie cover once! This is an absolute reason why one should research the film before seeing it! The "creators" of this movie have called us all gullible fools and losers with plenty of time in our hands. <br /> <br /> Based on the powerful and powerful Indian snakes that change shape, history takes us painful ride. They are the target of their former friend Manisha Koirala (who was in his old life a snake, but now he is a ghost!) And his pathetic, eternal and powerful boyfriend snake / killer killer Munish Kohli machines (which fortunately has not been seen since). Now you need to know more? <br /> <br /> I vote to study for the next test at school and not in this movie! Give yourself a pass if you are healthy. If not ... then you'll probably like it.
