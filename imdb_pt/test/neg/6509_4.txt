Kennan Ivory Wayans was so funny in Low Down Dirty Shame that I had to see this and it was one of the worst he did and Steven Seagal did not help much. It starts with some strange religious murders that do not make much sense to Jim Campbell (Keenan). He is surprised to see a new partner waiting for him to work by his side to decipher the case, but Jack Cole does not seem to be who everyone thinks he is until Jack's ex-wife is killed in one of those ritual killings that end up doing him the suspect too. It's the same thing as all his other films: Smoking past, CIA involvement and now trying to be a normal cop. Why does Steven dress like he is from a Western movie? And the prayer beeds on top of it make things a little confusing.
