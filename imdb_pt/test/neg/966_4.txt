This 3-hour mini-series made for TV came home with us from Blockbuster this weekend. The producer clearly spent a lot of money on sets, costumes (especially Bridget Fonda), and special effects (including a large polar bear and Jim Henson's reindeer). They should have spent a little more money on a coherent roadmap. The plot was so loose it really never came together. One can ignore the Germans with an Irish accent, but do not tell bold stories. With loose ends meaningless that included a special appearance of the Devil, this certainly is not destined to be a Christmas Classic. It's a shame that they have wasted good performances by the two female leaders.
