Now, of all the shark movies I've seen, this one takes the cake! The plot of the movie was good, but the emotion factor kind of fell apart later. Antonio Sobato, Jr. plays an excellent role as a son looking for the shark that killed his father. A megaldon is one of the biggest sharks of all and the most dangerous as well. The shark's vision was really scary at some angles, but the effects were a blur, and the scenes were a little weak in some places. With the guns of the mini submarine, this would take a whole school of sharks there. It was great that her son could exact exact revenge for this monstrosity, even though it really cost him his life too. As they say that revenge has its price, but was it worth it? That answer could go on, and this movie was a big disappointment. The start was good, and in the end, it was like the Titanic. 1 out of 5 stars!
