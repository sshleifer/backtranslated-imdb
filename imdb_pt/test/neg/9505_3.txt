This movie is very difficult to understand, why do the couple want to get divorced? No reason is given, we know nothing about their lives in Lisbon and not even anything about Marie's work. We can only understand that a certain hole has appeared in this life. We do not even know who took the initiative to seek a divorce. <br /> <br /> The way of filming is kind of special: I did not know the director's name before the end of the movie, when I read it on the screen, I understood why it was so slow, only 42 photos in a hundred minutes. I counted This reminded me of some Japanese films that I saw in the 1990s, in fact, we must accept that this is the expression of another culture, even if the whole is Western. I do not know if this story would be appropriate for a Japanese couple. <br /> <br /> You can see the logic of the scenes, but the result is annoying, anyway I decided to watch it to the end because I wanted to get the spirit and meaning of it all. In fact, I just understood that the story of these two beings may not be over, since the train leaves the station without Marie. That's little for so long! I can not recommend this job.
