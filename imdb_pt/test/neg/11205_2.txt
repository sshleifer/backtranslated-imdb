Look, this movie is terrible ... the "plot" involves twins who are neglected by their selfish parents, and left in the care of a succession of nannies and nannies, all of whom children run away being completely obnoxious. Eventually, the engineer of children ex-convict Beverly D'Angelo to be your new nanny, you care why? And D'Angelo watches a TV show about selling children and decides she'll try to sell the twins ... and, well, oh, you do not want to know. It's all very unpleasant and not funny. In fact, the announcer signed this movie before appearing on the TV channel I was watching! Just do not worry about wasting a single moment of your life in this complete pile of crap, y'hear?
