... and this is a shame! Please make the sun rise and incinerate all copies of Dracula 3000. This must be the worst vampire movie of the new millennium so far (I have not yet seen REIGN IN DARKNESS, but they do not get much worse than that). Do not be fooled by being the cool cover of the film, H.R. Gigeresque. This is so bad, it's almost hilarious. I can not describe all the emotions this movie evoked. I giggled, I screamed at the screen, I sat numbly, nodding in disbelief, ... This movie has 'cheap and cheese' written on top. The best thing about this movie is the opening credits and opening scenes that feature more or less okay CGI from two spacecraft. But when the voice of Casper Van Dien appears, you start to smell something suspicious. And, in fact, everything comes down quickly after that. <br /> <br /> The crew of a rescue spacecraft find an abandoned ship, the Demeter, which seems to be heading for Earth. They enter, thus sealing their destiny. This movie is, above all, a shameless low-budget scoundrel mixed with vampires. Until the turnaround in the story, the character of Erika Eleniak, Aurora, reveals that she is a robot. Coolio is much exaggerated as the blood-sucking drug 187 (pffff, cover code as a name?!?!). The character of Casper Van Dien is called Captain Van Helsing (hahaha!) And he looks ... well, Casper Van Dien. Udo Kier as Captain Varna, Demeter's former commander, is shown only on a monitor screen and he really seems to have difficulty reading his lines from a self-suggestion (poor Udo, what are you doing in this movie?). And then we have Langley Kirkwood as Earl Orlock, one of the most pathetic and risible Dracula of all time to (des) decorate the silver screen. Just look at your clothes. Instead of a futuristic black suit or something, he's wearing an old school Halloween costume with fringes. Did you think Richard Roxburgh was not convincing as Dracula in VAN HELSING? Then wait until you see Langley's performance! <br /> <br /> The set designers went overboard in this one. Demeter's interior looks like a cross between an oil tanker and an old steel factory, which they decorated with terrible lights and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. The prop-master must have forgotten that this movie happens in the year 3000 because the characters use weapons that look like today's .45 missiles and the "Prof" uses a non-motorized, non-floating wheelchair. It has to be pushed to move. <br /> <br /> In addition to a dried up corpse, some impalements and a break up, there is absolutely no blood. And vampire fangs and contact lenses look as fake as hell. Add to that the stupid, stupid, abrupt end of all: Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of having a final (bloody) confrontation with Earl Orlock, they lock themselves in the control room. So Aurora explains that before her program was updated and joining narcotics, it used to be a "Protheus 3.2 PB", in other words: a pleasure bot. Then she says "Well then, what are you waiting for?" Humvee replies, "I do not have to tell me twice. Come on, girl," get her and ... "BOOOOOOM !!!" the ship explodes and the credits roll. No sex scene, no Erika blinking her breasts, no bloody climax, ... Just one more dose of Udo Kier reading a line on the monitor and it's over. <br /> <br /> So, this movie is a must-see for all bad movie buffs, but I must warn you: sometimes it gets really painful. And everyone claiming that VAN HELSING, UNDERWORLD or even QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is the worst vampire movie of the new millennium, is clearly insane, or simply has not yet seen the Dracula 3000.
