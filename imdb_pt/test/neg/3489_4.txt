The "plot" of this movie contains some holes through which you can drive a huge truck, but I do not think it's always a top priority in horror. Two elderly sisters in rural England have held their brother in the basement for more than 30 years. Now he escaped and began a kill, focusing on the military that are nearby. `We just thought it was better for him, 'they keep repeating and ?? Strangely? all army officers love these women and do not doubt their sincerity, even though 5 of their men have died. I do not know if to find the revelation near the final suspense ?? or tedious! In a way, this movie reminded me of "Arsenic and Old Lace". In that classic comedy of dark humor, two half-insane brothers are also the younger brother's mother, but they commit the killing there. The old ladies in "The Beast in the Cellar" are by no means less crazy. The 'horror' in this 70s film is very amateur and cheap, but there are some legal attempts to increase tension. Many "old ladies" talk about the good old days, and this is rarely something you're looking for in a horror movie with such a compelling title. Flora Robson, who can be recognized by classic moviegoers, plays one of the sisters. She gave image to the Queen of England is the legendary swashbuckler film Errol Flynn, the Sea Hawk.
