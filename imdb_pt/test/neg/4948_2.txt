This is a terrible movie. Angie Dickenson is a class act and always does well, but she does not get many roles and she must have needed some money to make this movie. By the way, she is on the screen less than 10 minutes. Oooh, wait, there's a redeeming feature in this movie: Meg Foster has a small part in this movie. Now Meg has been on the screen for 35 years and is not particularly good, but she has the scariest eyes of any actress I've ever seen. By name, you probably do not know it, but a look into your eyes and you will recognize it. To summarize: the acting is horrible, the story is bad and even the filmography is terrible. A black screen every time the director wants to change the scene is pretty dumb. Watch anything else, but this, even Mr. Ed reruns!
