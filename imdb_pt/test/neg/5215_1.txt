my friends and I are always looking for chuck norris movies to just knock and make fun of. One of our favorites so far is Lonewolf. I went to a Wal-Mart Christmas mall and came across this movie in 5.99 bin. I had to get him. I had high hopes for this movie and although it's absolutely hilarious at times, we agree that bells of innocence is the worst movie we've ever seen, made, produced, invented, etc ... who the hell would think that's a good idea. not only is it confusing at times, but the acting is difficult to watch. the man who plays oren has a performance that I can compare to my own vomit, and chuck took a dip in that, he's not the best actor, but that was terrible. and what kind of names are oren, conrad and jux ........ jux. come on guys. If you honestly thought that this movie was at all watchable, great for you because it was difficult for me and I seriously had a headache and stomach aches after watching. I'm telling you now if you have not seen this movie, NO !! For God's sake, please do not subject yourself to such horrible 90 minutes of your life.
