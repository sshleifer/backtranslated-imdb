I'll repeat - what a stupid scenario. <br /> <br /> Is there something new inside? I do not know who wrote that. But I believe this guy has watched all the Hollywood movies -family-children's items already made ... all the scenes and dilutions you can see everywhere. Why do you guys make this movie? children like adults? they like gold cars for money ... and they are positive? they are lucky ... and emotions, of course ... without this being possible. the young actors - wow :-). Do I like it when the camera is focused on their cool faces? what a crap ... there are 90% better children's films than this one! This is not a creative or funny movie. This is simply nothing. <br /> <br /> D.
