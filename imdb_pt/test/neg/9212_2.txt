Very poor quality and the acting is equally bad. This film is an excellent example of current England and the mindset. There is no mention of Jesus in this film nor does the film feature any kind of scripture from Christianity as most know. <br /> <br /> I am also very surprised because this movie is a BBC program and the BBC is well known for its quality programming, but it seems that the BBC's attempt to rival Hollywood's psychedelic films is failing completely. <br /> <br /> Poor acting, poor plot, poor culture that seems to be without religion. I would not even bother to buy this, instead of trying to rent this or buy it when it goes to the $ 2 can.
