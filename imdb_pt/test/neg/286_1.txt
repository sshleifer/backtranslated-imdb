I had high hopes of getting into that movie. After all, Ocean's 11 was a great Hollywood product. His quick jokes, incredible star power and tight script made him one of the funniest caper movies I've ever seen. Of course, with all the money I earned, a sequel was on the way, and I, for one, was excited. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I was absolutely delighted with this movie. Despised by how horribly wrong things can go. This movie had everything for that; the return of the entire original cast, the same director, stories of crazy clowning on and off-set. How could it have been so wrong? <br /> <br /> It starts immediately with one of the most difficult and unnecessary opening sequences and descends from there. After reasonably goofy short scenes between Pitt / Zeta-Jones and Clooney / Roberts, the film spends several minutes watching Andy Waltz waltz from scene to scene, telling every individual member of Danny Ocean's original eleven that he wants his money back. Believe me when I say these scenes are only here to keep up with Andy Garcia's runtime, because without those ridiculously awkward scenes, his screen time would be WELL below five minutes. <br /> <br /> That leads me to another big problem I had with this movie. The rhythm is so uneven that the characters are discarded completely from the story and are only brought back later. The character of Bernie Mac is discarded from the script from the beginning and never comes back, except for two short scenes without dialogue. Garcia appears in the first few minutes and returns to an exceptionally brief scene at the end. Roberts appears for about 5 minutes at the beginning, and is not mentioned again until there are about 20 to 25 minutes. Even Clooney himself spent much of the film in prison. <br /> <br /> All this would be excusable if the movie were funny. Not at all. 90% of the jokes drop completely and the ones that work are worth a laugh at best. The "plot" is undeniably useless, and left me feeling cheated. At one point in the film, the team takes a job worth $ 2.5 million of the roughly $ 100 million they need to raise before Garcia's two-week deadline. Several characters even acknowledge how absurd it is to waste time to do this work, but they do it anyway! More than 30 minutes of the movie revolve around this work they should not even be doing, and we get the feeling that this part of the plot was simply added to fill the runtime. In addition, the equipment they use to do this work CLEARLY millions and millions to fund. Wait until you see what they do to get this job and realize that it would cost a lot more than $ 2.5 million. Obviously, because of this, they have to do various jobs to make money. The beauty of the first film was the great decoy and how ingeniously and intricately it was ripped out. Here, they pull so many jobs, in many different ways, that run through them all because to explain them, the movie would last for several hours. <br /> <br /> We all know we're getting into this movie that there will be a major turnaround in the end. So is the nature of caper film. The twist at the end of the Twelve of the Ocean made me laugh; not because it was funny, but because I could not believe how wrong I was. I will not give up because I know most of you will be foolish enough to spend the money to see this movie anyway. <br /> <br /> What I'm going to say is that it does most of the two hours. You've become completely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I was excited to see this movie after adoring Ocean's 11. I left the theater feeling like I had been the victim of a really great coup pulled by the cast. and the crew of this movie deceiving me into thinking that this movie would be worth watching. I never gave a 1 for a movie on the IMDb, but there is a first time for everything. Consider yourself warned .... 1/10
