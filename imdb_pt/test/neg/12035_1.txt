This movie made me so angry !! Here I am thinking that here is a new horror movie, a w / a sense of intelligence, and then the movie begins. The scenery, the delivery of lines, the costumes, the false blood, should I continue? There are porn movies with better dialogue than that. I understand the concept behind the indie movies, but my God, this was not just indie, it was a report from a high schooler with a camcorder and the cast were friends and relatives. This is a movie that was condemned from the start. Maybe if it was 1982, instead of the new millennium, this movie could fly. But it seems to me that someone hung a stone on the neck of this albatross and was sinking at a constant speed.
