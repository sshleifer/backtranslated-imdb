Super Troopers was an instant classic. Club Dread, though disappointing to many, has had its moments. Puddle Cruisers has fewer times. I saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store and saw at the bottom that it was done by the Broken Lizard group that made Super Troopers, so of course I got it. I just found a scene to be funny in laughter. Too far from Super Troopers. All in all, I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you have plenty of free time, and really need to kill some time. However, it is best to play video games or watch something that might make you laugh or think.
