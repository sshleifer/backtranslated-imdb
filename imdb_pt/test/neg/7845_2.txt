This movie was terrible. John Wayne is a brutal actor sometimes. The main protagonist of the role of "Maura" did a good job and tried his best to make the scenes believable, though inept, one-dimensional, acting Wayne. Seriously, did you see when he should be talking in his sleep? Ridiculous. And his character became such a terrible person in the second half of the movie and then did nothing to repair his behavior and is still forgiven by everyone, including his arch-nemesis, without even apologizing. The story was completely implausible. We should believe that two grown men, both tremendous successes in their respected fields, would sabotage a job and risk the lives of innocent men simply because they did not like each other. You can randomly choose any scene and will probably leave you shaking your head in disbelief that someone paid to make this movie. It's too bad because the only other Wayne movies I saw were the shootist and the brave river, both great movies. Unless you're getting paid, do not bother watching this one.
