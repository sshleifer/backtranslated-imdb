Yes, I did it all the way to the end. It was very difficult. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wondered if there was even a director on the set. The acting ... well, I do not even know what to say. I thought the girl who played Emily tried her best with the annoying, sometimes crazy and sometimes predictable dialogue. <br /> <br /> I know the budget was low, but the hollow sound and the lighting unfortunately made it look and sound like a 100-minute listening tape. <br /> <br /> I will not even talk about the ending ... <br /> <br /> The best of the movie was the song. <br /> <br /> I did not recommend this movie to anyone. Even for lesbians who do not have many movies to watch overall, this is nothing to waste your time. If you're looking for a sad lesbian-themed movie, check out Children's Hour, Lost and Delirious or High Art. All this will leave you depressed and gloomy, but you will not have to suffer a cinematic hell in the process.
