The New York lawyer plans to get rid of her senile mother after meeting an attractive and available woman. Writer Robert Klane, adapting his own novel (the kind of brochure children would buy for the dirty parts), does not seem to have any knowledge of mental illness: for him, it's just an excuse for lewd comedy and eschatological jokes. George Segal - who in the 1960s starred mostly in war films and espionage - became, by now, one of America's greatest sad-bag comedians; his crazy reactions and crazy answers rival only his mother's inscrutability. Segal is paired with Trish Van Devere, and their connecting moments (though also thrown by laughter) are really the only sequences that a person can gravitate to. Ruth Gordon, kind as she is, is simply too much - and more than she represents less. This is one of the most directed and edited films I have ever seen of so-called professionals. Promising scenes that ultimately do not develop for the full effect are disconnected from other moments that shake endlessly, making the film crass and unstable self-destruct long before it ends. * 1/2 of ****
