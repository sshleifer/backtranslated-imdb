I highly recommend this 4 star presentation. They are all for the script, which was butchered beyond recognition in some places. What can be said? They picked up one of the best pieces written in the last century and methodically stole it from their heart, humor and humanity. I do not really blame the actors, who are probably doing their best with poor quality direction and incomplete characters (because the very full characters of the stage version had their insights - and insights - ripped out). I really blame the director, who seems to struggle to find ways to undermine the script. There are so many strange pauses, awkward moments and awkwardly reimagined line readings in this TV movie that I sometimes forgot to love the play. I'm not one of those people who thinks genius plays are automatically inferior in the movie (quite the opposite), but this particular genius piece has been tremendously underestimated by that output. Now I hope they make a * real * movie of that piece. The world deserves this.
