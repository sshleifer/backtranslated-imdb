So many people shot Platoon and Born On the Fourth of July, among others, calling them "leftist propaganda film." Now it's my turn to give a movie a political chance. For me, this film is very imposing on certain religious beliefs and on their political opinions. <br /> <br /> The acting and the writing were a bit of a clich√© for my liking. Mel Gibson seems to enjoy playing these unnecessary violent movies and proves yet again by partnering with his partner Randall Wallace for yet another. Throughout this movie, there was this prototypical trash "Just tell my family I love them" or "Tell Ronny to pray before hoe goes to bed" lines. I was so overwhelmed with these garbage retread lines that I felt like I had to vomit. How about that scene where Gibson's wife is going to do the laundry and that "colorless" applies to what you put in the washing machine. It was in the mid-sixties she was somehow trapped under a rock without noticing the racism around her. Another scene is where Gibson's daughter asks him what war is and the scene is filmed on such a trivial subject. <br /> <br /> The direction showed all this perfectly. The countless scenes of Gibson and his family or soldiers praying. I'm good at showing this once or twice, but after a while I wonder if the movie is trying to shove something in my head. How many scenes with the American flag at its best were filmed with melodramatic music. The director also seems to have won some sort of victory in Vietnam. What exactly was won? Cinematography was the worst of them, with the scenes slowing down watching the American flag in the distance scenes scattered everywhere. I love America, but movies like this seem to glorify every little thing we do. <br /> <br /> This may sound like an outburst and maybe it is, but I can not stand it when a movie like this makes people who are not religious. they are not so patriotic that they agree with anything that their country sounds bad. This movie for me is limited and limited in many ways. To me, it says that if you're not a Christian, you're wrong. God or Jesus wanted people to kill I do not think so? For me this movie was offensive. At first, this movie was funny with the myriad cliches and overactive scenes, but when I looked at what this movie was trying to say or was not really frustrating watch. I think it's my fault that I chose to watch this movie. I hope no one takes this remark offensively because I'm not criticizing religion or patriotism but some of the narrow-minded people who are so into both and discount each other. <br /> <br /> If you want a real representation of Vietnam Platoon, born on July 4, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter or The Killing Fields. Even the Full Metal Jacket, which I absolutely hated, was a better representation. I read a quote that in the context says that a true patriot does not match everything the government or country does, but questions when it is wrong. A true patriot loves his country too much to see bad things.
