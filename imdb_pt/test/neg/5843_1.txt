That was one of the biggest crap I ever had to watch. I mean, seriously. How would one feel if they were in Woody Harrelson's place and his wife was even WHY would it be a good idea to sleep with the other guy even for a million dollars? After all, it was she who talked about it in bed and said how good it would be for them, since he could build his house or anything else with that money. Woody never fully agreed until she talked about it. How can you trust her? Who the hell would actually consider that if they were married? I do not care how desperate they were. This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life. Then he turns to her. Apparently, he had no right to distrust her, other than the fact that his wife had just slept with another guy who is extremely rich and handsome. Oh, and wait, so he should apologize to her after she asks for the divorce so she can stay with the guy she slept with. Of course Woody has no right to say anything to her or suspect her, especially after she still has Roy Hobb's card in her wallet. So at the end of the movie she apparently is so in love with Woody and misses her so much that she would not leave Hobbs until he made a ridiculous and stupid story to try to suggest she leave, and she bleeping thank you Hobbs? ??? Are you kidding me? Was she under contract as your sex slave or something? I mean what the bleep? Oh, and wait, it gets better. She kisses him passionately before getting out of the car. Yes, she is not a prostitute. Oh, thank you for letting me go, let me go with you one last time, for God's sake. Smooch smooch, smooch even though I'm still married to a guy I left for a rich guy. I've never seen a piece of shit in my life. How the hell should we feel good after that horrible end? What should this film represent? NOTHING CAME OUT OF THIS! This was the most senseless movie I've ever seen in my life. Two desperate and pathetic people. If I were Woody, I'd tell her to drown in that body of water they were close to. Apparently, he had no self-respect. What the hell was Roy Hobbs thinking when he took on that horrible role? I feel like throwing up after watching this. This movie was so bad it was seriously laughable. I want those two hours of my life back that I missed by watching that piece of dick.
