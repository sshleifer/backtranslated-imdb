Like most musicals of the time, you need to check the reality on the door. The MELODY of Broadway, 1938, is neither remotely plausible nor plausible, but fun in the odd way. This movie is really just an excuse to perform the talents of the stars. Some scenes happen as if they were in a critique, not in a movie directed by tangles. <br /> <br /> Judy Garland shines and it's a shame she has so little to do, unless there's a lot left on the court floor floor. One of the most futile events is the way Eleanor Powell gets a lead role in a Broadway show and Robert Taylor says it's going to be work, work, work from dawn to dusk. Several scenes go by and there is no work, no rehearsals ... NOTHING. She needs money to win a horse at an auction. She does not have money. Is not she getting paid while rehearsing? Taylor has to borrow money to help. He should be a great producer of time. He does not have money ??? Anyway, that's just two elements in this strange story. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers are wonderful, which prevents this is a total loss. Broadway MELODY OF 1940 is much better than the Broadway MELODY OF 1936.
