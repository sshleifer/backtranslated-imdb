Secret Service agent Jay Killion (Charles Bronson) has been assigned to protect the wife of the newly elected President, the new First Lady (Jill Ireland). She is a very difficult woman and Killion has her hands full. She is the victim of countless assassination attempts, all led by the President's Chief of Staff, who wants the first lady to die. This film insults his intelligence not only with the plot, but also with the lack of realistic locales. For example, in the scene that describes the inaugural parade, the First Lady is in a Rolls Royce convertible with Agent Killion and without the President. Also, we know what Washington, DC, is like the weather wise in January, and not only is everyone "top coat less", you can even see some palm trees in the 70 degrees and sunny weather! (Obviously filmed in Hollywood, not in Washington, DC). This movie is a joke. Not worth your time.
