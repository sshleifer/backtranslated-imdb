Not being a particular fan of westerns, I mostly watched this because I wanted to see Lucille Ball in something other than a "I Love Lucy" or "Lucy Show" role. Here she plays Christine Larson, the owner of a bar in the Territory of Arizona in 1868 who is about to marry the unscrupulous local Indian agent (Dean Jagger.) Ball's performance was OK - nothing more; she did not surprise me. For me, the role was very different from what I'm used to seeing it - there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy for which she later became famous, although the film tried to maintain a fun sensation everywhere. (A typical funny line - "There are two ways to deal with women - and no one knows any of them!") I did not find the story so compelling, although I appreciated that the Indians were depicted as victims of violence. Indian agent. There is a typical shooting action and lots of horses - in other words, its typical western. As for Christine - we can guess from the beginning how the planned marriage will end; It's just a question of how she's going to get there. If you like westerns, this would be a pretty typical with a little humor thrown in. If you're not big on the genre, this is going to be lacking. I'm not big on the genre. 3/10
