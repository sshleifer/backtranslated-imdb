I wrote spoiler alert, but there is not much that can be spoiled. It's like ruining rotten flesh. This movie is probably the worst I've ever seen. Not because of actors or special effects, but because of the large number of factual and physical errors. First of all, MIGs are not really MIGs. They are Mirages and they are French. And how the hell can Doug's father handle the maneuvers his son does to fight the "MIGs" without a g-suit? And why would Chappy try to board his plane without a g-suit? And how could Doug defeat the ace of the enemy pilot so easily? Anyway, I did not like this movie. And the worst part is that it has 3 sequences, the most recent one from 1995. Now that's scary.
