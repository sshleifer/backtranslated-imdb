Following the star of Dylan Moran from the charming misanthrope bookstore owner on the surrealist sitcom Black Books, I could see his comedic potential begging to be used in theater or on major cinematic avenues. This first big-screen exhibition in a leading role (he had a special guest as Rufus the thief in Notting Hill) had a lot of promises, but as Steve Coogan's stressed-out vehicle, The Parole Officer, has many creases that should have been resolved in pre-production. The plot is so complicated that I will not bother repeating the subtler details (the script has all the characters doing it for us), and the laughter comes from inner jokes from show business. Michael Caine is a pompous producer of Richard III - updated to the Nazi occupation (one of the few genuine laughter, a satirical jab in Ian McKellen) in which everyone is always giving Hitler's salute every time they take the stage. Convincing Dylan that acting must be a conceptual act in itself, the two conspire to steal money from some fairly harmless gangsters through their acting prowess. The confusion begins (both screen and audience), there is a romantic sub-plot between Dylan and the daughter of one of the blah blah blah gangsters and Dylan manages to dress in strange clothes and makes funny accents. Michael Caine offers a few lines of choice, and Dylan's comic timing is in the money, so why not good? It has a certain charm that you would expect from Film 4, but it also has a precocious little girl acting as a compass in a messy and irrelevant plot - a no-no in screen writing 101. The exhibit overshadows everything else. You just want to see Moran and Caine acting comically to one another the way they were at the beginning, but when they are together at the end, the couple has lost their charisma. <br /> <br /> Actors is a fun endeavor, though uninteresting. It should come on the television during a rainy Tuesday afternoon, then take on you. Otherwise, it would be best to watch your old Black Books videos or rent Withnail & I.
