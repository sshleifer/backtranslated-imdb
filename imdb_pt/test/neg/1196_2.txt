This movie was good, but like most TV series, it would be better if it were made for television only. The best and most beloved characters only had five minute roles, while the three mediocre characters went through the entire film. <br /> <br /> Unlike most British films that are based on TV series, this movie starts seems to be a winner, but the pace suddenly stops when the three mediocre characters are in the real world waiting to capture the three comedians. <br /> <br /> The movie then goes nowhere when Hillary in a room with Steve captured, Lipp disguised as Steve and Geoff somehow writing for medieval times. What made me think? Why does not he need a key to enter this world other than the characters of Royston Vasey? The medieval scene was ok, but Monty Python did a lot better and, of course, funnier with cameos from Peter Kay and Simon Pegg, both did not say anything funny, Kay had a line and Pegg just sat on the wall looking bored. What also pissed me off was that they seem to forget what happened in previous episodes, as Hillary escaped to the Caribbean on television in series 2, but in the film he escaped from prison, and also Lipp is a pedophile vampire who was not mentioned in the film , which was also quite disturbing when he was alone looking after the children. <br /> <br /> Were there many holes and unexplained situations, like Geoff and the Dark Escaped from medieval times back to Royston Vasey? Like Series 3, it started off well, but as the movie progressed, it slowly went down and had a very weak predictable end. <br /> <br /> They would have been better at doing what Monty Python did and remaking all of the best and classic sketches of the 1-3 Series and the Christmas special, and turned it into a movie that would reintroduce the characters to a whole new audience, who can not be invited to watch the series or buy the DVDs. <br /> <br /> The best advice is to save your money and wait until you are on the television ..... Where it belongs.
