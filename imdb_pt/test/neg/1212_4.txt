I loved this movie 10 years ago when I was 16 years old. My biggest mistake was watching it again, 10 years later. It's not the worst movie "I want to be a pilot" of all time, but there are so many flaws in it that you can hardly forget them. <br /> <br /> Queen's "One Vision" (along with the rest of the soundtrack) makes this movie better than the average patriotic nonsense you usually see; <br /> <br /> [*** * ------]
