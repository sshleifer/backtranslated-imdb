Poor Bela Lugosi. Just another day at work. A group of saboteurs trying to disrupt the American war effort inside. It's very hard to figure out at first because, although we know these guys are up to something, their method of operation is not very clear. I will not ruin it, but the end is incredible. There are a lot of murders perpetrated by our hero. A police force that does not know what's going on. What a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house. There are comments like, "A true patriot would do this or that." Obviously, while suspicion abounds, most of the world would not know a spy or a subversive if it jumped and bit them. I was also surprised to see Clayton Moore (the Lone Ranger) in a romantic role. I never realized he ever did anything other than sit on a horse. There is, of course, the presumption of criminals when they think they are immune to the killer's guest list. Anyway, Bela is kind of a cool guy and a bad guy in one. The best scene in the movie is in the end, but I will not ruin it. As a curiosity and a play of the period, it can be fun to watch some people.
