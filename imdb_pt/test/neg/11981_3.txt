I was quite surprised to find that a movie based on the game Far Cry had been created. The story here is not something I would consider to be a strong point in the game universe. Do not worry though, as in the typical Boll fashion, the story of the film has very little to do with the game on which it is based. Now I understand that certain freedoms need to be taken to make a transfer from one form of media to another, but it seems that he does not even really try to make a connection. Not only that, but the action and action sequences are so cheesy it almost makes you feel like the whole project was a big joke. It's been said a million times before, but why did someone more talented not get the rights to video games to create a movie ????
