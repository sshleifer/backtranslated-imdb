This should be placed in the "Bible Belt" of Northern Ireland. Well, as someone who grew up there, and was a kid at the time described in the movie, that did not seem true! The accents were everywhere - anything except County Antrim / Derry. The church did not look like any I've ever seen. "The Church of God" is a Pentecostal denomination, but the movie is certainly not Pentecostal! The elderly minister at the beginning was dressed in the robes of the Church of Ireland (Anglican) - and no C. de I. would call "The Church of God." The minister was often called a "reverend" - they can do this in some parts of the world, but I never heard of it when I lived in that area. Ministers were approached as "Mr ......" This film was very poorly researched and released - quite typical of Irish cinema - annoying! A movie may have a great plot, but if it does not look authentic, it's crap.
