This movie with good production values ​​presents secrets and how friends use them. Henry May Long is a very well-interpreted, illumined and depreciated piece from the turn of the century period, about a friendship between a fatally ill man and a melancholy and indebted addict. Talky's dramas are not my cup of tea, and all the weeping wears. Recommended if you like independent, maliciously intellectual and slow paced Merchant Ivory features. <br /> <br /> I suspected the main characters were in love, but their connection was so insinuated that it did not really have the emotional impact of 'Brokeback Mountain'. He presents a good writing with a scene discussing how to disappear in life, but it truly is a somber and depressing film.
