I was quite lost for most of this movie, and it is me who usually understands the work of big names in the movies like David Lynch (Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me) and Darren Aronofsky (Pi). Not to say that Northfork does not make sense on some level, it simply does not combine to form a fully coherent film. As time passes by watching the movie, its themes and intentions become clearer, but during my initial viewing, I was really confused, and I think that's the big flaw in the movie ... its lack of direction. The plot is concentrated in the city of Northfork, Montana, in 1955. The city has been emptied and will soon be flooded to create a hydroelectric dam. The big problem is that not all of its inhabitants are willing to be evacuated and relocated. A group of men are hired to coerce the remaining residents out of the city before they drown and, for the most part, they are successful amidst some rather strange situations and people of the city. At the same time, does the film tell the story of Irwin, a very sick boy (or is he a fallen angel?) Whose foster parents returned him, due to his illness, to the Northfork orphanage where they adopted him. Father Harlan (Nick Nolte) takes care of the dying Irwin, but Irwin imagines (or he ?!) that a group of angels (including Daryl Hannah and Anthony Edwards) arrived in the desolate and empty city in search of a fallen angel. Irwin has scars on his back and head, and he tries to convince the angels that his scars are where humans have amputated their wings and halo. Oh yes, and during all this there is a strange animal walking on stilts that runs through the scenery of the landscape. There are many other small events that happen in the movie, but none of them ends up being much more than a momentary intrigue. One can appreciate the artistic quality of the film (it is obvious that the filmmakers cared deeply about this film) and its rich cinematography, but the film still tries too hard to be different and then gives up and cries to the end without doing much. declaration. As I wrote earlier, it is clear, after seeing, what possibly happened in the film. Irwin is dying, and so is Northfork, and in dealing with his own loss and death, Irwin probably created characters, from ideas he receives from the objects surrounding him at the orphanage, to comfort him when he is abandoned and his life is approaching the end. But again, maybe he's really an angel, and he has found his kind and now he can go home. I must emphasize that there are some truly beautiful moments in the film, painful, vivid and full of loneliness and sadness. Unfortunately, the film as a whole ends up feeling disconnected and somehow incomplete.
