This movie is a nonsensical comedy, in the lines of The Airplane or Naked Gun, but it does not even come close because it lacks originality and a little smarter jokes, instead of just playing you with the same simple old jokes. <br /> <br /> You can find out some references to other movies, from the top of my head I've identified Dodgeball and Rocky, so you can have fun with it by trying to figure out what the movies are. The movie also offers an occasional chuckle, but nothing that can cause you any injuries, so nothing really funny. <br /> <br /> I liked the character of the iPod in some way (even though some of the jokes with him being standard comedy 101). <br /> <br /> I think this movie (and like most absurd comedies / parodies) depends on the mood you are in, so if you think you will laugh at any joke watch this movie. If you are in a serious mood, forget (re) watch The Airplane instead, it will definitely make you laugh
