I have to add a comment to this first <br /> <br /> First, ironically, we need to add the "spolier alert" to suit the parameters of the IMDb, but there is absolutely nothing here to be "spoiled." There are six characters: the good-looking hen, whose list A mountain guide, in the "climbing" area, and apparently among all the guides (including the Sherpas of Mount Everest) on the planet; his lost love, which disappeared from the passage titled two years earlier, whom the party is supposedly looking for, but never finds; his friend a store owner, also a guide, who may be better than a sherpa, but no match for her; the weird main actor that involves their services, and says that they will find their love long gone in the bargain; his only associate, a computer hacker with supposedly unlimited knowledge, of a level sufficient for Gates to ask advice from him; and his other colleague, a bodyguard who apparently has an IQ not even close to three digits. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, nefarious events, and the main actor's secret pursuit is to win the recovery of a satellite that has fallen on the "pass," and has data that alter the world and are unique in bringing riches incalculable. Exactly what is never revealed. <br /> <br /> Superabundance is plentiful, the script looks like something that might have a C- in a class of fledgling copywriters (but an F has been put up on a higher level), and the prophets gnaw each piece of scenery like a horde of beavers. <br /> <br /> The most interesting aspects of this movie for me was juxtaposed portions with three other films or roles that I saw. <br /> <br /> First, mysterious and undisclosed secret data resemble a "The Spanish Prisoner," an A / Mamet movie, involving a valuable, never-specifically-explained, but "better-made" corporate "process" . Definitely not here. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the main cookie proved to be perhaps even more ingenious than "Rambo" in dealing quickly when threatened later in the presentation. <br /> <br /> Third, I remember a Steven Seagal movie (I can not remember the title) where he was half-conscious and stayed about 1/3 of the time, and completely in a coma for a third more. Although I have not sought to see much of his work, I have seen enough to have noticed that while he was in a coma he offered the best work he ever had and most in line with his laconic personality. In this opus, while awake, the young hacker may have been the most engaging personality on the screen, but despite being unwell and incapacitated during the latter part, and unable to demonstrate emotions, he provided the best acting during these seemingly endless two hours. /> <br /> Take the thin and silly base for a plot here. Imagine being compressed into, say, a lb in the SNL with Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Martin Short in all four roles. They could get record laughs with few changes in the dialogue here. <br /> <br /> The most interesting aspect in the last analysis is to contemplate what information could have been on the spy satellite to be worth "billions" to any of the many nations, and still rendered worthless (according to the hacker guru ) if simply put on the internet, with no apparent consequences after that? Even a turkey like this should have at least a little trace of logic somewhere. This is totally devoid.
