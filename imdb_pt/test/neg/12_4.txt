Blake Edwards tried a lot to change the image of Julie Andrews in this movie. He tried to make her sexy, not realizing she was already. I think both were still a little annoyed because Julie had not been chosen to film her success on Camelot's Broadway and was deprecated for not being sexy enough. Unfortunately, they chose this vehicle to try to soften that belief. It gets to the point where it's almost funny to see Rock Hudson, which we all now know was gay, kissing Julie every 2 minutes throughout this movie. It seems now they were not just trying to make you believe that Julie was a femme fatale, but that Rock was straight. Unfortunately, they have absolutely no chemistry together and the endless scenes of kissing begin to fill one of them. The other mistake they made with this picture was not knowing what kind of movie they were doing. There are almost three separate films. There's Julie's drama as the German spy trying to get military secrets from Rock. There is an air war movie with many footage of World War II planes going by and there are the stupid humor attempts that Blake Edwards seems to think he has to insert into each of his photos, whether appropriate or not, in this case. , was not. The only truly redeeming qualities of this film are the always lovely Dame Julie and hear her sing in that crystal-like, bell-like soprano. Of course, if you love her, you can ignore the weaknesses of this movie just because of it. You can always tell yourself, after that, that it was so much better than sitting in the STAR!
