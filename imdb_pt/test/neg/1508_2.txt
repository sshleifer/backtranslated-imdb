The grandmother, directed by Boris Pavlovsky (who?), Sees eight friends experiencing a night of terror when a psycho-murderer dressed in an old rubber mask and a nightgown interrupts the party. <br /> <br /> They say you can judge a book by its cover, but it seems the same does not happen with the DVDs: I was in the mood for a REALLY bad horror movie last night, and since the cover of Grandma showed a picture of the titular killer swinging an ax, terrible typography (they still use the source of the sand system, a definite no-no design!) and credits with absolutely no one I'd heard of, I figured it would be pretty bad. <br /> <br /> It was! <br /> <br /> When a movie reaches just under an hour, you really should not waste much time before you start the action; Grandma, however, spends the first 20 minutes with her group of friends who indulge in useless games and extremely banal conversations. Anyone who actually gets the movie long enough for the murder to begin (and I doubt that healthy people will bother) will be treated to several death scenes with amateur gore, a lot of horrible acting and a surprise ending that is not surprising. (if you have seen the Day of Lies, then you will guess what the turnaround is before it is revealed). <br /> <br /> Grandma is uninspired, unenthusiastic, and almost unassailable. Avoid.
