This is a semi-fictional memoir of an "international man" who has witnessed several political upheavals over the past 30 years. <br /> <br /> I was hoping this film would offer a unique insight into politics and war. I was also hoping it would touch and affect. However, I was disappointed with this movie. "Chico" seemed fragmentary, with the main character, Ricardo, staying in a country for 10 to 20 minutes. As expected, no detailed plot could be drawn in such a period of time. His apologies for moving elsewhere were often explained superficially. The result was a disappointing collection of fragmented clips filmed in several countries.
