Horrid "comedy" in which a beautiful and crazy woman (Liv Tyler) "comedically" destroys the lives of three men (Matt Dillon, Paul Reiser and John Goodman). Dillon hires an assassin (Michael Douglas) to kill her. What's happening with comedy? The year 2001 produced some of the worst comedies ever (Saving Silverman, Sugar and Spice, Freddy Got Fingered, Tomcats, etc etc). This is one of the worst. There is not one, repeat, nor A funny moment in it. The jokes are stupid, bland, dirty, or very sick. There is also a strong hatred of women in this garbage - the only female main character (Tyler) is constantly used as a sex object. Also extreme, bloody violence is thrown at the end. The only bearable moments come from Reba McEntire as a psychiatrist and Andrew Dice Clay in two roles - both psychopaths. Dillon, Goodman and Reiser hit the worst mark of all time - the only way forward is the maximum. And poor Tyler! Did she fail to make independent, intelligent and brave films for that? AND DOUGLAS ???? What was he when he agreed to this? A piece of crap - to be avoided AT ALL COSTS !!!!!!!!!!
