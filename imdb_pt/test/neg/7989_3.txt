"Menlo Park Magician" was deeply responsible for many things we took for granted in 2007: even if he did not invent them without rivals or assistants, he gave birth to the electric light, the phonograph, the film camera, and the electric apparatus. car battery, electric power grid (possibly its most important but less remembered invention), prefabricated house and innovations for the telephone and telegraph, as well as the adhesive tape machine and an early voting machine. The total number of patents is over 1,000 - far more than any other American inventor. <br /> <br /> But Edison was a ruthless commercial competitor. He often had great legal struggles over the precedence of his inventions over rivals. The best example is the telephone, where he was one of seven or eight rivals with complaints against Alexander Graham Bell. In fact, Edison's invention here was not the central idea that Bell and Gray had created independently of each other in 1876, but an improvement in the sound quality of the receiver and telephone transmitter Bell did not develop. Still, it was part of the huge Supreme Court decision of 1888 that was the longest decision of the US Supreme Court (a single volume of its reports!) Written by Supreme Court President Morrison Waite - who, by the way, killed the poor president of the Supreme Court of Justice in weeks. to complete it. <br /> <br /> In 1886, Edison encountered an equally ruthless competitor in the area of ​​electric power networks for large cities. This was George Westinghouse, inventor of the railroad airspace. The Westinghouse firm got help from a new inventor, and from former Edison assistant Nicola Tesla. Tesla developed "alternating current", which was a rival system for Edison's "direct current". The Edison system was basically a straight-circuit electricity system. The Tesla system allowed the current to be switched from one circuit to another - in fact, it was a better and more efficient system. But Edison was determined to break this rival into an advertising campaign. <br /> <br /> It started with power lines. Edison had his lines buried at first so they were not threatened by weather conditions. But Westinghouse was forced to have its lines on the phone lines open. When there were several accidental deaths by repairers on the Westinghouse lines (in particular an incident where the technician was burned alive before hundreds of horrified spectators in the Manhattan business district), Edison began to insist that alternating current was much more dangerous than DC <br /> <br /> One result of all of this was Edison helping some subsidiary inventors obtain Westinghouse AC generators and dynamos for an electric chair. Edison himself always denied that he invented the electric chair, but he helped several smaller figures along the way - for the full story, read Mark Essig's EDISON & THE ELECTRIC CHAIR (New York: WALKER & COMPANY, 2003). <br /> <br /> Edison experiments with cats and dogs (experiments he was happy to show to the public). In the long run, despite helping to invent a new method of execution, Edison was unable to dislodge public support from the Alternating Current. But he never stopped trying. <br /> <br /> In 1903, he had the opportunity to combine his campaign against Westinghouse and A.C. with his invention of the motion picture camera. He helped "overthrow" a well-known public elephant ("Topsy") who had killed several men. He did this by electrocuting the poor beast with A.C. But the whole murder is in the movie - and you can see it to this day. It's a pitiful-looking movie - whatever the poor "Topsy" did, it was a poor animal - not a Machiavellian killer. The moment we see the explosions of electricity sparks that show the death of the elephant, we are aware that soon will end, but the sudden collapse of "Topsy" is still an unpleasant sight to see. The film leaves a bad taste in the mouth of modern movie audiences. However, it is sad to say that it probably made a profit for Edison - his description of the film in his movie catalog shows real pride in his achievement here. In 1903, it could have been an exciting entertainment for many Americans who watched it. It is a pleasure that more people are shocked at this today - sometimes we can feel that the human race has improved a bit.
