The two leaders, an Englishman and an Australian filming a history of the American Civil War in Romania, do not have the slightest spark between them, are absolutely unbelievable as lovers and totally unfriendly. There is no history, no characterization, practically nothing to keep the eyelids apart during this endless festival. Renee Zelwegger, also hopelessly miscada, practically chews the fence posts, but at least seeing her embarrassed provides some comic relief. Nicole Kidman is a very old decade for the role and has no idea what's going on. The foolish role of Jude Law could have been played equally equally by any of the Romanian extras. The only requirement is to wander through the forest looking stupid while watching a parade of invited stars stealing the show. Not that it mattered, because all the roles of the invited stars were completely unnecessary, since they did not advance the so-called plot at a glance. And as if all this were not enough, the author felt the need to play a kung fu spinning, spinning, jumping horses. What was that?
