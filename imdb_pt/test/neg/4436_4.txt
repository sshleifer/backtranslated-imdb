Quintet marks the only venture of Paul Newman and director Robert Altman in the field of science fiction. It was said of Newman that he could not do comedy but he tried until he finally got real success in this genre with Slap Shot. But the failure of this film made him shy and never tried again. <br /> <br /> This is one of the biggest bad movies I've ever seen. It is a glacial futuristic era, triggered by who knows what, but presumably it is a nuclear winter. Even during the ice age of thousands of years ago, the equatorial parts of Earth still held animal and human life, but apparently not here. The seals survived and Paul Newman is a seal hunter on the outside. <br /> <br /> But hunters need a bit of R & R and Newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring that the natives have some kind of game six people and it's kind of Russian roulette. To win, you have to kill five other participants in your game. <br /> <br /> It's sad to see what man has done. Which is one of the reasons why I could not get into this story. The atmosphere is somber, the story is gloomy, the people are gloomy, everything is so gloomy. No wonder this thing was short at the box office. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that almost everyone thinks will never be on Paul Newman's list of ten films, including me. <br /> <br /> This is the future of man, that bore.
