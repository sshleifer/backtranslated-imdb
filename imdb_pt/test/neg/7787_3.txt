This film is a perfect example of how to approach a fascinating subject, create 25 minutes of substantive material and stretch it into a six-hour program that resembles the way a documentary could take if Fox News decided to create one. Even the participants in this hateful film can not hide their laughter at the stupidity of their attempt to show one of the few great moments in world history where people stand and work to build a better world. If only the creators had spoken to Ken Burns for 5 minutes, they might have come out with something a little clever instead of that cure for insomnia.
