This movie had potential. If it had been treated differently. What he needed was a different director. That's right. And maybe a different protagonist. I just can not understand the character of Minnie Driver - or at least how she played. She was completely unbelievable. I can not believe she would have liked her performance in this movie as well. She was probably abandoned by the director or unable to deliver what the director was trying to get her to do. I'm writing this as I'm still watching. I'm thinking I'd hate to be in her place trying to 'do something' that I did not understand. Well, we just followed in case she starts with the son (I'm still watching). Now I am beginning to be deeply embarrassed by everyone involved in this endeavor. If you like watching movies that lose their brand in style, then check out this.
