Honestly, I'm not impressed with that, it's not a bad movie, but it's not great either. There is a story to tell, but it is told in a very incoherent way, that the means of releasing the full meaning and the ability to intrigue. This movie could have been made otherwise with an excellent result, the story is so interesting, but somehow I'm not intrigued when I watch. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not an amateur movie, it's the opposite and some scenes are really emotional. The actors and actresses do a good job, just like the director, but there is something so unfinished throughout the movie that I can not quite understand. Maybe if you had gotten to know the characters a bit more, the whole 'mess' of the movie could have been better clarified and put more 'action' everywhere, because as it was, it got a bit slow from time to time.
