After seeing the DVD release of the Blues Brothers, and the mention of "Wired" in Belushi's biography, my boyfriend and I were hungry for more information about John Belushi. I had heard of "Wired" but did not know much about it and found the way in the back of the local rental store. I understand that Dan Akroyd was really upset about this movie and I thought it was because he did not portray them in a good light. But that had nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The movie starts well, until they take John's body to the morgue. When he wakes up at the autopsy table, and decides to race for him, then begins the total lack of taste of this movie. John is subject to seeing his life and all the turmoil he created with "Angel," a Puerto Rican taxi driver with a malicious sense of humor - subjecting him to criticism and trying to get him across. The two actors who play John and Dan do not seem even remotely similar to the real actors (let alone with any other related person, for example, Lorne Michaels), making it difficult to really focus on them and how they were in real life ... but this is the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> I believe this should be an "artistic" film - John being constantly plagued by drugs (ie, soap powder in the bathroom being cocaine), in such a way that it was also difficult to follow. Flashbacks are agitated, which makes it harder to understand. <br /> <br /> Probably the most tasteless scene was when John is forced (literally) to do his autopsy and feels pain while removing his heart to weigh. , saying that it was abnormally large due to drug use, obesity, yes we understood the point without the grotesque picture. <br /> <br /> There are very few other actors we met in the movie (where Carrie Fisher is). for example? They were incredibly close. And Jim Belushi would have been a great person to show, it seems very cheap, (we felt the graphics were from the early 80's or late 70's) it was like it was filmed in about a week and after all, did not show John's side. I felt I knew a little more about him watching episodes of Saturday Night Live. <br /> <br /> On one last note, Bob Woodward is faced with narcissism when putting himself in the film, arguing with John about how to write his life. story. For someone who should be very intellectual, about the bust at Nixon, his caliber of person could be equal to any writer of the National Enquirer, and therefore lose my interest in any of his works from this point onwards. <br /> <br /> SKIP THIS MOVIE. If you want to see more about John, watch his movies, see Dan Akroyd's clips talking about him or hope someone has the taste of making another film about John, which follows the lines of "Man on the Moon", which is basically what we were expecting. I think this was a kind of "moral" movie - you know, do not use drugs, but I think the creators of this movie did not understand that his death caused several people (like Carrie Fisher) to stop doing drugs completely by this reason.
