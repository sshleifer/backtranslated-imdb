This is a beautiful concept and Brando's acting is a good job. Dean Martin is not bad and Montgomery Clift is very good too. Unfortunately, it's a very disconnected and very long piece that should have been edited for something closer to 2 hours (it's almost 3 hours). <br /> <br /> We followed the life of 3 men from 1938 until the end of World War II and watched as they discover who they are and what they can become as they discover the world about them and what they are made of. . For some, it is the women in their lives who bring this perception, for others, it is the broader general circumstances. However, very often, I wondered what had just happened or what a particular scene mattered.
