A rather shocking undertaking suggests that Welsh is a childish artist, impotent in the violent environment he knows best, but unable to resist empty elaborations rooted in banal fantasy. The first story is a nonsensical mischief, with a science fiction premise of B movie. The second reaches some pungency, but only through the excess inducer of indignation of humiliation visited on its central character. The third and most laughable seems to aspire to be a displaced sequence of Child's Play. The direction is consistently ignorant - all swirling sound and fury, a slave to the extreme discomfort of the environment; choking on an ill-chosen soundtrack with an indistinctly flashy performance. This is pure stupidity masked as a guerilla sensibility - as arbitrary and empty as the abstract images that connect the three sections.
