When the naive young Eddie Hatch, a window dresser from the Savory's Department Store, falls in love with a statue of Venus and gives him a chaste kiss, Venus comes out of his pedestal and gives Eddie more than he expected. This shocking example of what Hollywood can do with a Broadway musical can emphasize futile history and eliminate most of the front-line music. The goal was to make a popular, safe movie without much investment while capitalizing on Ava Gardner's upward mobility to super stardom. Robert Walker as Eddie gets lost in an ungrateful role. Eddie is not just naive but hesitant and unlucky. Gardner is beautiful, but the only things that give life to the film are Olga San Juan as the envious but envious girlfriend of Eddie, Tom Conway as the gentle owner of Savory's and Eve Arden as the long-time Savory, wise secretary. It's a role Arden could play in her sleep, and she's good at it. <br /> <br /> The musical premiered on Broadway in 1943 and made Mary Martin a big star. The only point of a musical, however, is to have music. As One Touch of Venus intended to be a kind of social satire, Kurt Weill, composing, and Ogden Nash writing the lyrics, came up with a slew of witty and witty songs and a masterpiece. Without satire, or clever songs or Martin (or an equivalent showstopper), the film becomes only a fancy comedy fantasy, where much of the comedy is predictable and fantasy is worked to the death. Not only did the film's producers release almost every Weill / Nash song, but also the musical director of the film, Ann Ronell, to write new lyrics for one of the songs that survived, turning sharp lovey-dovey romance. Ronell was not a hack; she wrote Willow Weep for Me. I wonder what she thought while replacing or adjusting Ogden Nash's intelligent work. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in the film is this Weill / Nash masterpiece. "Speak Low" is as much a love song as anyone has ever written. One of these ultra-professional and lifeless treatments is given by Eileen Wilson dubbing Gardner. Dick Haymes contributes a choir. <br /> <br /> As for Ann Ronell, she was one of the few women in Hollywood to become a great musical director, as well as a songwriter and lyricist. Her for a song: The Women of Tin Pan Alley is a fascinating documentary of some of the women who were part of the business, including Ronell, Kay Swift, Dorothy Fields and Dana Suess. And for those who would like to hear the bit of Weill / Nash score recorded by the original Broadway cast, you may be able to track down the CD, One Touch Of Venus (1943 Original Cast) / Lute Song (1946 Original Cast). ). The song is paired with Lute Song, another Broadway show that starred Martin.
