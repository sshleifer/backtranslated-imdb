What should have been a routine babysitting show in a secluded house on the lake turns into a night of terror when student Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) receives threatening phone calls from a sadistic stalker as she tries to stay one step ahead of him . The first 20 minutes of the original movie were very good, but everything went from there. The remake takes the first 20 minutes and extends them into an 80-minute movie. This is a good idea because it is eliminating everything that made the original bad. However, if they wanted the film to work more effectively, they should have hired better actress, best director, writer, etc. There is no suspense, everything can be discovered long before it happens and it is a very annoying movie, since not much happens. . At least there is not much to sit in from your less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> If this premise were to work, then the lead actress would have to give a realistic performance. Camilla Belle gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen and throughout the movie, she seemed to be reading her lines. You have a leading role in a Hollywood movie that will be seen by millions of people and you will not make any effort! Why did they hire this girl? Of course, she is beautiful, but she can not act, but I suppose that will not matter to the target audience who will probably eat this movie. The rest of the cast is soft and forgettable, especially the woman who plays the maid, Rosa. Even the stranger was lame and his lines on the phone were not effective. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of the last years of the disappointing Boogeyman horror film. This movie was a lot of cheap scares and fake alarms and when a Stranger Calls is pretty much the same. Jill enters a room because she hears a noise, but it's just a false alarm like a cat or the maid. This kind of scene happens repeatedly until finally after about 50 minutes, the stranger appears. He has to be one of the greatest killers of all time. He did not carry weapons and did not seem to pose a great threat. The ending is bad, but it suits the rest of the movie, so it does not matter. The film is directed by Simon West and he is very bad at building suspense. He was using all the cliches he could think of and the results were not very good. The house was amazing and I will give the film credit for that. It was an isolated house, so it was pretty scary, but that's the only good thing this movie has to offer. In the end, if you're not a teenager then you should skip the movie. Overall Rating
