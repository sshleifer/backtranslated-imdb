First of all, the title "DAILY" is a lie. <br /> <br /> Every "Daily Show" program opens with a visual on the screen of the date it was made, followed by a break and the opening announcement. On the many days when they are RE-RUNNING a Daily Show, they slip-cue the tape and omit the date and start with the opening announcement giving the false impression that the show is a new one. This is a lie. There is no mention of being a retransmission. And that kind of crap is just a small indicator of how sneaky and deceptive this show is. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, it is only on 4 nights a week. This is not exactly "daily" - that is, from Monday to Friday - another flaw, but which I appreciate. <br /> <br /> It is sad to think that many ignorant young people use this fake news program as their primary, often just, news source. This leaves them woefully ignorant and far worse - poorly misinformed. <br /> <br /> While supporting liberal-left politically, this show can be fun at times. However, its veracity is low. Facts and information are often distorted to suit writers' agendas. It is often difficult to tell where the facts stop being published and the fiction and the comedy begin. The result is pre-digested and reinterpreted information, designed to persuade and influence. This is called "ADVERTISING". <br /> <br /> Remote interviews are heavily made in issue. <br /> <br /> He really loses me when he criticizes God and Christians-which happens so often. However, you will never hear anything vaguely anti-Semitic. <br /> <br /> If Jon Stewart and company attacked someone other than Christians, it would be considered an offensive outrage. The names on the credits explain the source.
