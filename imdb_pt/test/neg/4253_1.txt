I do not see why everyone loves this movie so much. It's true that you have good intentions and meaning, but you can not make up for such a bad script. Woody Allen is a brilliant filmaker, but I'm afraid this is just a piece of crap. It is extremely predictable and the subject is very visible. I'm a fan of Woody Allan and I love most of his work, but this I can not recommend.
