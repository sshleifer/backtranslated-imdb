I thought I might have some laughs from this long movie, but I was sadly disappointed. This movie is about the losers who spend most of their time trying to get a passing grade without even trying to open a book or accomplish anything. The film also portrayed the teachers and director, Mary Tyler Moore (Mrs. Stark), "Labor Pains", 2000 as complete idiots. I know this should be a comedy, but it never made me laugh and I thought the whole movie was a COMPLETE CHALLENGE OF TIME! However, all the actors gave excellent performances and had the difficult task of making this film a nice and fun movie! Simply studying and getting good grades for college is the only way to GO!
