A scientific experiment designed to create a superhuman being went awry. The creators are trapped in a remote outpost of the desert, pursued relentlessly and ruthlessly by their own creation. James Stockton, the scientist whose research was used despite his protests to create the monster, is called the outpost to help undo the horror that now hides somewhere inside the dark corridors. James, along with his son and daughter, soon find themselves trapped inside the others, desperately trying to survive. And with the outpost locked inside, no way out ... "The Outpost" / "Mind Ripper" is highly non-original. The scenarios are very claustrophobic and have a bit of blood. However, as a horror, it fails miserably on almost every level. weak and full of big holes and the end is extremely predictable. Master called Wes Craven produced this one- I wonder if he's happy with this crap. Joe Gayton drives without any style. The acting is horrible, only Lance H Enriksen can act in all places.OK, I'm a big fan of terror and was bitterly disappointed. Avoid it like the plague, it's just the same old boring crap again!
