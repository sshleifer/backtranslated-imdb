Ken Harrison, a young sculptor in his mid-thirties, is seriously injured in a road accident. History end. <br /> <br /> "End of history," that is, in the sense of "end of any physical action". Not in the sense of "end of the movie". Ken's life is saved, but he is paralyzed from the neck down. When he discovers that he is unlikely to regain use of his limbs, he decides he wants to die and asks the doctors to end the medical treatment that keeps him alive. The rest of the film is essentially a long debate about the rights and wrongs of euthanasia and the right to die. <br /> <br /> Ken's main antagonist in this debate is his doctor, Michael Emerson. Although the case against euthanasia is often presented in religious terms, it is presented here in purely secular terms. If Dr. Emerson has any deep religious conviction, it will never be expressed in the film. He passionately believes, however, that death is an enemy against which it is his duty as a physician to fight; allowing a patient to actually take his own life would represent a surrender to that enemy and an abandonment of that duty. Ken therefore finds himself in a "Catch-22" situation. He should be able to show that he is sensible and rational enough to make the decision to end his life. Emerson, however, believes that the desire to die is in itself evidence of insanity and irrationality. Ken's dilemma can only be solved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospital. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss as Ken and John Cassavetes as Dr. Emerson transposed their respective views skillfully and sincerely, but this can not hide fact that "Whose life is it anyway?" it just does not work like a movie. At one time the filmed versions of plays were made in a manner similar to theatrical productions, but in the seventies and eighties this was seen as unsatisfactory because of the differences between the two media. When filming was filmed, then the general trend was to "open" filming both on location and on studio sets, taking liberties with the playwright's text, often making significant changes to the plot and even introducing extra characters. I've never seen Brian Clarke's play, but I suspect this is a story that would work better in theater than in cinema. There is very little physical action; most of the action consists of long discussions around a hospital bed in which the main character becomes paralyzed. Such a plot does not lend itself to the "aperture" device, and the resulting film is very static, dominated by speech at the expense of action. Although well written and well performed, it surprises me that a film has never been made from a non-cinematic subject. 4/10
