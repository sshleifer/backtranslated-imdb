I should have known when I heard Anne Rice leave the project that the movie would disappoint me. I could not predict that years after the release, just thinking about the movie still makes me angry. The novels are incredible, and although I understand that much is lost in translation to the screen, this movie was a big middle finger for her original work. I hope someday someone will try again, in the right way, starting with The Vampire Lestat. They change the roles and appearance of main and minor characters without good reason. They destroy Lestat's story. The queen's acting is exaggerated to the point of comedy, but I just can not laugh. The charm and fascination of novels simply does not exist. The film is a bad excuse to cram as many musicians and "shadowy" images into a single film as possible, in the hope that America's little Goths would curry it. Part of the appeal of the first film, the story of Louis, is that he is trapped between his humanity and his curse. Lestat must assume and display the magic and excitement of the vampire world. Thank God, I read the books first, or I never touched them after that movie.
