What else can I add? This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Terrible acting, an idiotic script, tediously slow pace - even visible microphones hanging from the top of the screen. I could go on, but I really can not be bothered. I watched it for 90 minutes before the feeling of losing the will to live became too big for me. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the first set of comments and votes was from people associated with promoting this insult to the production of British films. <br /> <br /> And even worse, I had to buy the Mail on Sunday to get it :-) The only reason why the DVD has not now been redeployed as a roller coaster is that it now occupies the place featured in my collection Top 10 Worst Movies Ever. <br /> <br /> It should definitely be avoided.
