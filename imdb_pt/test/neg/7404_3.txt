I was hoping this was of the caliber of Das Boot and echoed the realism created by the acclaimed German director Leni RiefenStahl in his documentaries, unfortunately I was monumentally disappointed. The plot is implausible and defies credulity. An RAF aviator is shot down and somehow finds his way to a hospital in Dresden. Anna, a nurse whose father runs the hospital and is about to get engaged to a doctor she works with, falls in love with the aviator and makes love. The next night, at a luxurious engagement party, the airman appears as a German officer and dances with Anna. Although well directed and acted, for me it is a novel of the lowest order.
