This is a flic that you can safely avoid. Cameron (she really should not take on these serious roles - they do not match her) Also, she looks more glamorous, let's face it, she's great at Charlies Angels and she was superb at Something About Mary ... The Pope would not be a good US president and vice versa, what matters to me is that there are some actors / actresses who are suited to a specific type of character and Cameron is the most unsuitable for that serious kind of owner from home - there are a dozen other actresses who would have done a much better job. The film itself is quite unbelievable and juvenile in its plot (I spelled Juvinile right ??) I noticed a reviewer reviewer who gave the box a rating 10 which was ridiculous in his comments on other reviewers who gave the film a 1 or 2 rating and could not spell. I mean, what does spelling have to do with a movie review? Does he mean that people who spell perfectly could appreciate this movie more than those who could not? Come on, Professor.
