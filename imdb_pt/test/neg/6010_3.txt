For producer David O. Selznick, no director would ever do that. So in "A Farewell to Arms" (1957) we have two ?? Charles Vidor and John Huston. Though both men succeeded in their own right, neither could make the head or tail of this disastrous remake of Hemingway's magnum opus. Hemmingway in general has never been translated from the book to the screen. But under Selznick's zeal to turn him into his next "And the Wind Took," the excursion is both punitive and exhausting. At this point in Selznick's career, he was no longer the titan who could take "box-office venom" and turn it into "And the Wind Took." Tired, fragile, without his studio, and with an imminent feeling that his second marriage to Jennifer Jones might have been a mistake, Selznick passed the creative realms of this movie to Fox Studios ?? but he kept enough of himself to become a goddamn nuisance on the set. So far is one, or should be familiar with the bittersweet tragic love story of a nurse, Catharine Barkley (Jennifer Jones) and her soldier hero, Lieutenant Frederick Henry (Rock Hudson). His passion should serve as the stabilizing force for what is essentially a tale of war correspondent with the romanticism played to good measure. But the chemistry between Hudson and Jones is turgid and monotonous. On the last roll, Jones's facial contortions during childbirth are so bad it surprises me that none of the directors have chosen to cut them from the general release. Part of the problem with Jones is that at thirty-eight she's too wise to play the upbeat Catharine with great conviction. However, older actresses have often succeeded in getting an audience to forget the age discrepancies. Not so with Jones. One is painfully aware that it does not fit the bill, either on the chops or the years invested on this planet. Hudson's laconic charm is hopelessly out of step with the stoicism of an army soldier whose heart is broken, but his head remains strong. The supporting cast is peppered with such luminaries as Vittorio De Sica and Mercedes McCambridge, but these are a waste of nonsense that in no way reflect upon the formidable talents of any actor and best evidenced elsewhere in his cinematographic production canons. The "Farewell to Arms" anamorphic image element looks good enough, though there is a bit of a grain of film present in certain scenes to suit this critic. Overall, the colors are subtle and smooth, although balanced according to the DeLuxe color processing employed at the time. Some fading is evident. The flesh tones do not look very natural. Contrast levels are a little weak. Blacks are usually solid. Whites are almost clean. Not much to recommend this movie sonically. It is essentially a wordy image with gun shots as the backdrop. There are no extras.
