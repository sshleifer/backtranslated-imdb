Smooth scattering in the second paragraph. <br /> <br /> Anna Christie was Garbo's first lackluster talkie. She and Dressler seem like the only people who know what they're doing in this movie. The old man who plays Garbo's father (George F. Marion) in the movie is soooo-ah-noying !! All he does is stumble drunk in a totally false way and shout about "dat old dah-veel sea". He blames the "past" of Garbo, his whole life and everything in the sea! He's x stupid 10. Charles Bickford is Matt, the rough sailor that Garbo falls in love with, and he's fine in his role, but nothing really remarkable. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Garbo releases his "terrible secret" in Bickford and his father. Finally, Marion stops talking about sea sickness and hits her head and fists on the table in perfect time with Bickford. So soon he keeps talking about the sea. <br /> <br /> I had to pretty much force myself to break up with Anna Christie. It is very melodramatic in many parts and creaky. There are many good early talkies but this is not one of them. If you have not seen Garbo before you try something else before Anna Christie, like Camille or Grand Hotel.
