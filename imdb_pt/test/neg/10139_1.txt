Reba is undoubtedly one of the worst comedy series of all time. I wonder how there are people writing good comments about "Reba" ... You watch "Friends", "Married Wtih Children", "Fraizer" if you laugh at it, you can never laugh at the stupid jokes and ridiculous singer who is trying to enter the comedy and obviously not having any chance. The actors / actresses next to Reba are fine, so I feel bad for them participating in a so-called comedy show with the least fun person in the world (Reba). To summarize, I suggest this program to see how comedy can come and appreciate the ones that can make you laugh
