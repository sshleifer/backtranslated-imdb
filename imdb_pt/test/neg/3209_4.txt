During my childhood, I saw the first three "Critters" movies and enjoyed them. They were entertaining and entertaining horror comedies, perfect for adventurous children who love terror. I've never seen Critters 4, so I finally decided to check it out. My script by Joseph Lyle and David J. Schow is predictable and clich√©, the plot kicks off "Alien" and "Star Wars" and the scenarios seem soft and obscure. The tone of the film seems to be very serious over time, making it slow and bland. "Critters 4" was apparently so cheap that filmmakers could not afford optical effects; those taken from "Android" look seriously dated. from 10.Um to avoid.
