I watched this movie so you did not need it! I have a lot of respect for Kris Kristofferson, but what was he thinking? Did he do it by scale? <br /> <br /> At least the title of the film practices the truth in advertising, as people and objects routinely disappear throughout the film, increasing confusion. Kristofferson mentions this in his comment that even he was not sure whether Genevieve Bujold's character really existed. This is not good for the viewer to be able to follow the story! <br /> <br /> The "making of" feature was much more interesting than the film itself. He explores the difficulty of raising funds for an indie, even while the film is being filmed. <br /> <br /> To his credit, this movie is visually pleasing and does not look at all like a movie made with just slightly over 1M. Too bad the money was not spent on a better project.
