When I first saw the previews for this movie on TV, I thought this could be a funny movie. I was wrong. All though I'm not totally against movies that make fun of others. Some are really funny, like the first horror movie. This was one of many that have been made lately that are not. The humor in this movie was anything but funny and it was pretty annoying. <br /> <br /> I feel that one of the biggest problems is that they have mocked many movies like Varsity Blues, Friday Night Lights, Stick it and if you're like me, try to choose each movie instead of paying attention to what is happening in this movie. Even the adult mood in that movie was dry. Do yourself a favor and save yourself time and money and do not rent this movie
