This was actually the most painful experience I've had in a while at a movie theater. I will give up criticisms as easy as "corny" or "historically inaccurate" or "crappy crap from a horse" because simply our sympathies would go immediately to those words. If a director makes a great epic of love, well, for goodness sake, MAKE A GREAT EPIC YELLOW GREAT LOVE EPIC! Why bother with ridiculously unconvincing, second-rate harlequins and those boring exchanges between characters we could not care less about when the most decisive battle on Canadian soil was going on? And for the pompous people who think "oh well, this story should center characters!" Well, you're wrong, you're wrong.
