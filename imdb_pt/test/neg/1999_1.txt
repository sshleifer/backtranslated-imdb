That was on SciFi this past weekend, and I had to take a look. After all ... it was science fiction, with vampires and Erika Eleniak. What could go wrong with this B movie? <br /> <br /> Much. <br /> <br /> To begin with: It can not even be classified as a "B movie," because it would put it in the same league as Roger Corman ... and this movie does not even meet his expectations. Most of the money they spent was on the contact lenses of vampires. <br /> <br /> Second: The cast was horrible. Yes, climbing Udo Kier as Demeter's captain was a smart move ... but the director clearly could not even get Kier to memorize his lines. Casting Eleniak in a vampire movie is also a smart move because it means that a bunch of hot faces will buy / rent / record this movie to see it be seduced by a vampire. But the director, writer and producer also spoiled it all. Granted, they've gotten some money from the poor, unfortuate souls who enjoy watching vampire movies with hot women in them ... but no one will remember this movie in another two or three years. <br /> <br /> Third: Little things that just emphasize laziness in this movie. For example, Van Helsing calls a cross a "crucifix", and when Mina is placed in the coffin, the viewer can clearly see the fact that his "chest" is nothing more than pillows. <br /> <br /> Oh and one more thing: why did they choose George Hamiltion-type Dracula instead of something that would seem frighteningly decent? George Hamilton has an overwhelming influence on our future? Why did everyone who saw Dracula just laugh at him because of his presentation? <br /> <br /> A waste of time. Even with a TiVo remote control in your hand.
