This was such a terrible movie, almost a comedy sketch from a noir film. The budget was low compared to a blockbuster, but still bigger than most. But that's where they decided to cut costs which is totally weird. Some actors are in less competent, while others seem to have just been dragged off the street. One of them being the lead actor, he's so bad that I shivered when he said anything (he speaks through the movie ENTIRE). At the beginning of the movie all the characters are wearing 1930s outfits. They drive a classic car, but the background is a modern wind farm that is blatantly state of the art. And the costumes and some settings continue to follow this noir theme from the movie of the 30s. So BAM into a new climbing units with 24 inch wheels .... WTF. So thing again when a guy has a night scope on his rifle, you get a shot at your aim. It targets a guy with a mp5 and tactical. In an even stranger contrast, the locations are bright and seem bird cost more than the rest of the entire movie. The camera pictures / angles one very good, and show these locations brilliantly in the scenes. The director has a keen eye for a single good-looking shot, but has no idea how to do much more <br /> <br /> People who should be filmed for this movie â–¼ <br /> <br /> The writer The director The casting agent The costume designer <br /> <br /> People who should be tortured to death by their monotonous, monotonous fingernails in the chalkboard voice. <br /> <br /> Anton Pardoe- the lead actor, writer, producer If you've ever seen the movie Hostel, I would like this to happen to this guy, but he does not escape.
