Bam Margera's fame Jackass is back with his own reality show, and not only is he not as funny as Jackass, but he's also incredibly stupid! This has to be one of the most stupid shows ever designed. Of course there are worse reality shows, but none are so daring or silly. <br /> <br /> Bam Margera was successful, and his parents decided to take the piggy bank out of his fame. Bam and his parents, his uncle, his crew of idiot friends all live together, and while Bam and his friends are out breaking things and getting into pranks, usually their parents are home being stupid. When Bam's parents are not at home being lazy, they are being tortured by Bam, especially his father. To increase the mood, we are treated with his fat uncle, Don Vitto, who is constantly out of this, and never paying attention. <br /> <br /> This show really is like a weakened version of Jackass ... in that there are no stunts, instead Bam and his friends will only break things, and make maneuvers, while loud music plays to leave everything most incredible. That's not funny at the least. I can not imagine a show dumber than that, because there is an ounce of intelligence found here. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Bam Margera, and want to see one of the many follow up / sequels cash-in for the Jackass series. <br /> <br /> My rating: * out of ****. 30 minutes.
