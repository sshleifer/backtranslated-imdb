Strange, often effective hippie flick zombie, starring the unforgettable team of husband / wife Alan and Anya Ornsby, this movie is not as bad as most in its genre but still very high on the cheese factor. Includes several bar-based zombies, outrageously exaggerated dialogues, a performance of chewing Alan Ormsby scenes, several gay / eccentric thieves, and an unheard-of soundtrack. Anya's wife puts on a performance that is so weird, have to wonder if she's really acting at all. There are worse pictures of this type during the season (look for any Al Adamson movie), but it's not a Night of the Living Dead. Director / screenwriter "Benjamin" Clark is, in fact, Bob Clark, who created the "Porky's" youth exploitation disasters in the early 1980s. He only reappeared after an inexplicably good movie ("A Christmas Story") for return to their terrible ways with "Baby Geniuses". The weirdo Alan Ormsby later wrote the perverse version of Nastasia Kinski / Malcolm McDowell's "Cat People." Moocow says to check out this hippie horror movie for fun, zombie jokes and exaggerated dialogue: = 8)
