I've seen all the episodes, and the characters have remained the same messes that the little ones thought, there's no character development in 5 years (getting pregnant is not development if you're still the same parent girl, only now Delinda complains to Danny because Danny is an ordinary character who is ordained by everyone in his life (he does not have directors of his own morals) especially Maria (who is not around) Sam never changes or grows, which makes him annoying, repetitive and annoying after Season 3 and Delinda. The boring old clich√© is that they do not turn on and off very fast. <br /> <br /> James Cann can act and his character is good to watch, only he is just another wet dream writers hack, an Ex CIA man who has great contacts and training etc so that he can stop any thief or cheater known to man, even if the cameras can not do half of the things they do their fun for a while, however in 5 years the writers act very dumb because? Because they have all this advanced and expensive technology, but no simple walkie talkie (communicating is fast and easy) you never see safety walking on the floor, only when there is a situation, and suddenly everyone is there. <br /> <br /> The plots move very fast from cheating and steal the casino in one way or another, to terrible American flirtations, the same made with death material seen around the world, they have sex, but I hate you, I've always loved you, I think so, but I love you instead, but what if, maybe one day, blah, blah, blah? <br /> <br /> I would recommend '' Babylon Hotel '' to people who like Las Vegas, it has a lot more so simply because the characters are interesting and not forced down the throat for 6 months of the year. <br /> <br /> Am I happy to be British? I'd rather see the same actors in 5 different shows instead of 5 years consistently getting worse in it.
