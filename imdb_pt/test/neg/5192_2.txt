I saw this movie two weeks before going on a snowboarding holiday, so for me it was really just to get my mind on the way to my holiday. The film features some snowboarding skills in all the movies in the action scenes. These moments were great, a bit like watching a radical sports channel. Unfortunately the story was quite honest, the acting was generally well, with a rather small cast. This movie is apparently comedy, at least it tries to be comic, but it seems that the comedy and the plot were written by a teenager. The story has no depth or purpose and comedy strives to be something more than a little giggle a few times during the movie. It may be worth renting just to watch the snowboarding action but again there are many movies out there that are totally dedicated to snowboarding stunts and do not feature a badly written UN history.
