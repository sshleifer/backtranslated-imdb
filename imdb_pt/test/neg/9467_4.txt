The lines in the title of this review are the first lines of the theme song of this movie, a wonderfully insane parody of the (in my horrible opinion) "My Favorite Things" song from "The Sound of Music". And that fun little detail is not the only thing that makes "The Body Shop" aka. "Doctor Gore" (1973) is commendable to my Gore / Trash colleagues. The film, which was created almost entirely by JG Patterson Jr., who served as producer, writer, director and leader as the homonym Dr. Gore, is crap, no doubt, but it is also undoubtedly fun, and that all involved, probably Patterson especially, were aware of this. that they were not exactly doing a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dr. Brandon (Patterson), a famous but totally insane plastic surgeon, loses his beloved wife Anitra, a model, in an accident. Along with his humpback assistant Greg (Roy Mehaffey), he kidnaps pretty women to build a perfect new wife out of his body parts ... "Doctor Gore" is undoubtedly a " so bad it's kind of good, "but also has qualities beyond the usual ridiculous unpredictability. Crazy science has always been one of my favorite themes for Horror, and in fact it's also one of the coolest topics for the ridiculous Gore Trash films. Obviously filmed on a minimal budget, "Doctor Gore" pays tribute to the films "Frankenstein", especially James Whale's masterpiece "Bride of Frankenstein" (1935), and resembles the look of the early Troon / Herschell Gordon films Lewis Gore as "Blood Feast" (1963) - but this seems much cheaper and uglier. Obviously, JG Patterson's motive was not merely to make an entertaining film: being a rather ugly and odd-looking fellow, his role as Dr. Brandon gave Patterson the opportunity to kiss with two hot, poorly dressed young men (who later would end them). as part-body donors in Dr. Brandon's lab). <br /> <br /> Most of the blood is actually well made against the obviously minuscule budget. The dialogue includes some extremely hilarious lines ("Take this, it may be the door ... and put on a coat so they do not see you are a hump"). In addition to the theme song mentioned above, "Doctor Gore" also includes a wonderfully bad look from a country band called "Bill Hicks and the Rainbows" - my favorite new band, NOT. For the rest of the movie, I was wondering if Bill Hicks and Roy Mehaffey, who plays the hunchback, are twins or even the same person - the two look exactly alike, and have two obese and bearded red faces looking at it. Strange in a movie would be a big coincidence. Unlike J.G. Patterson, most cast members have never made any other films. This is the first movie I've seen a few by Patterson. Unfortunately, the man died of cancer in 1975. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Doctor Gore" is a film that certainly is not for everyone. In fact, it's total crap. But it's also fun and commendable to my fellow strangers and cheap stuff at campgrounds. Dictionaries should show a screenshot of this movie in "junk movie".
