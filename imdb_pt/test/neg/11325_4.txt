. . . and this is only if you like the sight of a beautiful woman with beautiful jugs jumping by the so-called African jungle. So there are no problems for most males out there. <br /> <br /> I watched it as one of those packages together. Forget the plot that is essentially just a fragile plot to get our heroine blinking her on-screen jars at every possible opportunity. Just to give you an idea, our heroine swings from vine to vine and climbs over animals whenever possible, without good reason, just to allow her to see jugs from every angle. Again, no complaints there. <br /> <br /> The "fight scenes" are ridiculous and limited in the pornographic. Our heroine was caught by the bad guys at least five times in the movie. On occasions when she has to fight, the "fight" involves rolling on the ground, grunting unconvincingly and basically fighting like kittens. It surprises me that no hair pull is involved. It gets so bad that the evil boss had to remind the "fighters" that "I said, the one who attracts the first blood wins!" in order to avoid watching more stupid fights. <br /> <br /> The sorcerer Kuku was a bloody blast. From being a big bear and cuddly at first, he became manic depressive when caught and then completely psychotic. He spent the whole movie muttering lines without irrelevance. <br /> <br /> Next to Liana (our heroine) jumping topless, you also see many other Amazonians as well as a woman who decided to jump naked on the lake to take a dip without good reasons. Yeah, it's that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Watch the beautiful Liane in her inflatable glory. Although the film is over 20 years old, the fascination of seeing blond women showing their beautiful on-screen jars never gets old.
