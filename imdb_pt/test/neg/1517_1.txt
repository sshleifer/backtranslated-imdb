Wow, this movie was terrible. It's as simple as that. In fact, it's the first time I leave early, as far as I can remember. But it went well: I had a very nice conversation with two more charming girls, while we all waited for the rest to finally give up that crap they called "movie." <br /> <br /> Where to begin. Bad acting, bad jokes. Fecal humor, I simply can not stand. Sorry, but snot, pee and scat are not funny. Did you see the title photo? This scene really drags on for about 5 minutes, with the two "heroes" hitting and mutilating each other, which is supposed to be funny by itself. It is not. <br /> <br /> In addition to bodily fluids, violence and transvestism, I do not remember much about it. At least not very good. I was really disappointed in that piece of crap. Or let's be honest here: since I'm actually a big fan of "British" (ie, black) humor, I was angry. <br /> <br /> So, you want my advice? Three words: do not watch.
