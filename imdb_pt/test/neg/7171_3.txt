The Willies start late at night when brother Josh (Joshua Miller) and Kyle (Jason Horst) are camping outside with their cousin Michael (Sean Astin), they decide to spend time telling scary stories ... <br /> First is Michael with a story titled 'Maple Maples', in which a young man named Danny Hollister (Ian Fried) is bullied at school, however, the sinister new janitor Mr Jenkins (James Karen) decides to help him .. Then Kyle tells a strange story called "Flyboy," in which an overweight bully with a worrying fascination with dead flies gets what he deserves in a horrible and distorted way ... <br /> < Written and Directed by Brian Peck The Willies have not done much for me and I doubt I'll do much for you as well. The script is strange with regard to episodic anthologies, instead of the usual three or four stories that have only two main tales and some bizarre scenes of the "urban myth" type at the beginning, consist of the person who asks for food from a food restaurant quick just to find a dead rat in her hen, a man dying of a heart attack on a ride & someone trying to dry her poodle off in the microwave just to blow it up. I have no idea what the purpose of these scenes are, but they do not add anything to the movie, since the two main stories are both weak. For starters, they are very long, which is a big mistake in these types of movies, usually the stories in anthologies are short, crisp and fast, with a good twist in the end, usually involving people getting what they deserved. However, in The Willies the stories last for the better part of 40 minutes each, which is longer than the average episode of TV and I must admit that I found both stories very boring, they have very little to them and seem to be intended to children. The first story is the best to watch as a whole, but it has no twist as far as I could see, while the second has a beautiful ending 'just deserts', but the compilation is weak and with no good reason. I really like horror anthology movies, so The Willies comes as a disappointment, frankly, it leaves the genre down. Director Peck was obviously working on a low budget as a whole. , there are many errors of continuity and it is poorly done. There is no atmosphere, no scares, no blood, special effects are bad and features unnecessary shots of a dirty bathroom several times. Overall, it's a very unpleasant movie to sit on. <br /> <br /> Technically, the Willies are rough around the edges to say the least, the effects are far from special and have an extremely monotonous and grainy look for the image. The acting is bad, no one will win prizes for sure. Willies is a bad movie, not scary, not fun, not fun and has only two long stories. Definitely not recommended.
