I am evaluating 'The Decline of the American Empire' almost below average since it was not terrible, but neither is it great. I enjoyed the very open conversations of people so incredibly selfish and ugly inside and out. Was that probably the most original aspect? a small sex movie full of dialogue with people extremely distant from the models. Moreover, it seems ironic that these francophone Canadians have a movie about a neighboring society that, well, is in 'Decline' when their own actions are their own death. A group of female friends and male friends spend half the film laughing at their infidelities and acceptance of such behavior and the other half "intellectually" talking about how powerful they are for their speeches and actions. These are the normal targets in typical sitcoms that main characters make fun at parties mostly occupied by college professors. Unfortunately, it is not his "intelligence" or mastery of "history" that disturbs me. It is their pedestal made of ego and mightall-than-thou attitude that pushes me off and not a character could I relate to, nor do I like. When one cries, could not I care less? It's your bed. When someone complains, I barely back away. What made me skirmish was a character, uh, peeing red. (Another example of playing with fire.) Of course, I understand this happens to some people, but it was difficult to watch. And I sincerely hoped he would wash his hands, as he had no problem in re-cooking for everyone. At the opposite end of the educators noses, they introduce a stereotyped nomad. It made me shudder as no one seemed real; everyone was as shallow as their laughter in society. Unfortunately, with no one to cheer on, you're as empty as the souls of these characters.
