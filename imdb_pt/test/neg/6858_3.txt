It may be unfair for me to review this film because I left well before the end. This is strange, because I usually like Shakespeare on screen and enjoyed the Dream of a single night once, many years ago, when I saw him on stage. <br /> <br /> I think two things influenced me: twerp with the name of Shakespeare, Calista Flockhart and Michelle Feiffer sitting on a giant shell. Well, I suppose you could say it should be a comedy - but when the setting is funny and the actors are not, I'd say we have a bad movie in our hands ...
