Being a fan of ZaSu Pitts comedies, I thought this one seemed worth trying. I was quite disappointed. <br /> <br /> (The version I saw was in TCM, but it consisted only of the Niagara Falls movie, Miss Polly's movie was absent.) The talents of the actors, who give great performances, are wasted in a of the most stupid stories I've ever had the misfortune to sit on. Tom Brown (Tom Wilson) surprised me by being the strongest actor on the show, but the limelight is attacked by Slim Summerville (Sam Sawyer), who, if he has any talent, did not demonstrate this here. <br /> <br /> ZaSu Pitts (Elly Sawyer) is great but does not have a big enough part. The biggest laugh of the movie is when it ends up under Sam under a table. <br /> <br /> The only one in the movie that makes any sense is Tom Wilson. Margie (Marjorie Woodworth) is unreasonable in general. While she is physically quite attractive, her personality and attitudes make her completely undesirable. Elly, Sam and the hotel receptionist are just complete idiots. <br /> <br /> Sam and Elly give up their honeymoon suite at the crowded hotel for Tom and Margie. But then they take it back. Sam ends up imprisoning Tom and Margie in her bedroom. Most of the movie is that they try to run away, but Sam, using a rifle, always puts them back. <br /> <br /> In the end comes the worst part. Tom, who is finally about to flee, meets a minister on a lower floor of the hotel. Now the guy, who, like I said, is the only one in the movie who has his head on his shoulders, suddenly, for no reason at all, decides he has to marry Margie! <br /> <br /> He drags the minister into the room he just escaped, but Margie does not want to marry him. He gives her a kiss, and now, after a kiss, she feels compelled to marry him. Finally, Sam has the guts to say to Tom, "You fooled me," when practically the only line Tom told Sam before, "We're not married," to which Sam replied, "You think that I believe it? " <br /> <br /> Idiot.
