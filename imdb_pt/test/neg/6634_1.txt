First of all this movie has the most stupid plot of any movie I have ever seen, and unfortunately I had to see this. I was flipping through channels one day and ran into that awful excuse for a movie, and that confirmed what I've been saying for a long time. Carrot Top is not an actor, and it's not funny in the least sense. He acts as a great comedian and thinks he catches the public's attention. Honestly, he has the acting ability of a 10-year-old clown, scratching that less than 10 years' worth of comparing them to Carrot Top would be a gross insult to his good name. This movie tries to be funny using a boring liner that all seem to have been taken from the 50's cartoons. In the end, I would have done anything to erase my memory of this movie, but unfortunately the memories are with me. The only thing I can do is to warn others not to watch this movie. However, this proves that the rumors that the real Carrot Top can not act are worth it.
