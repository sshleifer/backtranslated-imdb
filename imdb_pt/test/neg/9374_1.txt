After a few Dutch action films, such as Lek and Van God Los, Gerrard Verhage wants to make a movie about the life of a Dutch mobster. Well, the mafioso is an important word for Klaas Bruinsma. He is not a big international guy like George Jung (Blow) or Pablo Escobar. He is just a lowlife from Amsterdam who made some money selling light drugs. Things are often exploded in Holland, and this film is just another example. But even so, the film could be very good if the story was well told. Now there are big leaps in time: one day KLaas is just an ordinary boy, the next target seems to be a great actor on the drug scene. No one knows how this is possible (except for those who read the book). The acting is very bad, non-Dutch moviegoers can see one of the worst actresses in the Netherlands: Chantal Janzen. When you think she finally gets naked then you are watching a booth in the model. So: bad acting + bad editing + shit story = From Dominee. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch, even if other people say it's good, because it's not. I warned you.
