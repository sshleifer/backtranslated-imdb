No shame of my time as a spectator. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. Please do not rent as you will regret doing it! Guaranteed! I wonder how Kathleen Turner ended up in that! She is a legitimate actress and people might be drawn to this movie because of her. But it's better to act like this title has never been done! It should not have come up!
