It's not uncommon for Hollywood to like making bad movies. Occasionally, a handful of good movies come out of them, while most just suck their big butt. Nor is it surprising that these bad films are retreated from old TV shows. Occasionally comes a surprise with "The Fugitive" (who saw the Oscar for best picture?), But for every "Fugitive," there's a McHale Navy or some totally unoriginal film, devoid of any plot or interest. The Mod Squad, in my opinion, enters my top ten of really bad movies, in which Hollywood should have regretted producing what could have been a good movie. We move right in the middle of a story that does not seem to make sense, wastes talent, and dialogue is bad. We really do not know who the hell these characters are, and we could take a good look at what they are. Instead, you are expected to automatically know who they are and what they will do. There's a particularly bad riff on the line, "I'm too old for this shit," which is just plain stupid. Something that my friend noticed verbally when we cried at the end of the movie. It's just an insult to Hollywood movies. Grade: F-
