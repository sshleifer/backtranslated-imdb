I did here this movie was good of several people. In addition, I like Natalie Portman and Javier Bardem, as well as director Milos Forman. However, after watching this movie, I really had nothing to wonder about. <br /> <br /> First, the performance was far below average. The performances were not powerful enough to really feel shocked at what the inquisition did. Javier Bardem gave solid performance and was probably the only one that actually had such a Spanish accent. It's pretty obvious why this Bardem was the only one. Natalie Portman, who I think is a great actress and actress, did not really make me feel sorry for her being tortured. Like the movie, there was nothing to admire about his performance. Stellan Skarsgaard, which I like, gave a very average performance, like the other actors giving a boring performance. This film has been essentially about him since he plays Goya. However, it did not become what it needed to be to make this movie good. What about Randy Quaid? You just have to be kidding me. He playing King Charles IV. See that he's great at comedies, but he plays a King who just describes the whole movie for you. <br /> <br /> The direction was horrible in this movie. When a movie is a mess, there are usually two people to blame: the director and the writer. I have the impression that Milos Forman did not really want his actors to put on a Spanish accent. Of the few battle scenes here were all horribly displayed. Also as a director, he must give you the shock of what the inquisition did. After this movie I felt I could neglect the event. To summarize everything, he barely filmed the scenes and deceived the actors. <br /> <br /> The writing that was also made by Milos Forman was so bad or perhaps even worse than the direction. There was really nothing memorable about the film, except for a visa where Bardem gets the same treatment as the Portman character did. Besides, the film did not give him the feeling of the time period, and at least he could have made up for it with one or two quotes. <br /> <br /> After finishing this movie, I was just looking at the TV. thinking well why should I worry about any of this. I care and I'm very interested in history, but when movies like this come up, it seems like the producers stole from you something good that could have been taken from the movie. When movies are so bad, we highlight many of the technical flaws in a movie than if it were good. Like the accents. I'm not sure if people would have emphasized the lack of Spanish accent if this movie were good. <br /> <br /> The main point of this review is to say just do not watch it.
