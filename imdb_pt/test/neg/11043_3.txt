Oldboy is set in Korea and begins when a drunken Da-su (Min-Sik Choi) is taken out of the police station by his friend just to be kidnapped, Dae-su wakes up and finds himself in a small room that he will be imprisoned over the next fifteen years. Dae-su is fed and cared for by his unknown captors, but he is never allowed to leave the room, Dae-su begins to train himself to take revenge after he leaves, what he intends to do, dismantling the masonry cement with a chopstick . However, before Dae-su finishes he is gassed and unconscious, when he wakes up, Dae-su finds herself free on the roof of a tall building dressed and all the money earned. Dae-su instantly tries to find out who imprisoned him, after meeting the beautiful Mido (Hye-jeong Kang) that the two fall in love and along with his help Dae-su finally finds what he is looking for, but the truth comes a price. .. This South Korean production was co-written and directed by Chan-wook Park and received several positive reviews (the kind that distributors can choose from in quotation marks and put them in the video box) and even won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes while he was also nominated for the Golden Palm so certainly Oldboy is a true classic? Well, not for me, it's not because I can not understand why it is so dear and I would even say that I hated it beyond one or two isolated moments. To begin with, I could not get into the story, I just did not like it because I thought it was slow and boring and while many wanted you to believe that Oldboy has the biggest and most shocking turnaround I ever thought it was. quite simple and not very well executed either. The end in which Dae-su goes to the New Zealand Alps to be hypnotized seems to be marked as if the creators wanted some sort of happy ending. In almost two hours I almost fell asleep. I was so bored, violence is meek and it is the thought of what is happening with which I imagine that most people have a problem rather than what is actually shown. In fact, Oldboy has a very low score of about seven and a light sex scene is not so graphic or memorable. I did not heat up the character, and although I do accept it, Oldboy has a well-defined concept and premise, he can not deliver, and it's a film that I'll never understand why so many people seem to like it. <br /> <br /> Based on a Japanese manga of the same name, Oldboy, the movie looks right, there are one or two cool visual moments here, though everyone gets excited about the fight in the hallway that happens in a single continuous shot, I was impressed and thought the choreography was pretty boring. The actual violence on the screen amounts to very little, Dae-su eats a live Octopus that apparently is quite normal in Korea anyway, there are some fight scenes, a severed hand, someone's teeth are plucked and there is some blood in the end. <br /> <br /> The budget was supposed to be around the $ 4,000,000 mark, which is actually a fair bit, filmed in South Korea and New Zealand. The acting looks right, but it's hard to tell when the actors are speaking a different language. Oldboy is a film that I found an absolute task, I do not care about subtitled movies or foreign films or paying attention to the plot as I followed the thing perfectly, but I just did not like anything and it's so simple and straightforward as that. Apparently, the second in the revenge trilogy of director Choi-wook Park, which also includes Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) and Lady Vengeance (2005).
