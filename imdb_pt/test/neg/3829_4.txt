Alice Dodgson, a New York physician, leaves her wallet suspended when she treats one of her patients with an unapproved drug, resulting in the death of the patient. Without work, Alice is forced to go to Jamaica, where she takes care of a rich man's brother. The brother thinks he is a zombie and is deeply involved in the practices and voodoo rituals of the local people. "Ritual" is a mediocre horror film. The action is very monotonous, the twists are silly and there is no suspense. a little blood as someone is killing white people with a machete, but not much. The cinematography is decent, however, the acting is truly regrettable. Definitely one to avoid. 4 out of 10.
