I do not understand people who rated more than 5. I think it's a horrible movie from any point of view. Plots, acting, art, dialogue, music, whatever! I do not mind a low budget .. However, you have to get some point. Wandering, imagining ... without limits ... then two boys started kissing on the bed. horrible, just horrible. I love indie movies, I do not mind being slow. However, this movie disappointed me from any perspective. Even the Graffito, not artistic. <br /> <br /> I wanted to know what kind of people they would like. I'm a woman in my 30's. Is it for teenagers who have some kind of loneliness about life, or do I just not understand? What did I gain then? Wasting time! Please go for some others.
