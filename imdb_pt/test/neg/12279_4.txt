This movie is very violent, but exciting with original dialogues and cool characters. It has one of the most exciting stories and is very true to life. The film begins with action star Leo Fong as a cop approaching the end of his career when faced with a large case involving corruption, black correspondence and murder. This is where the killings begin. From the beginning of beginning Fong delivery it has to see caper of action. This movie is also co-starring Richard Roundtree. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie as a kid, but when I got older, I realized that this movie is really cheesy and not very good. I would not recommend this movie and the action is very, very bad.
