It was (foolishly) with some degree of pleasure that I sat down to watch what a friend had promised would be the worst / best movie experience of my life, the powerful 'Roller Blade 7'. 2 years later and I'm still in therapy. Oh yes my dear friends this really is bad. Obviously, they got about 40 minutes of footage in the can and then decided to use the said image infinitely and repeatedly for the effect of numbing the brain. My only fear of the type of post-apocalyptic world featured in this turkey is that somehow an impression of this abomination would survive. Truly the living would envy the dead.
