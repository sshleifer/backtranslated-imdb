After reading the novel, which is about an hour of reading, watching this movie has become a sad disappointing experience. Just as he did in the prince of Egypt, Simon's wells somehow managed to direct a script that took away all the drama and mystery of its original material and transformed it into this homogenized absurdity. Now I'm a sucker for cheese and camp, but this movie made absolutely no sense. There was no joy in any of the performances or any mood. There were no emotions and that silly bookend with the addby character of filby throwing his hat in the air was the last straw of hackwriting. I felt so violated when this movie was over and I still refuse to believe it was only 90 minutes that lasted forever. I wondered how the studio and director could have such a bad script, but then my friend introduced me to the film exactly how it was and I said wow that sounds great but what happened to the movie.
