This review contains a partial spoiler. <br /> <br /> Shallow from the start, 'D.O.A.' at least it starts off as if it could be absurd fun, like "The Game" by Fincher. Its central character (Dennis Quaid) suffers from a sequence of nightmare events that appear to be creating a twisted and shrewd thriller. But the plot follows a very large pace, leading to a dramatic turnaround when the character learns that he has been poisoned and has only 1-2 days to live. And that, simply, is a very big change to casually add to a story. Once this has happened, the only chance of success of the film is if it treats the psychology of someone in this situation as its main, in fact, its only subject: but 'D.OA.' continues as if this is just a normal revelation like any other you might encounter in a thriller. The problem is twofold: first, Quaid's actions do not convince how likely someone is to be in their situation; and secondly, even if they convince it, it is difficult to care what happens next, when the most significant point of the plot has been solved prematurely. The rest of the film is pretty standard for such a movie, but it has become more boring than usual due to the character's slightly treated situation, which logically outweighs the events in which the film is interested. Dennis Quaid, in the lead role, is not convinced either as an exhausted teacher or as a man who is destined to die: Meg Ryan is, as often times, ditzy and annoying. Another negative feature is the ugly soundtrack of the '80s. Watch' The Game ', which with similar roots remains firm and directed by characters, while' D.O.A. ' derives in developments that only undermine its own premise. As the premise is quite intriguing in itself, it's a shame to see her drowned in an over-cooked super plot.
