This movie has a rating of 7.0 in IMDb, so until I felt something rotten in its synopsis, I decided to give it a try. What a waste of 100 minutes. First of all, the '80s were not a good decade for the crime and suspense genre. Most of these, in those days, were poorly done with a silly storyline (if they had any) then there are very few who can stand out, and even if they were good, they are still not very good. Hit, however, suffers from everything that makes the silly pictures of the crime foolish. It has poor character development, improbable plot and was not written or directed in a decent way, and when you have such shortcomings the acting does not help. Stephen Frears often tried to imitate the new French wave in English cinema and the two do not match. <br /> <br /> Terence's first stamp is 10 years hidden because he testified against some of his former partners in crime. He hides in Spain, everywhere. He is finally caught, and than first kidnapped by a group of silly Spanish thugs, should only be removed by a distancing to the two killers who should deal with him. These two are John Hurt, who must be well cooked, stone cold killer and Tim Roth (in his first role) as devil's apprentice. They do not kill Stamp immediately, they first discard the "three Friends" they should not have hired in the first place, and then, they are driving Stamp to Paris because one of the friends he testified against wants to confront him. Okay, this is possible. But even with Stamp being such a dangerous figure they had to hire four guys to dominate him, they do not tie him up, they do not cripple him at all, and drive around with him, as if he's one of their friends. Stamp does not object and is happy to go to Paris to be shot, not using half a dozen chances, these "professionals" offer him to escape. It seems that Tim Roth is just a bully at school, making the idea of ​​a crime boss joining a tough man like John Hurt even more unlikely, especially in such an important job. But John Hurt is not so difficult, he spends twenty minutes of the film, killing or not killing the totally surplus Australian, played by Bill Hunter, whose sole purpose in this film is to introduce the lovely Laura Del Sol, his lover. (whom he claims to be 15, but she looks more like 25), and whose role in acting and acting skills suggests that she was offered the role, only on the basis of being the mistress of the director or producer at that time. After much deliberation, Hurt kills the Australian, but takes his mistress for no apparent reason. He wants to kill her, but Roth in his "subtle ways" convinces him not to kill him, so even he kicks, bites and itches throughout the film, he remains faithful to this deeply buried human side of him . >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> All Products Anyway, the movie crawls. Tim Roth falls asleep, guarding Terence Stamp with his gun in his chest, and Stamp just waits watching the waterfall. Than all the confusion of a plot comes to the point where everything we've seen in the last hour and 20 minutes just goes out the window. Let's recap, the whole point in not killing Stamp immediately (except for having a movie) is to take him to Paris, so your ex-partner should have a last word with him. And the main point in him not to run away is that he is prepared to die, saying, "It's just a moment. "But my friends, this is where the plot turns, Hurt kills the man while he is still in Spain, and we asked why bothering and driving for days, he could have done it in the first 15 minutes, and contrary to his Stamp philosophy is too scared to be killed, so we asked him again why he did not run away, and he had many chances. Roth is dead as well, but he should not be in the movie, and Del Sol, well, she promised a role in this movie purely for romantic reasons (read sexually), so she stays alive again, even she attacked Hurt for the 15th time in the movie. He killed everyone else but not her, she must have the maximum appearance of the screen. The film was made on a shoe string budget and shows, but when you have no history and card characterizations, it shows even more. And yes, Fernando Ray appears and passes the movie as the guest star, taking a single audible line of dialogue. Horrible
