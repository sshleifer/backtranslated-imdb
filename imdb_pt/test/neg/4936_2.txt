Maybe SPOILER !! Well, I saw this at the Cologne Film Festival and I have to say it's ridiculous ... sorry author and writer and ... anything, but it's the worst attempt to make a good movie I've ever seen ... if you have 5000 times the possibility of moving away from your enemy and you do not do this ... it's getting annoying ... there are szenes in the movie that gives you the impression that they are forgotten, for example. a szene in front of a security camera, they are asking for help and someone sees this and calls the police ... that there is a cut and .... NOTHING ?? !!! ... the killer gets shot in the head and 50 seconds later he's behaving as if nothing had happened ... it's not a zombie movie ... and finally the final ... the BIG END that we were promised. ... hmmmm, let's say, take a guy who always wanted to give the world one of the best finals in history, so much that everything goes wrong ... I'm not going to vote "1" because the actress is beautiful ...;)
