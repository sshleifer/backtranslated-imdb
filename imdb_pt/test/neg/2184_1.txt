I found it hard to care about these characters, who were either boring or insipid, all living their fabulously urban hilarious lives. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was excruciating at times, and at other times the narrative seemed difficult to follow - was it me or were they deleted whole scenes? It sounded like a bad comedy somehow turned into a movie. Stereotypes and jokes about "men's groups" may have been funny in the early 1990s. As it is, that's where a lot of the movie's humor comes from - and man, he gets old fast. <br /> <br /> In addition to the attractive Irish man - this movie was a failure. And not even in a "so bad is good way". The last 20 minutes were particularly painful. Maybe, if you've never met gay people or have never thought about homosexuality before, then this movie may have something significant to say. Otherwise - honey, you'd still want to rent The Boys in The Band or Beautiful Thing.
