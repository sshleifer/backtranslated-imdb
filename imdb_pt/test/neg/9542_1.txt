Wow - this movie was really bad! Do you talk about typical stereotyped movie plot? Watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick wall. The transitions kept trying to be cool, but they failed. The turnaround at the end, where we find out who the bad guy is, was unexpected, but it does not make much sense until his monologue. Even so ... The amount of blood in this movie does not help either. Are all of these images necessary? My last complaint is about the plausibility of parts of the movie. Would the PD actually send a lone cop to a warehouse, underground tunnel or where to find a body, when the criminal's location is unknown? And why does the romance in the end simply happen suddenly? It's as if the writer was trying to fit in as many Hollywood clich√©s as he could. Do not waste your time looking at this piece of ... anything.
