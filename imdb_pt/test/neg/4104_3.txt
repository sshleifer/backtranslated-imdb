I do not want to sound like much spoiling, but if the accidental death of a butterfly by a time traveler caused such a huge change in the timeline, how could it be, since the butterfly would have been incinerated by the pyroclastic explosion? of the erupting volcano anyway? And how could time travelers return to the same moments and not continue to meet their previous and later selves who were also in those same few minutes on the timeline? It looks like there would have been a large crowd in front of that carrying dinosaur. <br /> <br /> Although I can accept the idea of ​​a wave of time, I seriously doubt that the wave has caused only a few changes. As the wave passed, all the changes that would have happened would happen immediately during the passage of that wave. So, scratch the idea of ​​the city starting to get covered in jungle. And why the jungle at all? The city's location would still be in the latitude and longitude of before and would have vegetation appropriate to its geographical location on Earth. <br /> <br /> And an endless list of other illogical inanities. <Br /> Bwahahaha! This film is a strange combination of some pretty decent production values ​​and totally ridiculous batch holes and factual errors. <br /> <br /> Too bad. A great idea of ​​history that was invented with silly science. <br /> <br /> I sigh ... why, why, why, why? Why waste all this money on production and not even bother revising the script to see if it made any real sense?
