Too bad PRC cheapie that I rarely bother to watch again, and no wonder - it's slow and chia and lackluster like a butter knife. Wacky doctor George Zucco is doing it again, turning a jumpsuit (Glenn Strange) into a werewolf. Unfortunately, the makeup is practically non-existent, consisting only of beard and dimples most of the time. If it were not for the presence of Zucco and Strange, along with fluffy Anne Nagel, that would be completely unacceptable. Strange, who would continue to play Frankenstein's monster for Unuiversal in two years, looks like Lenny's impression of "Of Mice and Men." <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (of four)
