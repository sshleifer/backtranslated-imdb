I have a lot of respect for Mr. Argento's work, but this movie does not have many of the qualities that make your movies really unique. The opening for the film is great, and it prepares you for the possibility of a really scary horror movie. What happens to the rest of the film lacks structure or purpose and is not based on much. There are some good performances, and lots of atmosphere. The end of the film is weak, considering all this accumulates. Where there should be a great climax of huge proportions, you have a very typical conclusion that many other bad horror movies use, making it look like they just had to wrap it up. A couple of scenes are very memorable for your images, but in the end the movie does not gel to make a really good movie. Unless you think you need to see everything this director did, I suggest you go through that ...
