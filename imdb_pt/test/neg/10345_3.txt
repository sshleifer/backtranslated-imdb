The idea behind Dead Silence is great: the outbreak of zombies happens during a paranoia radio program. There was a lot for this movie. Unfortunately, as soon as the zombies appeared, everything was lost. <br /> <br /> The film is ridiculous and only those with a passion for b-flick horror will like it. The zombies were sooooo stupid! They ran around waving their arms. They looked like a bunch of people putting a haunted house for elementary school students. <br /> <br /> I know this is a brief review, but I just do not see the need to invest too much into it. It's a stupid movie. You have been warned.
