I am writing this note as a chess player as well as as a movie viewer. I watched the 1997 Kasparov-Deep Blue games on the Internet. I know something about the issues that have been raised. Other chess players will appear and want to know if this movie is worth seeing / buying, and I'm talking a lot with them. However, I will try not to ignore those who are not "in the chess". <br /> <br /> This film is about the departure of 1997 between Garry Kasparov and the computer "Deep Blue" tailor made. However, the first image you see in the movie is not from Kasparov, or from the computer, but from "THE TURK". This is an "automaton" that was built in Europe from the turn of the eighteenth to the nineteenth century and played winning chess against all who came. I put the word "automaton" in quotation marks because it was, as everyone knows now, a farce. There was a man inside. <br /> <br /> If you do not like to see "THE TURK", then you will not be able to support the movie, because "THE TURK" has as much screen time as Kasparov, maybe more, both in modern filming and in black-and-white footage of some old movie. The reappearance of "THE TURK" every few seconds underscores Kasparov's claim that "Deep Blue" had human assistance - which was (to some extent) a fake computer, which IBM tricked, that there was "a man inside it" working behind the scenes to help them win. Kasparov does not just believe it, but the filmmakers seem to believe it too. And this is not really a movie about chess games or about chess computer programming. It is a piece of propaganda about a large company allegedly abusing a great helpless teacher. It really is a lot like a "negative campaign ad," as it is filled with sinister music and evocative camera work and scary sound effects and innuendo ("we never figured out what was behind that locked door") and the ever-present "TURK". <br /> <br /> Now, most people in the chess community are pretty convinced that IBM did not cheat and that this was Garry's paranoia at work. To begin with, for a human to help "Deep Blue" defeat Kasparov, it looks like you would need a human who is better than "Deep Blue" and better than Kasparov. Since there was no such person, the idea is a little suspicious from the start. Also, by the time this movie was made, there were computer programs that could run on your PC and that could beat great masters. Today, much more than in 1997, we take it for granted that a computer can do things you may not expect. And it is less likely that we take as a monumental human tragedy that a computer defeats a guy in chess. (And, in fact, the main point is that Kasparov won with two serious mistakes, including the dismissal of Game 2 in a drawn position). <br /> <br /> As for chess games, you actually see very little of them. There are some comments from masters and commentators who briefly tell how they were, but in fact you can not see almost any strategy or tactics. Of course, as a chess player, I consider this a major flaw, but I think players who are not players are also being cheated. Imagine a baseball movie, for example, where you can hardly see any game - just a commentator telling you that "in Game Four, the White Sox defeated the Astros with such talent." No one would make such a movie. But here, for example, we are told that Kasparov made a serious mistake in opening the deciding game 6, but we are not shown the position on the screen, nor did they tell us why it was a mistake, or what he should have done. instead, or anything. We just see a few seconds of Kasparov holding his head in his hands, and then more atmospheric sound effects and camera work. <br /> <br /> (Since I've seen this on DVD, let me warn the chess players about the DVD as the jacket promises that the extras include the games "with analysis." This analysis of great master, who It's the automated computer voice synthesizer analysis of some version of Chessmaster, which tells you when a piece is attacked and a pawn gets isolated and you're in the "Caro-Kann Defense, Main Line" Blahhhh.) <br /> <br /> One can then come and say, "Well, clearly this movie is meant to dramatize the game for the non-player, so it's unfair to get impatient with it." does a good job at reaching the non-player - it skips a few points that a newbie would really like to have explained. For example, he says Kasparov could have been given a "perpetual check" in the second game, but that does not explain what it is (or show how it would have been on the board, which would have been interesting). He returns to Kasparov-Karpov's fighting, but does not explain why there were two of them or who organized them, etc. I did not need this information myself, but I'm familiar with it. If you still have no experience with chess, there are places where you will get confused, and that is just a flaw in the movie. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I can not recommend the film, which, as "The Turco" itself, is not what it claims to be (a documentary) but more of a stage illusion.
