This season lacked real oomf, but, as far as creating stories to leave us in the mood again, the 6th season is without distinction and spontaneity. <br /> <br /> This season did not have its usual Sopranos style, and if you cut out all the junk that was filled in every episode of this season, you would probably have 6 episodes of actual stories. <br /> <br /> Parallel stories like Pauly's mother, is she or is not she? was boring and had no purpose other than the exploration of his character. I wish I had seen Bobby express his anger more at Pauly in that carnival episode, but to no avail. <br /> <br /> And that's it! These parallel stories had no real purpose and lack finishing. If they will end these stories in the next 6 episodes, I'd rather not watch because it's not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Disappointment is a good word to say about this season. and its end.
