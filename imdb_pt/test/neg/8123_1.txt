I do not care if this show is to communicate deep messages about human existence. <br /> <br /> The show sucks ... how can anyone take pleasure in watching it? However, it was received so well. This reflects a sad state of affairs for Joe Moron out there. <br /> <br /> I tried to watch this show when it first came out while friends talked about it. The bland laughter between the two main characters and the lamentable dialogue made me want to cry. <br /> <br /> It's unbelievable that people can watch this show. However, I think the creators had the last laugh ... becoming rich by taking the p.ss from the same people who would watch a show like that. <br /> <br /> I'd bet they're laughing all the way to the bank.
