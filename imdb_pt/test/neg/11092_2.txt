I usually do not categorize a movement as boring. I'm not big on action movies and my senses do not need to be stimulated during a movie. In fact, I enjoy a good rational logical dialogue and a plot. Unfortunately, this movie does not have any of these characteristics. Diane Lane is the only saving grace in this movie and even her beauty can not save it. Terrible and arrogant music amounts to idiotic dialogue and action. None of the actors actually connects and as a result, the movie does not connect with the audience. I think the scenes in which the people of the city are marching somewhere should contribute to the story, but it seems that they were inserted just to fill the space. The scenes seemed agitated and incoherent. There were some nice shots of the ocean and the beach that was beautiful.
