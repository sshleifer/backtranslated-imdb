The first two Bring It On films were both very good in their own ways. The first one was quite serious, the second was successfully satirical - and the third opted for the low-browed idiot comedy we always see in the brainless teen movies Hollywood has been coming out of the hole. The main point in this movie was that cheerleaders are total airheads who barely know enough to hold a conversation in common, and that's the extent of the comedy of this movie. Ha ha No. There are no shreds of cleverness in this film, no theme, no subtext, nothing to anyone with half of the brain being entertained (and, of course, I just could not bear it all). If you are the kind of person who is entertained by fart jokes, this movie is for you. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
