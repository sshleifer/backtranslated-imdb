A snore gore. I saw that horrible, stinking, worthless piece of crap at the Cameo Movie House (now Crobar Night-club) on Washington Avenue in South Beach in 1980 or 81. I was 17 years old, and my three friends and I laughed about it. horrible, disgusting, piece of garbage. The theater was on its last legs and there were mostly drunks snoring and sleeping on the premises. They did not miss anything. The worst performance of all time. These actors deserve the Oscar for the worst, and I mean the worst role in movie history. The joke was, the theater was showing another Mi Mi Lay (a big name, at least!) Stinker ... barf city. Enough said. If you are under 12 years old, it may have some chills. Over 12 years, you will be snoring after the opening credits. It's amazing that someone spent a dime to make this movie. And to think it's considered a cult classic. YUK !!!!
