Hypothetical situations abound, former director Harry Ralston gives us the latest post-apocalyptic glimpse into the dead of the world, left on the streets, in the shops and across the landscape, without the middle of a forgotten desert. A single survivor, trying to rekindle his sanity, takes food from town to his bungalow in this desert. Alone, he waits for more, but with no one around, does he get white briefs and a passion for a local Indian tribe? until the discovery of a camera that opens new doors and breaks the barriers of human coexistence. Alan, a man of the book, is left on Earth after an unknown disaster. Thinking that he is alone, does he begin to live life his way? until, Jeri Ryan, appears (as she would in any dream) out of the woods, disheveled and unhappy to find the last man alive to be ... well ... like Alan. Anyway, they try to coexist, fail, get drunk and, before creating the ultimate dystopia, meet Redneck Raphael (played by newcomer Dan Montgomery Jr.). Obligations are torn, confusion sets in, a couple becomes a third wheel, and the battle between physically inept nerds against a brainless athlete. Even with no one left on the planet, it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will arise. <br /> <br /> Using a variable film technique, Ralston gives us a mediocre story loosely based on another movie titled "The Quiet Earth" (which I'll be seeing next) strangely that it never gives any credit to. With a borrowed story, I think he does a decent job of reinterpreting it. His punch seems to be lacking at the beginning, while Ralston tries to find his way, borrowing yet again from the director's techniques to try and find his own. He opens the film interestingly, but does not respond to any direct response. Of course, the last few days have arrived, but there could be a concise answer on "how" or better yet "why" those few selected survived. A more frightening start would have gotten us stronger in a comic movie. The juxtaposition would have been like "Shawn of the Dead," but it made us feel like we were watching a TV show. Listening to the audio commentary, I have respect for Ralston because he worked diligently to make this film, and his passion almost sells the film, but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he was not so happy with his overall ending. products. There were mistakes, those he pointed out and others he was ashamed to point out. Meanwhile makes decent independent film, sometimes seems cheap, and in the case of Ralston, was the last. <br /> <br /> I must admit, Alan Arnott's picture of Alan addicted me. He played very well that weeping, nerdy school and adult role. He was funny to watch and listen, and so he became sympathetic to the viewer. He was a key player in keeping the film together, unfortunately, I can not say the same for the rest. This was Dan Montgomery's first movie, and was it obvious? I mean ?? really very obvious. There were scenes where I found that the suggestion letter was about to come out and read the lines to him, maybe even giving us a more realistic performance, but unfortunately that was not the case. Then there was Jeri Ryan. She pulled in her character near the end of the movie, which for me was the culmination of the entire work of art. She goes from unfamiliar distant to bitter crazy bitter girlfriend until the end. Confused? Again, she dropped into her character at the end, giving us just a glimpse of what she probably could have done when her acting matured. Even with the progress of the comment, all she contributed was a moment of laughter, giggling, or "ohhh, look at that color." While its beauty can sell tickets, one might want to consider the knowledge as so beautiful. This was your first movie so I can be very tough? <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie seemed to be missing something. Did I think the idea was strong? the premise that even with only a splash of people remaining on Earth, the evil of human nature still exists. Jealousy can not be killed by bacteria or bombs (perhaps because it is consumed by zinc?) And we, as a race, always want what we can not have. Ralston is not an amazing director, his techniques are flawed and pre-used, but he knows how to make a low-budget comedy. I think our idea of ​​"funny" is different, so that's why I could not see myself laughing at many of the parts he found "hysterical." His actors provided the level of performance needed for this film, which was less than average. His film was loose, meaning that there were elements never explained or addressed (ie anything with wings survived?!?), Which detracted from the intensity of the film. This was a comedy, but it could have been a lot darker and a lot more fun. For those who think that Roger Avery was a great element for this movie, as we learned from his comments, all he was there was money? it was in essence the bank of "The Last Man." Do not wait for any classic Avery moments. <br /> <br /> Do not expect more from Ralston ?? and this is how I will end. <br /> <br /> Note: ** out of *****
