This horror movie starts very promising and there is a moment when I thought to myself "this is going to be very good." However, it gets pretty annoying pretty fast in the end. The acting is pretty good, as well as the location and the story starts pretty well as well. The problem is not just kill on the screen and an end where you have the monster basically turning tail and running. I wanted to see more, especially after a good sleeping bag scene where I thought the movie was catching and would be a winner. Unfortunately after the film showed the monster very little and the back of the DVD lied as told me that the desert under the people literally came to life and was able to devour their flesh ... now that would have been some movie, a near situation inescapable. Of course this would make viewers uncomfortable and could increase tension, but that's what horror movies should do! Instead, we have very few photos of the creature or creatures, and when we see it, it's mostly defensive. Still, it was not all bad, just needed more horror, less hunting and more chewing.
