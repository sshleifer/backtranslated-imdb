Killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1. Bad acting, bad characters, boring clown, bad lines, his name. Honestly, I'm not so surprised that more people have not seen this movie. The only reason I watched Killjoy 2 is because I wanted to think that filmmakers learned from their mistakes. They did not. This movie is so bad, if not worse, than the first. That clown ... that damn clown ... I hate him! I hate him so much! And I do not hate him because he's a good villain ... I hate him because he's bothering too much! I hope the filmmakers have realized, after trying and failing again, that this film is irreparable. The last thing we need is a Killjoy 3.
