I used to love the Muppets. The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper and The Muppets Take Manhattan were good family movies, cleverly written and fun to watch. I never thought I would see the day when they would jump in the wave of Hollywood sleaze, but here it is: Scooter as a caged rave dancer, Pepe making obscene and suggestive comments every five minutes - this is not his father's Muppets. They are no longer the Jim Henson Muppets either. <br /> <br /> This thematic movie "It's A Wonderful Life" has its moments but not enough to save it. I cringed as I watched this with my children. I still have hope for the next movie, but this was certainly a disappointment.
