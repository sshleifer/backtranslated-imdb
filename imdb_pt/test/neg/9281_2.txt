This was one of the shows I wanted to follow. But I just could not devote myself to devoting my time to this show. To have a show focused on the topic of politics, you really need a strong plot with twists to improve the mood of the show, something like "The West Wing" or "Commander-in-Chief." Rob Lowe was fine, but actors like Kyle Chandler simply could not act (he was awful in "Early Edition"). It was a pain to sit through this show. With its lack of suspense, urgency and characters that can really act, I just had to give up on this show and I'm glad that it was canceled, so I would not have anything else to lose. <br /> <br /> Grade D-
