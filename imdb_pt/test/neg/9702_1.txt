I think you're saying something that Bollywood's "Bride and Prejudice" got more faithful to the original material than this 2005 Hollywood version did. I also laughed more at the Bollywood version. (Mr. Kholi? Invaluable!) If you read the book or saw the 1995 version of the BBC (and liked them), you will have an unpleasant surprise entering this movie. My friend, however, who did not see either, was slightly amused by the film. If you are a JAne Austen purist, or even a movie buff who does not like historical inaccuracies, it will be painful to go through it. <br /> <br /> Ugh, the script. The script was the biggest problem. I imagine the actors would not have done so badly if they had a decent script, perhaps written by someone who really loved Austen's work. <br /> <br /> What transvestites have been committed? Well, you will be forced to endure unbelieving lines like "Do not you dare judge me, Lizzy!" and "Leave me alone for the first time in your lives!" Not only are these lines far from anything that might come from Jane Austen's eloquent pen, but can one honestly believe words such as these have spilled out of the mouth of a gentle girl of Regency's time? The use of modern colloquialisms is one of the many irritating ways that the screenwriter slaughters the book. The writer also decided to give lines of characters that in the book were said by completely different characters and all without apparent purpose. Worst of all, as they try to get a little closer to the writing of the book, the writer has an unpleasant and unnecessary habit of rearranging Austen's phrases and replacing them with words that are already perfect. It was as if the screenwriter sat with the book in one hand and a dictionary in the other while writing the script. Stick with Austen's words; she did better than you! I suppose all this was done in a "revisionist" spirit and in an effort to distance this film from the iconic BBC version of 1995. However, for me, it also caricatured the true spirit of Austen's most beloved work. <br /> <br /> The cast had potential though it was quickly eliminated as soon as the script began. But Keira, laughing excessively and baring her crooked teeth is not equal to charm and vivacity! And I think Mr. McFayden, though I find him fairly handsome enough, misread the script and got the impression that he was playing Heathcliff and not the formidable mr. Darcy. I really liked Brenda Blethyn, Kelly Reilly and the actor who played Mr. Collins. His interpretations were really quite refreshing. <br /> <br /> Ah, but Donald Sutherland! Someone described his performance as looking like a hobo who accidentally wandered the set and I must say that it is an appropriate description. And can anyone tell me why they created Wickham after Legolas? Although he was in the movie for less than two minutes, I would dare say, and without his impressive bow and arrow skills to animate the film. <br /> <br /> On a guard's note, I would kill Ms. Bingley because they were sumptuous. and fit more into the modern century. (A regency sleeveless evening gown? Please! More Versace than Austen, that's right!) And poor Keira, the whole budget went to her salary and not her wardrobe! Oh, and I'm sure they ended up getting the bastard who stole the hairbrush from the set. Unfortunately, they did not catch him soon enough to rummage through the braids of the actresses before filming. <br /> <br /> In short, with this new version of Hollywood, disdain Austen's eloquence, subtlety and intelligence because you're getting the complete opposite.
