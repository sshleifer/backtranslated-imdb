This is a very interesting acquaintance! "Two-Handed Tales" contains three foolish and childish episodes - the genre is not really horror or action, more like something between the two. Where's the suspicion? Where's the fun? Where is common sense? It's definitely not here, but if you do not expect to get it, you do not necessarily miss it. <br /> <br /> The first segment is called "Showdown". It's a violent and absurd western. I could not fathom the whole idea. "King of the Road" is a stupid story starring Brad Pitt. At the time of "two-fisted tales," he was just a handsome face that really did not know how to act yet. Fortunately, he learned the skill later and now he is a fantastic and talented actor - one of the greats of the younger generation. The story is almost ok in all its stupidity. The final episode "Yellow" is the only segment that is almost totally successful. It's silly, but funny. We have to thank Kirk Douglas for that. <br /> <br /> This movie is something to watch when you sit in an armchair and eat popcorn. (I should know, that's what I did) If you loved "Tales from the Crypt", you'll love "two-fisted tales" too, because basically it's all the same. I understand these three episodes are really extremely rare "work of art" and very difficult to find anywhere. I have the whole package on VHS, but I do not think it's a great privilege. You will have to be a Brad Pitt fan to search. Otherwise, do not bother, it's not worth the effort. Fucking idiot.
