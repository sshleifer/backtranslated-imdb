I can not forget that incredible scene in Alien, when the extra terrestrial exploded from one of the men in the chest. Or even in the Predator, when the invisible monster sneaked into the bewildered soldiers and cut them to pieces. Both films expressed fascinating insights about the common-creature resource. Go back to the era of B movies and watch big men in fake parade costumes killing people in small towns. Now recognize that the two films above have revolutionized this genre. The cave does nothing to improve. He does not try anything new and, worst of all, The Cave does not even have blood. Shame on them, shame on them all. <br /> <br /> Sexy spandex parading are the one-dimensional characters of The Cave. Everyone does not seem to mind when they witness the death of their colleagues. They just walk together without the knowledge of the evil creature lurking in the darkness. The plot is very easy to understand. So you have both brothers, the black guy and the sexy female scientist. The rest (by the rest, I mean they all face terrible demises) are even more uninteresting than the others. We have the Korean assistant, the risky outdoor chick, a Russian scientist and two divers, both lacking in emotion and are stupid enough to get away on their own. This film is extremely clich√©, since all but the Negro, one of the brothers and the female scientist, find an end. It also seems that only Americans can survive the terror, since the Russians and the Koreans die. Do not be offended if I give details. There is no real surprise anyway. <br /> <br /> To be direct, they find this cave. They enter the cave. They get stuck in the cave. They begin to die in the cave. One of them is infected in the cave. More die in the cave. They leave the cave; only to discover that one of them has a parasite that will turn them into a ghastly monster, which does not really seem to bother them. This is the simplicity of the dull plot. It does not even try to be original. It even has the part where they decide that their leader is not capable and separates. We have just seen this many times before. <br /> <br /> I know in a movie like this, people do not care about the performances, but it's worth mentioning how bad they were. Everyone is so sad. Cole Hauser was especially unsophisticated and did not make me get Eddie Cibrian, which is often much better. Morris Chestnut is by far the best thing in the movie. His performance is really decent. It portrays the face that soothes everyone. All other actors are, at best, medium-sized. In a show like this, this really is not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> Now, the reason we go to this genre of film; the action, of course. Well, to my regret, the action was monotonous. The scenes of death are all boring, the hell the whole movie was. There is almost no blood. Either they disappear and are found later or are attacked and die without a concussion. Seeing the death of the Korean man was the only exciting action I could find. <br /> <br /> It's incredible. Bad things obscure most things that are good. A good example is to say that the special effects were well made, what they were. The only thing wrong is that, as everything happens in a cave, it will be dark. I found it extremely difficult to distinguish between the walls of the cave and the monsters. So it was very difficult even to see the creatures. Although I liked the special effects, there was nothing original about the monsters. They all looked like one another and they were not scary. <br /> <br /> The cave marks the premiere in the direction of Bruce Hunt. I do not see what he was trying to accomplish by doing this movie. He obviously made a big mistake. Almost everything about this movie stank like a stink bomb. A stink bomb is probably even more enjoyable than watching this mess again. Only the most indulgent spectator will find this forgivable. I gave up all hope in the middle of the movie when I heard the phrase "what the hell was that" for the third time.
