I think the film was a side, I watched recently and I found the documentary typical of western filmmakers that was biased without substance. The fact is that prostitution exists everywhere in the world, not only in Tanzania and not because of this fish business, there the prostitutes were there before the Russians and other businessmen arrived in Mwanza. Poverty is indeed endemic in Africa, much less in Tanzania, and this is not because of the fish fillet business, in fact the fish industry has helped millions to support their families in their daily lives. This film just tarnishes the good image of this peace-loving country. As for the arms trade, the film could not prove whether there is any truth in which, actually looking critically for the films is to doubt the filmmaker's authenticity, it seems that his attempt to prove his point using some characters that can be done for anything really. Yes, Tanzania is a poor country, yes there are prostitutes and street children, but they are not the product of this business, it is just a common scenario in most poor countries, even across the western world ... What a burden trash. <br /> <br /> The pilot himself is talking about sending guns to Angola, which lies more than 2000 km south of Tanzania and the war was in the DRC also miles from Mwanza, the director was unable to show how these weapons were transported from Mwanza to the DRC! <br /> <br /> In short, the films lack focus and respectability, it is very easy to find the character anywhere in Africa and has nothing to do with Darwin's nightmare or fish fillet ... What a load The truth is that the perch on the Nile did not decimate all the other species on the lake, contrary to what the film portrays, and also less than 25% of all Lake Victoria catches are exported, the rest being consumed locally. Let's get this right.
