Based on the excellent novel, Watchers, by Dean Koontz, is this extremely horrible movie that probably should not be seen by anyone. Not since "The Running Man" did I see a book that went far beyond recognition. The difference, however, is that the movie "The Running Man" was still enjoyable as a fun action movie loaded with a million effect phrases. This movie?? No, nothing remotely fun. In fact, if you love the book, like me, you'll hate this bastardization even more. <br /> <br /> ** ATTENTION ** CONTAINS SPOILERS ** Rightio, I'll basically tell you the story here, almost in its entirety. Because? Because you, dear reader, do not have to suffer because of this abomination, that's fine with me, because I like to watch crap. Because I like to complain about bad things. Now for the nasty: This movie revolves around a boy and his mother running away from the government and a mutant-monkey-creature soldier who escaped from a government genetics laboratory destroyed with a super-intelligent golden retriever that the "hero" calls "Furface". Groan?? Trust me, in the novel, this story was shaken. I'll get to that later. Anyway, the hero is none other than the dreamy ghost boy Corey Haim. I'm not kidding. Our hero runs around, hoarse and all, trying to convince his mother to help save this dog from the "evil government" that made him born and made him genetically ultra-intelligent. The ape-creature, lazily referred to as "Oxcom" (God help us), is also a genetic stew of a creature built to be the supreme fighter on the battlefields of the future. Michael Ironside (Total Recall, Starship Troopers always fucks) is also in this movie, and no, I could not figure out how anyone convinced him it would be a good idea. He plays a government agent with the NSO chasing the dog and the creature. Oh, yeah, here's a spoilerama: He's also a creation of government, and the same lab, and behold, he spends most of the film being an idiot and killing people - and all that murder must be done by monkeys. Soldier. Instead of a creepy horror movie, we have a rectal haemorrhage from a horror movie. The dog's intelligence is conveniently discovered and believed more easily than we believe we can see the clouds looking out. Breakdown !! <br /> <br /> Change from book to film: <br /> <br /> - The main character (Travis) has changed from man to boy. <br /> <br /> - Man's love interest in book (Nora), now is his mother? And all your growth of depth and character is completely gone. <br /> <br /> "Lee Johnson, the black man, is now Mr. White Ironside. This is important because the strength of the character was built on his heritage in the book. <br /> <br /> - Relationship between two completely ignored authority figures, Lem now kills the guy who was originally his best friend. One of the main characters in the book is now totally missing, the "immortal" who hunted the heroes - maybe this is Ironside, but why is he someone else? <br /> <br /> --Dog never gets the deserving name of "Einstein" in the movie. <br /> <br /> - No part of the book happened in a college? At least nothing that has a strong influence on the plot. <br /> - It occurs over a matter of days instead of months like the book - unrealistic pace. <br /> <br /> Corey Haim's girlfriend in the film appeared in no more than two chapters in the book - and they never met in the book. <br /> <br /> Lem Johnson's character is no longer legal; instead, he's a total idiot who threatens people. <br /> <br /> - Harero Travis was part of the Delta Force (military segment specializing in hunting terrorists), instead his father, who is never seen in the world. the film was part of this group. <br /> <br /> - The intelligence perceived in the monster is now completely missing. <br /> <br /> - The submarines involving the Soviets and the crowd went completely out of history. <br /> <br /> These are just the most unpleasant changes, and the ones I could remember (and a day later). <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - Eventually, after 90 minutes of pain and mental anguish, the movie is over. <br /> <br /> It did not hurt him, it did not help: - Michael Ironside - I usually like him. <br /> <br /> - The dog is still quite nice. <br /> <br /> - Title screen "totally from the 80s". <br /> <br /> The bad: <br /> <br /> - Okay, the writing of one of them is extremely horrible. <br /> <br /> - The direction is so kind that anyone who watches the film feels superior to everything involved in it. <br /> <br /> - The acting is lousy and weak, especially from Corey Haim. <br /> <br /> - Loose, weak, diluted story. <br /> - The monster looks pathetic, that is, when we are allowed to see the bloody thing. His head is too giant, the yellow eyes that were part of the book are not seen for more than two seconds. Instead of a lean, powerful, fast, and intelligent killing machine, we have some idiots in ugly, ugly monkey wear imposed on us. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no character development. <br /> <br /> - Even violence and blood are badly made, for God's sake, this is a HORROR movie !! Usually violence is at least well done! <br /> <br /> The Ugly: The idea that Dean Koontz drew his brilliant novel to become this filthy piece of shit. It makes me dangerously close to vomiting on me and anyone close to me. There are movies worse than that (inducing headache, as this idea may seem), but so far, only "Alien vs Predator", at least to me, is a great farce and a more painful disappointment. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: Watch the beginning of the final credits. 3/10 Story: 4/10 (the novel was really good, this is terrible) Atmosphere: 5/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character Development: 1/10 Special Effects / Make-Up : 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 0/10 Violence / Migraine: 4/10 Music: 5/10 Direction: 3/10 <br/> <br /> Cheese: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> General: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I would recommend anyone to watch this movie except for a few extreme and extreme horror fans and only if you have not yet read the novel. Instead, I would recommend that anyone interested in it avoid it altogether and buy / buy / borrow the book. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
