This is an absolute nonsense, designed to shock and excite the mindset of the 60s. The acting is completely woodworking, consisting mostly of improvisation, which makes sub-standard actors dribbling the first thing they can think of, repetitively. <br /> <br /> The end result is a badly written piece being read by people who have no idea and could not care less. The only exception to this is the main character "Joe" (played by Joe Dallesandro), who spends much of the film in a naked (or flattering, or the only one in the play that can act!) Please do not think I do not "I understand" Warhol - this is clearly and simply a Stinker who should never have left a film class.
