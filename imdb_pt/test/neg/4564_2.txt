I usually love teen / high school genre films, but this movie really lacked originality. The only premise this movie has is four friends cheating on high school and the tension it puts on their friendship. There simply is not enough depth in the story or characters to keep viewers' attention for the duration of the movie. The acting is not so bad, although the actors do not have much to work with, because the dialogue is silly and clich√© ... After watching this movie, one has to imagine how a producer could come across a project like this and think, "I should make this movie." No wonder he did not get a theatrical release. Andrew Gurland is a hack, avoid or burn.
