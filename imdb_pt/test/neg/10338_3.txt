This fourth film from the saga "Angel Guts", which in just a few minutes over an hour (is much more time consuming), is also the shortest, which is perhaps the best of the series. , an employee of the department store, is interested in another part-time job. Her co-worker in the department store presents her to model a porn magazine called 'porn net.' But when her other employers discovered her impertinent photos, they decided to fire her. And she gets some unwanted admirer. Oh yeah and she likes to masturbate ..ALOT. Using various household items. The wall-to-wall sexcapades masks the lack of noticeable plot and pushes this far into exploration territory, not unsurprisingly, since the director of this is Toshiharu Ikeda ("Evil Dead Trap", "Beautiful Prey"). Maybe his sensitivity was not suitable for an Angel Guts film. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Comments From Jasper Sharp; Bio / Filmographies; a 36-minute interview with Toshiharu Ikeda; Original sleeve art; and Trailers for this and 4 others Angel Guts Films (High School Co Ed, Red Classroom, Red Vertigo, & Red Porno) all available in the Artsmagik Box Set, but for some reason, the 6th film "Angel Guts: Red Flash" it's not on set
