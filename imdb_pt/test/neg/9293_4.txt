A former informant from East Germany ends up in Mexico as a spy for a student group in 1971 where he falls in love with one of the activists. This is the first co-production of Mexico with Germany, and although it is a good image of the ideals that marked, and continue to mark (at least to the CGH), youth, so much ends up being something tasteless from the internal dilemmas that faces brown (Noethem) as the passion for his ideals that Adela feels (Campomanes), as they glimpse, in his case, I suppose, by the language barrier; and in her case for lack of experience. Reason why in the end there is no concrete identification with any of them, what makes what could have been films that even served as document like Red Dawn, ended up being one more film; although I want to clarify that in the room many of the assistants were enthusiastic in the conversation with the director, who tells me that they are no longer so young or my ideals have changed.
