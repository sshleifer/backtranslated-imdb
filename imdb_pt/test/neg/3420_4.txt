Recap: Not entirely familiar with Macbeth's Shakespeare story, but my guess is that this is very close to the original, set only in the present tense. Tells the story of Macbeth, a member of a crime syndicate in Melbourne (?). He is a valuable man of success and in favor of the leader Duncan. But he and his lady have higher ambitions than that, and they plan the murder of Duncan and any throne competition. This is a story of brutal and brutal betrayal and death. <br /> <br /> Comments: Very interesting, I must say. To use the story, change the setting to the current time, but still keep the original dialog (?). It establishes a stark contrast between classical poetic work and violence. Promised to be extremely violent, it is a promise that holds, but not in the notion I imagined. It's very bloody, but violence is slow. Not only figuratively speaking it is calculated, which is also, but also literally. Too much action actually slows down the slow motion and that's what puts the film on its knees. <br /> <br /> What could have been a unique force, the contrast between superfluous and poetic dialogue and extreme violence. , it now turns into something completely different. Now both delay the movement painfully, so much so that it becomes monotonous and annoying at times. <br /> <br /> I also can not understand the context in which the three witches act. Defined to present time and reality, I think this magic sorcery had no place in the movie. Apparently, it seems, but to me it seems completely out of place. It's not a subplot, but a complete sub-story with its own rules, completely different from the rest of the movie. It seems completely out of place. Certainly it must have been possible to convert this part also into something modern. Drug-induced hallucinations (which I suspect the director hinted at, but then left a lot of witchcraft in it to be believable)? Now they only bring snippets of the film that are clearly next to the story and I just waited for the actual movie to start again. <br /> <br /> A clear disappointment, but perhaps something to Shakespeare's fans? <br /> <br /> 4/10
