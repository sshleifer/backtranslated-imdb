for people who have absolutely no idea what a comedy is. This does not only include the people who liked this movie, but the people who did. What could they be thinking? Madonna playing Judy Holliday? Please, she can not even play Madonna (if she really is a Madonna). I hope Griffin Dunne was well paid. He deserved every penny he got, because if it did not kill his career, nothing would happen. I'm sure the few people who actually paid to see this movie left it as if their pockets had been chosen. Madonna is apparently beyond the point of feeling ashamed of her virtually complete lack of talent as an actress, but you can not help but feel embarrassed by her anyway. She has no connection with the rest of the cast; It looks like she appeared on the set and said, "OK, I'm here, I'm going to embarrass myself by making the worst impression Judy Holliday has ever seen, now stay out of my way" and then proceeded to do just that. I know the phrase "Madonna's rotten movie" is redundant, but it certainly fits into it. It's painful to see a totally inept and untalented "actress" play foolishly, but apparently that does not bother her, as she does again and again. <br /> <br /> The strangest funny thing about this "comedy" is that it has managed to find people who have given you the money to do it. Now that's funny.
