This film was the first of the female genre in the 1970s prison. This film was incredibly violent, with a lot of sadistic torture being inflicted on inmates. The film takes place in the Philippines, which looks like a terribly ugly country. No doubt the producers used this factor in their favor to emphasize the horrible situation in which the prisoners were. <br /> <br /> Blaxploitation's film queen, Pam Grier, plays the lead role in this film. She plays Blossom, a renegade who is thrown into the vile women's prison, under forged charges. Her boyfriend, played by Sid Haig, tries to rescue Blossom. He and Blossom are part of a political guerrilla faction, and Blossom's imprisonment was orchestrated by Phillipino's corrupt government. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier and Sid Haig stand out among the less brilliant cast. The film itself places a lot of emphasis on the violence perpetrated against the prisoners. His captors used them only as objects of his sadism. That got boring really fast. This movie could have used more interesting plot lines and subtlety. This is not one of Roger Corman's best photos. The many women's prison films that followed this film were much better everywhere. I would recommend The Big Bird Cage, just for Pam Grier fans.
