The setting of "The Nature of the Beast" is ingeniously simple and full of unlimited potential for suspense: the tormented salesman Jack (a very domesticated Lance Henriksen) picks up trouble in the form of the comedian Adrian (Eric Roberts), who seems to be in possession of incriminating information against Jack. Oh, and over a million dollars have been stolen from a casino and someone nicknamed "Hatchet Man" is dismembering people in the desert. Sounds great, right? More or less like "The Hitcher" finds "Psycho". One or both men has a secret, and nothing is as it seems! Well, unfortunately, screenwriter and director Victor Salva (from "Jeepers Creepers" and "Pow") does not have enough ideas to keep the film, the setting does not arouse tension or suspense (poison for what is supposedly a thriller). ), and the inclusion of an underlying homoerotic tone seems out of place. Henriksen evokes an unusual Everyman, not very Earth-bound (even with a large intestine), but Roberts is as threatening and scary as an extra in "Death Wish 3"; we are never sucked to the point where we really care about what is happening, and the conclusion slips into unlikely territory (I kept thinking it would be "Fight Club" again, but I was wrong). What a pity. "Nature of the Beast" could have been something else ... instead of nothing else.
