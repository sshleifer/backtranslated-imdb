Okay, what was that story again? I am afraid I have never read the book, and frankly this was one of the most confusing films I have ever tried to watch in a long time. I get a little confused about the number of flashbacks between the nurse, the patient and the man without thumbs. The movie did not even explain what they were looking for in the desert until they found it; or even how in the world everyone knew each other to unite. <br /> <br /> After seeing the movie "Pride and Prejudice" recently with Colin Firth, I've been trying to do a study of his film career by watching his other films, and bluntly, in addition to "What a Girl Wants" I'm not finding much where he touched on what was good. I'm definitely not saying it was not good. He's really one of the best actors I've seen in modern movies, but the content and quality of the films he plays have a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient" is another perfect example of where the director, writer and staff are very close to your subject to see that the viewer is not getting the picture? literally. The entire movie seemed to be to show Ralph Fiennes as a dramatic actor with long periods of emoting which was a pain in the ass. Nothing is really explained and each subject from the outset seems to need a psychoanalytic evaluation! The character of Kristin Scott Thomas seems to like to describe erotic stories in front of a totally masculine public and to excite other men besides her husband; Colin Firth, who plays her husband, does not necessarily have all her marbles in place and is supposed to be a secret agent? I think; and Ralph Fiennes walks like a mr. Roman Darcy (sorry, Colin!) who thinks he knows everything. The rest of the cast is cast (pun intended) to the four winds, while the plot continues. <br /> <br /> The nurse's stability sub-frame (Juliette Binoche) and her motives and involvement with Naveen Andrews is another confusing element that leaves the viewer with an unpleasant taste. But of course, the viewer is still recovering from how the first two characters (Thomas and Fiennes) ended up having sex for the first time anyway. What was the attraction? There was no chemistry and no accumulation. Just a slap, bam, thank you! <br /> <br /> And is not it romantic that Fiennes ended up being a traitor helping the Germans giving them maps to the desert? (sarcasm) <br /> <br /> To describe this movie, I would simply say, "How to impress your gynecologist with your mammograms and betray your lovely husband who loves you." <br /> <br /> The last unbelievable part of this plot is to understand how someone would choose Ralph Fiennes about Colin Firth. Has Firth had very little opportunity to demonstrate any of his acting talents? in fact, when I watched the movie, I thought it must have been one of his first. The scene he's been waiting for his wife all night may have been the only second clip worth watching in the movie. With that, I have no interest in watching you again. <br /> <br /> The best scene I enjoyed was the plane crash in which Firth is trying to get them all out. Too bad he missed! It would have saved him twenty extra minutes of even more fruitless films. Aerial scenes of the desert were pretty cool, though.
