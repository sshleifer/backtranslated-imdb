Does anyone remember the docudrama THREADS? It's a dramatic documentary that shocked Britain in September 1984. Although not exactly wholly entertained by Mick Jackson's Holocaust nuclear film, I could respect him. Unfortunately I can not respect this documentary broadcast 20 years after it deals with terrorists dropping a dirty radioactive bomb in central London. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with it is that the production values ​​of director Daniel Percival are far too good when, in fact, it would have benefited from fairly cheap production values. Cinematography is superb, but in this kind of speculative drama we need a superb and well-lit Oscar filmmaking? What we certainly do not need is a soundtrack as survivors of the explosion slowly come out of the smoke. Nor do we need loosely known cast members. Someone else sat there wondering, "Hey, what was he? Do I know this guy" several times? I know I did and it's very disturbing. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest production flaw with DIRTY WAR is that someone decided to make it a docudrama with a lot of stylistic emphasis on drama. In THREADS, the action eliminates the action in Sheffield numerous times and becomes an issue of HORIZON on the effects of nuclear war before returning to the fictional protagonists again and THREADS is very effective because of this. Here the information presented suffocates the drama that drowns in the expository dialogue and totally unconvincing. The characters in teleplay are not really characters, they are just cyphers to inform the public what happens when the radioactive material is blown up. It would have been better for the action to cut the captions to convey this kind of information about the LINES. Worse, director Daniel Percival used the same technique seen in THREADS a few years ago with his docudrama on smallpox. He should have used the same style with HIS WAR. <br /> I should also put my cards on the table and declare that although I do not consider most Muslim terrorists to be, I'm getting a little fed up with TV productions like THE HAMBURG CELL, THE GRILL AND THE DIRTY WAR having to point this fact to me giving me an idea about the head, which is somewhat typical of paternalistic attitudes of PC in TV companies nowadays <br /> <br /> I missed the studio Debut that Bob mentions here but I have also heard this being discussed elsewhere and I can not help but think that it makes a better visualization than DIRTY WAR itself with its heated arguments between different factions of the political spectrum. If DIRTY WAR is remembered twenty years from now (highly improbable, I know) this can be remembered for the discussion that has caused more than anything.
