I found this movie for a dollar ($ 1.00) and the movie was a complete waste of time. Reb Brown (Mark Hardin), played a military advisor in South America and succeeded in capturing the leader of the rebel soldiers operating in the dense jungles. However, Mark joins the opposite side after some horrific tortures have been inflicted either women and men. In a scene as Mark is having a drink in a hotel bar, his eyes catch the glimpse of sexy long legs Sandra Spencer (Shannon Tweed), "Dead Sexy", 01. Mark and Sandra have an extreme desire for each other and up even make passionate love on some very hard stones, no time for the comfort of a bed. This is a horrible movie and it is not worth wasting time looking at you.
