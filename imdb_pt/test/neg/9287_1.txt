I usually like Lawrence very much and being in Australia, I have not seen much of his stand up, so when I saw this in my video store I thought, yes, I'll take a look. I wish I had not seen it now. Obviously, Lawrence had a deep experience that opened his mind, and I think he wants to share it with others, but this was not the time or the place. <br /> <br /> This whole experience seemed like a motivational speech in hell. really was. I believe the expression of the night was "to walk until the wheels fell," which he mixed with only indecent jokes around sex and sexual organs. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I do not care about raw humor, but Lawrence does not have the knack of classifying it in the form of Eddie Murphy, Richard Prior or Robin Williams. Lawrence was simply indecent, the only time I laughed was when he revived his experience with the law and his recovery at the hospital. If there were fewer points, I would give them ....
