Do not get me wrong, the guy is a successful dynamo, but he's reached the top selling overpriced plastic toys for impulsive brats. So I get a little annoyed when he looks at comic book fans as an extension of that same market. <br /> <br /> See, "The Invincible Iron Man" would not be bad if it were docked on a Saturday morning. and aimed exclusively at children without discernment. But it is not intended exclusively for children. Peripheral characters are killed every five minutes and there is enough blood and semi-naked bodies to make the network's censor squirm, so it's not very easy for children's television. <br /> <br /> So, what's the audience for this video? So? It is the audience that enjoys intelligible plots about the revival of a tyrannical Chinese emperor with five arcane rings, this is who. And I think this audience is restrictively small. <br /> <br /> Many great writers have gone through the marvelous yoni of Marvel over the decades. So it's a shame that Marvel risks his expensive investments in animation on so many questionable storytellers and scribes who, like Arad, are more accustomed to selling action figures during Saturday's cartoons. How many warm receptions does Marvel have to endure before reaching a better strategy? <br /> <br /> Animation: just passable cels, some segments are better than others, a low budget look everywhere - this is not Bakshi (Ralph) and it's no Bluth (Don)! CG animation is fine, but far from impressive. <br /> <br /> History: a litany of cliches, everywhere, complicated, invented and uninspired. <br /> <br /> Characters: So why is Rhodes really here, if all he does is add to Stark's sexual ambiguity? Hmmm ... her father is in a wheelchair ... Tony misses his mother ... Asian puppies are hot and apparently little else; the female leadership is completely objectified by the end of the feature film. <br /> <br /> Presentations: We can not blame the competent voice actors for a bad script. <br /> <br /> Art: very western musculature, very clean lines. , the faces are very derived from oriental art, very boring mattes, very bland CG. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Nothing good, but worth watching the fans and those who like myths of superheroes. A 'must-buy' for collectors. A valuable "what not to do" course for junior entertainers.
