I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of Satanic horror movies and actually I seem to like them less and less every time I see a new one, and this is not really surprising when I end up watching movies like Brotherhood of Satan! Despite his low rating in IMDb, I was surprised to hear some good things about this movie and my expectations have increased. This turned out to be a big mistake as this is exactly the movie that your rating suggests: it's too bad! The plot is their basic flock of Satanists causing trouble, and we focus on a small town where people were murdered and kidnapped and it is not very clear why. Of course, the Satanists are behind this and this is bad news for a mother, father and daughter on a trip who get stuck in the mysterious city. I had the feeling that this movie could be in the same vein as the devilish shitty movie 'The Devil's Rain', and although it's not as silly as Robert Fuest's later film, it's not much better either. The plot seems to be pretty down to Earth, but it's also pretty boring and I can not say I've had fun throughout this movie. Satan's brotherhood obviously has its fans, but I'm not one of them; This is a movie that I see no reason to recommend ...
