This film was obscenely obvious and predictable. The scenes were poorly written and acted even worse. Following the horrible scenes was the terrible script full of meaningless and badly thought out lines. I would never suggest this movie to anyone who had any sense in watching decent movies. This film was not only with the same ideas as the Bachelor and Bachelorette show but also contained many parts where you would know what the next step and line would be without having to watch the movie before. The cast was good but the actors played there characters horribly with more drama then it should have been used and said lines in which wanted you to change the channel quickly. As a side note, please do not watch this movie.
