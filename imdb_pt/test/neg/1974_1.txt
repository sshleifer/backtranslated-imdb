This middle-class sitcom became a target of much hatred for the new generation of talented comedians in the 1980s, such as Ben Elton. Did he deserve such malice? Well Terry and June have never been clever, never been a well written story with different topics that intersect in the conclusion. It was the show that his mother and father and probably the grandparents attended. They laughed more than they laughed, but they would never take offense at the show, so the fact that they never challenged them was irrelevant. <br /> <br /> A foot in the grave suffered initially because it seemed at first sight. to be just another Terry and June. <br /> <br /> A few days after Terry Scott's death, an episode was broadcast on terrestrial TV, and this was his final ride. There were few program replays on any TV channel. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the television comedy has advanced since Terry and June. It's hard to find nice words for that - Terry Scott made the best of the weak screenplays.
