The ugly British movie of a Japanese novel about a very troubled young man who suffers influence from a classmate resembling Hitler and conspires to injure his widowed mother's lover. Two good scenes (Sarah Miles, finding her son, spying on her and confronting him angrily, the pale-faced boy trying to get Kris Kristofferson to his death for being extremely friendly), but what's the point besides causing a shock ? Ugly and uncomfortable, he shows no one involved any advantage (especially Kristofferson, whose empty stares and usual conversations are out of place in a psychological mess like this). Coldly without any sense of his own absurdity, director Lewis John Carlino seems to believe that such a circumstance could actually happen. If he's right, this is much more shocking than anything in "Sailor". * in ****
