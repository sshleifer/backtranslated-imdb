I know we should not expect too much from an indie low budget movie. But the idea behind it is solid: an attempt to open America's eyes to the comfortable relationship between the government and the journalists who should be watching it. But somehow, the documentary aspect, takes away its drama. Protests during the 2004 Republican convention in New York were not so compelling to make a documentary on the subject. These kinds of irresistible protests belong to the 1960s. It would have been better to maintain a drama format. Perhaps a slow construction, where the young journalist's eyes open gradually to the conspiracy.
