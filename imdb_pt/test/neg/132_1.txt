Let me first say that 1 in 10 is too good for this movie. It's unfortunate that the IMDb does not have dozens of stars ... I watched this mid-night movie abortion because of insomnia, and it was absolute rubbish. The plot was horrible. The acting was horrible. The movie was totally boring. "Malachi" looked like Shadow with Alec Baldwin (The Shadow is infinitely better than that too) The character Eve was so underdeveloped and two-dimensional that she did not even catch my eye. I did not even know her name was Eve. Don was interesting when she kept her mouth shut. The "TWIST" (if you can call it that) was laughable and pathetic. When it came, the movie had done such a horrible job of building suspense or clinging to any character that I simply thought "Who gives a ***". The only thing that made me raise an eyebrow about this movie was the fact of med. The teacher was Dyson in Terminator 2 (also a film that was light years ahead of this cinematic massacre). Anyone who was involved in this movie should be ashamed to lose 90 minutes of the time of countless people. No wonder no actor in this movie has had a fruitful career. In summary .... This movie is so bad, I feel dirty and need a shower. Worst movie in history, Gigli was better, Prom Night (the remake) was better and I dare say I saw IV was better ...........
