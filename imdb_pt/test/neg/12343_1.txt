11 years after this movie was released, only 5 people reviewed it here on IMDb. There is a reason for this total lack of interest in Across the Moon. It is coherent, but lacks all cinematographic virtue. Watch this movie for examples of terrible production in all respects. Opening credits, for example, are white letters rising mechanically from a red background. The ending features Michael McKean peering out the prison window saying "There are so many mysteries out there." followed by a clip / video clip montage of all the uplifting moments of the tragically bad movie. Julinana Hatfield. Everything in the middle is horrible. I struggled to find any value in this movie and came up empty. Although it is hard to believe, even a special participation of Burgess Meridith (always a pleasure for all) only disappointed me even more. This movie is like a mockery of what's special about movies. On paper, the film is below average. Women living together in a trailer. But what was actually produced was almost impossible to find. The movie tries to branch out in many directions, but never goes on at all. The unpleasant conflict of having your boyfriends in jail is never solved. No conflict is resolved. There really is no conflict. Women try to become prostitutes, but that never happens. Instead, they get jobs as bartenders and stockists. Does it sound exciting? It was not. It was stupid. And most of the film is the two women talking and generating planned conflicts. Women are capable actresses, but the script was more than bad. Useless. This was a terrible movie, but it's even worse that they give Burgess Meridith out of his retirement home to do it. Bad from start to finish. Like the toothless lion, this movie has no bite.
