One of the most annoying movies I've ever had to do is completely stereotyped. Just a cookie cutout from a movie, you could predict about each scene in the movie just from knowing the genre, as this movie does not add anything new. The dialogue is never funny, interesting or intelligent. The acting is weak and the soundtrack is annoying - basically everything seems to have been done by an amateur filmmaker. Nothing new, memorable or entertaining in this movie, combined with the fact that it is LONG, gives it an easy handling. Sorry, fans. Overall rating: F
