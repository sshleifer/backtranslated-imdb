Here's another movie with dysfunctional main characters that are totally amoral and yet should we cheer for them? I do not. No character in this movie was worth it. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams plays the "Joey O'Brien" car salesman. Man has no class, a loser in all moral senses, and a guy who thinks he can get rid of anything. Knowing Williams' ability to speak, he was good for this role. The women in your life are driving you crazy too. Some of them are not much better than him. Tim Robbins plays a similar low life that begins to dominate the movie when he, fully loaded with explosives, collides with a showroom of a car dealership and keeps people, including his wife, hostage. Robbins, as in normal for him, plays a disturbed and ridiculous character. I think these crazy roles come easily to these two actors. Wow, I wonder why. <br /> <br /> There is so much screaming and screaming in this movie that it will give you a headache. Combine these two screamers with the nasal voice of Fran Drescher and you really have an annoying and exaggerated cast. It's like listening to chalk on a blackboard for an hour and a half. Is this comedy? No, that's lame. <br /> <br /> In fact, for a Robin Williams movie to have only a dozen reviews posted here, you say something. You're a long way from your best picture.
