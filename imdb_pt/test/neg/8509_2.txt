If you have not yet read Tolkien's masterpiece; get ready for perhaps the best movie experience of all time! If you do, however ... After reading the books over and over, over the course of many years, I have come to love the characters and the story, and I feel that I know it intimately. I have my own personal vision of The Shire, Hobbiton and the character gallery. So for me, the film was a disappointment. Because? It dictates the appearance of the characters (inevitably), changes events, removes an important plot, removes a not-so-important plot. Big chunks of what the Lord of the Rings does is what it is, it's just ignored. Even the special effects of 2001 can not do justice to Tolkien's (and his own) imagination. Peter Jackson made an honest attempt to do the impossible, and I think no one else could have done better! But the fact remains, I am sorry to see the movie. The next time I read The Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson's limited vision will advance, not mine.
