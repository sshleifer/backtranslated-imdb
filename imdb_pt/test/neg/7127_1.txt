This movie was total tripe. Possibly it is indeed a pollution. The subtle and tense atmosphere of the original remake is not where it can be seen. Sarah Michelle Gellar has nothing to do, even in her death sequence, but she is still the best performer in this movie, and her death is the best thing about it, even if she deserves a better death. It is the very bad sign of writing and direction. I'm guessing she made this movie to end her connection with it like it was crap. <br /> <br /> It's not scary. Not tense. It's not funny. It does not make any sense. And as stated above, Sarah Michelle Gellar gives the only reasonable performance of the entire cast.
