"War is in your blood," Rambo says at the beginning of the film, "do not fight it." Say what? Is the screenwriter taking Mickey out of Sly? It is impossible for anyone with a primary education to miss the joke here. However, Stallone utters without a hint of irony. <br /> <br /> The same lack of humor applies to the film. Rambo IV is an idiot and exaggerated actioner that would have been funny without intention if it were not disgustingly violent. A cabal fantasy of the most basic type where villains are so villains, is not it enough just to kill them? you have to dismember them with pleasure. Stallone for in no clich√© of blue collar to make your point. It is not enough for the boss of villains to be a type of sadist. He is also a homosexual pedophile. <br /> <br /> What's happening with the IMDb? Is it taken by the Rifle Society? How can this disgusting excuse for the gross exploitation rate be so high? I like a good action movie as much as the next man, but is not this entertainment? This is the pornography of violence that trivializes and, ultimately, denigrates Myanmar's real tragedy. The only good thing about the movie is that Sly does not take off his shirt. That's why I'm going to give a star ...
