Where the hell should I start? Give a brief summary of the story? No. Or have you heard, or do not want to. Anyway, it sucks. Much like the movie. I happen to be a semi-horror horror movie aficionado and I must say that this is one of the dumbest and most awkward movies I've ever had the dislike to watch. <br /> <br /> The script is terribly stupid. The story begins very fast, with absolutely no suspense or accumulation. All those scenes of torture would have been MUCH more effective if we had given the least crap to the characters. Since the first scene in the movie is when teenagers meet Captain Howdy, how the hell should we sympathize with them? First, they look stupid for going to a party with a guy they do not even know, and second, we do not even know their damn names! Why the hell should I care if they live or die? Not to mention the fact that they really have the guts to try and make us feel good about Captain Howdy after he was "retired"? PLEASE! I was cheering when he got his deserts fair! He deserved them! Hell, he deserved worse! In addition, we are forced to sit through a meaningless and indirect sequence taken directly from "The Silence of the Lambs" (and here it is HORRIVELY!) Of course he will give them a false address! to them the real Do not you think he'd be expecting and not punching a guy's Johnson up there? <br /> <br /> Then there's the dialogue.All Captain Howdy says is laughable or simply idiot. "" The dead are so terribly dead, when they're dead. "Dee Snider at one point says" knowledge is power. "Well, if this is true, this movie has absolutely no power. (well, aspiring horror movie), but damn it! You could drive a semi truck to those holes! <br /> <br /> So, there are the holes in the plot. First of all, these have to be the DUMBEST cops I've seen! ALWAYS !! I mean, CA RO GOD, these guys are idiots! Call it backup, you idiots! Second, how the hell did that septum ring come out of Captain Howdy? " Of course, this penetrating expert says "it's the biggest I've ever seen," but if it's so big, how could it have fallen so easily? Did Captain Howdy just leave him at the scene because he wanted to get caught? They sure did not make it sound like he did. Besides, they would NEVER release Captain Howdy, and I know it for a goddamn fact. He would be trapped for the rest of his life, and there is no escape from it. Much less let him go back to his old house where he killed / tortured everyone. IMPOSSIBLE AND IMPLAIBLE. <br /> <br /> And now the acting. Dear God, these people were boring. Linda Cardellini is the only good thing in this movie. She's ready and incredible. Too bad she hardly has a good chance of acting in this crap. Amy Smart appears for about 10 minutes and then disappears. Even the generally amusing Robert Englund is underutilized and ineffective here. Dee Snider plays the crazy guy with no talent. I never felt threatened, scared or intimidated. I'd rather have seen Dee Snider in the role of Alexis Arquette in "Bride of Chucky". It would have been a lot more fun to see this untold trick for that adorable psycho doll. <br /> Dee Snider simply sucks. He can not act (one of the less scary villains I've ever seen), he can not write (he wrote that damn movie in his sleep?), And he's obviously dumber than Jessica Simpson! This movie is just a way for Dee Snider to show off all the strange crap he knows about self-mutilation and modern primitives and blah blah blah. Either it was done before or it just did not have to be done. I was bored for the whole damn thing. <br /> <br /> The acting is crap, the music sucks, the script sucks, the rhythm sucks, the FX sucks, the direction sucks ... basically, this movie sucks. This movie tries to be a serious and sophisticated horror thriller and fails miserably. You can not scare, shock or bother in any way, manner or form. This is probably one of the least effective and totally non-original films I've ever seen in my entire life. A piece of cinematic trash captured on celluloid. <br /> <br /> "Strangeland" gets a 0 out of 10. Avoid at all costs. It is not pleasant at all.
