I've watched this movie twice in the last six months (which I went through so you did not have to). The first performance left me half crazed and stammering. The second display at 5 in the morning on a rainy morning was a bit better. only screamed in agony once. <br /> <br /> It seems that Pocona (The Azimmy Mummy) was horny for a certain Aztec princess who "should keep her maiden." Obviously, they gave each other the deal and were put to death for it. (Now that is severe!). But before they are the movie tries to put us to death with an Aztec ceremony screaming. The singing will make your ears bleed. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there is the usual absurdity of reincarnation. Not to mention a treasure map on a breastplate and a bracelet guarded by that sloppy Pocona. This time, Pocona seems to be in a year of 2000 and is after the desecrators of his grave. His moans and groans sound as if he had a bad case of Montezuma's revenge (or he read the script for this movie). This will make your breath stink. <br /> <br /> An evil Dr. Von Krupp appears wanting the Aztec treasure (possibly to finance interpretation classes and screenplay) for cast and crew). He is called The Bat because in The Curse of the Aztec Mummy he wore a bat as a cape, hat and something like a ski mask on his face. I think it's better than Fat Man to Laugh. <br /> <br /> The stick in the form of a typical mad scientist wants to rule the world. He emphasizes this by rolling his eyes, laughing madly and chewing the scenery. He set up an invincible robot. It looks like the bot was made from a trash can, a chandelier, and the grid of a 1957 Buick. That will make your eyes a company even takes credit for making that can! <br /> <br /> Well, the powerful confrontation between Pocona and the Robot takes place in the new Mummy's crypt, which has been homeless before. <br /> <br /> About half of this film is shot down from "La Aztec Mummy" never released in the US in its original form, but in a cut atrocity of Jerry Warren (see my article on "Mayan Mummy Attack") and "Curse Of The Aztec". Mommy. "The robot is downright stupid like most characters. If that and the plot do not make you laugh, nothing's going to happen. My first impression was so bad it would have gotten to 1. But after seeing "Mayan Mummy" and watching "Robot" again, he gets a 3. You have to watch this without any expectation, so it can be naively enjoyable.
