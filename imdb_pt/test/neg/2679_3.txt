Man, the '90s really were a horrible decade for movies. The movies are lacking in a good style and also the narrative is often lacking. <br /> <br /> This 6th entry in the long series of Halloween is certainly one of the most. You simply never get into the story because it's not a very well built and built movie. <br /> <br /> It's simply a poorly made film that also suffers from its unimaginative writing and no attractive characters that are in it. Dr. Loomis seems to be in it just for the sake of being in it. It's a pity that this was the role of Donald Pleasence. It's cool and also a kind of adaptation that his last role is in a Halloween movie, but he definitely deserved to be in a better movie. <br /> <br /> There is never a real danger feeling in the movie and Michael Myers' character never appears as threatening or scary. Maybe it's because he's been very prominent throughout the film since very early. He does the usual things, but without much class or originality. In addition, attempts to discover Myer's past do not work out, because the main reason is that it is not explained very well. It is obvious that the screenplay went through several rewrites before - and quite possibly during filming. Several scenes were even re-filmed or added after the first cut was far from pleasant. <br /> <br /> The film looks more like a TV show. This is also due to the lack of some real blood. Like a horror movie, it really basically misses everything to make it good or even original to watch. <br /> <br /> So far, the worst of the series! <br /> <br /> 3/10
