Werner Herzog again explores the psyche of a man. In "Little Dieter ..." we find a bright and bubbly man who survived the war in Bavaria, starving himself with strange sights, moved to the United States and fulfilled his dream of flying. War, food, death, survival, hoarding, planes, heads coming out ... like an American is born. Herzog again sees the madness as the plane of existence and the surreal blends in with the poignant as Herzog himself narrates this psychic travel diary of a German becoming an American who flies in a war in the late 20th century where culminated technology, pilgrimage and eating out garbage cans with spoons are fused with constant optimism in a man redefined in American. As always with Herzog, we are faced with the flowery madness, brightness and what man is in the face of his own societal and personal excesses. We laughed and shrank and we were surprised at this man. Where else for this man, but America?
