This is a fantastic movie. The acting is one of the best I've ever seen. Tatyana Samojlova is obviously very beautiful, and she automatically lures you into the film with her compelling acting. Cinematography was far ahead of its time. Watching, I could see parallels from the cinematography used today. This is really an innovative film. Because of cinematography and acting, audiences may feel the change of tone from beginning to end as the tone in the movie environment changes. It is a very touching and powerful piece. My friend told me that it was necessary to see, and I definitely agree with her. This is one of those movies you watch and never forget. Everyone should see this movie intensely moving. This should be placed in the "Movies to see before ________ (whatever)" list of all.
