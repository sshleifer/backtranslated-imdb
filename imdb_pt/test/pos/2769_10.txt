I love this movie. and the Disney Channel is ridiculous for not playing anymore. I think they should definitely put Susie Q back on the air at least one night so we can record it !!! but if not does anyone know where I can find it? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please e-mail me if you know where I can find this movie. Online or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and I think they deserve to see it too. All those Disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring. I need Susie Q back !! It was a great movie and had great actors and I do not see why it was taken off the air. If everyone loves this movie so much, why was it taken off the air? Please take my review into consideration and along with all the other comments made for this movie. Thank you have a good day.
