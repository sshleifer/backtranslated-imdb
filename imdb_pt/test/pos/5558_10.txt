Farscape totally rules! In my opinion, it is very close to Babylon five, although there are only 7 major characters in the series (including spacecraft). The humor is great and the writers are able to keep the program interesting, even though virtually everything happens on the ship. <br /> <br /> What I really love and appreciate in Farscpae is that they do not use CGI for the alien. or if they do, it is imperceptible. They use those adorable, low-quality rubber animatronic dolls very similar to those used in the original Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Farscape is something you definitely want to look at, if you have not already.
