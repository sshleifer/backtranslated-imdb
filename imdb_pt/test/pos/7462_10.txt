This is a great movie. I read the brief synopsis and was impressed, but as I watched (mostly for Caroline Dhavernas) it grew in me. <br /> <br /> It's such a cool change to see a movie where girls / young people are not punished for their sexuality. Girls are allowed to explore and even the chance to make mistakes without ridiculous repercussions. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are absolutely hilarious - and many of them are supposedly erotic scenes - which were not exaggerated. or unpleasant. The male characters in the movie were brilliant - David Boreanaz was great as the fickle heartthrob - and what's great is that the movie does not make us hate it that much. The other two younger male characters were also good, not being arrogant. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies I've seen that has girls growing up and it's very empowering to see how they perceive their mistakes. but eventually they pass on and go on with their lives instead of dragging their mistakes along with them.
