Continuing with the exclusive program of complicated films in some European courts, last night at the Schloss theater was "Anna Boleyn," a film directed by the great Teutonic film director Herr Ernst Lubitsch. The film portrays the terrible story of the queen consort of the British king Henry VIII. She was executed by her husband (well, not exactly, the king ordered the performers to do their dirty work) not to mention that this marriage caused a major historical political and religious event, the English Reformation. The film stars Dame Henny Porten, Germany's first superstar during these early years and Herr Emil Jannings, Germany's fattest actor in those silent times. Both interpret their characters appropriately; Dame Porten as an innocent aristocrat who becomes progressively interested in the power the court offers her and Herr Jannings as the unscrupulous, whimsical, womanizing British monarch, a character well suited to this German actor who appropriately appropriates, given the extravagance and Herr Lubitsch's excessive personality was known for his excellent fantasy films, colossal productions with large budgets ("Anna Boleyn" cost about 8 million marks, a fortune even for this German count). ) taking great care in magnificent decorations as can be seen during the coronation procession at the Westminster Abbey scene which employed 4,000 extras (idle Germans of the time were used, causing revolutionary workers to create a riot when German President Friedrich Ebert visited the set <br /> <br /> In addition to the show, one of the most important aspects of this and all of Herr Lubitsch's films, even during his epic period, is the complex relationship between the main characters. We experience a game of different interests, double meanings, and the complicated art of flirting, but what is treated lightly at the outset ends in tragedy. The importance of these historical facts is exercised effectively, but Lubitsch is actually more interested in the change in the relationship between Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. <br /> <br /> And now, if you will allow me, I must temporarily take me away, for this German earl must take care that one of his fat and wealthy heiress does not lose his head for this Teutonic aristocrat. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand von Galitzien http: // ferdinandvongalitzien. blogspot.com/
