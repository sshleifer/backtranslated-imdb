First, the obvious - how a police drama crossed with a funny melodrama, QUAY? is disconcerting, directly independent and a threat to banality. Jouvet's resourcefulness is well exploited in a tough cop's performance, immediately noticeable for its vigor and exuberant force; his Antoine is not so much a man of intellect, but a man of vast experience of life and terrestrial instinct. QUAY ?? is not subversive in the sense that the Philistines of today (and of yesterday) like to use the word. It's Clouzot's funniest hour. He tended to adapt Steeman's books on a satirical note. (They say that Clouzot was a great reader of detective novels). As a director, Clouzot's steady hand succeeds. <br /> <br /> It's not a mystery or a thriller, but a satirical look at a Parisian couple and police procedures. Those accustomed to Clouzot's masterpiece, LES DIABOLIQUES, may find the somewhat multiplicity of things, styles, and elements in QUAY a bit disconcerting. Here Clouzot talks about many things, about a couple, and a hidden love story (Simone Renant for Blier), about world entertainment and about old maids, about police techniques and an old bitter cop with a boy to raise, etc. There is a note of exuberance not only in Jouvet's performance but also in the film's conception. <br /> <br /> Quay is a realistic police drama made as a satire. He offers excellent performance by Jouvet as a tough police inspector. Antoine is an old cop with an adventurous past (he fought in Africa but did not climb the ladder of ranks because of his independent behaviors); he lives with his son, a student; at work, Antoine is hard and ruthless, a competent inspector, bitter, intelligent and hard. It's a very enthusiastic, very picturesque paper. Jouvet composed his character with several defining features-his clothes, his expression, his funny accent, his brutality, and his mocking air. "Antoine is not made to look smarter than plausible; when he questions Blier, Antoine makes mistakes, and his talent is presented as the talent we find in real life - mixed with mistakes, gaps and flaws. Antoine's talent is one that also comes from experience, from daily observation - is not the almost supernatural genius of almost all famous detectives. <br /> QUAY ?? is multifaceted? It is a realistic police drama, and also a satire and a melodrama. It can be considered it among the first filmic incursions in the legendary hardness of the French police. Long ago, the tough cops of Eastwood and Wayne, there was Antoine. <br /> <br /> The title is interesting, suggesting that this is a movie about the police, not about a case or a mystery. As a handicraft, Clouzot was perhaps the finest and sharpest of France (the way Welles was). QUAY ?? He is very faithful to the nature of Clouzot - a sarcastic story, keen observations, a lot of psychology, an acute and merciless irony. The man was first class when he filmed something - he knew what to shoot, what to choose - see the introductory scenes of this movie, with the great success of Jenny Lamour. Each scene is memorably recorded. Clouzot's technical and stylistic aptitudes were astounding. His style is inventive, satirical, sharp, extremely clear, ingenious. <br /> <br /> Jouvet's style was exuberant, powerful and vehement. (Some of them did not like that.) Because he was a great stage actor, his film style was considered too theatrical, etc.). His Antoine is a good example of what is meant by composing a role, a composition. Jouvet had a very peculiar physiognomy, like a threatening bird of prey like Van Cleef, though much more subtle, nobler, more intelligent, and distinct. Jouvet had this predatory and ferocious air, and it is useful here, as he performs an old tough cop. One side of QUAY ?? is that it is a Jouvet recital. He is immediately recognizable, identifiable by the quality of his game (I see that many, watching this movie, do not know that it is a Jouvet film - which is a surprising quality in itself). <br /> <br /> Fresnay and Jouvet are the two French actors I most admire; the first was revealed to me by a drama of Renoir (the famous), while Jouvet by a comedy of Carn√©. I was delighted to see that Clouzot gave leadership roles to both of them. <br /> <br /> Finally, a word about Steeman; he wrote the novel used by Clouzot (who had previously adapted another novel by Steeman, as a Fresnay comedy). Steeman was an old-school mystery writer in Wallace's vein. It has quickly become outdated with the new hardboiled fashion. When I was 11 years old, I read one of his thrillers and I really enjoyed it.
