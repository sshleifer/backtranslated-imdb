In my opinion, National Velvet is one of the best family classics of all time. He has Mickey Rooney as (Mi Taylor) and Elizabeth Taylor as (Velvet Brown). <br /> <br /> Velvet wins a racehorse, called (Pie) in a draw. She falls in love immediately. With the help of Mi, an ex-jockey, they train to compete in the Grand National. After the jockey who was scheduled to run Pie back off at the last moment, Mi convinces Velvet to take his place. <br /> <br /> This was a well-assembled movie. Good storyline and high level acting. The interior game between Elizabeth and Mickey was magical. This is a wonderful family photo expertly run by Clarence Brown. The photograph is stunning. This is a movie that you will enjoy for years to come. <br /> <br /> This photo is what made Elizabeth Taylor a household name. Both Mickey and Elizabeth remained close after the film. They even send postcards to each other after all these years. <br /> <br /> A side note. Elizabeth loved the horse "Pie" so much that the studio gave her.
