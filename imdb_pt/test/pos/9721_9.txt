It's been years since I've seen these shows. I have been looking for years for anyone else who has seen or knows anything about them. I thought I made it up. What I remember most is the soldier and the death. I'd ask the movie freaks if they'd seen it, mentioning it's a Jim Henson and people still did not know. these are great fables. I was very young when I was this, not even 10 and left a lasting impression on my life and beliefs. I would recommend someone to watch these, just remember that they are from the 80's so they do not look like the movies today. just give them a chance. Jim Henson was far ahead of his time and died early.
