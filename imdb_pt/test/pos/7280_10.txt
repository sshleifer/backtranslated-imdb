The first thing I noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up. A quality movie everywhere. <br /> <br /> I suppose you could love this movie just for its action, but I liked it for more than that. <br /> <br /> This is a pure thriller / horror movie. It offers a more complete script than most horror movies. I thought, at least the US version, ended brilliantly, and it was great all around. The story was honest and brutal. <br /> <br /> The film has an excellent script that keeps the action moving, with credible characters in widely believable situations.
