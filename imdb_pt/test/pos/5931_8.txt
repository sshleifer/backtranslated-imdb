Probably the best Royal Rumble in years. <br /> <br /> Game 1 shows the battle of Edge Shawn Michaels in a good but very long match. Then one of the worst fighters on the list - Heidenreich faces The Undertaker in a boring fight. Match number 3 prompts Bradshaw to defend his WWE title against Big Show and Kurt Angle in a surprisingly good contest. The next fight has Triple H defending its tenth heavyweight title against Randy Orton in a great match. <br /> <br /> Then the Royal Rumble happens with 15 Superstars and 15 Smackdown! superstars hit the ring to try to win the snore and face the champion whoever it is at Wrestlemania 21. Highlights include Tough Enough 3 winner Daniel Puder being assaulted by Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero and Hardcore Holly! All superstars beat Muhammad Hassan and Raw superstars against SmackDown! superstars! <br /> <br /> It's not a bad PPV. <br /> <br /> Edge vs HBK - 8/10 Taker vs. Heidenreich - 4/10 JBL vs. Angle vs. Big Show - 7.5 / 10 Triple H vs. Orton - 8/10 The game Royal Rumble - 9/10
