As an American Gentlemen's League fan I had to wait months to finally see this movie when it came out on DVD, but it was worth the wait (excruciating). "Apocalypse" is fantastic - funny, weird, clever as hell, full of inner jokes and enigmatic references to the television series; basically everything you'd expect from gentlemen. <br /> <br /> The plot has already been discussed in other reviews, so I will not bother to recap, although I say that when I first read it I was a little hesitant. Obviously, this device - fictional characters entering the real world to confront their creators - has been used before, notably in Wes Craven's "New Nightmare" books and Stephen King's "Dark Tower" (where King himself was a character). Gentlemen amuse themselves by breaking the fourth wall, and even add a new element: a second fictitious world ("them days"). Soon, the three realities came together, and the result is thrilling: Geoff Tipps being a knight in the Middle Ages (and attempting to court Queen Victoria Wood); the true Gentlemen's League in Royston Vasey, being confronted by such characters as Pauline and Dr. Chinnery; David Warner summoning a homunculus out of Bernice's church. I heard that some people did not like the "King's Evil" sub-plot, but I found it hilarious, especially Reece's character (who seemed to be channeling Judith to "Witch" series three). Speaking of the characters, I was relieved to find that although Hilary Briss, Geoff and Herr Lipp had been planted firmly in the core of the film, other, more familiar characters were given the due. Berenice's confessional at the beginning was hilarious, returning to the quickest, first-draft feel. Pauline and Mickey have appearances (though Ross is not strange), although I'd love to have seen more of Mrs. Campbell-Jones. Papa Lazarou is accounted for, as are Tubbs and Edward. All three are used very sparingly, giving their meager time an almost magical sensation (and what did HELL do to his father, like an obscene ball of hairs? According to the DVD comment, a "pubic hair oily"). /> <br /> The movie looks amazing, but then, what's new? The music, as always, is breathtaking. I was thrilled to hear Joby Talbot's new interpretations of theme music, and his slight reworking of the majestic and lovable play that encloses both "Apocalypse" and the last episode of the third installment. <br /> <br /> I have a few minor complaints, it would have been nice to see more of the old and familiar Royston Vasey, and I felt the stop-motion creatures (handsome, by the way) were a bit underused. Both issues, however, can be justified by the film's budget, so they are understandable. Still, as much as I love Berenice's new church, it would have been nice to see the final battle on the main street (the original vision of the Gentlemen, according to the commentary). <br /> <br /> Overall, "Apocalypse" is amazing, especially if you are a fan of the series. I can not recommend it enough. 10/10.
