Oh, that's a great job, for sure. In fact, several of the best movie scenes, or at least Bergman's movies, can be found in this film. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow are as good as you'd expect. Do these two perform more? Sven Nykvist offers a masterful, though not conventionally masterful, cinematography. The script is very good, especially in individual scenes. Sometimes the film gets late and the pace is uneven, though probably intentionally. <br /> <br /> So, what's the problem? Well, the film is very bleak for its own good. Other Bergman films are equally dark, but not nearly as hard. Eventually, I gave up and started to get a little irritated. I was very affected during the movie, but in the end I did not get involved. It's a great movie, but I doubt I'll see it again, nor suggest it to friends. Or, if I suggest, I'm sure to warn them of what lies ahead. 8/10
