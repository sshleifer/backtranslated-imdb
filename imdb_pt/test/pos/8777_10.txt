Hitchcock once gave an interview where he said that he likes to direct the scripts that had an ordinary person tending their own business, who accidentally got stuck in a terrible chain of events from which they can not get out until the cowardly plot that lies behind of your problems solved. In this way, the audience may feel more sympathy for the hero. We certainly do in this great movie. Barry Kane is just trying to help his partner by performing acts of kindness and consideration, such as helping Fry get the cards he left at the factory. Barry still returns a lost note from $ 100 to Fry later ... that was BIG money in 1943 !! It is Barry's acts of Christian goodness that put him in trouble and soon he is unjustly accused of sabotage and murder and will probably hang himself if he can not get free. Similar to the 39 Steps in the plot, the hero travels the country, where he discovers plans for new acts of terrorism by fascist cells, an arch-villain that no one could believe to be a Nazi closet and a beautiful blonde, Patricia Martin, who first suspects and hates , ends up falling in love with Barry Kane. Hitch's moody touches are here, too. Patricia is an outdoor model who has several ads on the road and helps Barry when he picks up a ride with the bad guys from Las Vegas to New York. We met a truck driver who does a one man comedy: "Someone convinced my wife that it was elegant to eat three meals a day." Fascist spy ring field officers forget to be forgotten or ignored by "suits" as if they were working for some legitimate enterprise. During a chase scene at a movie theater, audience members laugh at the action of a comedy / gangster movie as the cell phone saboteur fires out with the good guys and accidentally kills a patron of the movie chuckling. Horrible for the dead old man, but funny! Hitch liked to use famous monuments in his films and this is the best example, with the Statue of Liberty as background and ironic icon! Works even better than the Mount Rushmore scene on NBNW.
