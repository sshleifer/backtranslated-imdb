Maverick's director, Seijun Suzuki, finally managed to film his dream project, "Princess Racoon," and in a way, it's fortunate that he did not try it in the 1960s. Special effects and computer graphics made this kind of production more easy to achieve than the old mate film technology would have. <br /> <br /> Some familiarity with Japanese history and theatrical traditions will help in the enjoyment of this film. Just as familiarity with Shakespeare's "The Tempest" would help with Peter Greenaway's dense "Prospero's Books." These two films actually have a bit in common, although "Racoon Princess" is much more colorful and easier to observe for someone without the background to appreciate completely. While design, acting and art direction are good for most of the film, it seems to this viewer that energy runs out in the last third of the film. Most interesting sets have already been released and the camera seems to return to a more filmed stage experience. <br /> <br /> This is certainly a unique movie experience and I recommend it to anyone who is interested. in alternative forms of movie performance. It is not really intended for children, although nothing happens that can disturb them. If the last third were better, I would have given nine stars.
