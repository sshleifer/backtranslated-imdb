SPOILER NTH MAS SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have to add my name to the list of people who think other viewers simply do not understand. But no one even mentioned the word "s" as far as I could see. <br /> <br /> Although I agree that the boy died, I think we can be more specific: he committed suicide. He runs up the slope in an old wagon, shoots off the cliff and ... "flies away." Perhaps the full account of the form of death is an allegory or perhaps he commits suicide in a cart as set forth. In both cases, it "flies away" (come on, it's not such a difficult metaphor). <br /> <br /> Maybe I had something for Tom Hanks, but I was fine with the narration. Also, he's raising $ for the WW2 memorial and you have to love him for it. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, I loved the movie and found it incredibly moving.
