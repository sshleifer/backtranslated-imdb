Once again, Doctor Who delivers the goods by the bucket load. It has humor ("You're just making it up as you go!", "Yes, but I do it brilliantly"), action, monsters (in this case, more cyberbugs), tragedies and intimidation tactics. In short, only what the doctor prescribed (pun intended). The way emotions move from one to the other is so well done that there is no feeling of "moving on." So, create 3 of the last 4 episodes that made you laugh, then made you cry, and made you go "eek". <br /> <br /> In terms of character development, this is clearly the decisive argument for Noel Clarke's Mickey (and Ricky). Being one of the Doctor's companions, you know he will do the right thing, and may even suspect the way he does it. However, it is still an emotional key when it confirms its future path. <br /> <br /> While "The Rise of Cybermen" had more of the sinister build up to terror, "The Age of Steel" is a whole blast away. Like "Alien" compared to "Aliens" - both true classics, but in different ways. Can the series continue at this level? Let us wait.
