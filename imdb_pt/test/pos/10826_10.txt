When I went to see Bon Voyage, I expected a good and skillful multi-drama in the order of the Grand Hotel (1932) and Les Enfants de Paradis (1944). It was better than that. With few exceptions, none of the characters were totally good or totally evil - just like in real life. The performance was wonderful, especially those who played Frédéric, Raoul and Camille. The photograph was amazing as it perfectly recreated the period and managed to be filmed in Bordeaux at a time of new public works but achieved the "look" of June 1940. The costumes and makeup were accurate. There's so much in this movie that it's worth a second screening. It's exciting, funny and, finally, touching. N.B - Do not forget to watch it in a cinema with good quality projection. It's on wide screen, and in the theater where I've seen (the Clairmont in Montclair) the first 30 minutes had the subtitles in the background in focus, but the faces of the actors were a bit confusing! This was finally rectified, but undermined the movie's enjoyment.
