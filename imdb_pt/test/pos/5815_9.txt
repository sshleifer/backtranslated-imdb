Although it may not be Cassavetes' best work, Minnie and Moskowitz are almost perfect in all their efforts. The plot is capricious and charming, and surprisingly dramatic with an impressive range of emotions - much more drama than comedy, contrary to IMDb profile. Yes, the story is capricious, but not arbitrary; it is very believable, though a bit forced - to which I will return. All the artistic aspects are of the true form of Cassavetes: cinematography and camera work are delights, and the soundtrack - although only there - is complementary. Also, I believe I've noticed some nods to Godard and such in the editing - as I have in some of the other Cassavetes films - (that is, the abrupt cut of a song in a scene), which are interesting. <br /> <br /> I feel that the plot is well constructed, with the first half being particularly pleasing. Seymour's conversation with Morgan Morgan (Timothy Carey) in the restaurant, for example, is wonderfully funny and fascinating, and sets the tone for the philosophical commentary made throughout the film. This philosophizing - a tradition in the films of Cassavetes - is what made the film for me. Seymour's fun and deep monologues instantly eliminate the first impressions one can have of him as a simple hippie - though his character is curiously similar to his in Faces (1968). This gave me the impression, however, that (in the second exhibition) the opinion is against the best work of Cassavetes. I gained an affection for this film that I missed the first time I watched. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are several aspects that make this film imperfect. I think the plot is unbalanced. Like I said before, it develops very well, but it dims a bit here and there, particularly in the end. Because of the spontaneous style in which Cassavetes worked, and particularly the freedom with which he allowed his actors to improvise, the quality of his product can easily go either way. In this case, it is inconsistent. I reckon most of this movie was improvised, and most of it beautifully. But one or two scenes, unfortunately, simply do not work. In particular, the scene after Seymour quarrels with Minnie's work at her home. During what is intended to be the most intense scene of the film, Cassavetes allowed his actors to run freely through the dialogue - assuming some were planned in advance. That, I believe, was a mistake. One has the impression that Cassel does not quite know what to do, since he repeatedly gets in the way of his speech, often making no sense, and exaggerating; all this damages the scene and the development of the character. I understand that Seymour pretends to be an idiot, but Cassel's attempts are misapplied. Why did he cut off his mustache? These failures are due to: lack of direction in the part of Cassavetes; lack of understanding and prediction on the part of Cassel; lack of testing and preparation; Of course, Cassavetes did not learn from his mistakes, as he allowed the same thing to happen in his next film, A Woman Under the Influence (1974) - the scene of committing and ending. <br /> <br /> The flaws I mention are not minor, but they do not spoil the movie. They simply make some scenes embarrassing and unreal, spoiling the flow of the film and compromising its potential. However, I really like Cassavetes and all his actors, especially Cassel, despite the flaws I mentioned. This is a very nice film, although it proves the precariousness of the style of Cassavetes.
