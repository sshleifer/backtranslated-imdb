I really enjoyed the wooden film camera. I think it's a bit influenced by the Brazilian film "City of God", but perhaps this parallelism between the two possible tracks (crime and art) in the social neighborhood is a reality. <br /> <br /> I think the films made by Madiba are really beautiful. I do not think it's unreal that he made such good films because there are so many artists who have no education at all and can be really cool. <br /> <br /> I really liked the soundtrack. It is set for the photos. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie ... it's good to show what a life in a social housing can be like.
