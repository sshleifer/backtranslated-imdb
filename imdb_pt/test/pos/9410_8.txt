Having seen this unaware of all the enthusiasm surrounding the main character, unaware that it was based on real-life facts, I must say that I am impressed. "Murder in Greenwich" is an above-average production for a movie made for TV - the performance is uniformly great, Christopher Meloni in particular, putting on a standout performance and teen actors stand out in difficult roles. The idea of ​​the dead girl narrating the film is a stroke of genius that elevates the movie from merely good to excellent. The screenplay is exemplary for what is essentially movie-of-the-week fodder and cinematography is beautiful.
