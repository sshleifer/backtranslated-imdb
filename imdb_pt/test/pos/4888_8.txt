Whether you're a fan of the series that inspired you or not, there's no denying that this is an erratic job. But in the best possible sense. Desirous of escaping the pitfalls of the old sitcoms that made a difficult transition to the big screen, Mr. Pemberton, Dyson, Shearmsith and Gatiss took a different path, addressing the problems of coping with their success, adding other creations, and inevitably remaking some of his most beloved characters. It's a shame that they do not just have a more consistent Gents' film, because no matter how inventive it gets in the script, it weakens the finished film. It's worth renting though.
