I just came back from attending this doctor nominated for the Academy Award, and I was completely touched and interested in exploring the works of this guy that I had never heard of before. Of course I am someone who is captivated by beautiful architecture, so I realize that others will not care. <br /> <br /> We can imagine if there were any more visionaries in Philadelphia in the late 1960s, when the Kahn plans were a possibility, what a wonderful downtown there would be. If you wonder if you're going to see more about the Bangladeshi building at the beginning of the movie, be patient because there will provide the climax of the film at the end. <br /> <br /> Your son's personal discoveries in the process of making this movie are quite interesting, sometimes touching and even funny at times. There are one of the funniest anti-visionary verses ever captured on camera. <br /> <br /> Rounding out the good points of this document is a touching soundtrack with great expressive chord music. And expressiveness is an important point to be found in Kahn's architecture. The points pointed out by other architects about the spiritual nature of matter and how Kahn's buildings brought up the general experience of this film.
