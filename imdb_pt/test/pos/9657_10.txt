I watched this movie for the first time on the Sci Fi channel and I must say it was simply amazing. For those of you who love 'The Never Ending Story' this is one that would bring back memories of this movie. Even though it's a 1996 movie, it has a hazy background and seems to make it look like it's a fantasy. The performance was brilliant and the music was great, especially the beginning song of battle and the final song. For those of you who still have to see, WATCH! I thoroughly recommend!
