10/10 <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies ever made and I'm not saying this because I'm being fooled by the seemingly meaningless presentation. Those who do not like the film because they do not understand the story often criticize those who are praising the film saying they are assuming their genius because they do not understand it. I do not see this movie as very allegorical. For me, it's a story with beginning, middle and end. People get confused by the film because they expect it to have a deep philosophical meaning that they must interpret from the supposedly senseless scenes. I feel that they fail to realize that the enigmatic comes from a cut-and-rearranged plot combined with a very long and rather explanatory fantasy sequence and not from a chaos of visual allegory. Because of length limitation, I will try to keep it short and to the point and touch on the main concepts. <br /> <br /> The general plot: Diane moves to LA after the jitterbug contest to get in on the action. In an audition, she meets Camilla with whom she falls in love. Diane is furious with jealousy, since Camilla sleeps with other men and women. Diane discovers the other man (the director) in a movie session and discovers the other woman (a random blonde) at Camilla's engagement party and director. Motivated by her rage and possessiveness, Diane hires a murderer to kill Camilla. After that, she is overcome by loneliness and enters a world of unconscious fantasy where she lives the life she desires. Diane is then awakened. In her conscious state, she is haunted by what she did. <br /> <br /> The meaning of fantasy: The film begins, after the credits, with a first person p.o.v. shot depicting someone collapsing on a bed and slipping into unconsciousness. This is where Diane's fantasy begins. The accident exists as an excuse for her to "bring back" her dead girlfriend and justify the fantasy life. She describes her girlfriend as meek and innocent, because that's what she wanted her to be. Meanwhile, she acts as if everything is "like in the movies", because she has an escapist personality. She also, in a sense, kills herself and assumes the identity of a waitress named Betty in a restaurant. The story that revolves around the director is a direct result of his sense that he was somehow victimized in reality, just as she was and "convinces" herself that he was forced to choose Camilla. It was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control she felt during the party. Camilla Rhoades in fantasy is actually the random blonde of the engagement party. She hated her so much that she turned her into Camilla and made the final antagonist. She then took the real Camilla and made her into a perfect and submissive girlfriend outside the theaters and used Rita Hayworth as inspiration. She also paints the killer as a very clumsy person and unable to further justify Camilla's survival. Her fantasy world, unfortunately for her, was a search for Diane, who turned out to be herself and made the dream world die, taking her through a series of reminders of reality. The first reminder was Club Silencio, who sang that "there is no band" and the "instruments" you hear are not really there; this is a metaphor for fantasy. She begins to shake violently because it shakes her perception of her surroundings. The other reminder is the blue box ... Actually, the blue box is not the reminder itself (more of a Pandora box, actually), but the blue key that opens the box. The blue key reminds Camilla's real death, because that's what the killer said would appear when it was done. Besides having love, all this creation is an escape from reality, living in the idealized Hollywood she hoped to be a part of when she arrived. <br /> <br /> This is a story that shows the psychology of a very upset woman who has lost a dream. It is not a series of random things specifically designed to upset and is not a cryptic philosophical message. It is an unfortunate piece of the human condition that is presented beautifully. <br /> <br /> However, in the final analysis, this is all my opinion. I can be far away. Or it may not mean anything. There are many who do not agree with me. Great! After all, why does this have to mean anything? Why can not it just be a statement itself? What if coherent and sensible narratives are shackles to artistic expression? Peter Greenaway, for example, spent many words eloquently supporting this idea with statements such as "I would say that if you want to write narratives, be an author, be a novelist, do not be a filmmaker. exciting in areas that are not primarily about narrative. " And where is the written rule that everything must be immediately understood with only one possible interpretation? There is no such rule because the clarity of the film is not related to his art. "I did not understand!" Like this...? "Mulholland Dr.," story or not, affects viewers, torments them, drags them, haunts them, soothes them. The way it lends itself to interpretation is incredible. It never gets old. It never loses its luster. Their visuals are always effective and beautiful. It's cinematic perfection, no matter what. Appreciate.
