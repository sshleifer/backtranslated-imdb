This is an amazing movie and it is very smart to use the few actors and sets. It is also very shocking - physical and psychological torture (explicit and implicit) is mixed with quiet and even humorous passages. So the horror is always unexpected and brutal. I'm not soft, but this would have to be the most shocking movie I've ever seen. The message of this movie is definitely delivered with a sledgehammer. This is the movie that I will always remember the two actors.
