I have no words to really describe this series. <br /> <br /> The premise behind this concept (a highly hyperactive girl with a very eccentric personality who ends up creating a team of eccentrics in her own interpretation of the world, which was after all a creation of Haruhi, since she wants a world with aliens, espers and time travelers) is a breath of fresh air in a world full of repeated anime series and non-innovative TV shows. <br /> <br /> Characters are well developed, and you will end up loving them, some less than others. The word to describe the work of animation does not exist, since "excellent" would be insufficient to describe how it was done. There are many funny situations that will either make you smile or put you into deep thoughts. Do not fall for the impression of the first episode, since it is just the tip of the iceberg, since the novels are yet to come. <br /> <br /> The only problem is the lack of chronological order in the region. episodes, but you can solve this problem, no? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Unquestionably, one of the best series of 2006.
