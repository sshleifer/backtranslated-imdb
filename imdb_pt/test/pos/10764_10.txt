I can not imagine why this has not yet been released in theaters. He has a great cast, with Sutherland, Lane and especially Chris Evans doing a spectacular job. Wake up, studio executives! <br /> <br /> The story is based on the experiences of the author / writer, growing up as the "poor kid" in an extremely rich community, where class is everything, and makes a difference in every aspect of life, clothing the Justice. <br /> <br /> During the question and answer session of the film, the author was asked about his experiences, and particularly about what we do not know about the ultra-rich. He said they are not stupid, they are very smart (as opposed to how they can portray), they have plans, and they are a threat! <br /> <br /> In many ways, this film is extremely timely.
