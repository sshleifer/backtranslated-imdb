I'll start with a warning: This movie is not recommended for anyone who has no interest or has never played the FF7 before watching. The film relies on the public knowledge of each character in the game to convey the plot elements. And it does so very subtly. Do your homework before watching this wonderful CG movie and I promise it will be so much better. <br /> <br /> With that in mind, this movie has some of the most spectacular CG sequences I've ever seen. The whole experience looked like an extra long FMV string of the game, with steroids. Yes. The attention to detail in every scene, especially the heavy-duty ones, is so impeccable that it left me with a sense of wonder. <br /> <br /> I believe the soundtrack is streamlined to help the audience focus on the quality of animation more than the music. Again, for those who are familiar with the history and history of FF7, the music should surprise no one (although the timing and placement of each original soundtrack accompanies every scene and mood to the point where music simply animation). <br /> <br /> Once again, having just touched the FF7 once, I really enjoyed this piece of Square Enix art. And that's the feeling in most scenes, choreographed and organized. Like a dance. <br /> <br /> In short, if you liked the music or the game Final Fantasy 7, this movie will get you out of the water. If you are in the unfortunate majority who have not experienced the well known FF7 on Playstation or PC, doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experience. <br /> <br /> Finally, I just want to write down the quality in the animation of this movie. Characters move smoothly. Each scene scene comes to life and tells its own story. For those who criticize the thinness and dependence of the plot of the story, I urge you to reexamine the animation. Facial reactions, subtle clues that bring another level of entertainment above the typical storytelling method of plotting. <br /> <br /> Square Enix and the great Tetsuya Nomura have set a new standard for quality animation and storytelling. Advent Children ushered in a new era for CG animations, allowing the subtleties that exist in each character to speak volumes in themselves. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Square Enix. The wait was worth it.
