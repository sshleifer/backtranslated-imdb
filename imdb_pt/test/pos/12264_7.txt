James L. Brook is one of those directors who always seems to have a peculiar view of life. He is not only the producer of "The Simpsons," he has some classic comedies on his resume - "Broadcast News" is one of them. <br /> <br /> Although it does not match his later effort "As good as it is," "Broadcast News" is still a very clever, funny and witty movie about a television station and all the problems they suffer. There is a great comedic sequence of physical humor in which Joan Cusack is running around the building trying to get a news tape into the editing room in a matter of minutes before being broadcast live on TV. <br /> <br /> This is not only very true in terms of how busy broadcast stations are operated, but also a skilled and honest picture of humans. <br /> <br /> A discreet and subtle film with good acting (especially from Hurt), which I do not always like so much) and proper direction.
