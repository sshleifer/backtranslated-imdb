First I have to say that this movie is less pretentious than The Da Vinci Code. Of course, you have the problem of religion versus science, but do not try to make an important statement about it. is basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well. a scene particularly (involving fire) I found extremely well done. <br /> <br /> Second, the book changes to the movie. although when I was following the development of the movie I complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others, I have to admit that I was wrong. it was refreshing that the film did not follow the book in exactly the same way as it was done in Da Vinci. If you are a book purist, some of them may upset you. However, the BIG TWIST is still there, so do not worry about it. finally, I am glad they have removed some subplots and have not even tried to suggest the possibility of Langdon and Vittoria joining. <br /> <br /> The presentations are really good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Okay for a movie like this. <br /> <br /> I would give 9/10, mainly because it offers what it promises, entertainment, pure entertainment
