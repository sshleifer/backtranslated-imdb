This is a very underrated movie to say the least. As pointed out in previous posts, this movie has a somewhat loose and highly implausible script, but you find yourself saying "Who cares?" while shooting milk (or insert the beverage of your choice here) through the nose. It was really due to a rare mix of actors in sync. While Kelsey Grammar is obviously a talented actor (reference 'Frasier', this film), the supporting actors play their roles very well. I found it interesting how they played the part about Duane Martin blowing the shot in the 'big game' for the Navy basketball team; If any of you are a basketball fan, you'll remember Martin from 'White Men Can not Jump' and 'Above the Rim' and you'll know that Martin had a short spell in the NBA with the Knicks. Nice as they played on attributes of credible characters like this. Rob Schneider's anal-retentive character was the perfect compensation for Grammar's calm demeanor. Lauren Holly has played the brave-sexpot-with-a-brain well enough to make you want her to succeed. This is a movie that will make you laugh even if you've seen it many times before ... the comics in this movie definitely last. I still see myself laughing 12 years later. <br /> <br /> "Is this one of my chickens?" "Uhhh ... no, that's a parrot ... from the Caribbean." "Well, do not let it fly ... it's dinner." "Arrrrr ..... arr."
