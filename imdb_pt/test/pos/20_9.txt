The many other comments about the movie say it all - just to add that we showed last week to about 30 in our Community Cinema, and got an overall average score of 8.6. We 100% recommend it to the audience today, especially if they can see it on a real movie screen, and can talk about it with others after, as our audience did. <br/> <br/> The power of the performance performances of the whole troupe was incredible and quite fascinating. Of course, Finney and Courtenay were truly the stars. but everyone was completely well off. For our afternoon audience, most of whom are "elderly", the fact that the plot could be followed so easily because of the clarity of speech and the wonderful non-technical use of camera and sound was a great influence <br /> <br /> How delightful, many have said, see a really great movie that is British: not yet dated twenty years later: not full of blood and guts: not confused because of bob-about- the-place camera pictures, and back and forth across the lines of the story of time: no decadent sex scenes. Such visions were even uttered by some who were younger.
