As the first film in this series (SLAUGHTER, 1972), I think it would be a mistake to label this as a "blaxsploitation film." Of course, Slaughter is a tough, armed black man, but it's more of an action photo, regardless of the color of the protagonist or the bad guys - and a good action photo. <br /> <br /> For the second and last time, Jim Brown plays the title character. The movie starts with one of the most idiotic scenes I can remember in a movie. As Slaughter and his friends are enjoying an outdoor party, along comes a biplane and begins to spray the group with machine gun fire! No, Slaughter is not so hard that he shoots the plane with his .357! But Slaughter is marked and no one knows for sure why this happened - however, Slaughter will get to the bottom! Well, it turns out that the coup was tried in retribution for the last film. In it, Slaughter assumes the mafia and kicks a lot of people in Mexico. Now, in a horribly spoiled and awkward attempt, the guys on the plane kill and injure many people, but they miss Slaughter. And as the job was very bad, the mafia boss (Ed MacMahon!) Orders the pilot and the gunslinger to be killed by his brutal killer (Don Stroud - in a very typical role for him). Stroud is great - scary and nasty up to the core, but Ed MacMahon as the boss?! Wow, this is an interesting twist! <br /> <br /> The slaughter is perplexed now. He discovered who the two guys were on the plane, but when he got to them, they were dead. Then to help him in his own private revenge, Brock Peters (who plays a policeman) tells him who the mobsters were who ordered the attack and got Slaughter to agree to help by doing some illegal underground work. Then, Slaughter and his pimp friend invade the mafia's mansion and steal a list of rewards from leading government and police officials. And, of course, there is a lot of shooting and bloodshed in the process. Stroud is not about to let Slaughter get away with it and kidnaps Slaughter's girlfriend. Now it's a deadlock - Slaughter has the list, but if he does not return it, the lady is dead. Being a tough but gallant man, you may be able to guess much of what happens next. <br /> <br /> The action is very good in the movie and Jim Brown is menacing and tough. The only downside I noticed was that although MacMahon played that bad boss in the end he just gave up - and very quickly. When Slaughter reaches him, MacMahon becomes a coward and all the previous evil disappears - and that is very clich√© and inconsistent. Still, despite this little complaint, it's an engaging movie that is NOT for kids because of all the violence and breasts.
