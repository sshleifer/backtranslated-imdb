People seem to be waiting for Citizen Kane here! The Planet is a B monster movie and as such is fun and different enough to be enjoyed. The director clearly has something to offer - not so sure about some of the cast. As for the effects? Â£ 8000 is not a lot of budget effects. I would at least be happy to recommend this tour to a sci-fi head or to anyone who does not take monsters movies very seriously. If then? Watch 3colours blue instead.I noticed a comment saying it had ripped Alien. As Alien did not rip things off. The best thing about the movie? The director. The worst thing in the movie? The cast. Maybe it's time for the director to move from Glasgow to London and find some talent. However - well done. At least you're trying to do something.
