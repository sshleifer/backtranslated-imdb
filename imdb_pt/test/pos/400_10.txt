A very delicious piece of film that should have a wider distribution. Ian McShane is at home playing the DJ who goes crazy because he will not "follow the show" and wants the world to know what he's missing out on. The supporting cast is great too, and the song is the "Soul" of the movie. I just wanted the movie to be released so I could get a copy of it for my film library.
