This movie is a sleeper - I watched all the miniseries that have appeared on TV a few times, and this is the best. Wonderfully released, superbly represented and characters are well developed. Helen Morse fits perfectly into Jean Paget's part - raucous, in control, sharp and a little aggressive. She jumps well from Joe Harmon, the cowboy / taciturn type / "It's gonna be okay." I regretted that the film was not in the book because there was no romantic interest between Noel Struan and Jean Paget. For those who do not know, this is taken from a true story about English women marching through Malaysia for 3 years by the Japanese, who did not really know what to do with them. Very few of them survived. Neville Shute talked to one of them, and this is his story. This movie deserves to be in the collection of everyone who loves the stories of World War II.
