remember when this movie was made by robert downey senior. a very good entertainment black entertainment feature, which was an underground success in california-los angeles and new york at the time. a hippie loved the classic where, the changes taking place in the business world are striking, refreshing and interesting comedy.Not complacent, not like the basic society in the time of 1969 watched, is still very good, but today's life in America totally different from 69 good for baby boomers.
