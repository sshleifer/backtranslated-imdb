Having seen the uncut version, I thought this movie was done beautifully. This captured my attention from beginning to end; the tension was beautifully conveyed. Nasaan Ka Man portrays the typical Filipino family accurately in the presentation of secrets and lies. Even the religious culture, the human tendency to keep up appearances and maintain a pure reputation is shown clearly in the personality of Gloria Diaz. There is not a little scene in this movie that does not have a purpose - the cinematography is excellent and the writing brilliant. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is great, I personally discovered that the turnaround in the end, The revelation of the character of Jericho was not as shocking as it should be. But then maybe it's just me, because otherwise, Nasaan Ka Man is a very cleverly done film. <br /> <br /> The cast was good to start, but the acting of Deither and Claudine was the icing on the cake. Not one to miss if you are looking for a Filipino movie that will amaze and exceed expectations. Thumbs to the director.
