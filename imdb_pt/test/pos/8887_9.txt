We live in sad times today, in which it seems that every comedy movie and TV show is painfully bland and inflicted with cheap, coarse or poor humor. Most people do not know what it means to laugh at a comedy, and these people desperately need to watch "Throw Momma From the Train". I say with little hesitation that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, from beginning to end. The comedy is so unpredictable and distorted just enough to make us laugh out loud many times. Do not be fooled by the murder plan. The plot is not serious enough to make us care or worry about what's going to happen. The story involves a young man (Danny DeVito) who wants to get rid of his annoying and grumpy mother (Anne Ramsey, nominated for an Oscar in a completely flawless role, in my opinion) and does so by killing Billy Crystal's wife. , whom Crystal wanted to kill for stealing her romance. I do not want to ruin the jokes and jokes in this movie, but all I can say is you should see this movie if you want to laugh. Quickly and genuinely, a real treat for comedy lovers, and the kind of movie you just do not see today. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
