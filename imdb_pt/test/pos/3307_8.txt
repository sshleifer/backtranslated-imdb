You can not take this movie seriously ... the plot is predictable and banal, the acting often exaggerated, the dialogue laughable; but all this is a lot of fun! Three "career girls" in the late 1950s find their way into the big city and all the evils and temptations that their mothers probably warned them of: married men, alcohol, premarital sex, abortion, etc. <br /> <br /> Then there's Amanda Farrell (Joan Crawford) who succeeded professionally but whose personal life was sacrificed by an office with her name on the door. <br /> <br /> This movie may have been credible 50 years ago, but now it's just great great fun! Rent / buy and enjoy.
