In the world of "shorts" (most of which are not), this movie is a jewel. <br /> <br /> A silent, concise glance at the world of a young woman who is a reader of a blind woman, here the starlet Elizabeth Franz - this film has the textures, layers and visual narrative of a sumptuously painted dead nature. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is minimal, the cinematography is impressive, and the direction is clear, clear and convincing. I saw this movie at a movie festival held in a noisy and crowded Tribeca bar - and in the first two minutes (and for the first time that night), the crowd was quiet. <br /> <br /> That says it all.
