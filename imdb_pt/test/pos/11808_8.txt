Elementary and middle school teachers will find "The Cure" an excellent teaching tool, either as a companion to "Huckleberry Finn" or as an autonomous lesson. Although AIDS is supposed to be the main theme, the strong assumption of friendship and love as they evolve between Eric and Dexter is a powerful message for teenagers. Writing prompts centered around the symbolism of sneakers are particularly effective. I also suggest a class discussion addressed on how Eric evolves from user manipulator to loving friend.
