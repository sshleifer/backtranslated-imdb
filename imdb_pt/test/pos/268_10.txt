I am surprised that mine, so far, is the only comment on this subject. film ... as far as I know, the series itself, had a huge following of followers, commentators and real people, praised a person. Anyway, let me immediately tell you that if you like me, you're a sucker for gritty cop dramas, you'll love "The Lost Child" Tennison, the heroine, throughout the series "Prime Suspect", has fought against the male police establishment throughout the series, reaching his current and comparatively powerful post in the police hierarchy through hard work, stubbornness and pure talent for police work. She is essentially an ambitious career woman, but she has a romantic side and certainly is not a man who hates. Unfortunately her relationships are affected by the perverse hours her career demands, and she has never married, so when she finds herself pregnant with her last case, she is faced with the choice of becoming a mother and risking all her police work without talk about future advancement, or have an abortion - by which she chooses. This abortion never appears in the ensuing drama - it is very cleverly treated, in less than two minutes, a marvel of economy in scripting and editing - but it is always there, as a counterpoint to Tennison's desperate efforts to find another "child lost "- a kidnap victim - before it's too late. The story takes a lot of twists and turns, before the surprising ending, and one is equally fascinated by the plot and characters (though I have found the many villains a little uncovered), the police, and especially Tennison herself, are not always competent , nor so sympathetic, that she imagines, given the unpleasant work she has to do, in the contemptible underworld that habitually inhabits this series. Mirren herself said that she will not make any more films in the series, but, excellent as she has always been in the role of Tennison, the series itself is like "actor proof" as is my other addiction - Dick Wolf's "American Law & Order" - whoever appears, each could go on forever. How my fervent hope is.
