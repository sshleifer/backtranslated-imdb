David Cronenberg, much like fellow David Lynch, is an acquired taste. A director who plays with themes like reality, perversion, sex, insanity and death, is bound to receive the most extreme reactions from the public. He has proven this with films like The Fly, Naked Lunch, Crash and eXitenZ (Capital X, Capital Z) and most recently Spider. It's best to see eXistenZ with a clear mind. Try not to read too much about the plot, or it will be ruined for you. What I can say is that Cronenberg takes you on a trip to the world of video games, which acts as a metaphor for any kind of escapist behavior. Living fantasies is something that people always dream about, but how far can you go before reality gets confused and fantasy becomes a nightmare? These are the themes addressed in eXistenZ, an exploration of identity, the human psyche, physical bodies being invaded by disease and, more important, reality itself. <br /> <br /> The history and direction are excellent. Cronenberg knows his business very well and successfully gives life to an artificial world, avoiding the usual traps and cliches linked to stories like this. The film shows some very disgusting things, but is unusually discreet in the gore department compared to other Cronenberg works. The shock effects he plays are never exaggerated and the plot progression is very clever and creative. It is not the most intellectual movie of all time, but it will leave you thinking about it, wondering and very confused. <br /> <br /> The performance also gets two compliments. Both protagonists, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, play their parts perfectly and intelligently portray the mood swings and identities of their characters. The dialogue may seem a bit obsolete and clinical at times, but that is part of the effect Cronenberg was seeking, to create an alien and unhappy atmosphere that makes him completely uncomfortable. Supporting actors like Ian Holm, Don McKellar and a particularly scary Willem Dafoe elevate the film even higher with their disturbingly familiar performances. <br /> <br /> This movie takes some time to get used to, but if you can enjoy the dark tone, blood-curdeling images and existentially distorting the story, you will love it.
