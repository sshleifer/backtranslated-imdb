Having long scorned television network programming, I remember the first time I caught an episode of "Police Squad!". It was totally by chance. It was during the initial network program on ABC in early 1982. I am a chronic channel surfer and was ringing the dial one night when suddenly appeared the opening credits sequence of "Police Squad!" On the screen of my TV. I immediately recognized this as reminiscent of the opening credits of "M-Squad" starring Lee Marvin, one of my all time favorite cop shows. I stopped surfing. Then, of course, came thirst being fired, followed by the immortal Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln. By now I was saying to myself "What the heck is this ??". Then came the special guest star, Georg Stanford Brown, being flattened by a free fall box. I was addicted at the time. The episode was "Ring of Fear / A Dangerous Assignment," with its references to "On The Waterfront" and "Muhammed Ali," but more memorable, of course, were all gags and non sequiturs. Leslie Nielsen and Alan North in their loose parody of Lee Marvin and Paul Newlan of "M Squad" were an absolute riot. "Finally," I said to myself, "A network television program is really worth watching !!!". Would not you know it would be canceled only a few weeks later? Leave it to the nets - I should know. Anyway, I just bought the DVD collection of all six episodes and they are as funny today as they were 27 years ago. The films "Naked Gun" were also great, but I missed Alan North (he was as good as Ed Hocken), Peter Lupus as Nordberg (and they were thinking about starring OJ in that part?) And especially Johnny " shine face Good stuff.
