This is a very strange series with Dean Learner. I really did not understand the guests. I knew they were not serious, but if they were really they were not clear why ... I think I'm so stupid. I do not know if this class as a spoiler, but the guests are not real like Ali G or anything that they are played by a man or so I believe. I love the serious look that is happening. It's like the show I was on a Sunday morning that I forgot the name of lol. I also really like the clothes and the mustache he has. It's too hot. He is insensitive, which is one of the funniest qualities. I also like the way he has subsections of the program. That makes it seem more authentic.
