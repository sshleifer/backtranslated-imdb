This is an adaptation of the talkie of the play Eugene O'Neill, incredibly well filmed. Its main disadvantage is a static camera, and as a result, it comes out most of the time as the piece shot, which is a pity as it is a good piece of primitive film made at a time when the sound was representing all the types. of technical problems, and as a result, most films were experimental, whether that was their creator's intention or not. Garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as he was in his silent films, and his entrance is still classic. His voice is strangely deep, almost childish, which only enhances his already seductively eccentric personality. Like her boyfriend, Charles Bickford is appropriately virile, apparently he was born steep and a perfect match for the divine Garbo. His Irish accent is not bad at all, and he always looks like a natural sea man, much like O'Neill in his independent and brooding nature. As the (very) confused father of Garbo, George Marion really seems from another time. He has the kind of face and voice - open, unmanaged, totally unscrupulous - that has disappeared from the earth. Marie Dressler is also on the swing of O'Neill's stuff. Her empty expression and intensity around her eyes speaks volumes as she interprets her drunken character as a woman sometimes bordering on psychosis. A poetic license, perhaps, because this is not in the script, but we can forgive Miss Dressler's excesses; She's too good not to. The story ends with a move to the next thing, different from the resolution, which is not the author's cup of tea; and those who enjoy their movies resolved at the end will be disappointed by the absence of any real surprise. In Anna Christie, we are in the country of O'Neill, a place of sea, storms and haze, a sense of impregnating and reprehensible uncertainty, which we would now call ambivalence or neurosis of anguish. Instead of analyzing this state of mind, the author presents it simply and wisely, while the climate, the earth, the ocean, and the people intertwine and address one another in a unique language that we believe to be privileged.
