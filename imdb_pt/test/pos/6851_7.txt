One more fault than a failure, MR. IMPERIUM stars Ezio Pinza as Alex, the apparent heir and later king of a small European nation, who falls in love with an American actress and artist, Fredda Barlo (Lana Turner), but due to machinations of Alex's cunning prime minister. king, very well played by Cedric Hardwicke, lovers are separated for 12 years before meeting in Palm Springs where their love is revived. Director Don Hartman, who also labels, is not able to fully utilize his talent for sulky dialogue because of the hesitant use of Pinza's English, and the necessary rewrite, combined with a less than obvious relationship between the two stars, results in a somewhat uneven tone to the screenplay, exacerbated by the cruel cut of many studio scenes, leading to a confusing ending. The domineering Pinza dominates her scenes with Turner, but both artists punctuate with good work, while Marjorie Main is stunning with her patter effects as it is written, with Debbie Reynolds being put on track by Louis B. Mayer for SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN as the result of his cheerful performance here; only Barry Sullivan is heavily victimized by the flagrant cut. Beautifully filmed in Pebble Beach, California, and other surrounding Monterey County, the film is endowed with a strong operatic center of Pinza in Only Once, as well as original songs by Harold Arlen and Dorothy Fields, with Douglas Shearer splendidly manipulating the sound recording, and notice must be made of the fine decorations of Edwin Willis, and the costumes of Walter Plunkett.
