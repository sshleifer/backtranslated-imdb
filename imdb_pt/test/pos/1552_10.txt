This film takes the psychological thriller to new depths. Well written by Shane Black, the film is performed phenomenally by the cast under the watchful eye of director Jack Swanstrom. Clearly, Swanstrom is a director we should look for in the future. Its strength lies in its adaptation of personal experiences, both on the screen and in the classroom. <br /> <br /> This thought-provoking movie is a must-have for anyone who can appreciate action, drama, suspense and mystery. As with all good movies, the viewer makes a journey on his own to find his individual interpretation of the film. The mystical aspect of the film is intriguing and increases suspense. You find yourself looking for the answers along with Marquette. The public liked the film on the festival circuit - with many awards received, they must have agreed that A.W.O.L. (2006) is worth watching. <br /> <br /> I would love to have a copy - how do I get one?
