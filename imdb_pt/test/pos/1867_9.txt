Put simply, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were notable. The film is less about the raw science of Darwin's beliefs, and it keeps focus very strongly on his relationship with his family, especially his wife, Emma, ​​and daughter, Annie. Toby Jones takes a wonderful turn as Thomas Huxley, Darwin's great defender of beliefs, and the rest of the cast is up to the task of sharing screen time with Bettany and Connelly. <br /> <br /> But it's these two who carry the movie. His actual chemistry is apparent from beginning to end, but he develops transcendence when Darwin deals with his demons. The scene in which Darwin relates the end of Jenny's story, the orangutan, to his dying daughter, Annie, is extremely moving. The world premiere audience at TIFF was fascinated. Bettany's performance will be recognized as one of the best of the year in the short term. Equally magnificent is Connelly's work as the religious wife of a man who, in Huxley's words, "killed God." <br /> <br /> The movie advances slowly across the spectrum of Darwin's pain, savoring every detail of Bettany and Connelly. Act. <br /> <br /> Bright.
