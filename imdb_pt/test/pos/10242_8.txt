This is a story of a long and awkward love. The daily life of a 50-year-old woman and some people around her is portrayed. His daily life is so common and routine that I doubted who the real main character was at the beginning. So the public knows that the woman and a man who was her schoolmate had a very small connection. The woman has done the same job-a dairy woman and a supermarket kosher-for so long. There are so many slopes that delivering milk bottles is a very difficult job. The man married another woman, who is now dying of cancer. He works in the city hall and dedicates himself to her at home. They never look directly, nor talk to each other, but they never forget. <br /> <br /> The original Japanese title means "Sometime in the days when you read books". But of course when the man said, "Now I want to do what I always wanted to do," was to hug her and make love to her. She writes to a radio DJ that "If God gives us time to talk, we need at least a whole day." Dreaming about that day, she has sublimated the desire in hard work and reading books. I personally know a woman who has loved a man for many years, even after marrying another woman and dying from an accident. So the setting of the story is not so special. Instead, this film portrays novels not verbalized in many ordinary men and women. Through this movie, you will remember your long lost romance. This is a movie with lasting effect.
