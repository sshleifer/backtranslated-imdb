I first saw this movie by accident when I was visiting my uncle in Arizona about 3 1/2 years ago. The VHS print was a little faded, but I was very amazed by what I watched. Does all this make sense? Well, honestly, no, no. However, this is a movie that requires more than one preview to understand all its aspects. The wonderfully tragic score haunted me and the bizarre images made a quiet impression. Well, when I discovered that Anchor Bay had released this weirdness on DVD, I picked it up right away. I was very pleased with the transfer, although I feel the missing extras. Although the film concerns the characters of "O" and Sir Stephen, it really has nothing to do with Pauline Reage's original novel or with the 1974 film "The Story of O". However, the film pays attention to the artistic detail and symbolism of an almost mystical type. "O" decides to prostitute himself for Sir Stephen in violent Hong Kong from the 1920s. His mission is to prove his endless devotion and love for his master, giving his body to other men. Naturally, Sir Stephen likes to watch her during her unpleasant sexual adventures and even discovers a lover. However, the tables are transformed when "O" actually finds a kind of love with a young male admirer. Suddenly, Sir Stephen feels the threat ... <br /> <br /> I feel that the deep meaning behind the film (including the tragic track and artistic direction) really makes this film a classic. The viewer is presented not only to the lives and pasts of 'O' brothelmates, but also to the turbulence of the 1920s in Hong Kong. Like the political scene, all prostitutes need membership. No one is happy in the movie, even if they believe they are. (However, "O" finds a sense of happiness with his young admirer). A prostitute recalls with tears of how her father used to act like a dog when she was drunk, naturally leading to a fetish for having her clients acting like a dog. Another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress. She can not let this vision go. She treats her clients like co-stars and even swears that she hears a piano in the river. <br /> <br /> As for "O", she has a flashback about her father leaving her in a chalk circle. When he leaves, she feels a sense of abandonment. Of course, in that same flashback, Kinski becomes his father. I was very, very disturbed by this image. I really felt for "O" at this point in the movie. She almost never smiles and this scene really explains why. Her fear of abandonment is so great that she sees Sir Stephen as her father and meets all her obscene demands in the hope of proving her love. <br /> <br /> Another curious aspect of the film is the small child (who ages at the end) who sells his fortune in a box. It's a very random character, but somehow it just adds to the feeling of loss and emptiness in the movie. At one point, the director even uses cardboard figures painted to represent people. Now if this is not symbolism for you! (Laughter) <br /> <br /> All in all, I really love this movie. I feel it is a very deep experience and a little exciting. It has erotic scenes, but the scenes are not really meant to wake up. Like the lives of the characters, the sexual acts are empty. They are movements, but lack feeling and tenderness. (Again, the only tender scene is between "O" and the young). "O" believes that she is in love and that to bend down is an honor, however, she thinks in the end that she has choices. She can also be her own person and pursue her own happiness; however, she also has the option of remaining in that circle her father drew. The director leaves many questions unanswered, however, some things do not need answers. The viewer will make the judgment that works for them. <br /> <br /> I must say that I would like to see a special edition of this DVD released with comments from the director. I think it would be fascinating to hear his opinion about the film and its message years later. It's a shame that the soundtrack has never been released. This movie has a truly amazing score and heartbreaking. There's something about the lingering vocals that make a chill run down my spine. I can really feel the feeling of loneliness in the movie just by listening to the song.
