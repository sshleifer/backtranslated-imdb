Being an addict addicted to slasher means that it is very rare for me to have the chance to review many larger films with credible castings. In addition to the box office success of James Mangold, draw Identity; there has been no entry for big names since the Scream trilogy once again put Wes Craven's name back on the Hollywood map. Is that why Mark Malone's last stop? a mystery thriller with blatant connotations, immediately intrigued me. With a decent line-up, including Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow and an intriguing soundtrack that even finds space for Lynn Anderson's Rose Garden, I must admit that the early signs were very positive for this claustrophobic feature. As far as I know, there have only been three other slashers with snow, unless you consider Demon Possessed to fit into the category. The first slice and dice on the ice was Satan's blade, then came the Lisa Loring cheese party that was Blizzard of Blood and the nice Shredder followed about fourteen years later. During an extreme snowstorm, state trooper Jason (Adam Beach) struggles through the snow to reach a remote hut in the Colorado mountains. Your task is to inform the guests that the road is closed and they must stay for at least another night until a path can be cleared through the dangerous conditions. This news does not go down well with the suspicious flock, which includes two troublesome brothers (Callum Keith Rennie and Peter Flemming), a truck driver who really does not want to be around (William S. Taylor), a rude couple of lovers (Winston Rekert and Amy Adamson) and Jason's ex-girlfriend Nancy (Rose McGowan). The owners of the motel (Jurgen Prochnow and P. Lynn Johnson) are also not very enthusiastic about the news, but offer rooms for guests withdrawn and try to calm the tense situation. Things get worse when Jason finds a mutilated body and a bag full of money stolen in the snow behind the cafe. Just like a chapter from an Agatha Christie mystery, tenants begin to die at the hands of a masked assailant who seems intent on claiming money. With so many dishonest characters to choose and no way to leave the crime scene, does Jason have to try to stop the maniac before he kills again ?? <br /> <br /> A good mystery needs at least a handful of suspects who have a reliable motive, a remote location from which no one can escape, and a clever protagonist to help unravel the clues. Luckily The Last Stop provides each of these essential ingredients in a thriller that has its equal moments of brilliance and absolute stupidity. The film begins superbly when dubious personalities collide in a claustrophobic environment that manages to maintain high tension throughout the execution time. Malone keeps interest levels up as each character reveals their own reasons for attracting some of the suspicions, and to be fair, the essential change is not one you can easily guess. In fact, I saw myself watching the movie one more time to see if I could pick up any suggestions I missed the first time. Unfortunately, when the maniac is revealed as a psychopath who ironises like a bad guy in comics, The Last Stop loses enormous credibility. Fortunately not everything is lost when an unexpected and brilliantly orchestrated twist saves the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The similarities can be drawn with the excellent Identity, since the two plots are almost interchangeable. James Mangold's effort has to be the better of the two mainly due to the billing of John Cusack's stars and the ever-reliable Ray Liotta. With that said, Adam Beach does a good enough job in the lead, while Jurgen Prochnow, Amy Adamson and the brilliant Callum Keith Rennie add some reliable support. Rose McGowan acts convincingly in this role, as she probably does day by day, in fact, and Winston Rekert began fantastically before going completely overboard with the climax of the movie. If you are a diehard slasher fan who is watching this for some bloody murders then you will be disappointed. The psychopath wearing a balaclava only appears once and the rest of the murders are committed off-screen. But as I said earlier, Malone's directing talent means that suspense is never far from the boiling point and you can forgive the few flaws because the positives almost trump. <br /> <br /> The Last Stand is well worth slasher addicts and movie fans. Yes, there are a handful of negatives, but overall this is a solid example of emerging Hollywood talent. If you liked Identity then surely try this ??
