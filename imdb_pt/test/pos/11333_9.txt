How do you describe perfection? In-the-Mood-For-Love! Maggie Cheung and Tony Leong practically dance on screen and make starred performances that remain with you hours after you leave the theater. Each scene of the film resonates with the powerful combination of excellent cinematography and selection of footage, high-level acting and the sensual soundtrack. Nat King Cole singing in French absolutely sets the tone for the entire movie. Maggie and Tony look wonderful, with Maggie sneaking into some truly glorious cheongsams and Tony always looking with elegance. I've seen this movie several times, and every time I see it I find something new to celebrate. Love!
