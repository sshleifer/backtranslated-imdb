The great thing about Thirst, the latest movie from Chanwook Park, is that it's anti-Twilight. Some of you may take this as a negative sign, but in reality it is a great advantage. Park takes the method of vampirism seriously, and also the torrid love story between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflicts of both characters - Sang-hyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that, unbeknownst to him, turns him into a sickly but true blue vampire, and Tae-Joo with his mother and brother "idiot ", the latter is killed by Sang-like in a very strong melodrama. There is nothing terribly tearful or insipid about history and characters at any time, and the implications of religion from the outset (Sang, for example, is seen as a healer since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism, even when he it simply can not be that and knows it) on top of those about good versus evil, raise it on another plane cinematically. <br /> <br /> That Seat also rises to the incredible art pattern that Park has. displayed with Oldboy, Lady Vengeance and the underrated I'm a Cyborg, but that's OK, it should be taken as a given. Sede is a film with a succulent narrative and bizarre suburban characters, and is filmed and edited with an eye for a humor that is satirical part, romantic / erotic part, dramatic part and, finally, fantastic. And it does not always treat vampirsim as a simple horror movie montage (although, as a horror movie, Park has more than its share of scary scenes). It's more like the movie Near Dark that never mentioned the word vampire, but let you know it was, and treated with sincerity and a kind of lucid attention span, and that the disease itself and its effect on a person's existence is perhaps more frightening. than the murders or bloodshed. Once you see a vampire jumping up or healing your wounds, you've seen it all. <br /> <br /> Thirst also has a sense of humor, much like Oldboy, only here with a bite (intended pun) means emphasizing bizarre physical states of being. An example of this can be found with the Priest's predilection for sucking the blood of people in coma by taking his blood tube and sucking it into the ground. Or the way Tae-Joo clings to a piece of humanity keeping his mother alive even when she's had something like a stroke and can only blink her eyes and touch a finger as a means of responding to the bloodsuckers she brought pain and horror to your home. But those moments are like icing on the cake to make it a complete experience. What makes Headquarters the last thing on the mind is how elements come together from drama and existential pains from a sense of Surrealist-Bunuelian Catholicism (I particularly loved the dynamics between Sang-hyeon and the other priest who gives the arm to sugar blood but really wants to be a vampire too), and the erotic: the scenes in which the priest finally gives in to Tae-Joo are incredible in their pace and duration of shots and how real he is. Not in a pornographic way, but in the direction of the release and escape of these characters, which does not last very much in the scope of the story. <br /> <br /> If it's not as good as Oldboy, it's not something to fondle. Not all films directed by Chanwook Park will reach the stature of his masterpiece (and at least he will always be known as the man who directed the film). But Thrist is an excellent addition to his work, and to the serious series of vampire films in general. Film production is sharp and exciting and even dangerous (and in what white daylight room the characters live!), Humor is somber and hilarious, the acting is intense and moody - especially with subtle touches of Song Kang- . and the peculiar and perverse vulnerability of Kim OK-vin, and the ending, when it finally gets there, is one of those truly superb vampire movie endings that you've been talking about for years, in a good way. In a battle between Headquarters and Twilight, Headquarters takes the knock-out in the first round. Between letting the right in or nearly dark, it's harder to call. 9,5 / 10
