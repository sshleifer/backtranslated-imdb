When I went to the movies I did not expect much. I did not know anything about this movie, but it was the only movie I could see because I was in a small town. So I saw this movie and I was fascinated! "La stelle che non c'Ã¨" is a journey through the new industrial China and show this honestly! You see most of the ugly places in China, and you see what really happens with this new industrialization. The main characters are sad, but we expect people. He's the naive Italian guy who does not believe in what he sees. She is a translator from China who is missing her son. Sometimes sad, sometimes funny but always poetic! A wonderful film with wonderful actors! So, only one star is missing!
