Blade is a dark, somber but significant vampire movie, and is one of the best. A little blood, but nothing so bad. Wesley snipes played an important role when he eliminates vampires. I do not really like buffy because this is very tame, but Blade offers a decent storyline and is the kind of movie you'd probably like to watch on a dark and stormy night .... this is in the best view! <br /> <br /> 87%
