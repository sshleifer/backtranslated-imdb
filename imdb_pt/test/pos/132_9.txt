This film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply rooted in ritual and tradition. All this against the backdrop of an India that, in itself, struggles to break free of those same values. This film is both political and personal and is never very preacher or idealistic on any front. It is easy to see why the "fire" caused riots in India, but nonetheless, tragic. A true film like this deserves to be seen by all the people of the world, not just by privileged westerners.
