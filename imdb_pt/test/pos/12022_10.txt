When commenting on this movie, it should be realized that it is based on a real story and therefore should be reviewed as to the quality and accuracy of its description of events as well as its entertainment value. It may be implausible that Jack Shepherd surrenders twice to Jack Wild because Wild captured Edgeworth Bess. Nevertheless, it happened. It should also be noted that the director was young and inexperienced, which explains why he relied on tried and tested techniques. There were times when Clavell did not have the confidence to follow the script as written. The movie would be better if it had. And yes, I used to have a copy of the script (copy of Stanley Baker - one of five), which I recently returned to my father, Rafe Newhouse, the writer.
