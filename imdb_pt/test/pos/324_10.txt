Mani Sir, as usual, brings another incredible story with Kannathil Muthamittal. Such an incredible relationship between parents and children is brought in beautifully. Mani Lord, as usual, without many special effects and without many outdoor trials. (In fact, this was the only film he went to outside India. This was also done in Sri Lanka). to add the ARR song ... which is simply amazing ... Vellai Pookal is one of my most favorite songs ... Maddy, who is what he is in the film industry, also impressed a lot. Beginning from alaipayuthey, kannathil to ayutha ezuthu to guru .. Mani ratnam has shown the world what a versatile Maddy is. Simran was also very good. She has shown that she can also act in non-glamorous roles and character. In all an incredible movie. Sad that the Tamil public could not enjoy this movie gr8 and bombarded at the box office ....
