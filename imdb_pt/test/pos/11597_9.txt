If you go to the movies to have fun, have fun, so as to occupy your time, do not go out of your way to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If you go to the cinema to appreciate the depths of humanity, the feelings of real people, to explore the characterology of the personalities, if you go to the movies to absorb a magnificent photograph, do not forget to put this film very high on your list, preferably first. The experience is deeply gratifying, making the intelligent spectator make several reflections on the meaning of life itself. With 'Mar Adentro' Alejandro Amenábar overcame the best he has done to date, and even redeemed certain deviations in his previous films, which had a bit of being aimed at Hollywood. This is not the case with this visual poem put into music: Hollywood could never come close to the effect of this human and human story of inspired tingling. <br /> <br /> No way should I interpret 'Sea Inside'. as an apology for euthanasia; this story, based on the real life of the Galician fisherman Ramón Sampedro, is a cry from the bottom of the heart for life and love, a reach for human compassion, to understand the emotions. Sampedro was an intelligent and articulate man who, after a diving accident on the rocks of the Galician coast when he was young, was condemned to live in the next 27 years in bed. 'Condemned to live' (2001) (TV) was the first version of the life of this man about which I have already commented. However, Amenabar notably portrayed this man, with his enigmatic permanent smile and witty wit, in an equally articulate and intelligent manner. <br /> <br /> And Javier Bardem rose to the occasion, found the head-com challenge, complete with a Galician accent, producing an electrifying, engaging and captivating performance, in such a way that the actor and the fisherman merge into be the same person on the screen. Here, in fact, is an occasion to take off your cap and gently murmur 'chapeau'. Bardem is driven in his task by a magnificent cast, especially Belén Rueda, Lola Dueñas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo (Los Lunes al Sol) (qv) and Clara Segura, Galician and Catalan accents, playing an important role. Amenábar produces wonderful dialogues as these six revolve with each other, individually or in groups, with excellent chemistry, thus demonstrating that this young Spanish-born Chilean director is an artist who knows what it is and how to get his results; his overall concept of the film includes his own music, interspersed with pieces by Beethoven and Puccini on the turntables of Sampedro. <br /> <br /> Upon seeing 'Sea Inside', I met myself sometimes comparing him and this film to Stephen Daldry and his masterpiece 'The Hours' (qv). I refer to the way the dialogues work with tension and passion and that careful sense of time in each scene. <br /> <br /> The photography of Javier Aguirresarobe is superb as always. As I mentioned elsewhere in IMDb, he not only films events and scenes - he even captures the feelings and mood of the moment, cleverly capturing that look in his eyes, light and shadows, so that his work behind the camera is at the same time another player in the story. A great artist. <br /> <br /> Mar Adentro is another milestone in the history of Spanish cinematography, among the five or six best works of art produced in the last 25 years. This film stands next to cinematographic art as 'The South', 'Los Santos Inocentes', 'El Abuelo', 'La Lengua das Mariposas', 'Las Ratas' (qv), 'A Los Que Aman' (qv ), and I think I should add 'Te Doy Mis Ojos' (qv). <br /> <br /> Superbly orchestrated story of a real man, and those who loved him around his bedside: not to be missed.
