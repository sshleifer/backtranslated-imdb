Plunkett and Macleane is a wonderful upgrade from the braggart tradition, preceding Johny Depp and his pirate friends. The tone is cheerful, with a touch of social commentary, but nothing too heavy. You could almost see Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in that. <br /> <br /> It begins at a slow pace, with the introduction of the characters and the establishment of the themes of social inequality and rebellion; but it goes at high speed when the boys hit the roads. The assaults are grandiose and elegant, with romantic touches that are buckwheat butter bread. The actors are involved and help raise the material a bit, which is quite hollow. There is not much depth to the numbers, but they are played with such charm and skill that it does not matter. <br /> <br /> Muh has been said about modern music. The music of the period tended to the most serene, which seems out of place. A classical score with Celtic rhythms for the action pieces might work, but the more modern, rebellious rock and techno music seemed to add an edge to the action. Because the characters are more legendary than reality, accuracy in music seems futile. The pieces tend to fit the mood of the scenes in the air, so, most of the time works well. I just wonder how they lost Adam Ant's "Stand and Deliver." Make no mistake, this is not a serious movie. It is pure escapism and a wonderful lark. Tony Scott shows a little of his father's visual talent, but I do not think we'll see Oscar nods in his career yet. He seems to understand the material here and gets a good movie. Over time it can prove to be a name to tell. His father took time to mature beyond visual styling and become a more rounded director. This is definitely one to watch a fun night out or for a buck movie festival.
