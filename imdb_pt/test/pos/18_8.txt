"The Dresser" is perhaps the most refined of behind-the-scenes films. The film overflows with intelligence and spirit, largely as a result of Norman's "energetic" character (Tom Courtenay). Although his character is clearly gay, and certainly has an attraction for the main performer (Albert Finney) that he helps, the film never inhabits him or makes him more than he is. The brave style of Peter Yates, who worked so well on "Bullitt," is again on display and gives the film a sense of realism and consistency. This is much appreciated in a story that could easily become tedious. In the end, "The Dresser" will annoy a lot of people, but it will really be a delight for those who love British cinema. <br /> <br /> 7.7 out of 10
