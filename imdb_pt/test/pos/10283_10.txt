L'Appartement is, I think, a very purposeful Hitchcock film. The plot was filled with symbolism (that is, white and red roses) and twists in the story that fit perfectly. The look was very Parisian and brought you closer to the story. I saw it in London and I am very sorry that it is not in video in the states
