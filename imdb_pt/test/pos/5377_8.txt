I would probably say this went hand in hand with movies like "Devil's Rain" and that kind of movie, although that's probably a little better done. I love the horror of the 70's and this has most of the elements that make up other movies that I like so it was very easy to appreciate. A family on their holidays stumbles in a small town where people seem to be stuck in some kind of hysteria. It seems like the kids are disappearing. After an initial attempt to flee from this place, the family is somehow standing on the outskirts of town and finds their way back, but not without first finding a house where the children are gone and Mom and Dad are dead. It seems we have a different kind of distortion at a community center for the elderly in this city, they are all worshipers of Satan and they need the children to renew their lives so they can continue in their service, I think. Not that someone seems very interested in giving up their children for this venture. This is quite elegant, considering it is scary and scary, with no blood bullets or the surprising high events that try to make people jump into movies today that seem to have replaced real scares. We have Hank Kimball (Alvy Moore) from Green Acres, like Tobey, deputy sheriff who reads UFO magazines, and LQ Jones as the sheriff, and a very familiar actor as the father of the stranded family. And Strother Martin plays the doctor who seems to be doing double duty without the knowledge of his colleagues in the city. This is very good, but sometimes a bit confusing, but overall works very well and is recommended for horror fans of the 70s. 8 out of 10.
