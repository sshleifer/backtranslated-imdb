La Antena, an audacious film by Argentine director Esteban Sapir, is a reinvention of the silent film genre and a history of caution. The setting is a city dominated by senseless television, its people deprived of the power of speech, except for a solitary and mysterious screen presence known simply as The Voice. In an attempt to cement his hold on power, the marvelous duo of TV mogul Mr. TV and mad scientist Dr. Y set out to kidnap The Voice and turn his unique talent into his own cowardly ends. It is up to a young family and the nameless, voiceless son of The Voice to stop this evil scheme. The result is a roller coaster of a bewildering story on some occasions, but never less than captivating. <br /> <br /> This is a silent movie that uses many of its influences on its cover; explicit references to silent movie greats such as George Melies and Fritz Lang will be readily apparent to anyone with a passing acquaintance with their work. But more subtle references and symbolism are behind such tributes. I particularly like the fact that Mr. TV and his henchman drove in typical 1930s gangster cars, taken from the decade when the silent-film era died and a very different industry began to emerge. <br /> <br /> La Antena explores the clich√© devices of the plot and the excess of theatrical performance common to so many silent films, albeit in a very conscious and good-humored way. It's the amazing visual style of La Antena that really sets it apart from the films it pays homage. From the hypnotic TV logo to the menacing broadcast station at the top of the hill, this movie is filled with a dazzling visual inventiveness that rivals Studio Ghibli's animation? and all this using real actors and handmade sets. <br /> <br /> Moreover, although the style is often intentionally kitschy and theatrical, it is still a disturbing, provocative and emotional picture. The use of religious symbolism throughout La Antena brings additional resonance to the struggle between the Empire of TV and the power of declining words. At the same time, many of the most powerful images are original, including the hypnotic whirlwind of television sets and the nightmare of the TV food factory. <br /> <br /> I hate to end this criticism with a bitter note, but I feel that the English release of La Antena is disappointed by the subtitles. The original Spanish subtitles are used with great effect, with much playing with the words on the screen. However, the English subtitles that accompany the original dialogue are frustratingly incomplete, with omissions and errors sometimes leaving the viewer to put things together for themselves. La Antena is, however, an impressive piece of cinema; a visually breathtaking experience that displays great energy and humor while chronicling a powerful preventative tale.
