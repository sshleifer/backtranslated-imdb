"Death Wish 3" brings back Charles Bronson as a lookout time for Paul Kersey, now retired. Yes right. Before long, Kersey is back to his old habits. But this time, there are just a few burglars at a time, it's a gang. who took over a rundown part of the city (by the way, New York again) this time his war, so Kersy Throws the big guns (literally) for that. The count of bodies in your rival rhymes anything. Stallone or Schwarzenegger This movie is actually a little fun to watch, particularly for some liners and of course bandits die, or get seriously injured in creative ways, which is always a good thing. Violence is not so personal in that. one of them obviously on a much larger scale, like bombing their victims from afar, rather than one against one. This film is lighter than the first, making it easier to monitor. There is not much importance in this. film, it's more escapism than anything. It's also tacky at times and pseudo-inspiring, but the hose scenes do drop. they should have left the original "Desire of Death" on their own, without sequels, but since they did not, they should have stopped here. 8/10
