"Admissions" is a great drama, although there are some issues with the ending. Lauren Ambrose plays Evie who is trying to avoid college. To make her mother overworked not realize, she invents poems that everyone thinks her sister with mental problems wrote. All acting is top notch, especially Lauren Ambrose and Amy Madigan. Both did great performances. The climax is also very powerful. There are only two bad parts. The first is the character of Stewart Worthy played by Christopher Lloyd. Your part is underdeveloped. The other weakness is the end. He walks in circles, which I did not expect with the run time of 84 min. Also, the movie is worth watching.
