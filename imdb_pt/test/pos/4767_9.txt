It is now clear that the true golden age of American cinema was from the mid-1960s until just before the launch of Star Wars. Before that, there was a lot of pope restricted to the Hays Code. With Star Wars, the green light went on for most movies to target kids and idiots, a practice that continues today. SEVEN-UPS, truth be told, contains some banal lines of dialogue - "We can do it the easy way, or we can do it the hard way" is one - but I'm doomed if I can find anything more wrong with that . (In fact, this line may not have been obsolete when the film was made.) THE SEVEN-UPS demonstrates everything that was right with the best films of the Golden Age: sparse dialogue, realistic acting, real-life locations (winter in a movie dirty) New York never looked better / worse), propulsive stories and, yes, the best chase of cars ever filmed. Bill Hickman is the driver Scheider is chasing (you'll recognize him from Bullitt), and the chase structure is a lot like McQueen's, but I prefer Scheider's facial intensity here, the rhythm, the great close-ups of school. and the destructive conclusion. (That VW bug that walks at about 2 mph always bothers me in Bullitt's pursuit.) A loud, glaring Don Ellis score sets the perfect mood. THE SEVEN UPS: Dark, dark, action-oriented, adult. This is a movie that could not be done today; there is no "trick" for the children or absurd end. Thank you, Philip D'Antoni, Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco: while the police films are watched, THE SEVEN-UPS and its brothers of the 1970s (for example, THE FRANCHISE CONNECTION) will set the standard.
