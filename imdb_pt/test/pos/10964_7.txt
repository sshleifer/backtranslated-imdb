In many ways, the cinematic career of independent film legend John Cassavetes is the opposite of someone like Alfred Hitchcock, the consummate studio director. Where Hitchcock treated his actors as cattle, Cassavetes sought to work with them improvisedly. Where every element of a Hitchcock picture is immaculately composed, Cassavetes cared less about how a scene was figuratively composed than how it felt, or what it transmitted, emotionally. Hitchcock's tales were always narratives in the foreground, with the human element being placed in the background. Cassavetes put human experience first in all his films. If some things did not make much sense logically, so be it. <br /> <br /> You can see this from your first movie, Shadows of 1959, filmed with a 16mm handheld camera, on a shoe string budget. of about $ 40,000, in Manhattan, with the company repertoire of studios of acting of Cassavetes, and presented like a film of impromptu. The story is rather simple as it follows the lives of three Manhattanites-Benny brothers (Ben Carruthers) - a trumpeter and countless, Hugh (Hugh Hurd) - a washed singer, and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) - the younger sister of both . The three main arcs in the film deal with Hugh's failures as a nightclub singer and his friendship with his manager Rupert (Rupert Crosse); The wanderings of Benny in Manhattan, with his two friends countless; and Lelia's love life - first with a white boy Tony (Anthony Ray), who does not notice Lelia's fair-skinned race, even after lying down with her; then with Davey Jones, rigid and appropriate, who can be a misogynist. In the first bow, nothing happens, except Hugh, dark-skinned, who pontificates as he feels degraded by singing. in low-class nightclubs and opening shows for female acts. He dreams of succeeding in New York, or even in Paris, but it can be said that he is the kind of man who will continue to delude himself with his skimpy ability, for the only time we actually hear him sing, he shows that he is a marginal talent at best. That Rupert continues to encourage him gives us glimpses of how destructive friendships work. But this is the least important of the three bows. Although this film is better than, say, Martin Scorsese's first film, a decade later, another tale of failed romance and frustrated New Yorkers, it has none of the bright moments - neither wise nor cinematically. - This movie has it. Nor is it naturalistic, for naturalism in art is a very difficult thing to achieve, especially in the movies, although the Manhattan exteriors of the 1950s at ground level are a gem to be revived. While Shadows may, in fact, be an important movie regarding the history of the independent film circuit, it certainly is not even close to a great movie. Parts of it are misinterpreted, poorly executed, the scenes end at random, almost like blackout sketches, and sometimes are cut off apparently in the middle. All in all it's a very sloppy job - especially the atrocious jazz track that is often not synchronized with the rest of the film, since Cassavetes proved that as a director, at least in his first film, he was a good actor. The only reason for anyone to see Shadows is because Cassavetes has finally gotten better with later movies, and this gives a clue about his later work style. <br /> <br /> The National Film Registry has rightly stated that this film deserves to be preserved. as "culturally significant". All this is in keeping with the creed of art that Cassavetes defended long ago, as typified by this quote: "I have never seen a helicopter exploding. I've never seen anyone go and blow someone's head off. So why should I make movies about them? But I've seen people shattering themselves in the smallest way. I've seen people withdraw. I saw people hide behind political ideas, behind the drug, behind the sexual revolution, behind fascism, behind hypocrisy, and I did all those things myself. So I can understand them. What we're saying is so sweet. That's kind of you. We have problems, terrible problems, but our problems are human problems. That this film is "culturally significant" is true, but this truth is not synonymous with being "artistically significant." It is in the difference between these two definitions that great art really thrives.
