This game is very good for n64. You can skateboard like Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska and maybe a few other skaters. The game does not have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Well, anyway, the gameplay is incredible. Level II of the school is a great level with so much to skate. In Career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores and various other things in 2 minutes. There's a skateboarder, which is pretty cool. I created a skater named Butt Mulligan, a black guy with an afro, and a girl. There's the park editor, some cool pre-made parks, free skate, and there's a single session where you skate for 2 minutes and get a score. You can watch replays, which is always cool. Each skateboarder has 2 styles: A and B. The graphics are not that good. Well, they're good for a n64 game. I would like to have a control package in order to save my data. Overall, this game is awesome. I give an 8/10 to n64. But with the GBA version, it's just as fun as the n64 version, but a bit hard to control. I give a 7/10 to GBA. So go to a place that still sells n64 games and get a copy. There are also versions for the PS1.
