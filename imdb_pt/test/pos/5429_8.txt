If you are going to see this movie, by all means do not enter this movie with the expectation of this movie will be absolutely hilarious because you will be disappointed. Yes, of course it's funny at times, but I would consider it a political thriller disguised as a comedy. The performances are very good, especially by Jeff Goldblum as head of the voting company. even though it has limited screen time, it makes a lasting impression. Of course robin williams is excellent.laura linney is very good also what a surprise. she is one of the best actresses in Hollywood and one scene in particular shows this. This movie makes you think. What if a comedian ran for president and actually won? would the country be better or would the country shatter in a million pieces?
