It's a horror story, fine. But maybe not how you know it. The real monsters in this movie are human. While the monsters are human and prey. Strange as it may sound, I see it as "Monsters Inc" for fans of horror movies. Of course, the effects are from a horror movie, the monsters are there as in any monster-based movie, Gore is there too, there's even a slasher in the form of Dr. Decker (played by David Cronenberg; I see Cillian Murphy's flash as Dr. Jonathan Crane in Batman Begins here - or is it the other way around?). And it's Decker & c who are the bad guys. The monsters mainly want to take care of their own business, pushing away the more or less mistaken intruding humans, wanting to join society. <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie, you're really going to like the little monsters (and the dog) - maybe not what you expected from the first scenes ...
