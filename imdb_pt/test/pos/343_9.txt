Sri Lanka ... it's not a country I've thought about much, I have to admit. I did not even know it was close to India, much less that there had been a bloody civil war going on since 1983. It seems the rebels of the Tamil minority were in conflict with the military regime that rules the country. for many years, causing many deaths and widespread sufferings on the island. Mani Ratman's latest film, PECK ON THE CHEEK, tells the story of a young woman named Amudha, who is separated from her Sri Lanka. parents by war and raised by a young Indian couple. Amudha is a bright and mischievous girl whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her she was adopted as a child. Although her adoptive parents love her as much as possible, and have raised her unprejudiced along with her biological children, Amudha can not help but want to learn more about her biological family. <br /> Mani Ratman is probably best known for his 1998 film DIL SE, which hides a story about terrorism and politics within a love story (or is it the other way around?). A PECK ON THE CHEEK inhabits a similar territory, but perhaps is more ambitious in the terrain it covers. The central theme that links the film is love between all the various members of a family and especially between a child and his adoptive parents. It is a fairly honest and open look at the feelings, which can be extremely touching and comforting at some times and quite painful for others. It's an emotionally complex film, with characters that are a bit idealized but still behave in a very human way. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around 9-year-old Amudha, played with charm and vivacity by the young actress P.S. Keerthana in her first and only acting role. She is a princess and a monster, always getting into trouble, but so charmingly no one can get mad at her for long. The young actress is perfectly chosen for the part and does a tremendous work in the several and often difficult emotional scenes demanded of her. <br /> <br /> A PECK ON CHEEK has such an innocent name that I was not prepared for the intensity of the experience. Never such a small act has such a great emotional impact that I dare say. The film is a bold and artistic endeavor to explore issues that are not often addressed on the silver screen. <br /> <br /> The direction of Mani Ratman is superb, very confident and mature - the most sophisticated work I have ever seen director yet. The film is visually very stylish, with excellent camera work and pictures. A.R. Rahman provides the film's soundtrack, which is not as good as his classic DIL SE or BOMBAY (based on first impressions, at least), but still shows his great musical talent. <br /> <br /> I am not aware of DVD release for the movie yet - I saw in Tamil with English subtitles thanks to the San Francisco International Film Festival, of which the film was undoubtedly the highlight. The production is a truly world-class endeavor, and I'm sure it will be popular with the western audience, as it begins to receive a wider exposure. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
