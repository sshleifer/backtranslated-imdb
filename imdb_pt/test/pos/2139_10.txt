I watched the longer version and could not take my eyes off the screen. It was 219 minutes, and yet it seemed that only an hour had passed. the characters were very believable and entertaining, and the photograph was excellent. The story pulled me and caught my attention. I will definitely watch this again and again. this true telling story is better ... not Hollywoods usual cheap thrills and skin shine. I've seen a lot of comments about this movie. most seem to cover up the film or give a slight compliment. basically, it's a great movie that received unfair criticism. observe for yourself with an open mind. if you like westerns, historical pieces of the period, although historically inaccurate, you will enjoy the film. Great !!! 10/10
