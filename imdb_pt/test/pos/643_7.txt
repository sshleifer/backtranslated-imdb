This may be the most stressful movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's so stressful, I have not been able to watch again after seeing it two years ago, but I've been going since I got the DVD. There were a couple of scenes here that are almost too much to watch .... so if you have problems and need to "escape" for an hour and a half this movie will get your mind off of something else. <br /> <br /> Russian actress Marina Zudina did a super job on facial expressions alone, which she had to do, since her character here is dumb. She plays a cute and healthy makeup artist for a despicable filmmaker. After the day's shooting is done and "Billie" is about to leave, she hears something. She takes a look in the room where they were filming and discovers that they are now filming a "snuff film" and killing someone. Billie's listening is discovered and she runs for her life as the killers search for her in this large warehouse-like building. <br /> <br /> There are two extended scenes in which our heroine is running for her life and both of them will wear you down. The first one I described above. The second scene, the climax, lasts a long time and is not as well made as the first. In fact, the movie should have been cut a little, but overall, since it's so good at keeping our attention, it served its purpose as entertainment.
