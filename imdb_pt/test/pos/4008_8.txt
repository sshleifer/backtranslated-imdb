I watch the show every day and it's a lot of fun. It provides technology news updates, virtually everything geek video games. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, gamers or anything really, you will enjoy this show. They definitely increased their game since the guy below me (2006). It's the only place where I get my technical information. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments regarding things in the game, film, comics ... Universe. If you know these universes, you will understand the jokes. To shorten the story, aots is a hilarious show that gives me and all the news about anything and everything that you like. I'm watching now, as I type this, they're 'in' San Diego covering the red air races. Candy.
