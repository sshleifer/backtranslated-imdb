There is no denying that this is a bad movie. The acting is not great, in the same way as the script, acting and direction. Still, I can not wait until the release of Anchor Bay's 23/2/99 video. Everyone knows there are lots of bad movies out there that have a tremendous appeal to them. This is at the top of my list.
