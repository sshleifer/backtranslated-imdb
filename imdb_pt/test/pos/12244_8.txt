I loved this movie the first time I saw it. He gives details of what executives involved in the news industry will do to bring a story to the air: notably Jane Craig rushing Kenny to finish editing the play to get her out, and then Joan Cusack struggling to get it, and William Hurt , who according to Jane commits an incredible breach of ethics, feigns her tears during her rape interview, a flaw pointed by Aaron. Another highlight is when Tom uses Jane for his own benefit, and then turns around and sleeps with Jennifer. The script is brilliant and the direction is almost as good. All three main actors have been great in the portraits of their characters, especially Holly Hunter, and Albert Brooks, who is the most funny of the film. William Hurt is also very good. It earned at least three Oscars, best actress (holly hunter), best supporting actor (Albert Brooks) and best film. I liked the last parts of the film, where they meet again 7 years later. <br /> <br /> 8/10
