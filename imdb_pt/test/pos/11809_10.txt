*** Contains spoilers *** A beautiful film starring Brad Renfro and the always wonderful Joseph Mazzello. I like Joseph Mazzello, of all his films I've seen so far I've loved each of them for many different reasons and The Cure is no different. Brad Renfro does very well in this movie as well. The Cure is a drama / ripeness movie from the point of view of a sick child and his friend. <br /> <br /> The basic idea is: Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) has AIDS. He ends up making friends with the boy next door (Brad Renfro), but Erik's mother is very narrow-minded, ill-informed and a little "thick" when it comes to Dexter's illness. She thinks AIDS is contagious like the common cold, so she does not want her son to get close to Dexter. <br /> <br /> After many attempts to make their own cure without success, the boys go to New Orleans. to find healing after reading a pamphlet on this. After receiving his kicks from Playboy magazine, Dexter's health goes south shortly thereafter, and as his health deteriorates, there is still enough life in the boy next to Erik for two pretense jokes to stop breathing. Sadly, poor Dexter actually dies of his illness, leaving poor Erik behind to wonder why he did not find the cure. Throughout the film he ends up joining Dexter's mother more than his own. <br /> <br /> It's a very exciting movie to watch and it's not absolutely perfect (movies rarely are) but you will not mind this as you get more involved in the movie. A must for fans of Joseph Mazzello, one of his best performances ever. Very well recommended film not to be missed - if you can find a copy :)
