OK, so I'll admit that it often seems like most of Sylvester / Tweety's pairs have exactly the same plot: Sylvester tries to catch Tweety, but fails repeatedly and always gets mutilated in the process, usually with the help of a bulldog. I think it's as if Wile E. Coyote was chasing the Road Runner (in other words, mammals should never go after the birds). "A whole Bir-r-r-rd" has the same plot and puts it on a train. In a way, the best part of these cartoons is to see what kind of schemes Sylvester creates to try to go after Tweety. We know he'll fail miserably, but it's also funny to see Tweety turn into an idiot. (If you saw his cartoons at first, you'll see that he was not "cute," but actually had a cruel trait.) This one mainly works as a way to pass the time. <br /> <br /> By the way, I thought I saw - I mean, I tensed I taw - Sylvester passed a piece of luggage with the name Friz Freleng on it.
