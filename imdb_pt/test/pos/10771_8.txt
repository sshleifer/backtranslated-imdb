Sonny Chiba, as everyone knows, is the man. In this film, he plays Mas Oyama (1923-1994), a true martial artist who fought over 50 bulls with his own hands - and won (interesting guy, look at him). Anyway, Chiba only kills a bull in the movie, but it's a memorable scene and as the notes say, up there with the zombie vs. Sharks in Zombie! The film also offers a lot of melee combat and a decent storyline, though I do not believe all of this is true. This film is the first of the Oyama trilogy made by Chiba and is recommended for martial arts fans. Finally, three little crap; part of the opening theme was used in Kill Bill Volume 1, Oyama himself appears in the opening sequences, and that's because he trained Chiba in real life for five years!
