I'm a fan of Jeff Bridges, so I recorded this on DVD without having seen it previously. I immediately became a Kevin Spacey fan, too. The general plot of "alien in the human body" was, in my experience, done to the death, but I liked the approach adopted in K-PAX, which seemed to me quite different and much more sensitive than most. Bridges makes an excellent doctor (you * want * to tell him what's on your mind) and Spacey's expressions and gestures are perfect on paper. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Prot and the fully human characters in the clinic is delightful, particularly the subtle manipulation of his behavior. <br /> <br /> The ending is bittersweet - I like Prot's choice, but the final scenes (with Bridges) made me cry.
