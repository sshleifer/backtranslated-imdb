Aunt Cora has always been tactless, and her well-born family ignored the remark she made after her brother Richard's funeral: "He was murdered, was not he?" They remembered the next day when Cora was brutally murdered with an ax ... For some reason, this year's POIROT movies have been far from faithful to the original book. I was disappointed by the changes made in CARDS ON THE TABLE - my favorite book by Poirot. AFTER THE FUNERAL is my second favorite book of Poirot, and I was afraid that the story would be destroyed. It was not! The film was almost true to page by page, even to the killer's motive! All the actors have been wonderful, but my favorite has to be Monica Dolan, who does a great performance as Miss. Gilchrist, the companion of the late Aunt Cora. Without a doubt the best Poirot film of all time!
