I absolutely loved this movie as a kid. I can not find anywhere! I was mentioning this to some friends the other day, and none of them remember that! Can someone help me? My older sister vaguely remembers that. There was also another movie that I remember that was half live action and half animation, but I can not remember his name. The characters were animated and the background was real ... It seems like I remember being a kangaroo, and I think the scenery of the movie was in Australia. I'm going crazy trying to get copies of these movies that were a memorable part of my very nice childhood. Edit: I searched IMDb for this other movie and found out it's called Dot and the Kangaroo! All I had to do was type "kangaroo" into the character search bar, and the name of the movie on the list was like a bell ringing! MAN, I love IMDb! Thank you!
