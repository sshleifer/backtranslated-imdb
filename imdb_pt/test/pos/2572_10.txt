I suppose this is what is called Southern Gothic. <br /> <br /> It stars Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci, and also Justin Timberlake is featured in a role. Timberlake does a good job, to my surprise, I did not expect this from him. <br /> <br /> When you're lost and can not find your way home - that's the moaning of the black snake. The people in this movie are definitely lost in many ways, psychologically and emotionally damaged, betrayed by those they trusted and loved and filled with a lot of pain. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson plays a blues singer / musician whose wife played with his brother and now abandoned him for his brother along with the abortion of a son he hoped to have with her. <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci's character is a woman who was sexually abused as a young woman - this turned her into a self-destructive nymphomaniac; allowing men to treat her poorly. <br /> <br /> History is at the intersection of these two-character lives. It's a love story, but not a sexual love story between them - the older black man and the young white woman. <br /> <br /> It's different from most Hollywood movies. <br /> I strongly recommend. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
