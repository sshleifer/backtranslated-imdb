He plays as his usual teenage audience T & A movie, but the feeling is unbelievably bleak. If it were made today, it would be considered an art film. He goes through the usual routine of a guy trying to get laid, but the results of his efforts are hard, cruel and unsatisfying. <br /> <br /> The whole formula of the adolescent film is adopted, but nothing happens. you'd expect. Imagine a version of the director of 'It's a Wonderful Life', where, in the end, James Stewart could not return to the real world. An incredible movie that subverts all expectations of the genre. It makes you feel dirty afterwards: there is no redemption for the characters. I'm surprised it's ever been done. The 80's version of Detective Story.
