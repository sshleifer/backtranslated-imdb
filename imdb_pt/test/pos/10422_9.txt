Wow, I'm sure I saw a bit of Kelli McCarty this summer. I did not realize that this woman has made so many softcore movies in the last three years. It's like seeing a future softcore star in front of me, much like what Michelle Hall did a few years ago. "Passion's Peak" is the third quality film in which I've seen Kelli McCarty, with "Girl for Girl" and "House of Love" being the others. "Desire and Deception" was fine, but it was not spectacular. There are spoilers in this review so just read it if you want. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Christina (Kelli McCarty) coming out of the big city and into the mountains. She inherited a home from her beloved grandmother and plans to turn it into a mountain chalet. Before she can even figure out her stuff, a woman named Kim (uncredited in this movie, but quite aggressive) begins to reserve the guests to stay there. Now she has to clean the house quickly - comes Chip (Bobby Johnston), a childhood friend, to the rescue. Chip helps you tidy up the house in viable conditions. She hires two local prostitutes to work at her store - Chip's sister, Bait (Samantha McConnell) and her sexual partner, Hank. <br /> <br /> Now the guests begin to come. The first to arrive are Eric and Linda (Flor), two stereotyped cash lawyers. Linda and Eric get involved in a big argument during a dinner in the middle of the movie that leads to the breakup; Sad things there. Then there is the novelist Sophia, played by the goddess of the film B Monique Parent. She's wearing that silly alias Scarlet Johansing again, and she has a very professional look this time - with blond hair, of course. It would not be Monique if she did not have at least one scene in which she touches herself - and she obliges, during one of the sex scenes of Eric and Linda. <br /> <br /> James and Shene (Devinn Lane) - Yes, the porn actress Devinn Lane) shows up for a little weekend getaway as well. Without the knowledge of Shene, James and Christina have enough history. James and Christina used to date, but Christina left for the mountain cabin. James comes to the cottage to bring Christina back, but his plan backfires. Christina pours the beans to Shene, which causes Shene to walk over him and down to the local pub to undress for the locals. Shene ends up in the now single Eric's sleeping bag, and they go out together. Bait realizes that she wants something more than sex with Hank, and Christine finds true love with Chip, with Sophia dipping it all down and writing in her next novel. <br /> <br /> In fact ... if you ask me, this whole movie unfolded like a novel. I do not know if the screenwriter was going to that effect, but I'm sure I get that impression. Sophia had some of the best lines in this movie, showing the idea that this is a live action novel. She seems to enjoy all the fighting and stabbing that are happening. <br /> <br /> Now, for sex. There was a fair amount of it, and it was the usual collision and grinding. Monique made her fair share of groans in her two sex scenes. This movie was noteworthy, and the story will really keep the audience a little interested in the sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Monique was simply Monique.) Of all the softcore actresses I've seen in years, she's the best at acting, in my opinion, she can really act and be sexy, and it's that's why she's holding # 1 on my Skinemax Top 10. Kelli McCarty is better at making softcore movies than in the novel "Passions," I do not know why she's not doing it anymore. mostly background in a limited role.Samantha McConnell continues to impress me, and Devinn Lane is more a crossroad of hardcore actresses to the softcore realm and doing a decent job in the middle of it.) <br /> <br /> Sex : B (It was good but not spectacular inspiring.Many groans.Don't watch the movie R-rated version, trust me .... most good things are taken.My note is for the uncut version.) /> <br /> Story: B (A solid story ich launches into an invented "Ooh, the building inspector will close us" subtra towards the end that messes things up. The underlying story between Christina and James was good, and Sophia's dialogue, full of metaphors and images usually found in novels, was a nice touch.) General: B + (I found this movie as It's a lot of fun, not a Hall-of-Famer like "Girl for Girl", but it's a respectable addition to the Skinemax collection.
