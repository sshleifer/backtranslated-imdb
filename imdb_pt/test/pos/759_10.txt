I had to get this movie, since it did not get where I live. I waited patiently and it was worth the wait. I totally fell in love with this movie. The chemistry between Walters and Grint you could see, since they also worked together on the Harry Potter films. The woman who plays her fair and authoritative mother really convinced me all right and how hypocritical she is, I think she did a great job playing the part. I just wish we could have seen the sex scene or more of it. LOL, but of course we just have to use our imagination on how it happened. (laughs) I thought the movie was worth waiting for and if you want a good movie to watch. Rent this movie. I have to say that Rupert really did a great job and it's nice to see that he's making movies out of Harry Potter, even though I totally love him like Ron Weasley. The whole cast did a great job and I hope Rupert continues to act out of Harry Potter to expand his ability!
