Scintillating documentary about how a small group of idealistic youths used music, art and dance to unify and heal the community of Vig√°rio Geral, one of the most violent neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro (favela), offering its youth community an alternative the lethal world of drug traffickers. <br /> <br /> In his film debut, Zimbalist and Mochary have created a film that is breathtaking because it works on many different levels. As a social document, it provides the facts we need to know to have a context for understanding the meaning of the particular story told here. The story itself is well developed, with a strong narrative arc and, by additional measure, is recorded with great anticipation. There is a central, charismatic and sweeping protagonist, Anderson Sa: he is an experienced, articulate, courageous, spiritually evolved natural leader, a talented interpreter, a visionary who accompanies his talk. <br /> <br /> There is also lots of music and dancing to entertain. Are there talking heads? mainly Sa and his closest associate, Jose Junior - but they are presented with cinematic imaginative brightness. The editing mixes well footage of different themes, punctuated only occasionally by some static texts full of facts. The rhythm is as lively as the music. You can do it in 78 minutes. <br /> <br /> The Afro Reggae Group, the neighborhood social club that Anderson, Junior and a few others formed in 1993, use music and dance as weapons to deal with traffickers. and the dubious police. They teach percussion skills to any child who wants to attend a class along with dance, martial arts, a community journal. The only requirement for children to belong is not to smoke, not to drink, without drugs. There is a soft and subtle spiritual selling fabric that runs through the movement, loosely based on the Hindu god Shiva, the destroyer of old habits. <br /> <br /> Jeff Zimbalist, who was also the principal director of photography and editor, is Student of Culture and Modern Media at Brown University. He polished his skills by editing feature-length documentaries for PBS and others, and teaches film at the New York Film Academy and elsewhere. Matt Mochary, as Andrew Jarecki ("Capturing the Friedmans") made a few years ago, recently came to film the business world. Zimbalist and Mochary together won Best New Filmmaker Award in 2005 The TribBeCa Film Festival and "Favela Rising" were tied for the best film of the year in awards made in 2005 by the International Documentary Association. I could go to pages about Afro Reggae, Sa and this movie. A much better idea is simply for you to go see! My note: A 10/10
