After seeing Undisputed 2, I knew what to expect from Isaac Florentine. <br /> <br /> Shepherd: Border Patrol is a decent movie (not the best of Van Damme, but definitely not the worst.) The supporting cast of the RV, but it makes sense. <br /> <br /> The plot and plot have been made before, so it's nothing new. I mean this is Van Damme. Do not we expect too much of an incredible plot? So let's talk about what we all want to watch this movie anyway: the fighting. <br /> <br /> Without revealing anything, I thought the way the fights were filmed and filmed was well done, much better than some of the recent VD movies, such as Second in Command, in which the whole final fight it's HORRIBLE. With Florentine behind the camera, and if you've seen Undisputed 2, he seems to know how to shoot fights and enjoy. Some of the fights in The Shepherd reminded me of the older things of VD, which is what we all want to see. The fights were good, and I said "hah, awesome" out loud a few times. But I was just waiting a little longer considering how good I thought the Undisputed 2 was. <br /> <br /> Something I found intriguing was the daughter of VD in the movie, I thought "Wow, she's kind of hot." his Bianca Van Varenberg, the daughter of JC's real life. I've never seen her before so this was a nice treat. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is not at all bad. Yes, the story was made before, but at least JC was trying to make a good movie. Next time, add more melee bouts! I think he still has what it takes to make another big budget movie ... his acting has improved since he's doing DTV and he's really in great shape at 47. I do not know about you but I'm one of the those who think that most of their DTVs are really good, other than Derailed. All he needs to do is go back to the form of "bloodsport" and make a martial arts movie ... and I think people would respond well even if he is not jet Li. This movie is definitely worth the rent. =)
