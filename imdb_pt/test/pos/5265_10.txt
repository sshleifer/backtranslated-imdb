As a senior writing instructor at Richland College in Dallas and a former MGM screenwriter in the days of decent movies, I'm very happy to have accidentally clicked on Channel 33 in Dallas tonight and watched this charming movie in which Betty White is CUTE and makes A longing for the good old days of really good movies before Hollywood starts to debate all this crap for teenagers. If a producer is listening, I'd like to say that there are people over 60 who will pay a buck to see a movie that has no guns, no killing, no special effects, no sex and violence, and just a good tale of relationships which leaves you with a good and warm feeling, as this movie did for me.
