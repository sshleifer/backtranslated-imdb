When Pinky, a qualified electrician, is released from prison, his probation officer found him working on a large city bank. When some of the criminal underworld from their past learns from their position, they plan to exploit it and steal the bank. Pinky is horrified at first because he really wants to go straight, but when a turnaround of fate happens, Pinky begins to think that one should not look a present in the mouth. <br /> <br /> Also known as The Mayfair Bank. Caper {among others!}, This is an extremely nice piece that is par excellence 1970s. London and all its highly dubious forms are lit up like a Christmas tree in Ralph Thomas and the cunning of Guy Elmes. If the viewer can accept David Niven as an elderly crime lord of some difficulty (not easy I can tell), then A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square may surprise you. The actors are not pulling trees, for sure, but it really is not harming the image, it has a fun and honest quality that is never less than entertainment. The soundtrack and soundtrack may be blamed for overjoyed during the dramatic criminal moments, but it's a minor complaint to let me think that this is a British gem seen below. Richard Jordan takes on the lead role of Pinky (obviously hoping to attract American viewers), the pulsating heart of the '70s, Oliver Tobias (a mass of hairs) is there to keep the women interested while the subjects get the pleasant sight quite a decent clip and containing a seriously satisfying ending, The Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square deserves far better than the insignificant 5.7 rating here on IMDb, but how many people have seen this I ask? hmm, go ahead, if you get the chance, it's a good thing 7/10
