Reader's Digest is worth watching. Or Time, if it was the original source of the article that served as a supposed inspiration to Mani Ratnam to make this masterpiece. Based on a true story of an adoptive girl who goes in search of her biological parents, Ratnam paints a classic that rebounds as much as it rebukes, cherishes as much as it rebukes and preaches as much as it practices. <br /> <br /> Where does one start? The ominous melancholy that precedes the recent struggle in northern Sri Lanka? The chaotic family of a family led by an engineer-author and three adorably disobedient children? Or that dark region where reality crosses the point of providing a comfortable existence and becomes a monster of unbelieving and sinister events and ideologies? Whatever the way you look, this movie is worth being in your collection, if you like the irresistible dramas of Mani Ratnam. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ratnam is a master of the past in blending fiction tales into real-life incidents and in this film he exudes class in adapting two real-life stories into one. I will not go into the story because it is better to see than to read. But what I am going to dwell on the impact it has had on me and why, despite all the war that takes place in this world, it can not destroy that simple but inexhaustible force called hope. <br /> <br /> Innocence, in its purity, can not comprehend the complex desires of adult decay and greed. Nor does he recognize the dangers when he is accompanied by the fierce determination to seek what he wants. It is an innocence of this nature that leads Amudha to seek out her biological parents, despite warnings that they might get lost in the cauldron of civil war. Having survived a terrifying experience of talking to a physically disabled man only to realize that he is a more lethal entity in disguise, Amudha sticks to his cause in a way that overcomes the resistance of his sympathizers. And finally, when the two meet, mother and daughter, the meeting is so tense with emotion that even the moody adoptive parent is reduced to tears. Aided by an A R Rahman background soundtrack, the following scene is poignant to melt even the fiercest hearts: a list of questions Amudha must ask her birth mother. In a culmination as dramatic as the sequence of incidents leading to it, a child discovers his mother, alive in the body, but lost in spirit. With the overwhelming realization that she has no hope of being with the one who gave her, Amudha does with her adoptive mother what the title of this film means: a kiss on the cheek. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, trail is clearly marked by the brilliant PS Keerthana. Ratnam has the gift of extracting spectacular spectacles from little-known children's artists, but this should not take anything away from Keerthana for an award-winning performance. With a talented supporting cast of Madhavan (Thiru), Simran (Indira) and the stupendous Nandita Das (Shyama), she embellishes the scenes in almost every frame she is in. The song may not be as memorable as Rahman's other offerings, but it still did not stop him from winning another National Award for best musical direction. "Vellai Pookal" is as much an ode to the need to take care of human life as of nature. The dialogues are first class (show the touching exchange that Amudha and Indira have in swing, shortly after the revelation that she is not the biological daughter of Indira) and cinematography, superb. <br /> <br /> This film of course statement to drop your arms as much as respecting life and human expressions. Do not judge it as a movie lesson; you will just miss out on experiencing one of Mani Ratnam's best-stable R Aman Rahman.
