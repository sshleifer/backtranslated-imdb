I really liked this made for the TV movie. I was surfing on the channel and I came across the beginning of the movie. Boy, I'm glad I stopped. This movie has a warm cast as well as a semi-believable plot. There is drama, comedy, action and best of all, the human nature aspect of this movie is what makes it great. I hope you get on Video, because I'm going to buy a copy. Rating ... 9 out of 10 stars
