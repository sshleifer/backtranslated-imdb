I stopped watching "The West Wing" after Aaron Sorkin stopped writing and producing. It just was not the same. Imagine my excitement at watching a movie he wrote again. Already a long time ago - The American President, A Few Good Men. His script was a beautiful blend of humor and tragedy. He made a convincing story and made me cry at the same time. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was amazing as a small Texas congressman whose voters just wanted lower taxes and keep their guns. It's not a difficult job, so he had plenty of time to play - and that's what he did. His office staff seemed to be in the Playboy Mansion. As he said, "You can teach them how to type, but you can not teach them how to grow breasts." Despite their sexist attitude, which fits well with a Texas congressman, they were fiercely loyal, especially his advisor, Amy Adams (Junebug & ex-girl Hooters). <br /> <br /> Now, add a rich Texan socialite who wants something done in Afghanistan, played perfectly by Julia Roberts; and a CIA agent sleeping in his boss, superbly made by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and you have a movie that is worth watching. <br /> <br /> Excellent writing and superlative acting, and a story that needed to be told. What else do you want in the movies?
