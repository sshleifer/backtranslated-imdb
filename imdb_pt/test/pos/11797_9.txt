On more than one level, I can relate to what happens in this movie in a very personal way. And all I can say about that is, it's true, what Dexter's mother tells Eric at the end of the story: he actually "healed" his son, taking away his sad feelings and his loneliness. <br /> This film emphasizes a philosophy that I may well agree upon. We're all going to die one day, sooner or later. In the end, it's not the amount of time we live but the fun / good times / happiness we have during that time. It's not the quantity, but the quality that counts. <br /> <br /> I think all the other words used here would only keep you away from watching this movie if you have not already. I would really like to see it released on DVD. It would definitely be added to my 'classics of all time' immediately!
