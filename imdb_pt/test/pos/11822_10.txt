Unbelievably close to the real-life feelings and emotions captured by Joseph Mazzello as an AIDS-stricken hemophilia child and his new neighbor, a hard-nosed tough guy played by Brad Renfro. Although the story may seem a bit forced (the two boys try to find several hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have a cure for AIDS), the emotions, actions and interactions of all the characters involved are tragically close to real life. Being a "big brother" to a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after this movie was released, I strongly recommend this photo to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with AIDS. Peter Horton's superb directing creates the perfect mood and scene for each scene and draws the viewer to the various emotions affected by friendship, illness, prejudice and the final farewell of two friends who fought hard to overcome adversity.
