A truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict. The film is a film that will get very close to home to those who have been involved in the drug culture and are aware of what being (or being around) a heroin addict really is. Good movie, it will never really be outdated. Excellent performances from all involved and the minimalist set is Preminger's way of showing how the world of a JUNKIE can be somber. Worth a look - a kind of education. The golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the clandestine life of pain that an addict lives on.
