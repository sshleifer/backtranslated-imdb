Contains Spoilers <br /> <br /> Luchino Visconti's film adaptation of Thomas Mann's novel is visually, if not philosophically, faithful to its source (Britten's opera offers a more accurate reading of the apologetic / dionysiac struggles that consume the old writer). It is certainly one of the most beautiful films ever made. <br /> <br /> In the Visconti version, the emphasis is more on the physical aspects of history. Never before did Venice seem more beautiful and seductive, more decadent and weakened. If you've read the novel, it's like having the descriptions on your pages come to life. Dirk Bogarde gives an excellent performance as Gustav von Aschenbach. Although he has very little dialogue, he conveys the bitterness, aroused passion and ultimately regrettable yearning for Aschenbach through facial expressions alone. Bjorn Andresen, the young actor who plays Tadzio, the beautiful object of Aschenbach's desire, was perfectly chosen. He also plays the role with facial expressions and gestures. The character Tadzio is fundamental to the story, so any actor in that role should be worthy to inspire passion and desire. Visconti, with his incredible look at beauty, knew exactly what he was doing. And switching Ashenbach from writer to composer based on Gustav Mahler, and then using Mahler's music, especially the Adagietto of the 5th Symphony, was another brilliant blow. Although I read Mann's story before the movie, Mahler's song and Death in Venice will always be inextricably linked in my mind. Just as the astonishing images that appear throughout the film, especially that last of Ashenbach dying in the beach while Tadzio walks slowly towards the sea. <br /> <br /> One day this movie will be released in widescreen format on DVD and visual splendors completely restored to us.
