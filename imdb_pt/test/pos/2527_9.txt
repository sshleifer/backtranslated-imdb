This is probably the best film by director Hector Babenco. It shows a Brazilian reality unknown to foreigners, which is the same reality that haunts all the countries of Latin America, poverty and the instinct for survival. Those most affected in this reality are children who are often left orphaned or abandoned by their poor parents who need to enter into a "dog eat dog" society, often falling into delinquency, prostitution and crime. Very well acted and with a "no frills" approach, this movie will reach you, great storyline, a must have movie in anyone's collection. The main role was for Fernando Ramos da Silva, a young man who fell victim to the crime, killed a few years later, during a robbery. I suggest people watch the movie "Who killed Pixote?" so you can get a deeper insight into the lives of these characters. Some other characters in the film have had a similar fate, some have died and others are in prison. Nevertheless, this movie will last for a long time in your memory
