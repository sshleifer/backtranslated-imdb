Hell to Pay is a bit bloody for my liking, even if it's not worse than many movies. However, I enjoyed the parade of experienced stars and the western landscape and everything; but the story was very weak and I could not see the sense of it all. However, the music that accompanies the film more than makes up for the lackluster movie. <br /> <br /> Where did the Nate & Noah Cryns guys come from - who wrote this song? They are amazing!! From the moment the song starts, it's by far better than anything I've heard in years. I think it may be the best I've heard! Even though I was not enthusiastic about the action that is taking place in the movie, the song evoked the exact emotion that was needed for each scene. I was transported back in time to the Old West during the opening credits and really felt like I was reliving those old days through music. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth a purchase and a sight for the beautiful music and a journey down memory road to see the old western stars once again.
