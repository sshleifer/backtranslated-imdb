The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino ("The Antichrist is on the Phone") is a truly suspenseful, but incomprehensibly overlooked giallo containing virtually all the trademarks that make this subgroup of Italian horror so magnificent and addictive for fans. Are there any very disturbing themes (child abuse, fake priests ??), scary moments, plot twists left and right, great music and ?? Last but not least ?? a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror! What is it about ordinary children's dolls that make them so scary? When the anonymous man, dressed as a priest, assaulted a little girl and the broken head of his doll jumped down a flight of stairs, really sent cold shivers down my spine! Years later, the young woman in the prologue is an adult woman locked in a wheelchair. She inherited a lot of money, but uses her fortune to encourage other people with disabilities to play sports and keep her mind positive. She ?? Joanna ?? falls in love with their personal trainer and they get married immediately. Of course, he's just after her money and starts to terrify Joanna, making her relive the childhood trauma that crippled her. The repeated images of a sinister priest, guided by sinister songs and a lullaby, provide "Formula for a Murder" with a ton of genuine scares and the direction of Alberto De Martino is very resolute. The acting is quite competent, with David Warbeck ("The Beyond", "The Black Cat") in a glorious role of greedy villain. Due to some holes and lack of originality, this movie may not be able to compete with Italy's best horror efforts, but it definitely deserves more attention. Many unknown and unknown Italians from gialli have received wonderful DVD releases and, hopefully, "Formula for a Murder" will receive the same treatment soon. Meanwhile, good luck tracking this baby!
