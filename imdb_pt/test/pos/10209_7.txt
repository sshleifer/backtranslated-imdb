Hard to believe that this was directed by Fritz Lang, since it directed mainly dramas and mysteries of the crime. This film has a cast that includes Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and John Carradine. Scott plays a thug who tries to go straight and leave his old gang and ends up saving Jagger's life. Jagger works for Western Union, a telegraph firm that plans to have telegraphs west. Jagger hires many men to ensure they are done because they need to worry about Indian attacks and bad guys. Scott is in charge of the men and Young is a telegraph specialist who can not fire a gun, but can walk. Scott meets up with his old gang who wants to stop them, but Scott can not tell anyone. It's a very good western and Lang should drive some more westerns.
