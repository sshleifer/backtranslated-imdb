Not as good as the movie, which says it's a cute kids show. Ok, so the Emperor slips back and becomes a spoiled and selfish brat once again, accepts and appreciates the cartoon as something fun. It has lots of jokes for the parents and still catches the children's attention. Also features two of the film's original voice actors. Earth Kitt who has been in numerous films, but I'm sure many people know how to Catwoman. And Patrick Walburton (sorry if I wrote it wrong) that also appeared in many movies and TV series, but is more widely recognized as The Tick. It really is a rare and wonderful combination. If, for any other reason, I recommend that comic book fans watch at least one episode just to enjoy the dynamic duo. In short, fun children's show with many inner jokes for adults to laugh along with. If you are looking for educational value, this is not your show. If you're just looking for something funny, this is a great choice for Saturday morning!
