A year after 'Love Thy Neighbor' made her first video. debut, he followed the path of 'On The Buses' and 'Steptoe & Son' as he graduated from the big screen, in a photo taken by Hammer Films. It opens with an exciting patriotic speech extolling the virtues of England's green and pleasant land, then cuts a scene of Eddie and Bill up a street, arguing furiously. This turns into a strange sequence of white and black neighbors vandalizing the houses of one another. At least the original theme song is retained (even if it's sung by someone other than Stuart Gillies). The local newspaper The Gazette is holding a contest to find the best neighbors, the winners of a Mediterranean cruise. Barbie suggests to Joan that they should enter. The thing is, can Bill and Eddie be friends long enough to win? That's the main part of the plot. The film is largely episodic. One piece is raised directly from the first season, ie Bill and Eddie going to the club pretending to be in 'union'. In fact, they will see a stripper (not meet two girls). Another part of the film has Bill, along with other black workers (in the series, he was the only one), breaking a strike that Eddie helped bring about by various tricks (including smuggling through the gates into beer kegs). While another (apparently inspired by Powell and Driver "For the Love of Ada") sees Eddie's mother speaking (the magnificent Patricia Hayes) becoming friendly with Bill's father (Charles Hyatt). <br /> <br /> The climax of episode 1 The first season reappears in an expanded way. Bill once again puts ink and a towel to terrify Eddie, but his friends join him and dance around a drum containing a bare Booth, so they can pretend to cook it and eat it. Eddie then has to make his way home naked (surprisingly, there is less nudity here than there was in Season 2 Episode 2). <br /> <br /> The movie ends with Reynolds and the booths winning 'Love Your Tune Up' contest, and cruising together, but there is an unexpected turnaround involving Joan's crazy brother, Cyril (James Beck - "Private Walker" from "Daddy's Army"), who is working as an administrator. <br /> <This is the typical 70's sitcom-into-movie, with all the flaws generally prevalent in such films. The laughter is scattered and interest subsides after half an hour. The cast is augmented by familiar faces like Melvyn Hayes (played by Terry), the character of the first season of episode 2 (Leslie Meadows), Bill Fraser (factory manager), Anna Dawson, Andria Lawrence (who seems to have appeared in all films The director, John Robins, was also responsible for the film 'Man About The House'. <br /> <br /> Funniest moment - while Eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory, Bill paints his face in black.The first thing he knows is when the manager's secretary screams in terror.The tables were turned!
