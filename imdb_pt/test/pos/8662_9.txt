The Bothersome Man is one of the best foreign films I have ever seen. All technical aspects are, in my opinion, perfect (lighting, acting, direction, pace, etc.). THE HISTORY is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Apparently beyond death, our main character finds himself dwelling in a world without beauty, passion or anything remotely pleasing to the human senses. His work is cold and uninteresting; his relationships are numb and uninspired, and when everything becomes too much, he tries to finish it in front of a train. But that does not end - he can not leave this strange world by suicide! Working back to a man who seemed to be feeling the same isolation and loneliness, our main character joins him in the digging of a stone wall hoping to reveal the source of a strange and wonderful song and smell. Just as they break - and I will not reveal it that much, everything comes to an end and the movie ends as strangely as it started. <br /> <br /> Just say you're going to love this movie or hate it. I feel it is like a magic poem - open to many different interpretations and all of them as valid as the next ones. If you enjoy new experiences in the movies and want to be taken from the Hollywood banquet, try this movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10 (and I do not classify easily!) Because despite its darkness, this movie left me with a feeling of something greater ... something mysterious and beyond ourselves. Well done!
