I discovered that late at Turner Classics. I kept saying to myself, "I'm going to hang up as soon as it stops being funny," but it goes without saying that I watched it all the time. <br /> <br /> I'm a movie addict, but I've never even HEARD this movie (or if I did it in 1971, I forgot). Worth watching just for the performance of Goldie Hawn as the naive tart-tongued. His acting is a revelation in this film. Yes, the script is clear and excellent (when was the last time they did a Hollywood comedy with a clever script?), But their acting is extraordinary. I never realized how funny Goldie could be, and that makes her appear later in roles like Laugh-In and Private Benjamin a little sad. In her later career, she is much more than her minimalist and funny looks here. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasure to see young Matthau, the great Bergman and the supporting stellar cast, but it's Goldie Hawn who will make this movie worth watching again.
