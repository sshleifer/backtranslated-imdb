I think that this TV movie was first shown the same week that Manchester United played in the Champions League Final (1999), they played a lot of football related items that week and this was an absolute highlight. <br /> <br /> He played in all the cliches that are produced every season during the Cup of England, ie brave, lucky clothes / mascots, name in the cup etc and turned out to be brilliantly funny. <br /> <br /> Surprised that was never repeated before other great football occasions, even now with the world cup just beginning. <br /> <br /> Some previous posts of non-football fans have said they still love it, but a football fan will find it hilarious.
