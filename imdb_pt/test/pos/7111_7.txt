One year after the release of the "House of Frankenstein" average, Universal released another Monster Mash, where all of its famous characters collided again. "House of Dracula" would bring together Dracula, the creature of Frankenstein and the Man of the Wolves for what would be their final battle and finally end an era for the studio. Directed once again by Erle C. Kenton, "House of Dracula" presents a slight but notable improvement over the previous film and presents a better constructed (though still imperfect) story that, far from being perfect, is a more appropriate closure of the film. than the previous film. <br /> <br /> The story ignores most of the events from the previous entry, "House of Frankenstein", and introduces a new angle to the story. Count Dracula (John Carradine), tired of having to hide in sunlight, asks for help from the brilliant scientist, Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), a physician famous for his research in biology. Edelman is fascinated by Dracula, and soon begins an experimental treatment, while Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), the Wolf Man, visits Edelman for the purpose of getting rid of his curse. Soon Edelman realizes that Dracula is a monster that must be destroyed, but his own exposure to the blood of Dracula is also developing a disease in him. The discovery of the Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange) in a nearby catacomb will bring more turmoil to the mind of the brilliant scientist. <br /> <br /> After the previous clash of monsters, it's good to see the series go back. to the roots and delivering almost gothic horror straight back to the dark and pessimistic nature of this type of film and moving away from the comic relief of the previous entries. The story (by Edward T. Lowe Jr.) has many interesting themes, such as the contrast between Dracula and Talbot (both looking for a cure but for different purposes) and Edelman's growing madness. Probably among the most interesting themes is the inclusion of Nina's character, a beautiful but deformed woman who helps Dr. Edelman expect to be cured of her condition. <br /> <br /> Director Erle C. Kenton is back and this time he finally captures the dark nature of these three characters, a nature that was apparently lost in the previous film. In spite of the low budget, Kenton creates a gothic horror that, although simple, is quite effective, and still manages to introduce to the old partners these new personages of a new way. Although he is never at the originals level, "House of Dracula" regains the charm that Universal Studios horror films used to have, and Kenton makes sure that, at least for the last time, the monsters will have the chance to shine. The cast is very good this time, with Carradine, Chaney and Strange reprizing their roles (although Strange's role is considerably smaller) with more enthusiasm than in the previous film. The addition of Onslow Stevens, Jane Adams and Martha O'Driscoll to the cast brings back the tragedy and drama to the series, with Stevens doing a great performance as Dr. Edelman. A small cameo by Lionel Atwill and the presence of Skelton Knaggs as chilling Steinmuhl complete one of Universal's best horror films in years. <br /> <br /> "House of Dracula" is a good addition to the series. , especially after the mediocre "Frankenstein House". It's nice to see Kenton back in shape in a rather serious horror film, however, and while the plot is quite unique, suffers not only because of the budget but because the film tries to do a lot in a very short runtime with bad results. It is true that the characters have very inventive story lines, but the film devotes very little time for each one to develop, and the film seems very rushed and disjointed. <br /> <br /> Although far from perfect, it is also far from the worst of the series. "House of Dracula" is a good ending to one of the best times for the horror genre, a time when ghosts and ghouls roamed foggy nights, and crazy scientists gave life to hideous monsters. Later, the monsters would return to "Bud Abbott and Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948), but that would be a completely different context. after the disappointing previous entries, it's easy to dismiss "House of Dracula," but give it a chance, and let the monster wander one last time. 7/10
