Lightning flashes; an extensive cemetery; the name of Adam 'Batman' West: they all appear on the screen even before the opening credits are over, and yet, despite these somewhat na√Øve elements, One Dark Night is not as tacky as it sounds. <br /> <Meg Tilly (Jennifer's sister) plays the beautiful Julie, who reluctantly agrees to spend the night alone in a mausoleum as part of her initiation to the exclusive high school clique, The Sisters. What Julie does not realize is that the other "sisters" plan to scare her with some macabre jokes - or that the latest body to be buried in the mausoleum is Raymar's "psychic vampire," who feeds on life. Force of frightened young women. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not the most original of the set-ups, but fortunately there are enough inventive touches to help set this movie apart from the competition, my favorites being the macabre view of the everyday objects embedded in the walls of Raymar's apartment, and the creepy way in which moldy corpses float through the marble chunky corridors of the mausoleum during the great finale. Hal Trussell's stunning steadicam cinematography and Tom Burman's wonderfully macabre special effects also add immensely to the creepy atmosphere.
