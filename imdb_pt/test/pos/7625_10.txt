Once a sage from India once said, "First they will laugh at us. Then they will hate us. Then they will fear us." I know, the budget for this movie was a little wrong, but even so the story still interests us many years later, regardless of how it might seem. But know soon enough, in due course "Masten Thrust" will appear on the big screen one more time. So he and the new redesigned T-Rex will shock you more. It will scare many for centuries to come !! This movie is in current pre-production and will not be anything like anything you've seen before! <br /> <br /> This will be beyond the THX format ..... in the 4-DX format. <br /> <br /> "Be afraid, be very afraid!"
