Following the huge success of Nick Park and Aardman's team with the short animations of Wallace and Gromit, we now have the first (hopefully of many) features with the plasticine characters that many love. The DVD of the movie proved to be the most durable and best used of the many Christmas gifts of my two sons by a long way. The plot of the movie is straightforward enough, but the beauty of the W & G movies to me are the background jokes. There are plenty of front jokes and slapstick for kids and adults to enjoy, but the bottom is the killer for me. All in an elegant addition to an already stylish filmography for Nick Park etal and I would recommend fans and new observers to see this movie .... many times.
