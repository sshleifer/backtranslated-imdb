I think "Key West" can do just as well as a DVD. There are probably many failed Star Treks who simply never had a chance at success. We'll never know if this could have been a great series. Would I love to know if there is a way to view old programs like this or if they are just another Hollywood footnote? Is it possible to find copies of these shows so that the loyal eccentrics can take advantage of them again? The show had a great talent for writing and some, if not all episodes, left you with an idea of ​​the characters that are often lacking in today's hits. I often quit with the feeling of learning something from the stories and very entertained with the characters very original. Thank you.
