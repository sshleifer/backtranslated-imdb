Sometimes it's difficult to be a pirate ............... but by mere rider Miss. Jean Peters has a lot of fun trying - and this shows, particularly during his first friendly spot of sword fight with Blackbeard (eminently hissable) when the sheer joy of performing is simple on his face. With Fifty Years of Retrospective Feminists seem committed to taking this film as a sort of anthem for the empowerment of women in a male-dominated society, but I have serious doubts that either M.Tourneur or Ms. Peters had such a concept in their heads. The Hour. It was an exciting and fun family movie with absolutely no pretense, hidden meanings or alternative agenda. It was fun. M. Louis Jourdan is both captivating and treacherous as his love interest. Mr. Herbert Chapman is wise and philosophical as the wise and philosophical doctor. Mr. James Robertson Justice is a bit unbelievable as the foreman. But it's Ms. Peters that stays in memory. Adolingly adolescent, illiterate, tough but vulnerable, wonderfully agile, and ultimately brave, she is everyone's idea of ​​a pirate lady. There was a definite window of opportunity for her in fancy roles - which she did not choose to take advantage of is a matter of some regret.
