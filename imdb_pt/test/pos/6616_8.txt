I've seen this movie twice now on cable. The first time I saw it, it took me by surprise. The skateboarders I was seeing were the guys we followed in the pages of Skateboarder magazine in the late 1970s. Those were the guys we copied and tried to become as we skated. I'm glad we finally made a movie that provides a precise account of how it all happened. I'm almost 40 now and I think a guy very tense with all the problems of life, however; This movie did a great job of taking me back. Back to the empty pools, the backyard halfpipes and the car trips to Cherry Hill NJ. I suspect that in order to really understand this movie and enjoy it, you had to live it. Otherwise, it probably will not have the impact on you, as it did for me. But for those of you (and you know who you are), whoever lived through it, you know exactly what I'm talking about! Anyway, I do not care who you are, if you get the chance to see this movie ... do it! I thank the Z-Boys of Dogtown for the memories of my youth and thank Stacy for making this movie! WORK WELL DONE!
