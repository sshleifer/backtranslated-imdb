This is not "direct cinema", in fact it is the opposite. The second edition of the gypsy trilogy of filmmaker Gatlif, this French work produced by Mich√®le Ray-Gavras, is a masterpiece of cinema, not a pure documentary, no fiction by any means. Instead, Gatlif chose different places from the route from India to Spain, where the Roma people have a strong presence, and with the help of art directors he staged various musical numbers that tell us how Gypsies live, sing, dance, fight and have survived. The film may have strong opposition from those who question the hypothesis that the Roman tribe is of Indian origin, mainly challenged by those who see a direct connection with the Hebrews (so, in a way, it is no surprise that they too have been persecuted. by the Nazis.) But above all anthropological argument, this is a work of great beauty, strong colors and wonderful songs and dances.
