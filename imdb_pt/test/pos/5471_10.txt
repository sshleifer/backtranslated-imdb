I'm from Texas and my family was on vacation a few years ago with Sante Fe with my brother. He suggested we go see the church with the stairs. I was absolutely impressed by the miracles that took place there. The film is great - Barbara Hershey and William Petersen were perfect for the parts they played. It's incredible, absolutely incredible. If you have not seen the stairway in person, it's worth the trip to go see it. The wood is beautiful and the architecture is stunning. Just being in the chapel gives me goosebumps! To read about the history of the chapel, and then see its beauty is breathtaking. Watch the movie - it's great! Then see the staircase in person!
