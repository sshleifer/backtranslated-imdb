I'm a fan of action movies but until today I've never seen a preview or an advertisement for this movie in Italy so I went to see "The Long Kiss Goodnight" on pay TV waiting for nothing special. <br /> <br /> But what a surprise! This movie is great! The only problem I found is the presence of some holes in the plot, but the rest is the most entertaining, intriguing and funny action movie of all time. Samantha / Charly's transformation from common-wife-teacher The cold-blooded agent who is recovering from amnesia seems like a good idea. The action scenes and acrobatics are the best I've ever seen. Samuel L. Jackson adds some of the best lines I've ever heard and his chemistry with Geena Davis is good. <br /> <br /> And Geena? She is wonderful, she plays the best acting heroine ever seen and does strong and convincing acting and fantastic acrobatics. <br /> <br /> So I think this movie had poor box office performances and bad reviews because most critics and some kind of audience have a tough time with strong female roles. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
