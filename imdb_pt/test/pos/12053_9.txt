Darr is a great movie! Shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to conquer his lady, who in this case is Juhi Chawla. Little does Juhi know in the film that Shahrukh has a great passion for her and is constantly chasing her. I have to admit, some of the things he did in that movie were pretty scary ... like the threatening phone calls. Never in my life will I forget the phrase "I love you K..k..k..Kiran!" <br /> <br /> It's too bad that Shahrukh and Juhi were not exactly "together" in the movie. But Juhi and Sunny make a good couple in the movie. Although Shahrukh's role was psychotic enough, I still think he did a great job of acting and can not imagine anyone playing that role. No wonder he received a prize for Darr in 94 '! <br /> <br /> Juhi ... what can I say ??? She looks especially amazing in this movie! It's not that she does not always seem incredible in her other films, but Darr gave the audience a wonderful picture of her! <br /> <br /> As for the music ... it was excellent! Especially "Jaadu Teri Nazar", one of my favorite songs of all time. I also thought "Tu Mere Samne" was very good too. <br /> <br /> A must see for everyone! Overall Darr deserves a 9/10!
