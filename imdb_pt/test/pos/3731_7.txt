I saw this today with little information on what to expect from the plot. I go to the movies as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a "story". I thought this would be a good movie, not great, but good. It was worth my money and my tears :) Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Richard Gere is not a surplus actor. He held his own and has a certain presence that we always look forward to. He brings his own style to the film. <br /> <br /> I think it was the kind of love story that is not always told. It was a mess and they had other priorities, but they wanted to be together and wanted to wait for each other. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend it!
