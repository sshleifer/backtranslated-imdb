To paraphrase Thora Birch: "I kind of like this movie. It's just the opposite of everything I hate in a movie." <br /> <br /> This obscure film was very discreet and clever to have a theatrical release, any chance of success would have needed an expensive promotional campaign. And a maturing story where nothing spectacular happens - where, instead, the focus is on character development, it has a limited audience. Who has heard of a mature teen movie? <br /> <br /> But if you have an opportunity to see this or if you can separate a few dollars into the DVD, you can do a lot worse. "My teacher's wife" is nothing revolutionary, but it has a lot to do with it and keeps up well with repeated visions. Jason London (like high school Todd Boomer) is the star and fits this character as well as his parts in "The Man In The Moon" and "Dazed and Confused." He is helped by the exceptional work of his supporting cast. Aunt Carrere in the title role is a revelation (she can act) as a calculator and love interest for Todd. Christopher McDonald as the teacher in a good self-parody performance. Zak Orth and Alexondra Lee as best friends of Todd and Jeffrey Tabor as his father. <br /> <br /> As someone commented earlier, this is a "mature" teen movie because romantic relationships are universally unsuccessful - at least by traditional happy end patterns. Even Todd's parents are indifferent to each other, with his father panting after the title character and his mother (Leslie Lyles) literally on the phone all his time on the screen (a device that increases comedy with each successive appearance). The London-Carrere novel has an unexpected charm and is far more believable than any other older woman's story you can find. <br /> <br /> But the real strength of the film is the evolving relationship of the three friends. There is no exhausted melodrama here, only three immature people who alternate between testing and relying on each other, subject to all the dynamics that three young people can bring to this kind of thing. They really manage to make a three-person relationship "believable," perhaps the first in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
