I am listening to Istanbul, with intent, my eyes closed: In the beginning there is a gentle breeze And the leaves in the trees Swing gently; Outside, far away, the bells of the water-bearers ring incessantly; I'm listening to Istanbul with the intention, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I am listening to Istanbul with the intention, my eyes closed; Then suddenly birds fly, Bands of birds, loud, with a tone and shout, As the nets are drawn in the fishing areas And a woman's feet begin to wrap themselves in the water. I am listening to Istanbul with the intention, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I'm listening to Istanbul with the intent, my eyes closed. The Grand Bazaar is serene and cool, A bustle in the center of the Market, the courtyards of the Mosque are full of pigeons. As hammers beat and hit the docks Spring winds bring the smell of sweat; I'm listening to Istanbul with the intention, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I am listening to Istanbul with the intention, my eyes closed; Still dizzy from the gossip of the past, A seaside mansion with grimy boat houses is sleeping. Amid the noise and buzz of the southern winds, we rest, I am listening to Istanbul, intending, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I'm listening to Istanbul with the intent, my eyes closed. A pretty girl walks along the sidewalk: four-letter words, whistles and songs, crude remarks; Something falls from her hand It's a rose, I think. I'm listening to Istanbul with the intention, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I'm listening to Istanbul with the intention, my eyes closed. A bird flies around her skirt; Is there sweat on your forehead? Or not? I know. Are your lips wet? Or not? I know. A silver moon rises beyond the pines: I can feel everything in my heart beating. I'm listening to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> For you <br /> <br /> For you, my human companions, Everything is for you, The nights are for you, the days are for you; The light of day is for you, the moonlight is for you; Leaves in the moonlight; Wonder and wisdom in the leaves, myriads green in the light of day, yellow is for you and pink. The sensation of the skin on the palm of His hand, His warmth, His softness, The comfort of lying down; For you are all compliments And the masts sifting through the harbor; Names of the days, Names of the months, Fresh paint in rowing boats is for you The postman's feet, Potter's hands Sweat on the foreheads, Bullets fired at the battle fronts; Graves are for you and gravestones, Chains and handcuffs and death sentences Are for you Everything is for you. <br /> <br /> MAR NOSTALGIA <br /> <br /> Ships sail over my dreams, On the rooftops, ships in a party of color, And poor of me Yearning for the sea year after year, I look and I cry. I remember my first view of the world. Through a mussel shell I opened myself: The water is greener and the sky bluer And the rounder of the fish ... My blood still flows salty Where the oysters cut my skin. What mad speed was our plunging deep sea into the whiter foam! The foam has no malice, Like lips Of whom adultery with men Is not disgrace. <br /> <br /> Ships sail along our dreams On the rooftops, ships in a banquet of color, And poor me, Yearning for the sea year in the year I could not have said anything better than what Orhal Veli Kanik said about Istanbul. About this movie, all I have is praise. A very nice and balanced introduction to a city and its music that connected Asia, Europe and Africa at one point of time.
