Film critic Late Gene Siskel said that this movie shows how easy it is to make a movie. He was giving a compliment, though now this may have been considered an insult these days. Even though I do not always agree with Gene Siskel, I agree with him here. Love Jones is a brilliant example of how a love story should be: realistic with real characters in real situations. <br /> <br /> The story recounts the ups and downs of the relationship between Darius Lovehall (Larenz Tate) and Nina (Nia Long). Larenz Tate and Nia Long are more than just a gorgeous couple on the screen. These two really have chemistry together. You can feel the vibe between these two whenever they are on the screen and it's fantastic. <br /> <br /> Bill Bellamy is very funny as the deceptive Wood and Lisa Nicole Carson is great as Nina's friend Simone. Isaiah Washington is as good as Darius' close friend Savon, and I sigh every time I see him in a movie. The guy is a great actor whose career is ruined by people of short stature and by the children's games that they do. You may believe he called the little Gray's Anatomy ferret his name, but anyone who knows how Follywood works knows better than to believe any "official history" of the place to be believed. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Love Jones is a wonderful love story filled with interesting and friendly characters that are in realistic situations that anyone in love can relate to as well. You love these people because they are believable and they are not portrayed as gangsters and vagabonds. No obscene stereotype can be found here. Contrast this with the toady romance movies. Exactly. To close, if you like Black Cinema, then you would do well to own a copy of this movie.
