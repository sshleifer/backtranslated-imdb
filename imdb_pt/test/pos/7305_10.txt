I was very moved by the gentle power of this film and by the mood it created. I think I should have received a lot more credits than that. I agree that Michelle Pfeiffer should have been nominated, but I think all performances were excellent, and that Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange portrayed the deep affinity and conflicts of the sisters with great emotional depth and sensitivity. Although I did not read the book, I found the modern concept of King Lear really cool. I most certainly will never look at the piece in the same way!
