I absolutely LOVED this movie as a kid and still do as an adult. To say this is even a euphemism. My sister, my brother and I have been at our grandparents' house for a year during the Christmas holidays. They recorded it from the TV. Our parents were glad they kept us occupied for one night but they thought we would get tired of it and would be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We were hypnotized. They could not have undone us if they tried. It has become an estimated annual tradition. We love all about it: time, romance, battle scenes, villains etc. <br /> <br /> Come on, who can resist to hate that psycho Bent with his constant SIR!? Classic! Also, who can resist clapping when Justin falls off the porch ?! What a triumphant moment! I've always had a special place in my heart for Orry and Madelaine. They were so romantic. The theme song alone can make me cry a little. This movie is incredibly exciting and I challenge anyone to stick with it until the end. Worth it!!
