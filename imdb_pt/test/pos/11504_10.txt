If this movie is not selected for at least an Oscar nominee for best foreign film, I will stop waking up at night watching the event. Fridrik Thor Fridriksson proved that money is not the key to making a good movie, but originality. From a cold country comes a hot but instigating movie from a mentally ill man and his fight against an insane world. After such an insight, you question whether the man is crazy or the world in which he lives.
