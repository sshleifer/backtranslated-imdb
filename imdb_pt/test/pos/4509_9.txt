I've never read the book, but I've always heard good things about it. So when the movie came out I considered seeing it, but I never did. Now it came out on DVD and I thought of renting it for a few weeks now. Last night I finally got it. I am very happy about it. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was incredible in this movie. The setting, etc, ... everything made you feel like you are in Kabul. The acting was very good, although I made sure that some of the emotions were lost in the translation. And the story itself was good, pure, and edifying. Yes, the story was very sad, but at the same time edifying. <br /> <br /> And I will be honest, as a white American, ... made me see beyond Kabul and Afghanistan that I never imagined in my life. when I think about it. He showed me an Afghanistan before the Taliban. He showed me a place that was beautiful. He showed me a place with good-hearted people. I community that was like a family, plus some bullies. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend this movie to everyone. It's one of the best I've ever seen.
