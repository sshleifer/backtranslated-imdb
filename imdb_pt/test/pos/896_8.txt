The first of the Italian cheats of the soft French porn blockbuster (although it may be interesting to note that the boot-shaped country actually got the first of them with Io de 1968 from Cesare Canevari, EMMANUELLE, starring Erika Blanc) is a very different kettle of fish than the despicable sequels provided by the late and questionably great Joe D'Amato. It is much more intimate in spirit for the now-dated 1973 Just Jaeckin film, with a close eye on the relationships between men and women, questioning topics as hot as loyalty and jealousy, all in a luxurious exotic environment. Unlike D'Amato, the director Albert Thomas (also known as Adalberto Albertini, who also made the difficult to find YELLOW EMANUELLE, actually a sexualized version of MADAME BUTTERFLY!) Does not introduce us lords of predatory drugs, film producers prey or enraged cannibals. for a viewing experience admittedly less sensational, albeit much more erotic. <br /> <br /> Photo journalist Mae Jordan, also known as 'Emanuelle' (Laura Gemser, born in Java, in her first role after playing a Thai massage therapist in EMMANUELLE 2 and a 'untouched native' in the Just Jaeckin from the rarely seen COLLECTIONS PRIVEES) flies to Nairobi where she will film the stills that accompany an article by noted British writer Anne, played by Teutonic herself, Karin Schubert with a butch haircut that takes some getting used to. Anne shares an "open relationship" (remember when this was done) with her Italian husband Gianni (Angelo Infanti), which means that they both jump anything with a wrist. Contrary to his subsequent reputation, Emanuelle seems positively reticent in comparison to his hosts of heavy breathing, smoldering seductively at Gianni by way of foreplay until the tempting strenuous payout. Okay, so she compensates for this lack of debauchery at the end, when she does an entire male hockey team on the train. I'm not kidding with you. <br /> <br /> The production of this classic of sexploitation is quite impressive, especially the superb cinematography. And Nico Fidenco's musical theme is a solid favorite of anyone with more than a passing interest in the genre, a hilarious Eurotrash pop singer (try to understand those totally meaningless lyrics and have a fun night out with the family!) throughout the film in all conceivable types of slow 'n' sexy interpretation for hip-gyrating disc. <br /> <br /> This is Laura Gemser's show. Considered simply as "Emanuelle" (as was another actress in the same director's elusive EMANUELLE NERA 2), it illuminates the screen from start to finish. Not yet subjected to endless scenarios of rape (as she would be once D'Amato took over), she seems much more relaxed than in later films, even smiling from time to time, a rare occasion as anyone she has seen some lady work. certainly knows. A flawless Eurasian, and not as the title suggests black beauty (it comes from Dutch Indonesia now in Indonesia and is actually very close in physical appearance to the supposed author of the novel Emmanuelle Arsan), it projects a slightly passive, submissive sensuality of some form stands out Unlike the French film, demeaning morality is kept to a minimum, almost cast as a late reflection near the end of the film, when Emanuelle tells Gianni that he has not lost her like never before. owned it to start. I swear you could hear the audience of Just Jaeckin's version moaning whenever Alain Cuny's extremely annoying Mario appeared on the screen because it meant that we had many minutes of halfbacks philosophizing libertines as an alibi to get the divine Sylvia Kristel (now living by the way, the Belgian capital of Brussels ...) to undress, the real reasons why the theaters were crowded for years on end. Gemser's husband, Gabriele Tinti (now deceased, she remarried), appears as a drunken writer (huh?) Constantly drunk who forces himself briefly into Emanuelle amid the African ruins at some point but no real sex scene Despite .
