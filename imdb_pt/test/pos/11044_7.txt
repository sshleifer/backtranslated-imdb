"Anne Christie" was Garbo's 14th film and the first one in which her hoarse, Swedish voice was heard. She plays the protagonist, Anna, who has struggled to be abandoned by her father, Chris (a drunken barge owner played by George F Marion), and with the unhappiness of life she has, she has to lead to keep her head above the Water. Br /> <br /> Encounter with the Irishman Matt (Charles Bickford) can mark the turning point for her ... or not? Garbo looks and looks great in this drama that, although it seems clumsy and moves at a slow pace, still manages to engage and engage an audience almost 80 years later. Marie Dressler makes an impact on the role that gave her a second wave of success in films like Min and Bill, Dinner at Eight and Emma; while Marion and Bickford are more than enough. <br /> <br /> An interesting slice of film history. Garbo would do better talkies in the following years, but "Anna Christie" will always be remembered for the first time she spoke on the screen.
