I recently saw this movie for the first time. I liked it so much I went straight and bought the DVD. This movie is pure genius and only gets more fun with every performance. Anyone can write funny jokes or dialogues and make the actors memorize them, but the basis of this movie is to improve !! How do they do it? Thank you, Christopher Guest!
