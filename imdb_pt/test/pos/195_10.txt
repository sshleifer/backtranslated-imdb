Unlike the many who posted here, I am not literate in the movies. I stumbled on this movie by accident (surf channel), and could not surf. This is a truly incredible film, worthy of all the praise that critics and those on this site have bet on it. The actors are great. Tatiana is beautiful and innocent. Her boyfriend Boris is sweet and patriotic. You can not help but feel the exasperation and sadness of Boris's father as he rebukes his son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great war. <br /> <br /> Others have summarized the film so well, so I'll just mention a few scenes that moved me the most. When Boris's brother reveals to his family that he has broken trust with his brother and "has to marry" Tatiana, Tatiana's twisted mouth shows his disgust at this betrayal (even though his part in infidelity may have been rape) . You fear that the rest of the movie can correct this mistake by visiting only the destruction of Tatiana and her brother, or worse, showing Tatiana destroyed by an immoral descent into the decline of smoking. As this is not "existential French cinema", the latter does not happen. Thankfully! <br /> <br /> Another scene ripping through his heart is when the anonymous "musician" soldier who was saved by Boris returns to tell Boris's father about the death of his son. He involuntarily breaks the news to Tatiana. I can not describe the sadness of this scene ... Still, Tatiana finds a straw to catch and hopes Boris will still get home. In fact, the musician never saw Boris buried. <br /> <br /> I will not mention any more scenes, but I want to note that the touches of Soviet political correctness did not diminish anything about the film. Boris's brother is revealed as the pianist who plays against the Soviet folgarer that someone who steals his brother's future wife would have to be. No doubt he gets at least a "tenner" at the conclusion of the movie! The finale, when Tatiana finally discovers that Boris is dead, still manages to end happily and hopefully for the future. You do not even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept the theater when the survivors of that war, with their own losses in mind, saw this movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> Incredible. Go see that.
