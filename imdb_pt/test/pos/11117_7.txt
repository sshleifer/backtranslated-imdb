The last one to play a dancer with no academic or other credentials is an incredible personality and worth observing. which is essentially a portrait of himself. A wonder to behold, as a king was willing to say. <br /> <br /> The plot follows an interesting format - chronological sometimes, genre at other times, personalities in some cases ... but, everything really ends <br /> <br /> Parker's success is to push this film for a periodic overdrive - with the exaggerated and sometimes beautiful and direct score that combines with the artists step by step. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film is a climax for all time. And this complete climatic cast of many talented musicians and dancers and music is happily repeated throughout the credits. These are a set of credits that are well worth ... an achievement for the ages. Christopher Gore's music is a gift to be seen.
