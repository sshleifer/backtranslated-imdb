If you are looking for a fake Hollywood action movie, this will not be one for you. If truth is what you are looking for, rent or buy it. From a true story, the film tries to capture the heart of what was happening in South Africa (and in many other places). For historical knowledge, this applies to such stories as "The Pianist," "Schindler's List," or "Nuremberg." Millions of people today have no idea what apartheid is or what exists. This movie can help them learn and even help them delve deeper.
