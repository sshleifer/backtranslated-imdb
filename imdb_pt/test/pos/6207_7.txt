Despite subsequent claims, this early-talkie melodrama has very little in common with "Citizen Kane": it's a biopic of a fictional, but human, plutocrat, counted in flashback, but jumping over time. The screenwriter, Preston Sturges, does not show any of his later gifts for the glittering dialogue, and none of Kane's innumerable cinematic innovations are evident. Still, it's very watchable, with a young Spencer Tracy (his old make-up makes him look, well, an old Spencer Tracy) showing depth and authority, and Colleen Moore - a little beyond his age, not physically well Combined - playing a multifaceted woman - behind the man. There is also Helen Vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatal in movie history, sending the final third to reverberations of ecstatic novels. The surviving picture is agitated and lacks audio snippets, and there are some holes left open (how would she know whose son it was if she was sleeping with them?), And the music is terribly mushy. For all this, I was quite fascinated.
