I have only praise for this film. From beginning to end, he captured the brilliance of Stephen Sondheim's musical. I'm not a big fan of musicals, most of them are very exaggerated. This, however, changed my mind. I'm an actor myself and I played Sweeney and I know how difficult that role is. George Hearn gave an impressive performance, masterful and rounded, worthy of the biggest awards we can give him (He won an Emmy and that's something). Whatever he does he turns into gold. He is so good that he will blow his mind because he is not in movies winning the Oscar. Lansbury is also very good and very funny. Sara Woods is creepy and wonderful as Beggar Woman. All in all a great video. Take if you can.
