This is the only thing I'll be able to look back on from the year 2006 and say now that it rocked. He rocked hard and yet also swayed tasty. Mr. MEATLOAF added a nice little touch to this movie plate even before the opening credits were released. Now that it tells you something, this one filmed shook before it even STARTED! Now I do not want to give too much away or be a "spoiler" but this movie ROCKED! If you've heard the new album and thought to yourself "this looks like a precarious Tenacious stuff, it's like I'm just playing badminton with Satan, what gives?" Then this movie will heighten your appreciation for music and you will marvel at this steamy satanic work. For those who want better, do not know what they want, because better would not be D. D. This movie is period D. So if you dare the local vision theater if you want to have your socks balanced.
