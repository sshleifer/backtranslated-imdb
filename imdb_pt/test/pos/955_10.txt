I'm an ardent fan of Vijay. I've never seen another movie of him as good as this. <br /> <br /> It has all the regular clich√©s you would expect from a commercial artist. A hero who is poor in studies, but a star in his fort, namely Kabbadi. Your friends to fill the comedy quota. A heroine in a life or death situation. A villain, which I say is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist. Sequences of pursuit and action of high octane. Music that can do a dance. And most of all, a perfect story line to keep all of the above factors in a nice circle. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The director gives no chance for the audience to let go. It simply goes from one nail in the head to the next. And one can see the lighter side of Vijay in this film he rarely performs. <br /> <br /> All told ..... This movie was and will be perfect for many years to come ....
