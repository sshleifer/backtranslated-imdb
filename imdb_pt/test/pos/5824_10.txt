HBO created this program in order to make us see the most realistic view of the prison possible and they did an incredible job. Oz was created by the creators of the Homicide who wanted to show a crude version of the prison. This show is what launched the idea of ​​all other HBO Original programs such as The Sopranos, Sex and the City, The Wire, Arliss, Deadwood and Six Feet Under among others. Oz is the nickname for the Oswald State Penitentiary, a fictional prison in a state of the United States that is never declared (although with accents, crime scenes and racial distribution NY assumed). The main prison unit seen on the show is Emerald City, a seemingly ideal prison unit, with more privileges than others thought by a liberal unit manager named Tim McManus. Overall, this show shows us how it is if someone wants to survive in prison. <br /> <br /> There are about 10 gangs in Oz. First, we have the Muslims, a group of blacks who want to destroy the injustices of the criminal justice system and help improve the living conditions of blacks everywhere. They are led by Kareem Said, a black militant minister who wants to destroy everything that is racist in the judicial system. As a group, they are not so anti-white, but anti-unfair. Our second group of blacks are the Homeboys, who are essentially street blacks who want to keep up all the bad behavior of the ghetto and administer drug trafficking. Their leadership varies mainly because they are always losing members due to violence. In this group, a character who is acted terribly is Simon Adebisi. Adebisi is an African prisoner who is essentially the most frighteningly evil character alive. This gang as a whole receives help from the Irish side at times and is always at odds with Latinos and Sicilians for drug distribution purposes. Since Oz is mostly black, the Homeboys have more soldiers than any gang inside. <br /> <br /> Latinos and Sicilians, like the Homeboys, have variable leadership due to violent deaths that occur during the show. The Sicilians practically have the most substantial word on how any illegal activity is conducted in Oz. Latinos make their presence known so that they can at least be moving well if they are not in control. Unlike Homeboys, however, these gangs do not have as much internal power struggle and are generally more stable when it comes to drug use. The Irishmen who are mentioned above are a minor gang led by a Ryan O'Reily manipulator and winding. O'Reily always manages to be in good graces with all the powers of drugs and manages to manipulate things in his way whenever he wants. They have no illegal control, but at least they are in good condition with all those who are. <br /> <br /> Among the whitest inmates, we have motorcyclists and Aryans. Motorcyclists are just a bunch of tattooed drug users who help the Aryans get out most of the time. The Aryans are the most hated and hateful gang for any Oz viewer. They are led by Vern Schillinger, who is among the most racist, sickest and sadistic characters anyone will ever see. Both gangs do not control anything illegal, they just let the dark-skinned prisoners see that they are a substantial threat to anyone who thinks that all white prisoners are soft. We also have the Others. The Others is a gang of prisoners from outside who are not necessarily a problem for any other prisoner. In this group, we see Tobias Beecher, a lawyer who accidentally killed a young woman whose life is forever altered by arrest. We also see Augustus Hill, a black man stuck in a wheelchair for killing a cop who tells the show and presents the audience to all prisoners. The character's crimes are shown as they are presented and Augustus lets us know how long they will be in prison. Finally among gangs there are Christians and gays. Christians merely remain religious so they do not go crazy and gays are a bunch of transvestites who are often raped by other inmates. <br /> <br /> This program delves into many issues involving the criminal. justice system and is more explicit than any prison film. As the language is not edited, here we have more racial epithets and swearing than in any other TV show. Augustus Hill's commentary offers us a good way to truly understand every subject involved with Oz. This show as good as it is is not at all for the light to the middle heart. He explicitly shows the use and distribution of drugs by any means possible, rape in prisons, murders, fatal stabbings, and violence in general than anyone else has seen. In my opinion, it is the largest and most influential show ever created, but I can see, at the same time, why other people would be disturbed by this show. If you are interested in jail shows and movies, Oz is a must see.
