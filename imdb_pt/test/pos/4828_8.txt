This work is quite atmospheric, with some surprises and some really scary elements. I found this work more rewarding than I had hoped, given the rotten reviews it gets here on IMDb. The dialogue seems natural and honest (given the circumstances), although the overall execution of the film goes from predictable to clichéd with heroines falling when they should run, and investigating strange noises when they should be locking their doors. Typical horror movie. <br /> <br /> The local characters are some of the worst cliches, portraying the Appalachian natives as freaks challenged by development. The children's characters and the directors are great! The development given is adequate, and Scout Taylor-Compton seems to be developing his talents very well. <br /> <br /> Now, I will not say that this is entirely original or the best thing since the sliced ​​bread (which is not so great by the way), but this is interesting and I do not care much for my 107 minutes back. I would not say this is an amazing movie, anyway, but there are some really good horror elements here. But there are also some really slow points where the development of the plot / character seems superfluous to the whim of the director (or film director). <br /> <br /> In short, this is good for a rainy night but not so good. for a Friday / Saturday night session. <br /> <br /> The price is 7.6 / 10 of ... <br /> The Devil :.
