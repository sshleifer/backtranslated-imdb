Of course the value of this film far outweighs the cost with which the format (mini-dv) implies. In fact, the filmmaker adopts the format and incorporates so ingeniously in the plot that I forgot the fact that I was not watching the typical 35mm film. It has the central appeal of indie films like Clerks and the work of Robert Rodriguez, combined with a fantastic "new view" on the genre of romantic comedy. "This Is Not A Film" is an honest film with honest portraits and, it is a superbly stimulated narrative. There is not a point in this movie where I felt that a scene could have been (or should have been) omitted. Rather, the director attracts incredible performances from truly talented actors and does so in extremely confining circumstances. From page to screen, this film is a valuable and relevant story that reaches many levels (creative, technical or other). I recommend it to everyone who likes cinema or those looking for a bit of charm in a way devoid of average charm.
