I saw this movie on A & E last weekend. The mystery was good, I could not guess the culprit before the end. But I liked the characters and their development much more than the mystery. There was a mystery about some of them, especially George Abernathie, played by the wonderful Michael Fassbender and George's cousin, Susannah. In fact, the story of these two characters left me wanting to know more. From what I have tried to rejoice about Agatha Christie's book of the same title, I do not think this film followed it to the letter. Very good performance of the actors involved, especially Fassbender and the lady who played Cora / companion.
