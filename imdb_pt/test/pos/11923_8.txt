It really is not worthy of a "best picture" consideration, but as the entertainment goes, it does the job! This is one I've watched, with pulse acceleration every time, at least a dozen times. <br /> <br /> Most of these actors were unknown at the time this was done, and we can recognize them from another work. Those who do not have current name recognition probably do not want it. <br /> <br /> This was a fun adventure. Kind of like The Little Rascals, if they had to be serious.
