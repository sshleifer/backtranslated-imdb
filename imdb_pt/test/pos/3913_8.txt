I think anyone dumb enough to risk being a wax doll just to go to a football game or not want to leave the car "to undress" deserves everything that happens to them. The guy, Wade, who "went to a barbershop and asked for the haircut of He-Man", was not my type, but has a very cute scene with his eyebrows and facials waxed. This is a bit too loud for me. <br /> <br /> It's also fun, but not my type is the fat guy from the big sunglasses that looks "like Elton John just gayer", but this whole plot does not lead to anything! <br /> <br /> Blake was hot, I could see him with him if he was not so connected to his girlfriend, who is a fake Paris Hilton in a bad wig (without Chihuahaua in his purse but this would have really been precious). I do not think girls who look like that go to football games anyway. Nick, the car thief, is the sexiest! One of the best parts is where a football lands next to him and instead of throwing him back, he kicks his cigarette down and burns the ball. See, that's the kind of guy he is. He has a sister who looks dumb by borrowing his white wife batter. Her bra straps are showing up for like half the movie! <br /> <br /> Mostly you will just want to shave your legs and never go to football games after you see this.
