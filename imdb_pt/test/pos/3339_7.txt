I want to start my critique by thanking the producers of this documentary, it's obviously a labor of love and I think they did a good job of putting together a nice documentary about a person who had so little information available about him. It definitely has a sense of fan worship, which is a good thing. I had heard of Bruce Haack, but I did not know much about him, and found the beginning of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talking about him, but Bruce Haack himself was kept too far behind. far. I wanted to see this Bruce Haack guy !! I felt as if the makers thought I already knew him as well as these on-screen musicians I did not know, so I felt a little in the dark. <br /> <br /> When Bruce was finally shown into action it was great and gave me a taste of who Bruce Haack was, but it was just a taste. We were treated to more musicians and I felt like I was being told "Look - all those cool musicians are for him so he should be cool!" I really do not care much about the musician's comment about Bruce. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see Bruce as a person. You know, the important things - more interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. More about his life and, yes, his drug use and other issues. I would like to know much more about your "Hackula" project. I wanted to get inside your mind. Even if they did it through "voice of god" comments and photos, everything would be fine. <br /> <br /> The animations were good, but again I felt they were used as fillers, they were anything but to let me hear your music and see some images based on the records in Dimension 5. I I think it was clever and creative, but again ... I wanted to learn more about Bruce! <br /> <br /> Maybe Bruce Haack was so indescribable in real life? <br /> <br /> Anyway - in the end I liked this documentary and felt a kind of sadness for these pioneers and geniuses as incredible as Mr. Haack is forgotten as the march of the seals from time to time. I'm glad this movie is around to educate people about Bruce Haack, even with his flaws.
