The first movie of the Fangoria Festival in Las Vegas and the most challenging. It's not a movie for everyone. Some of the films that followed used predictable classic horror formulas to tell predictable stories. This image seemed determined to do what she wanted. <br /> <br /> Tom Savini showed some comics as the villain on top. He dominated all the scenes he was in, casting his cover as Leslie Neilson playing Dracula. It was great to hear his explanation after the movie. He had a good sense of humor about the role. <br /> <br /> I was glad I did not have too many prejudices because the film offered many surprises. The story was funny and profane and unusual. There was much love squandered in the visual. More importantly, he had a strange advantage in that. Unlike many of the films that followed and tried to use a similar classic horror style, this was a film that used its visual for a purpose. <br /> <br /> There were many films at the Fangoria Festival with larger budgets, but none that dared to be different.
