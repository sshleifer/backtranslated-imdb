Despite its many flaws, Hallmark's 1995 version of Gulliver's Travels is still the best adaptation of Jonathan Swift's classic satirical - largely because it includes not only Gulliver's many travels but also includes satire that is often neglected. Unfortunately, the twin problems of the highly episodic structure of the book and of a budget for television (even if quite generous) remain. The book is a collection of travelers' stories that simply move from one surreal landscape to another, but Simon Moore's adaptation attempts to impose some order on the chaos, providing a parallel plot that sees Gulliver returning to England clearly deeply traumatized and trying to prove his leaving the madhouse where the rival for the affections of his wife committed it. The scenes of England immediately reflect and comment on the voyages, elements that occasionally overflow into the real world. The problem is that during the first hour, it acts more like a distraction, constantly pushing you away from the story as it begins to get interesting. The scenes of Lilliput suffer worse here, with the feeling that home-made scenes are often designed to save them from the more expensive filming - this has to be the only version where we do not see Gulliver pulling Blefescu's fleet back. However, once Gulliver makes his escape, the tone becomes more consistent when he finds his situation reversed and himself the pet of the Utopian giants of Brobdingnag, a guest of the sages of the floating island of Laputa. who are so engrossed in science that they have no common sense, the guest / prisoner of a historian who collects history directly from the source, offered immortality with all its terrible consequences before finally finding a world to which he wanted to belong, if he could convince the sublime Houynhnhms talking horses that he is not an uncivilized Yahoo, each new destiny convinces him of what is an absurd and insignificant species of mankind. Most of the time, it's a gloomier set of travel than expected, with Gulliver's curiosity, common sense, and disappointment stopping him from plunging into hopeless desolation - and this is offset by scenes at the asylum, where makes it more obvious Telling the truth may well have left you genuinely insane. It is in these last scenes that Ted Danson's Gulliver really shines, never more than in an extraordinary speech in which he turns his judgment into a disappointing judgment on the whole human race. <br /> <br /> Being made for television, Yahoos are literally less eschatological here than on the page, but for the most part, it is a more adult treatment than one might expect without a real dumbing down. The cast of stars is certainly impressive, and mostly well used (if a little briefly in some cases) - Mary Steenburgen, James Fox, Peter O'Toole, Edward Woodward, Omar Sharif, Shashi Kapoor, Edward Fox, Ned Beatty, Alfre Woodard, Kristin Scott Thomas and Isabelle Huppert among them. It's hard to imagine the Jack Black version coming close to being as impressive a fraction as this.
