Before seeing this movie, I read the comment of someone who did not like him very much. This I must admit has left me apprehensive to devote 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life to this, but I'm glad I did it. Ryan Gosling is a fantastic actor, I especially loved the believer. Don Cheadle was also fantastic. The film presented an interesting insight into life and death. It was very touching and very sad, but it kept me interested, which most touching stories can not do. It's a reckless movie whether you like it or not, you should see it. It was unique, and I do not think anyone will be able to duplicate it. All the young actors did surprisingly well, considering the subject and the emotion that must have occurred. I was pleasantly surprised.
