If you loved the cyborg movie "Nemesis" of 1993 (erotic, science fiction) then you will love this. I loved the minute the hero Elvis Pompadoured pulls a samurai sword during a gunfight. Like "Nemesis," it occurs in a post-apocalyptic favela of the future. Both are suspense cops where the well-armed hero must face well-armed rebels to solve a conspiracy of powers that are against the unwashed masses. but that's where the similarities end. The ambiguous mayor of dead or alive tries to keep the masses calm with the drugs he sells. The rebels aided by mercenaries and a cyborg try to curb their stifling rule over their subjects. After several unsuccessful attempts to stop the rebels, he sends his police officer to assassinate the rebels. This film follows the trail of most action adventures, but is not afraid to color off the line.
