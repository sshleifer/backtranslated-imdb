Often considered the last "big" movie of Argento, this entry into the giallo canon is unquestionably better than any Argento movie that followed it (although I still have to see "Mother of Tears"), but to call it your last "big" movie may be a bit much. <br /> <br /> The stylistic and stylistic flourishes - the hallmark of all Argento films - are indeed present, with some of their suspense sequences classifying themselves as their best (the "magic eye" sequence). is especially memorable), and Ronnie Taylor's cinematography is excellent (fluorescent lighting is beautiful). <br /> <br /> However, the narrative - which is unpredictable in all Argento films - is missing here. There is indeed a potent sense of mystery and intrigue, but the plot resorts to what is essentially a sequence of murder sequences, with one following the other, leaving no real time to completely build a certain and focused mystery to be solved. All of this results in a climax that is ... well ... anti-climatic, since the film has not invested enough to really make us take care of. <br /> <br /> Regardless, this is simply recommended due to the magisterial direction and beautiful images that Argento conjures up. I would not recommend this as a starting point for the Argento movies, however (for that I would recommend either "Deep Red" or "Suspiria"), but if you liked these or even any giallo then this is a very good addition to your viewing repertoire.
