It's hard to know in which category to put this movie, most of the films set in this period of US history are Western, but here, instead of the wide open western plains, the action is almost entirely confined to a claustrophobic boarding school for girls in Louisiana . The movie begins with Amy, a young girl, walking through the jungle picking mushrooms as she makes her come across the cable John 'McBee' McBurney, a wounded Union soldier, which she takes back to school. We know he's not a particularly good person when he kisses her on the lips to distract her from alerting a confederate patrol who's passing by, even though she told him she was twelve. <br /> <br /> Once back to school opinions are divided over what should be done with the new guest, some feel they should care for it until their wounds are healed, while others believe it is a betrayal do not hand over confederate forces at the first opportunity. The first group prevails and it gradually recovers. In doing so, her presence affects all girls who do not have a man on the scene for a long time, including a young teacher and the boss who seems to have had previous relationships with her own brother. McBee cares about seducing them, emotionally, if not physically, this leads to considerable envy among the girls. <br /> <br /> Although this film has the fifteenth note, it is definitely not for the younger viewers, so much for the sexual content, it is actually shown, but a lot is implied, and for a very tiring scene that made me squirm more than any other scene in any movie I've seen for some time. It's interesting to see Clint Eastwood play against the guy, instead of being heroic his character is both unpleasant and most often at the mercy of the women around him. The performance is solid everywhere, not just from Eastwood, but also from all the actresses, including the young Pamelyn Ferdin who played Amy.
