When I saw Colleen Moore for the first time, it was in the excellent series on silent films called "Hollywood." There she was, in 1980, with her hair slightly tilted, as in the 1920s, a brilliant, witty, charismatic old lady - the very definition of "presence." So I saw her fabulous comedy work in movies like "Ella Cinders" and "Orchids and Ermine." Then the disappointingly somber talker "The Scarlet Letter". And now she's in "The Power and the Glory," delivering a stunning performance of power, working cleverly alongside one of the best actors in the talking cinema - Spencer Tracy. <br /> <br /> I found the film a bit lackluster in terms of history, but Moore and Tracy give such brilliant performances that the story hardly seems to matter. Both actors age from youth to old age during the course of the film - and this is done mostly by acting alone with minimal makeup and hair changes. Moore is almost unrecognizable as the elderly wife, and the scene in which she discovers that her husband is seeing a younger woman is one of the most magnificently realized scenes I have ever seen. She does most of the scene without dialogue, which is where her experience of quiet acting gives her an edge, even on Tracy. Compare this to her delightful comic in another silent sequence when she is a young girl and Tracy is struggling to propose to her. Amazing! What this movie reveals more than anything else is how shameful Hollywood is to let this remarkable actress slip through her fingers and spend most of her life retiring.
