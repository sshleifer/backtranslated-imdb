George Armstrong Custer is known throughout history as an inept general who took his death to the battle of Little Big Horn. "They died in their boots," paints a different picture of General Custer. In this film he is portrayed as a Flamboyant soldier whose mistakes and mistakes are mainly u and for his love of adventure. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays George Armstrong Custer whom we met as a confident recruit at West Point. . Custer quickly distinguishes himself from other cadets by being a poor student who always seems to be in trouble. Somehow this never seems to bother Custer and just seems to confuse him as he does not really know how he gets into such difficult situations. Despite his poor position, he eventually graduates and becomes an officer of the United States Army. By mistake, Custer gets a promotion in the rankings. Before this can be corrected, he leads a Union regiment in the battle against the Confederates. His campaign is successful and Custer becomes an unlikely national hero. Custer returns to his hometown, home to his girlfriend, Libby who is played by Olivia De Havilland. Libby is a sympathetic understanding wife who stands firm on her side and follows him to the frontier by taking the lead in the Seventh Cavalry Regiment. Custer becomes a man of honor who strives to maintain peace with the Native Americans. To prove his intentions, he enters into a treaty with Crazy Horse, the leader of the Sioux. When this treatise is threatened by a conspiracy to spread a false rumor of gold being found in the Black Hills, Custer sacrifices his own life as well as the lives of the men under his command to prevent the slaughter of thousands of innocent settlers. /> <br /> Errol Flynn dominates every scene in which he appears. He successfully portrays Custer as being extravagant, arrogant, romantic and funny, depending on the mood of the scene. Olivia De Havilland's portrayal of Libby Bacon Custer as the love of her life allows us to see her more tender and gentle side. The chemistry between DeHavilland and Flynn, who have performed together in several other films, is so smooth that it almost makes the viewer feel like he's playing and not the parts of Custer and his wife. The other actors portray their characters truly enhance the performances of Flynn and De Havilland. Anthony Quinn as Crazy Horse, Sidney Greenstreet as General Winfield Scott, Arthur Kennedy as Edward Sharp are among the other actors whose roles made this movie entertaining. <br /> <br /> The critic would rate this 4-star movie. Although not historically accurate, it's a lot of fun. The film has a bit of everything. It has adventure, comedy and romance, so it appeals to a wide variety of audiences. The cast of the characters is excellent and the actors give credible performances that make you forget that it is largely fiction-based rather than reality. The reviewer especially likes the Native Americans not to have been shown as villains but only to show them as desirous of protecting their sacred land. <br /> <br />
