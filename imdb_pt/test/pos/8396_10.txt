My mother is as it was with the wind as it may be. She has collector's dishes, Rhett and Scarlett Madame Alexander dolls, GWTW Christmas ornaments, and a GWTW cookbook! My sister and I had seen only pieces of GWTW, but we knew the whole plot of color. On a whim, my sister bought this miniseries thinking that my mother would like it and we took an interest in her after going through the novel a bit. <br /> <br /> Yesterday we decided to watch Gone With The Wind and Scarlett. We started GWTW around 2:30 in the afternoon and finished at 6:30. We started Scarlett soon after. My mom usually goes to bed around 10:00, she ended up staying until 1:30 with us to finish! We're riveted! I like how the movie begins at Melanie's funeral, exactly where Scarlett stopped, saying, "I'll think about it tomorrow." Scarlett does not stay in Georgia for long, she flees to Charleston in her quest to regain it. Rhett is not happy when he finds Scarlett in his house, so he leaves for the family plantation. Scarlett, being Scarlett, follows him and they finally agree to put aside their quarrels for a while in order to keep the gossip in the distance. Rhett begins to like his company again and takes her to his boat. A storm comes and they sink. He helps her to swim to the shore of some island. Afraid that she has died, Rhett is anxious until she wakes up. When she does, both get involved in the moment and make love. Scarlett wakes up the next day in Charleston, but Rhett wrote that he thinks it best never to see each other again. Scarlett is heartbroken, and when she does, she does stupid things, in which case she is seen by Anne Hampton going alone to a hotel room with Ashley. Nothing happens, but her reputation is tarnished, so Scarlett goes to Savannah with her two aunts and unmarried aunts. She soon discovers that she is pregnant and decides to wait for the right time to tell Rhett. While in Savannah she meets many of her relatives O'Hara and grows up to like a particular cousin a Colum father. She soon gets her divorce notice from Rhett and decides she will never tell him about her baby just to annoy him. Typical Scarlett. <br /> <br /> She decides to go to Ireland to make sure that Rhett can never figure out his condition. She meets many relatives and buys a beautiful Ballyhara ancestral home. During this time, Rhett is courting Anne. It's at Halloween when Scarlett gets word that Rhett remarried, she goes into labor that night. <br /> <br /> The film jumps to a year later and Scarlett is very happy with her beautiful daughter Kat. She is being pursued by Lord Richard Fenton, who is really a bad man, forcing a young girl named Mary Boyle to sleep with him. Scarlett meets Rhett and Anne again at a horse fair. After a riding accident, Scarlett talks to Anne and discovers that she and Rhett are going to have a baby. Heartbroken again, Scarlett leaves and heads to Dublin with Fenton. There she cultivates a relationship with him, as I said, she does stupid things when she's heartbroken. <br /> Mary Boyle has discovered that she is pregnant and asks Colum for help. The priest asks Fenton to help the girl and Fenton kills him after Colum threatens to tell Scarlett. Fenton convinces Scarlett to go to London with him to escape his pain over Colum's death. Maria asks to go with her. Back in Charleston, Anne died of yellow fever. It is clear that she never gave Rhett a child. <br /> <br /> In London, Scarlett sees the true colors of Fenton after he hurts her when she does not feel like sleeping with him. Fenton rapes her after she says she never wants to see him again. She falls unconscious afterwards and when she wakes up Fenton was stabbed to death. Scarlett is charged with her murder. <br /> <br /> Rhett hears about it and rushes to England with Sally in tow. Scared of the gallows, Scarlett has no choice but to tell Rhett about her daughter. Rhett is furious with her for keeping such a secret, but stays to help her. Mary Boyle, the real killer, can not be found. Scarlett is considered guilty, but Mary finally arrives to declare her innocence. After promising to help Mary, Scarlett leaves with Rhett for Ireland because, as he says, "the time has come to familiarize myself with my daughter." The scene in which he sees Kat for the first time is absolutely beautiful. In Ireland, Rhett sees how much Scarlett has changed and the two finally completely reconcile and admit that they still love each other deeply. <br /> <br /> After seeing GWTW, I'll say yes, Vivian Leigh was a better Scarlett, but I liked Scarlett's character in this movie than the first. The reason is that in GWTW you do not know why you like Scarlett. She is so cruel to Rhett and arrogant and spoiled, but you like her spirited spirit. In Scarlett, you see how much she has changed. Oh she's still in her lap, but she's not arrogant anymore. You see how she becomes a true mother to Kat and a generous person to the poor people of Ireland. Joanne Whalley does and great job playing this new side of Scarlett. Timothy Dalton is not Clark Gable, but sometimes you swear you can see the original Rhett in it. <br /> <br /> If you just sit and compare Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton with Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable, you will surely enjoy this movie. It's a chance to compare to Scarlett from yesterday, to what she becomes after "tomorrow."
