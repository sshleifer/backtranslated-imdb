* Smaller spoilers * I just wanted to say that for those who like entertainment baseball movies, this is definitely in my top three. Only Little Big League and Major League can compete with this in my mind. I would also like to commend the writers of this film for creating such a nice dialogue! Without being too specific, I would say the lines are very suitable for each character. Tom Selleck seemed to have no problem creating a realistic character as a ball player. His animosity for playing abroad in Japan sets the tone for comic but significant interactions with his new team, the Dragons. He must adjust to life in Japan ("First you wash, THEN you bathe!") He finally sees eye to eye with his trainer and sets his goals to have that last season of greatness, albeit in a very different environment imagined! So for any baseball fan, or anyone who wants to watch a good baseball movie, Mr. Baseball will not disappoint you!
