Great movie! The soundtrack is amazing! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his own time, even in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this movie! The movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The soundtrack written by Sir Elton complements the film for a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song "Honey Roll" and the poem "I Want to Do My Work Today" by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible! Congrats to everyone involved with this fantastic movie! It was no surprise that many of the people involved with this film became the best in their field.
