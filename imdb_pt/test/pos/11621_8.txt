The film "... And the Earth did not swallow it," based on Tomas Rivera's book, is a film that opens the eyes to most people. He talks about the exploitation by which migrant rural workers pass to survive. <br /> <br /> Sergio Perez uses Impressionist techniques to describe Rivera's story. He uses sienna and grayscale effects to depict some of the scenes, and he uses specific photographic techniques to make the scenes seem to happen in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Perez also brings the film to life using timely music , including balladeering and guitar. <br /> <br /> I feel like it's a good movie to see because it shows in detail how migrant farmworkers live, what they do for entertainment and their beliefs.
