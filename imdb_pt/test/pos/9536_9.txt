The book "The Railway Children" is a children's book published in 1906 by Edith Nesbit, a former British socialist who had very strong opinions about the importance of family values ​​for the education of children, and the story she was supposed to have wanted to be contemporary. . Surprisingly, it seems to hold a significant appeal to children today, one hundred years later. <br /> <br /> A cinematic adaptation of a classic Edwardian infantile story with the leading roles of children does not seem very exciting to most movie goers these days. But a very good performance by Jenny Agutter who (almost at the beginning of her long and distinguished acting career) played the older girl, Roberta (Bobby), combined with notable work by screenwriter and director Lionel Jeffries and excellent photography Arthur Ibbetson , made this a movie that is not yet to be wasted, and which most of its viewers find quite memorable. It is notable that this book, set in the year 1905, was filmed five times between 1951 and 2000 (four of them by the BBC for British television), and all these versions are not only still much admired, but also very respected. (something users' comments in this database will confirm), even though this may seem almost inconceivable to a nostalgic story designed to appeal primarily to children. As I have not seen the four versions of the BBC for TV, these comments relate exclusively to the 1970 film version produced for theatrical release. Unlike most children's book films, "The Railway Children" may appeal more to adults than to children. The structure of family life has changed so much in the past century that many children may feel totally lost by the way it is portrayed in the film, while many older adults may find it has a considerable nostalgic appeal. Perhaps compensating for this, the children featured in the film are full of life and vitality, while the adult characters, though well-rounded, tend to be mostly "plush shirts." The story is mature, it deals with love, support and encouragement, not only timeless but able to appeal to all ages. It can be reasonably described as sentimental and more than a little idealized, but it is never in any way malicious, and this is rarely justified. The adjective 'lifts' fits like a glove. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Ahead. The film begins with his upper-middle-class Edwardian family celebrating Christmas in a comfortable, rather spacious London home when two unexpected visitors call and bring Dad (who is a government graduate) with them. The mother has to move to a very small house next to the railroad in a remote part of Yorkshire and the children gradually build a new life associated mainly with the railroad and the few passing trains. This life is quite agitated in small ways and the eldest daughter, Bobby, grows rapidly as she takes on more responsibilities from her mother. At one point she avoids an accident on the train when her sharp eyes realize that a landslide has created a natural danger. The father's story never gets much emphasis, but it is never forgotten and gradually it becomes apparent that he is imprisoned and suspected of treason. Finally these suspicions are clarified (do not tell us how or why) and he reappears unexpectedly at the local station to join his family. <br /> <br /> For many years, this movie was not available in any home video format. In North America, but Anchor Bay created a DVD of it three years ago, they clearly recognized that this simple movie has not yet lost its appeal. For anyone who does not already have one, I strongly recommend that you get a copy of this DVD while it is still available - it is very unlikely that you will be disappointed unless you have become totally skeptical, or your minimum requirements for a movie include buckets of blood and / or scenes of intense sex.
