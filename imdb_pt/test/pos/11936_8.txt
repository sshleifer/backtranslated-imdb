Colombian terrorists hold a US military school hostage until their demands are met. Students decide to fight back. Will they be able to do it? <br /> <br /> Silly premise, but the movie really works. The group of boys who fought were all in vogue when the movie came out in 1991: Sean Astin (looking very cute); Wil Wheaton (looking miserable); Keith Coogan; George Perez (the Latin token who is very handsome, very muscular and is shown mostly in nothing but tight underwear); YOU. Russell (the symbolic black guy) and Shawn Phelan. None of them are very good actors (except Astin), but who cares? This is an irrational action movie. The only other good performances are Denholm Elliott (having a ball as the director) and Louis Gossett Jr. as the dean. <br /> <br /> Other than that - there is a lot of action, suspense, explosions and little brains. . In other words --- FUN! Only complaint (and this is minor) - is a bit too long (there are three endings) and there is a lot of casual, bloody violence (the R rating was well deserved). Still, I enjoyed it a lot.
