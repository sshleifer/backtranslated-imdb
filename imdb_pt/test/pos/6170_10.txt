Since I grew up in Czechoslovakia, I was following the story of RAF pilots and crews in World War II in Britain, their tragic stories and tragedies, both in combat and in communist prisons and camps. This is undoubtedly more than an obscure chapter in our history, although the fact that those brave men who are able to go through all this and recover afterwards is incredible. For all the people who want to see a great movie ... this is the one! During a recent visit from the Czech Republic, I saw this movie three times in three days (they are playing for three days ... otherwise I will see it some more times! Worth it!) I hope you enjoy it, although it requires a little more reasoning and knowledge of basic information behind the story, in the same way that the movie "Kolya" was. It's not a simple movie because of its deep story, and the way it is told will probably make you cry ... this happened to me three times in a row ... Zdenek Sverak did as always a great script, his son Jan did a great job movie and the cast Undoubtedly, everyone did a great job, I was impressed with Ondrej Vetchy, for the great role played by Oldrich Kaiser and all the other actors who made this movie simply GREAT !!! If this is not an Oscar nomination, I think I'm going to be on strike in Holywood.
