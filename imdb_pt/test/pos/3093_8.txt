Arguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog has pushed the boundaries of cinema perhaps more than any other commercial filmmaker. I've known Herzog for a few decades and I've never been impressed with the man and his work. Last year I went to see the Rescue Dawn and was a bit surprised at how mainstream the film was, but I could not help imagining Herzog taking his actors and his crew to the royal jungle, not just to make the film, but to live it. No other filmmaker is so maddened by the purity of the filmmaking process, and the subsequent knowledge of productions like Fitzcarraldo has been forged in the film legend. <br /> <br /> Today I sat down to Fata Morgana, a 1969 Herzog film that could be described as an allegorical film card. Without researching the actual sites, I presume it was filmed somewhere in Africa, both on the coast and in the desert, a region that could have been the cradle of the infantile man, of the infantile civilization, of the infantile life on Earth. It is these origins, the Biblical notion of the Garden of Eden and the Apocalypse with which Herzog cares, as expressed by the narration dispensed throughout the 79 minutes of duration. <br /> <br /> Watching FM I could not help but feel that I was a passenger on a deep journey. Following the opening, the title is translated as "Mirage" and Herzog juxtaposes this translation with multiple replicates of commercial jets landing on an airstrip. These images are perverted, their tridimensionality crushed by a long lens, piling layers of escape, heat waves and aberrations of light, one on top of the other. The effect led me to conclude: things are not as they seem. <br /> <br /> The FM is divided into three very distinct chapters: 1) Creation, 2) Paradise, and 3) The Golden Age. Chapter one opens with countless languorous images, where dark and arid landscapes crack, dead animals rot, broken shells of crashed airplanes, and abandoned cars disintegrate slowly in the desert sun. The people who inhabit this inhospitable landscape are prisoners of the desert, impertinent, without smiles and apparent. The narration speaks of a time before life, a time when the canvas of the earth was blank and all that existed were the heavens. While the narrative refers to a simpler and purer age, a portrait of a boy holding a fox-like animal by the throat evokes a chilling representation of man's cruel and cruel attempt to force dominion over nature. <br /> <br /> In the next chapter, we are introduced to more of the same, but images and people are more lively and seem infused with a minimum of life and vitality. We heard a conversation from a biologist with glasses about the difficulty that a monitor lizard has in hunting prey in a lifeless environment. While holding the wriggling monitor, his tongue flicks the flies, he also describes how difficult it is to catch these creatures in the scorching heat of 140 degrees. The parallel is duly noted and Herzog continues to explore this concept through repeated and sincere portrayals of individuals battered by the sun, the desert, and the laborious efforts required to exist in this hard kingdom. He also pushes forward the theme that, if not in control, man asserts his control over his environment and not always in the most agreeable way. <br /> <br /> The last chapter takes us out of the blast furnace of the desert. the most familiar territory of Herzog peopled by eccentrics and absurd behavior. No one seems to have a more effective symbiotic relationship with the eccentrics of the world than Herzog - possibly that's when he feels more at home. Like Errol Morris, Herzog chooses to put her camera in a position as objective as possible before letting the film roll. Herzog's subsequent flirtation with the subject is the result of his continuing to film well beyond the point where most directors would have shouted the cut. As Morris does, this extended roll surpasses the "on" moment that the subjects feel obligated to offer and, through their discomfort of being pushed into overtime, their facade gives way to something real. The funniest picture in this chapter is that of a 2-person band playing a strange, polka-type song that Herzog recycles throughout this chapter. The band's drummer wears the same glasses as the biologist, as does another guy doing a magic trick, begging the question: what's with the glasses? They definitely add some lightness to the film, but one has to wonder if they have any meaning or deeper meaning, or if this is just one more example of Herzog's playfulness. <br /> <br /> The narration aside, Herzog uses folk and blues music as soundtrack to the experimental documentary. Leonard Cohen occupies the longest time on screen, two of his wonderfully melancholic songs "So Long Marianne" and "Suzanne." perfectly accompany the scrolling scenery, adding to the convincing sense that we are really together for the ride. At the end of the journey, Herzog returns to one of the many shots that recur throughout the film: the distant setting of a lonely vehicle crossing the endless desert enveloped by a water mirage that fills the horizon. Despite the general desolation of FM, the crescendo of the film and the motive of the mirage leave you with a hopeful spirit, believing that, despite everything, life will persevere and possibly even flourish. <br /> <br /> Have finished writing this post. , I referred FM to find out that Herzog filmed in Cameroon in the Sahara just weeks after a bloody coup. Faithful to his legend, Herzog and his team were arrested, beaten, and arrested. While imprisoned, Herzog fell ill with schistosomiasis, a parasite of blood. It's really hard not to love a movie as hypnotic and austere as Fata Morgana; knowing that the filmmaker was willing to die to do this only makes you respect even more. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
