If you want to see a brilliant performance of the Mikado, played perfectly with time and style experienced, do not watch this version. If you want to see a hammy version with Eric Idle having fun in the private club society of the English gentlemen of 1930, this is the one to watch. It's a lot of fun and a good introduction to Gilbert and Sullivan, but after that, hurry up and rent the Canadian version of Stratford. You will see the difference between good and great. No one is better than Brian McDonald and the Stratford group.
