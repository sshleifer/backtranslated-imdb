The Ascension (1977) <br /> <br /> Larisa Shepitko is a name that few know. Her brilliant career as a director lasted only a decade, abruptly ended by a tragic car accident. Despite her short career, she managed to create some of the best Soviet films of her time. His latest film, The Ascent, is widely regarded as one of the best Soviet films of the 1970s. However, his work remained in obscurity over the ensuing years, usually only available on rare and poor video copies. This has now changed thanks to the Criterion staff. They released two of Shepitko's best works through her Eclipse-Wings department, and her penultimate masterpiece The Ascent. Placed during the darkest days of World War II in rural Russia, two partisans walk the earth in search of food after their party is attacked by Nazi patrols. They are originally just to go to a nearby farm, but when they arrive they think it was razed by the Germans. Not wanting to return empty-handed, they remain in a deep enemy territory. Along the way, they must confront not only the enemy soldiers, but the harsh conditions of the Russian plains, potential betrayal and their own souls. <br /> <br /> The film does not fit into simplified devices or destinations. It addresses difficult issues with painful rationality. It never takes the easy way or gives us comforting answers. The second half of the movie is full of moral dilemmas. Shepitko shows us the intimate horrors of the war through the internal conflict between Russian colleagues - those who collaborated and those who fought back. Although she shows the contributors how the light jumps, it also shows why many resort to such tactics - survival. <br /> <br /> The film contains several religious references, particularly to lead to the crucifixion. This is a spiritual journey in the hearts, souls and minds of the two partisans and those they encounter. Shepitko and her cinematographer capture the journey in beautiful black-and-white photographs. The camera moves in long planes, similar to the camera work of another of Russia's greatest filmmakers, Andrei Tarkovsky. Shepitko, like many others, was clearly influenced by Tarkovsky's style, and Ascent takes some of his rhythmic notes from Ivan's Childhood. It's a stunning film to see, and it does a fantastic job of capturing the cold and terrifying atmosphere of occupied Russia. <br /> <br /> Shepitko's husband would pay homage to his great film a decade later. Elem Klimov made his own war masterpiece with one of the biggest movies I've ever seen - Come and see. The story and themes of this film were clearly influenced by The Ascent. Although this film is also quite obscure, it received much more attention than any other Shepitko film. This, however, served as a bridge to Shepitko, and has been one of the best aids to keeping her work alive. <br /> <br /> The Ascent is a truly magnificent film, and it rightly must be considered one of the best films of the Seventies. It's impressive cinematography is inspiring; his mood is frighteningly authentic; and his lessons are unforgettable. It is, in any definition of the word, nothing short of a masterpiece. Too bad that Shepitko's career was interrupted by the time it reached its peak.
