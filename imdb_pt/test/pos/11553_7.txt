I agree with "johnlewis" who said there is a lot going on between the lines in this movie. While I think the pace of this movie could be improved, I think the complexity of the relationships between the characters is fascinating. <br /> <br /> Examples: <br /> <br /> Is Pierre going to marry your cousin, although your love for her seems very cousin? <br /> <br /> Pierre and his stepmother have a rather ... curious relationship. <br /> <br /> Pierre, Lucie and Thibault seem to have a triangular relationship, and the real points of the triangle are not quite right ... <br /> <br /> Lucie's brother is a little eunuch, or is it? <br /> <br /> And Isabelle, who is she really ?? <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it was worth it. An interesting movie that makes me want to read Melville.
