So real and surreal, all in one. I remember feeling like Tessa. Heck, I remember being Tessa. This was a beautiful vignette from a relationship that ended. I especially liked the tangent protesters. It's good to see the symbolism in a movie without being hit in the head with it. If you have the chance to see this, accept it. It's worth the 30 minutes.
