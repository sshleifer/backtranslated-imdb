The kite runner is undoubtedly one of the most amazing books I've read in the recent past. I may have had very high expectations of the film, but nevertheless, the film was good, the whole scenario seemed realistic. nothing was meant for fantasy. the dialogues were not very attractive or powerful, they were right. The film was not a bad experience, especially in the last 15 minutes, where it got very exciting and even the most difficult man would probably cry. But my imagination was much better than the movie ... I cried more reading the novel than watching the movie. but in general a good movie to see those who are not readers. but readers, romance would be a better experience, so if at all you want to see the movie, read the novel first and then compare it to the movie.
