Jay Craven's critically-overlooked film is a sober breath of fresh air in the generally narcissistic world and derived from independent cinema. First of all, photography is pure aesthetic pleasure, capturing all the dark beauty of northern New England in late fall (director of photography Paul Ryan made the 2nd unit on Malick's Sky Days). Second, the performances are uniformly excellent - Rip Torn's Noel Lourdes is irascibly charming and the Bangor do Tantoo Cardinal is both sensitive and exuberant, not to mention an excellent supporting cast. Overall, it is a tribute to the narrative force of the film that the story maintains a strong and lively rhythm while still unfolding in its own time, and the film comes to a conclusion, natural and genuine, which, however, does not seem expected. This is one of the rare cells of dignity in the world of independent film, a film that explores a small part of the intersection between humans and history.
