The "good news" is that the circus is in the city. The "bad news" is about the underground house of Bugs Bunny. He wakes up when his place shakes as an earthquake struck, when workers hit stakes on the ground and elephants pass by, etc. <br /> <br /> To be more specific, the lions cage is placed exactly on the insects. hole. The lion sniffs food, and through the process of elimination, discovers that it is a rabbit. Insects, curious about what the whole racket is, snakes through the tunnel and ends up in the lion's mouth. <br /> <br /> I'll say it for BB: he's totally fearless, at least in this cartoon, and for at least 30 seconds. When he falls on himself, he runs like crazy and we have a lion battle against a rabbit the rest of the way. Again, Bugs faces a stupid opponent, one he calls "Nero," but the lion is fierce and Bugs will need all of his judgment and his somewhat false bravado to ward off that beast. <br /> <br /> About half of the jokes are stupid and the other half funny but always fast, colorful and good enough to recommend. I mean, it's not every day that you can see a lion on a trapeze or do a hula dance!
