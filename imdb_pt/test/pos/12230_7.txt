"A Fare to Remember" is a wholly derivative movie, almost ridiculous but has a warmth about it that makes it a very effective and optimistic holiday film. He is starring a newcomer, Challen Kates, as a high-powered advertising executive who, shortly before his wedding, has to run from Los Angeles to Seattle to keep a client who has rejected all other presentations. She has had transportation difficulties from the beginning and apparently has no money. This is stupid first thing - were not ATMs nowhere? She must make a fortune. Anyway, she meets a taxi driver (Warner) who looks like a homeless man, and he takes her to her presentation and when she leaves with a big box of jerky (the client's product), he's there to take it her to the airport. All flights are canceled, so to get to Los Angeles for your wedding, she hires you to take her there. <br /> <br /> Along the way, they unite and learn from each other. It's a very sweet movie, although there's absolutely nothing new - it combines "Six Days and Seven Nights" and a few other movies. But the chemistry between the stars is good, they are nice and the acting is good. Look for Jerry Springer as the head of the beef jerky company and a special guest of Karl Malden. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie to spend on vacation. It is in the time of life.
