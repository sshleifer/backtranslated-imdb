I can never imagine if this is the Artiest Soap Opera ever produced, or the Soapiest Art Movie. No matter, John Seale's cinematography is sweeping. Ondaatje's novel is not reduced, but for once, elevated to the cinema. If there is a flaw, it's in the original novel, not Anthony Minghella's beautiful movie. Anyone who has a problem with its extension almost certainly has not read the book and probably can not read. I do not like repeating adjectives, but snatching serves purpose. <br /> <br /> In addition to the plot, the players stand out. But it is the Australian sensation of light and shadow that ultimately triumphs. Like some Dutch anti-Macedonian master, Seale uses a blast of light, where Van Rijn would use shadow. One can weep for such magnificent cinematography.
