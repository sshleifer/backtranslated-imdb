Dude, it's great to see the young woman and the Restless star, Melody Thomas Scott, as something other than the fickle Nikki Newman! A doctor with no less brain! And super nice to see her with the likes of gorgeous Lorenzo Lamas instead of Victor Newman! <br /> <br /> Mel plays a university professor of microbiology who goes to the islands with her son for spring break, only to find herself prisoner on the island infested by a rapidly spreading virus. For her, there is the handsome character played by Lorenzo, who has a daughter who is only the age of his son. Mel shines, as does Lorenzo with a bit of the exaggeration of the younger couple. Interesting premise in these times of chemical and biological terrorism. Worth seeing, especially for fans of Y & R.
