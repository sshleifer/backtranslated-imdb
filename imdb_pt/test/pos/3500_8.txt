By persuading the prime minister to support the totally inadequate Ali G as candidate for Staines in local elections, nasty Chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit the current leader of his party by allowing him to take power. To his surprise, however, the plan goes awry, Ali is embraced by the nation, and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try to secure his political future. <br /> <br /> Pueri, coarse, misogynist and always scandalous. : Ali G Indahouse, the big-screen debut of the middle-class gangsta by Sascha Baron Cohen of Berkshire, is all that and more, which means it's my kind of movie. Obviously, there are those who simply will not understand the joke, and certainly there will be people who will find jokes about oral sex, homosexuality, recreational drug use, heavy pornography and the Queen's offensive extreme regions ( it goes without saying that it should be far away!), but if you find that such juvenile humor is hilarious, you are a fan of Baron Cohen in general, or just want to see the hot Rhona Mitra in panties (and you shudder because she's fine !), so I totally recommend spending an hour and a half in the company of Ali G and West S It is massive. <br /> <br /> They are evil!
