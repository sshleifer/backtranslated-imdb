I still remember seeing Satya for the first time. I was completely delighted. Here was a movie that was very different from the other Gangster movies I had seen. So realistic, so Mumbaiyya and so believable. Despite "Company" (which was a very good effort) and "Vaastav" (more focused on the journey of the protagonist) who came close, no underworld film could live up to Satya. <br /> <br /> When I watched Ab Tak 56 for the first time, I said to myself, "Indian Cops have their own 'Satya' now." Nietzsche's quote in the beginning itself says that this is not an ordinary movie. What impresses you about the "date" at the beginning of the movie is the laid-back way it's performed. There is a cold and scary feeling because you realize that this is part of their routine. Ab Tak 56 is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready. do whatever it takes to get rid of criminals when all legal means are exhausted. With simple shots and camera angles, director Shimit Amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives the film a realistic and rough feel. Editing seems non-existent and therefore effective. The music is also awesome and amazing and stays with you long after you leave the movies. <br /> <br /> But for me, what really drives the cake are the dialogues and the acting superlative of each character. . Sandeep Srivastava did a brilliant job as a dialogue writer. If I start listing my favorite dialogues, I'm afraid I'll end up rewriting the entire script of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film boasts some stellar performances. Yashpal Sharma is detestable as sub-inspector Imtiaz Siddiqui and Jeeva is joint commissioner Suchak. Revathi, Hrishita Bhatt, Mohan Agashe and Kunal Vijaykar have small roles that play to perfection. Nakul Vaid as the rookie Jatin Shukla was a revelation. The scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the injured gangster? Oh my gosh! He learns under the tutelage of Sadhu Aghashe and firmly believes in him. <br /> <br /> Prasad Purandhare as Zameer Zafar is impressive. His conversations with Sadhu are true jewels of dialogue writing. Never before in Indian cinema has any movie brought such a beautiful relationship between a cop and a gangster. <br /> <br /> Not that I was not a fan of Nana Patekar before this movie, but this movie made me a fan of a devotee. Nana as Inspector Sadhu Agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best I have ever seen in Hindi cinema. The way he talks with his expressions, the way he hits his cigar on the way, sips his tea? It's almost as if Nana could not do anything wrong. He is at his best in every single scene, especially when he is teaching Jatin about how the police force works. His cool and composed way of doing things is scary at times. His dialogue and body language convinced me that he is one of the best actors in the country. It's a shame that he has not won any popular awards for this. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, Shimit Amin does a brilliant job of bringing all that talent together and exploring them to the fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of Indian cinema. In an industry that is sickly accustomed to raising stories from here and there, Amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment. I just hope he continues the great work and do not give in to Bollywood! If he can do that, I'm sure he'll be a force to be reckoned with for years to come.
