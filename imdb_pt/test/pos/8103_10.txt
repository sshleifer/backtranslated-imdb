"The Great Dictator" is undoubtedly one of Charlie Chaplin's best-known films. It is notorious for its blatant satire of Adolf Hitler and Nazism. Until I saw it, I only knew of his fame. Now I know how much the movie deserves. <br /> <br /> The film basically shows the exploits of the somewhat embarrassed, ambitious, short-fused and impressive dictator of Tomania, Adenoid Hynkel; and with him, his close and beloved staff: Field-Marshall Herring and Herr Garbitsch. In addition, it involves the exploits of an amnesiac, emotional and often clumsy Jewish barber, a World War I veteran. <br /> <br /> Stopping with the plot, I would say that this movie has several qualities that make it unique and wonderful. While comedy is decidedly both verbal and theatrical and incidental, the whole film shows how serious Nazism or aggressive nationalism is as a subject with multiple interludes. Chaplin's impeccable acting skills vary a lot in the film, he continues to accelerate until he explodes. Paulette Goddard's position as an ambitious pretender Jew and Henry Daniell's delivery of nasal lines, calm as Death-serious-as-heart attack, provide a marvelous sight. <br /> <br /> One aspect of the film is what makes it so special: it does not punch. It is not "shrouded", there is no business being covered up. It is an "obvious," obvious, blatant, obvious to Hitler and Nazism. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, watch it. Just watch, you'll see.
