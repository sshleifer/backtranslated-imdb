I had never seen the original Death Wish in Death Wish I (movie). However, Death Wish 3 was the movie very interested. The well-known vigilante, Paul Kersey, tried to visit his friend, Charlie, but he only visited for a few minutes before dying, because Charlie did not pay protection to the huge underground gang infamously led by Manny Franker. After some fighting during his time in jail, Kersey learned that Franker, with whom he fought in jail, had his own agenda to make New York City in hell (and also its influence) by sending his henchmen to set the crime all times, everywhere, every day. Due to the chance given by Insp. Richard Shriker, who knows his profile well and loves him very much. Kersey decided to wage war with Franker and his gang. <br /> <br /> I accepted that Death Wish III was one of the most direct and extreme violence action movies I had ever seen of the past. This movie used the very straightforward way to tell the story. No heavy story and less unnecessary scenes, which was the only merit of the film. In the next issue, Violence was used extensively in the film. I believed that many viewers might like the Death Wish III action scene because it showed the brutal, extreme and explosive action of every minute of the film, especially the climax of the film and the death of Manny Franker, who I thought was the scene action. <br /> <br /> About the cast, I think everyone was good and went through their role. Charles Bronson made everyone believe he's still great as Paul Kersey. He did not look like the "big old cat," but the great watchman. Gavan O'Herlihy also did his job very well. His main villain role in the film made him look nasty and look like the big bad guy. However, the role of Kathryn Davis in this film was pathetic. She did not look like the main character. I thought she appeared only two or three scenes before being killed by Franker and his follower to make it hot on Paul Kersey. She could have more paper to show up. <br /> <br /> For my review, the straightedge style and extreme violence made this movie great for fans of extreme action movies. Fast-paced with the back and Forth style made this movie very keen to watch. However, this movie had some silly scene and some plot hole. First, the scene in which Insp.Shriker confronted Paul Kersey for the first time. It was very cheesy because you attacked your favorite face before you wanted him to help, it's similar to how you punch a guy before trying to lend him some money. Haha! This is such a joke! Although, I liked the turnaround when Insp.Shriker was shown later that he helped Kersey, because at first, Shriker looked like the villain a lot because of his act of Kersey, but when the movie went to climax, everything was cleared that he did not had hidden agenda with Kersey. <br /> <br /> In another case, the final scene of the movie was late. He stumbles on all the feelings because it ended up very easy. The members of Franker's gang seemed unbelievable after they discovered Franker was dead before his girlfriend and other followers decided to escape. Finally, Insp.Shriker allowed Paul Kersey to fly from his city before the police caught him. I thought that this final scene style could be found in many Cannon Film movies, but I do not like it. <br /> <br /> For the summary, I'm fine with Death Wish 3 because of my explanation that I typed first. The cast, and the action was very good and so extreme, even had some scene that I do not like. Straightedge and Extreme of Violence may be the best short description of this movie.
