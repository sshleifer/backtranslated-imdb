Despite the New York scene and the New York characters, 'Summer in the City' is not an American movie, it's better than that. What is most unusual is the mix of styles and genres. Director Niami's shows a clever twist on the combination of comedy with tragedy, pathos with drama. <br /> <br /> The secret of Niami's success seems to be a miscellany of great characters - each could have his own film built around them - and then filling them with wonderfully accomplished performances of one of the most wonderfully eclectic cast that someone would fight to find in the same country, much less in the same film, from Bai Ling to Ornella Muti, Robert Burke to Peter Stormare who here reveals that he has much more in it than the stereotypes of bad guys he plays in Hollywood pictures. Even Sandra Bernhard is funny here! <br /> <br /> An added bonus, cream on the substantial cake, is the soundtrack of John Cale.
