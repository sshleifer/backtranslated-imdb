This film was overshadowed by 'The Jackal' (Bruce Willis, Richard Gere) which was released the same year. Having seen both films, I can honestly say that this is the top film. <br /> <br /> Granted, the production value of 'The Jackal' was very good, it probably had a substantially larger budget. However, 'The Assignment' is well written and has a fascinating history. Aiden Quinn is flawless in two roles. Aiden Quinn and director Christian Duguay have done a great job establishing a deep, multi-layered relationship between the main character and his family. I particularly liked the ending. <br /> <br /> I remembered the character of Jack Ryan in the Tom Clancy films. Both are naval officers in unbelievably dangerous roles, while secretly working in the name of national security. And yet, both Harrison Ford and Aidan Quinn reveal their respective characters as heroes who manage to be virile and gentle. They have a genuine tenderness and vulnerability in their relationships with their families. <br /> <br /> What I do not understand is how the opinions of everyone who posted in this movie (including myself) can be far more positive than the warm reception the film received. This is a film that has enough complexity and subtlety to remain attractive after multiple views. If you are a fan of espionage movies, I highly recommend 'The Assignment' with enthusiasm.
