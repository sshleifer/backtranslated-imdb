"The Cell" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying journey not only to the vast mind of a serial killer, but also to a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if humans unleash their uninhibited imagination. This is daring at work, pushing away thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year so far. <br /> <br /> I have read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere, of any style, and not substance to misunderstood characters and bad performers. To criticize negatively this film is to miss the mark. This film can be a landmark, a tradition where future films will come. "The Cell" has just opened the door to another world of the imagination. So we can slam the door in the face and tell her and director Tarsem Singh that we do not want any more? Personally, I would much rather receive another Tarsem movie, and I would love to see someone try to challenge you. <br /> <br /> We've all heard of getting into the mind of a serial killer, and yes, I agree that the "genre" is a little overwhelmed. The 1990s were full of movies trying to portray what makes serial killers attack; some of them worked, but most failed. But "The Cell" does not go down the same path, we are given a new twist, we are physically transported to the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject ever studied. <br /> <I like how the movie does not bother us with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez really gets into someone else's brain. Instead, she just lies down on a lab table and is involved with what looks like very long Twizzlers and turns to another entity. "The Cell" wants to let you "see" what is all and not "how" all this, and I think that's what some people do not like. It's true that I like explanations with my films, but when a movie ventures into a new terrain, you should let it do what it wants and simply accept it. <br /> <br /> I noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality, perhaps to contrast the bright visuals when inside the other's brain. However, the design of the setting was simply amazing. I would not be surprised if this movie took home a few Oscars in cinematography, best costumes, best director and the like. If it were up to me, at least it would be nominated for best picture. <br /> <br /> I have noticed that I have repeated myself. Not because there is nothing else to say, but because I can not emphasize enough how fantastic I thought "The Cell" was. If you enter the movie with a very open mind and get carried away by wonders and a feast of eye-popping, you will have a guaranteed good time. I think this movie was a bit much for some people, writing as "weird" or "crazy." I am very attached to the psychology and imagination of the human mind, so it was in my alley. Leaving the theater, I heard a member of the audience say, "Whoever made that movie certainly did a lot of good drugs." If so, I want what he was smoking. <br /> <br /> **** (out of 4)
