This is a new Barbie movie. The graphics were very good. They made the film seem partially realistic. I used to do ballet and this movie made me want to continue. This movie was like a Cinderella movie, but a little different. A father of 12 princesses gets very sick. Your cousin poisons you and wants the throne. The girls find a secret magical land thanks to the stories of their dead mother. It is up to them to save their father and society. With the help of his handsome prince. It was a funny movie and me and my friend had fun watching. We enjoyed it and also enjoyed the Indian speaking parrot. The music was very good and made the movie even bigger. There was a great classical orchestra. The voices were great and the characters were adorable sweet and cute. I liked it, so enjoy the movie, it's great for the family. After all, I would watch again.
