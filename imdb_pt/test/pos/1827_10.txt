I usually do not go out of my way to watch romantic comedy, and maybe I'll go in the future after seeing Return to Me. The plot was simple and no secret after the publicity. You do not have to be Einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes. What you can do is relax and let the cast take you into a world where "chemistry" is plentiful and the good guys win and you can just laugh and have fun. I love this movie .... and I have the DVD in order!
