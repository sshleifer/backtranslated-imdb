This movie is great The passion between Jade and Billy is memorable and the acting was great. That's why you do not leave a young man of 16 years and a young man like this alone! This shows why a single mom should not date a younger man with a teenage daughter at home because he looked young enough to be Jessy's son. <br /> I give it ten in ten, The acting was wonderful and the movements between the actors were correct. <br /> <br /> The age difference between Jenny and Rob was also good because they were similar in age. Overall, it's fun movie, but I guess anyone under 13 should watch this movie because of the sexual scenes.
