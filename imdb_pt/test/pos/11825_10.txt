The Cure is a real-life drama that deals with a very sensitive subject. It's the story of the deep and beloved friendship between two boys, Eric and Dexter. The latter acquired AIDS from a blood transfusion. Thus, he and his mother (Annabella Sciorra) became pariahs, avoided by the public and labeled as a dangerous company, basically due to a common lack of public knowledge of the disease. <br /> <br /> When Eric (Brad Renfro, known as 'The Client' and 'Apt Pupil') and his mother move into the house next to them, he has to deal with public insults and the fear of getting the AIDS itself. However, Eric overcomes his fear and risks everything. At first he starts talking to Dexter, but eventually he climbs the fence and joins the witty boy (played by Joseph Mazzello of Jurassic Park) and his games. Very quickly he develops a true friendship with Dexter, who is delicately constructed and fragile due to his condition. <br /> <br /> The central theme of the film? the theme that makes it incredibly authentic and tragic at the same time? This is how Eric and Dexter try to find the ultimate cure. In the beginning do they experiment with all types of plants and leaves? which is very naive but also genuine at the same time as it shows how young people deal with these heinous diseases and with what force they still believe in the magic of the world. When they hear about a supposed healing that has been developed in the South, they do not hesitate and depart for an adventure that will bring them closer and symbolize the ultimate quest for hope. <br /> <br /> So they board a ferry and head south on the Mississippi River. What begins as a true adventure becomes a dangerous, emotionally intriguing and instructive task at the same time. The scene in which Dexter reveals his fears and talks about the end of the universe, where everything is dark and cold, Eric gives him his sneakers, a symbol that wherever the boy has to go, Eric is and will always be with him; he will never have to be alone. This sequence, which is one of the most attractive of the film, presents a very convincing interaction between the two actors, who manage to avoid strange and quarrelsome dialogues and deliver a very genuine performance that ends up destroying their tenderness and honesty. I will not go any further, delineating the plot, because I do not intend to give much information. The ending, however, is emotionally difficult and makes the public a part of the tragedy that everyone who watches the film will feel personally affected. This aspect makes this film so strong, so extraordinary and so convincing. The emotional burden on each character is so real and so difficult that even the toughest members of the audience may need some wipes. <br /> <br /> A 10 is doing justice to this movie and it is not a very high rating. There is virtually no other film I have seen so far in my life dealing with such an emotional problem with so much intelligence and sensitivity. It's the story of how two kids enrich each other's lives and teach each other the lessons of life. Thus, Dexter overcomes his isolation and sadness, and Eric discovers what really counts in life; and both realize how much a true friendship is when it comes to the most difficult moments in life. <br /> <br /> Is this movie tragic ?? but your message is pure inspiration.
