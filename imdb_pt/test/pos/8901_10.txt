After another attack on an empty village, Vikings chief Timandahaf mistakenly interprets his counselor Cryptograf's explanation that "fear gives wings to the villagers" and believes that fear actually causes villagers to fly. They decide to chase the fear champion in Gaul to learn how to fly and make them invincible warriors. Meanwhile, Vitalstatistix's nephew, Justforkix, is sent from the Parisium to the Gallic village to become a man and Asterix and Obelix are assigned to train the young man. The idiot son of the Cryptograf, Olaf, hears a conversation from the coward Justforkix with Asterix and Obelix and kidnaps him. Upon returning to the Viking village, Justforkix meets with Abba, Timandahaf's daughter, and they fall in love with each other. But the Machiavellian and ambitious cryoptograph plans to marry his son Olaf with Abba and become powerful. In the end, Asterix realizes that it is not fear that gives wings, it is love. <br /> <br /> When I was a teenager, Asterix was my favorite comic and I read all the stories of Goscinny and Uderzo. This movie shows all the original elements and humor of the comics in a delightful and wonderful animation. The romance of Justforkix and the beautiful Abba is charming and the situations in which Asterix and Obelix get involved are hilarious. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Asterix and the Vikings" ("Asterix and the Vikings")
