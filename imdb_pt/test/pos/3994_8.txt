This film, winning Im Kwon-Taek, Best Director of Cannes in 2002 (tied with P.T. Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), is about a 19th century Korean painter with roots and significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strong points of the film is that Im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter, so we see various scenes and objects that help our drunken painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik), inspiration. <br /> <br /> The costumes and the art direction are impressive and the acting is even good. It's not a movie that moved me, but it was one that made me think about art and what it means to find its own voice in it. This is really cool. It is also interesting to see a version of Korea during pre-turn times, when the Chinese and Japanese powers are in Korea and the kingdom of Chosun is coming to an end. More than one revolution and political ideology are gathered in the film, but they are never the center. He is firmly in the painter. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is a well-made movie about the life of a painter. But it does not exactly have the regular structure of three acts, so you have to have a non-standard Hollywood story to watch it. Yay for the art! 8/10
