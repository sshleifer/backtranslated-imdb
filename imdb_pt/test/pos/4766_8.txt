One of my favorites. As a kid, growing up in the New York metropolitan area in the late 60's and early 70's, I often had the opportunity to visit New York with my grandfather or father while they were doing business there. The sandy, turbulent, and human reality of that city, particularly in the winter, remained with me. <br /> <br /> This film captures very well the cold and simple feel of the New York winter season as it exposes the underworld of the infamous crime underworld and policing the region. A great snapshot of a place, a time and a culture. <br /> <br /> And the pursuit of cars is simply incredible. At least on par with that of "Bullitt," and overcoming the chase in "The French Connection." I can watch, over and over again, as the suspension loosens itself in that Plymouth Fury police car running toward the GW Bridge in search, as it enters the right bend, jumping and scraping into the approaching traffic. The stunt coordinator for that scene made "Bullitt" and "The French Connection", as well as many other pursuits of noble films. Good acting too and a decent storyline. The musical score is edgy and compelling, and cinematography and direction are top notch. A great, if underrated, 1970s crime drama. A goalie. Not on DVD yet, though. <br /> <br /> Comparable in style and content to: The French Connection and Super Fly. In the early 1970s, police dramas took place in the dark winter months of New York.
