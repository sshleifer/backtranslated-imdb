I watched this movie as a kid and still like to see it from time to time for the nostalgia factor. When I was younger, I loved the movie because of the entertaining plot and interesting characters. I still love the characters today. In addition, I think of the plot with greater consideration because I now see morality and symbolism. Rainbow Brite is far from the worst movie ever, and though old-fashioned, I'm sure I'll show my kids in the future when I have kids.
