This is one of the best TV movies you can see. The values ​​of acting, writing and production are high level. The performances are infatuated with Beverly D'Angelo as the older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes just as perfect as the young boyfriend. However, the best part of this movie was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending. It showed that abuse can happen in good families; involve good people; and destroy lives. It's thought provoking and fun. Congratulations to all interested with this exceptional film. <br /> <br />
