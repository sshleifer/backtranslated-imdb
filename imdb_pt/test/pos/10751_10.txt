I really liked this old black and white talkie. At first I did not recognize Harold Lloyd as Mr. Cobb, a missionary from China returning home to find a wife. There have been many twists in Cobb's attempts to clean up the town hall. His methods of making punishment fit into crime would probably be illegal, but this is not a reality-based film. This would be a perfect movie for kids, except there's female nudity (just Grace Bradley's pastels)! The old phones are lovely. The only flaw is a typical problem of the day - Caucasians are used to represent Chinese men. This is offset by the positive way the Chinese are portrayed. They are the wise, good and friendly guys. Curiosities - a Bekins truck appears in the movie when the police are left without Black Marias.
