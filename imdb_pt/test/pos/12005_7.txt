And I do. Peter Falk has created a role that will live forever in the land of TV! And I'm grateful for that. This is not one of your best moments, though. Columbo goes to college and basically teaches him how to solve a crime, and there are bandits who go ahead and think they're smarter than him. What all of us fans know is that Columbus needs a decent opponent. Without a big enemy, how can he be the hero in the wrinkled coat? Still, it's better than NO Columbus, and I'll wait and watch the next one as well.
