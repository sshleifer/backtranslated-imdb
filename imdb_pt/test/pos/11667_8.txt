"It's easy to kill a monster, but it's hard to kill a human being." <br /> <br /> Located in the St. Thomas Housing Project and the Angola prison in New Orleans, "Dead Man Walking" is the true story of Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon), a Louisiana Sister nun who became friends with Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), a murderer and rapist bound for a lethal injection machine for killing a teenage couple? Sister Helen agrees to help the convict and remain with him to the end - an act never before attempted by a woman? At his first meeting, Poncelet swears to the nun that his accomplice was the one who shot both children and asks for his help for a new trial in order to convince the pardon council's audience to save his life . ??? <br /> <br /> The film challenges the public to think about the human consequences of the death penalty, but gives voice to bereaved and angry parents whose children have been shot, stabbed, raped and left in the woods to die alone? As Poncelet's execution approaches more and more, is his character considered deceptively complex, harboring doubts about the accuracy of what they were doing with him? In a moment, we hear him sensitive asking for a lie detector test to let his mother know he is innocent, in another we see him furious throwing the victim, blaming the government, drugs, blacks, children for being there? Poncelet never understood that he stole the Percys and the Delacroixs so much, giving them nothing but sadness ?? They will never see their children again, will never hold them, love them, laugh with them? <br /> <br /> In the scenes that preceded his execution, the death row prisoner overthrows his terrible facade and reveals his identity? Fortunately, both Sarandon and Penn are outstanding here? Successfully realizing an exquisite and tangible harmony of souls? When Sarandon was looking at Penn, was she casting compassionate eyes full of tears? Does she ask him to visualize it while he dies? '' I want the last thing you see in this world to be the face of love '' - at that moment, do we really believe that it will be the face of love for him ??
