Reinforced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Porta Dourada is a visually stunning poem that accompanies the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. It is a surrealist, enigmatic, often strange, but deeply gratifying experience. Interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with brave realism, Emanuele Crialese's latest film (Respiro) is like an Impressionist painting - a cinematic representation of what the immigration process may have been for our parents and grandparents. Crialese's "magical and mysterious ride" came as a result of his visit to the Ellis Island museum, the looks on immigrants' faces portrayed in photographs he saw, and his research into the harsh policies and procedures used during the admission of immigrants Guided by letters he read about immigrants sent to relatives who stayed at home, Crialese identifies with those impoverished immigrants who could see the positive side of things beyond their ordeal. For Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) and his eldest son Angelo (Francesco Casisa), America is a distant dream of which they know nothing. After climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the saints for a sign, they are rewarded when they are shown postcards by Salvatore's youngest son, Pietro (Filippo Pucillo), a deaf-mute who portrays the new world as a land where they can bathe in rivers of milk, sit under a tree of money or harvest onions and giant carrots. After discarding his animals in exchange for shoes and clothes, Salvatore, his two sons and his elderly mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) set out on their adventure with more hope than trepidation, but the equation soon changes. to the other side. As they embark on the boat and settle into their bustling third-class compartments, the most commented scene of the film takes place. Using a suspended camera that shows masses of people standing while the ship walks away, the picture is divided between those aboard the ship and those who say goodbye to the dock and how they are separated imply that they are being separated from everything that is family. On board the ship is a mysterious English woman named Lucy (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Crialese does not reveal her past or the reason she is traveling to America, but she seems to represent the beginning of the modern world in which they are entering. Although they look at each other carefully, Lucy cares about Salvatore and asks him to marry her to allow her into the country. The trip is treacherous, with a violent storm hitting the ship. Filmed in almost complete darkness, the passengers in the direction are thrown against the side of the boat, and then the bodies become entangled and twisted on the ground as if in a macabre Totentanz. The rite of passage through immigration processing on Ellis Island does not become easier and Crialese attacks the way in which illiterate peasants, in the name of preserving "civilized" society, are forced to assemble puzzles, perform mathematical tasks, and submit to humiliating medical examinations. prove that they are "fit." <br /> <br /> A marriage brokerage ceremony looks like an auction block, and the girls seem discouraged when they are equated with overweight middle-aged men. This is the only way they can enter the "Golden Gate", however, since single women are rejected unless they have partners, ostensibly to avoid the threat of prostitution. Through the fog, immigrants can barely see the land of milk and honey and there is no Statue of Liberty asking for the tired and the poor, the humble masses longing to breathe free. In their imagination, however, the river is still flowing, waiting for them to enter. Although the ending is ambiguous and a door opens on a blank wall, another door symbolizes the rebirth of the soul and the passage we must all take. the old world into the new.
