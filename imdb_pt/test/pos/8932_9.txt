I saw this movie on a Sunday night and I must say there is no better way to end the weekend. I am totally satisfied with the humor and the warm charm that this film offers. It just leaves me in a good mood. Watching this movie means having a great time and maintaining a warm feeling. <br /> <br /> The film offers a sharp British black humor and seems very new to me. You really like the story and the characters. Brenda Blethyn is so great. I do not know exactly why. She is too old to be a loving interest in me and too young to be my mother. But I really feel comfortable when she appears in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some might say that the story was lean and predictable. But who cares? There simply has to be a happy ending, dancing in the sun! Are the characters stereotypes or cuts? I do not know, better I do not care! I just loved it and I enjoyed watching them. <br /> <br /> Besides, I must say that I generally do not like romantic comedies. But this is a great one: a black comedy with a heart of gold !!
