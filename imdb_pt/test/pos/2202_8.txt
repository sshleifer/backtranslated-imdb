There are no flaws in this production. Perfectly fun, fun and worthy of respect. <br /> <br /> That's what theater is all about. It's definitely not for the very young, but the slightly older kids will get a great kick out of watching it and can be introduced to the theater this way. <br /> <br /> Surprising and surprising.
