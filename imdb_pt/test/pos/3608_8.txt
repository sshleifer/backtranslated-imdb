To tell you the truth, I went to see this movie just because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. People may not agree, but he does equally good performances in bad and good movies. I have not seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I was anxious to see if she's a good actress. So here's what I think: The movie is good (I did not read the novel, though). Some moments were really exciting and ... unexpected. In all, you will find the plot quite simple. So the only thing that could save the movie, which (an experienced viewer will know from the beginning) would end tragically or happily, was the performance of Cage and Crus. And it was great, great, great !!! In the final part of the film, I even liked a very broad accent of the actress (Spanish, but for those who do not speak Greek, that's fine, and she even looks like a Greek girl). Overall, the film is very enjoyable and has a good dose of irony (classical music fans will certainly have fun in a few moments :) <br /> <br /> I give 9/10. You should see that!
