For people who are beginners at the cinema, I think they did a great job !! We have to support the emerging industry, especially coming from the north. It was very popular when I was in the movies, a good house and very good reactions and lots of laughs. It's a feel-good movie and that's how I felt when I left the movie! It has northern humor and positive about the community it represents. The movie just opened, I hope it succeeds - people should support this little movie. I think that person 'vinny ...' is very bitter, about something! And getting very personal ??? shame!! I say well done to all involved ?? have a drink with me !! I look forward to you next adventure.
