At the same time that John Russell played the owner of the ranch Nathan Burdette, trying to free his good brother Claude Akins from Sheriff John Wayne in Rio Bravo, he was working on the other side of the law on television. These years were probably the high point of Russell's career, his most famous screen role and his most famous television role, Marshal Dan Troop of Laramie in Lawman. Russell kept law and order in Laramie the same way James Arness did it at Dodge City in Gunsmoke. Unlike Gunsmoke, Laramie never developed all of the minor characters that gave him the feel of Dodge City at the time. Instead, he focused on Russell taking care of business and learning the business of law with his eager young deputy Peter Brown. Brown represented Johnny McKay, who was a very respectful young man, constantly referring to his boss as Mr. Troop. He was quite practical with an iron shot, but he was inclined to be impulsive. Good thing Marshal Troop was around. <br /> <br /> The other regular series was Laramie's Kitty Russell, Lily played by Peggie Castle. This is where Lawman most resembled Gunsmoke. There was a tacit understanding between Russell and Castle that even the smallest of the children could not have missed. And I was not the youngest of the kids when Lawman was the first time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Peggie Castle developed substance abuse problems after the Lawman campaign ended. I remember a little obituary that marked her in the first half of the seventies. She was a beautiful woman. Lawman was good without Western absurdity of that golden age of Western adult television. It was one of the best.
