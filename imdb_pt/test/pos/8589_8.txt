Good Movie, acting was great, especially Eriq Ebouaney (Lumumba) and very well directed. <br /> <br /> It also shows how Lumumba was cornered by the Belgians, the USA and the United Nations and how they labeled him 'communist'. to scare people like they did with all honest African leaders like Nkrumah, Kenyatta, Nyerere and many others. It shows how Western countries preach democracy while having something else in the back of their minds. It is a story of injustice, struggle and brutality. <br /> <br /> It shows how Lumumba could not control his people, yes, they were his people, but before we blamed him, he was getting enough if any of the people he named in his government as Mobutu? Or your colleague had other things in mind, to discover go and see the movie! Certainly Mobutu did this, continued to plunder the country for the next 35 years, before being shot down and fled the country. A billionaire died. <br /> <br /> A few flaws: There was little explanation as to how the man (Lumumba) managed to get up in the first place. There should also have been more explanations about the country, Congo Kinshasa (after independence), now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly known as Zaire when under Mobutu. There should be an explanation why he (Lumumba) could not keep Africa's second largest country in one piece. And also what was happening to Tshombe and Katanga. If you're going to watch the movie, Tshombe was controlling the region of Katanga, which (if I'm not mistaken) is the number one copper producer in the world. <br /> <br /> In everything, it's a good movie to watch. You will learn something new about Africa, its leaders and people, and will probably open your eyes to why this continent is full of wars.
