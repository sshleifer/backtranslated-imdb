Guilt and redemption are two of the main emotions and plots of the heavy and powerful dramas that Oscar so much loves (which is funny, since "The Kite Runner" was only nominated for Best Soundtrack - unfair). While most cinematic adaptations of books (or any other medium) are generally inferior to their literary counterparts (and "The Kite Runner" is NOT an exception), Marc Forster's film adaptation is good. <br /> <br /> people are familiar with the story, the book has been read by millions, so I will not get into the plot except to say that the book remains quite faithful to its source. That said, if you do not know the plot, watch the movie, or better yet, read the book. <br /> <br /> The best thing that "The Kite Hunt" has in its favor (besides its history). ) is director Marc Forster. Forster is a director with epic reach and single vision who is perfectly used to bring Khaled Hosseini's book to the screen. A small part of me feared that he would use the same dreamy images that were included in one of Forster's earlier features, "Finding Neverland." Do not get me wrong, "Finding Neverland" is a wonderful film, one of my favorites actually, but the visual trick he used there has no place here. Fortunately, Forster understands this, and the brightness of his direction shows his versatility. Although the lack of an appointment for Best Director for his work here is not exactly a scam, I see a series of statues held for him in the future. <br /> <br /> Also noteworthy is the script's adaptation. He remains true to the source, but leaves room for Forster's vision to interpret the material. The dialogue is not dumb, and this. along with Forster's direction, moves in a solid rhythm. Like Forster, the lack of award-winning recognition for the script was not an outrage, but I would not have complained if it was at least indicated. <br /> <br /> The dividing line between this movie is great and excellent lies with acting. Most of the performances are solid, but there are a few that are not cut, and that harms the movie. The most notable weak performance comes from Zekeria Ebrahimi, who plays the young Amir. It's not that it's bad, it's just that it's not as effective as it could be. He simply can not translate the guilt that consumes Amir to the public. In fact, I think I might have been a little lost right now in the movie at this point, if I had not read the book because of it. He looks somber and sometimes resentful, but we can not feel his emotions. This is a difficult part to portray, and for the most part young Ebrahimi retains his own, which is especially surprising since this is his first movie role. <br /> <br /> The best performances come from Khalid Abdalla, who plays the Amir and Shaun Toub, who plays the wise Rahim Kahn. Abdalla may not be a household name (although he was in "United 93" by Paul Greengrass), but his work here is incredible. He is a quiet, modest man, and he emits perfectly when necessary. A less capable actor could have turned Rahim Khan's character into a cliché, but Shaun Toub uses subtlety and care in his performance, which creates what the clichés are trying to portray. <br /> <br /> Forgive me if I go in a rush here, but this is something I must address, and that's the PG-13 rating of the movie. The fact that this film received such a low rating is scandalous. There is no justification for this. Some might argue that the rating was doubled because of the need for everyone to see it, like the gore in "The Rescue of Private Ryan," which some say should have earned the NC-17 rating. But this exception can not be applied here. The only purpose the scene serves is to tell the story. Forster (probably at the request of the producers) tried his best to tame the most painful and disturbing scene of the film to allow the film to go unnoticed with a PG-13 rating, but the subject material is very disturbing to be portrayed in. any way and get less than an R rating, regardless of how "taste" can be portrayed. Worse, this edition robs the scene of much of its power, and trying to make it less disturbing to get the lowest rating is insulting. In addition, some scenes of violence are incredibly disturbing as well. In terms of how long these scenes take off from the film, this does not increase much, but what is there is well deserving of a R grade at least. The MPAA, whose film review system has always been corrupt, has dropped to a new level, giving the film such a low rating. <br /> <br /> But you should not blame the movie for it. The movie is a solid movie that is worth seeing, especially if they are fans of the book.
