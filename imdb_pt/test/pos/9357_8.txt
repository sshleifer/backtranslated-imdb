After a man appears dead, a soldier becomes the prime suspect. Without a doubt, the best film to present three Roberts and all of them are in good shape. Young is the coldheaded police officer who smokes a pipe investigating the murder, Mitchum is the suspected friend of the murder suspect, and Ryan is a hot-headed soldier with something to hide. Grahame has a brief but effective role as a femme fatale. Future Tarzan Barker has a small part as a soldier. This film addresses anti-Semitism, a theme also covered by the Oscar winner for Best Picture "Gentleman's Agreement," which was released the same year. It is solidly directed by Dmytryk, who creates an effective noir movie atmosphere.
