I recently bought "The Big Trail" {1930}. It's an incredible and incredible movie. I knew this from reputation, but I never expected it to be so magnificent. My version is the only one in 35mm and I'll talk about it again later. When you think of the Western Myth in movies, the names that come to mind are John Ford and John Wayne. Well, you only have half the team here, but the whole Myth is present. Raoul Walsh gave us a remarkable epic in which the true plot is the nation's expanding struggle to the west. There's a plot centered on a romance between Breck Coleman (Wayne) and Ruth Cameron (Margaret Churchill) with the main villain, Red Flack being played memorably by Tyrone Power, Sr. But that has almost incidental quality as the wagon train struggles forward against unbelievable obstacles ?? natural and human. Examples are the crossing of the river, the Indian battle and the burning desert crossing. The consequences of the battle receive a gloomy touch when a doll is placed in the grave of a dead child while a faithful dog lies in the tomb of his master. <br /> <br /> Magnificent panoramas are full of energy and activity. The opening scene as the car prepares to depart, the interlude of Square Dance and the big flocks of Buffalo are some that come to mind. Wonderful use is made of footage everywhere. Another feature of this splendid film is the fact that men and women receive the same credit for their share in the great struggle toward the West. Women work, struggle and face the terrible difficulties with the same firmness and strength as men. The ending has a powerful experience as Coleman and Cameron meet in the gigantic Sequoia Forest to begin their new life. <br /> <br /> The acting is quite acceptable everywhere. I have already mentioned the scene stealing performance of Tyrone Power. Tully Marshall is excellent as Coleman's helper, and Marguerite Churchill convincingly portrays a woman who develops an inner strength by finding her own problems as well as those external to herself. Comic relief is the weakest aspect of this film, but these scenes are uncommon and are swallowed up by the film's tremendous sweep. <br /> <br /> Have I read many reviews about Wayne's performance? even going so far as to blame his "acting of wood" for the failure of the film at the box office. I think this is unfair. Wayne was in his first major role and certainly did not develop the charisma of his performance in "Stagecoach". But he still does a useful job in a role that will surely be the second violin of the great all-encompassing theme. After "The Big Trail", Wayne played in a large number of low budget B Westerns. I have a number of these and one can see the developing actor in them. When "Stagecoach" arrived, he was ready for it and "The Big Trail" was a significant part of that learning. <br /> <br /> I mentioned earlier that my version is the only one in 35mm. It's still impressive, but to get an idea of ​​the effect of the 70mm version I've set the TV screen to 16: 9, which does not cause any distortion. Although not having the full effect of the Grandeur version, it was good enough to make me want the latter. (In addition, the film filmed in 70mm has some extra scenes, not in the form made for ordinary theatrical display). In summary, this movie deserves to be on any of the biggest lists. Westerns already did.
