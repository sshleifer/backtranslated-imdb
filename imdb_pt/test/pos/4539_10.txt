This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Pretty pathetic you say? Well, it is. But Chris is incredibly incredibly funny. His innocent glow comes out in this film more than in any of his other films. Look at both scenes of the motel, when Spade is caught with the zipper down, and the other: "JUST GO FOR THE LOVE OF GOD !!!"
