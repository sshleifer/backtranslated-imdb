Once a year in the United States, Saturday morning would give way to new cartoons, usually sometime in America. About the time the school started. <br /> <br /> I think it was not to have a Saturday school more bearable. <br /> <br /> One Friday night before the premiere of the new cartoons on Saturday morning. A movie appeared. "In the Core of the Earth" I had no idea who Cushing and McClure were. Clearly they were not from the same country so I could not understand why they were traveling together. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing the mechanism in the mouth of the fire-breathing monster. <br /> <br /> What connects this movie to me is the opening with the molten metal and suddenly the band starts playing when we see the factory. <br /> <br /> How do you end a movie like that? The music again, and two policemen chewlidered as the drill appears behind them. <br /> <br /> Whatever the reason, I remember watching this movie more than Friday night than any new drawing that came the next morning. /> <br /> This was definitely the end of the seventies. <br /> <br /> It would be during the Jurassic Park mania, cicra '93, I believe, before seeing this movie again. <br /> /> Yes, people in suits. There was the fire-breather again. <br /> <br /> I still loved the ending with the two cops. <br /> <br /> Finally, it would be almost another decade before I sent it to the DVD movie. <br /> <br /> Now I just watch the beginning and the introduction. <br /> <br /> Oh, I really love the movie. Of all these science fiction films, Jules Verne, HG Wells, ERB movies, this one is my favorite. <br /> <br /> What I noticed now is that one of the cops starts to turn around a little too soon, then turns back, so he and the other cop are in sync when they come back in again to look back at drill. <br /> <br /> Maybe for me, this movie is the best of the shows on Saturday morning, which is why I really like it.
