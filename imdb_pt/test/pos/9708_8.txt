It's what you expect. It induces laughter, shrinkage, and dryness, not necessarily in that order. It's over-the-top. You'll see things you may never be able to erase from your mind's eye. "Jackass Number Two" is better than the first; the actors definitely took more risks while filming this film. There are many acrobatics that could have killed the actors, especially Johnny Knoxville. The treatment of the animals was suspect, but other than that, the film got what it was made to achieve. If you like the preview, watch the movie. If you do not, avoid! <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
