Some people do not appreciate the magical elements of the ROS, but that's what sets the series apart: the fact that the producers really decide to dress the actors in proper clothes and armor - not anachronistic feathered caps, colored socks and plaid armor! <br /> <br /> But I'm actually writing to comment on the article from a previous poster. Michael Praed did not leave the ROS to do Jules Verne! There are 15 years between these two series. Yes, I agree and Michael could also agree that leaving the ROS was not a good move - but it was a coveted Broadway role that drew him in 1984 and then Dynasty with his megabucks salaries.
