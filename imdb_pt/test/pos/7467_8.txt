I had the pleasure of seeing these two chairs of the (one?) Executive Producer of the Atlantic Film Festival, which was interesting because he laughed at very different times than the rest of us. <br /> <br /> Filmed in Atlantic Canada, the film tells of three teenage girls who in one of their last summers of their youth devote a great deal of energy to sleeping with a married man of 30 years, despite many protests . <br /> <br /> Definitely worth watching, but the mood was geared towards a completely different demographic group from the one I inhabit (Male 18-25), so I was shaking my head with the character's antics, instead to laugh Despite this, the story is strong enough to keep you entertained, without much laughter.
