I saw this movie with an open mind, not knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this movie was written, directed and acted in such a way that every minute is a delightful watch. People do not seem to be acting, more like real people who actually train dogs and lead the lives portrayed in this movie. There are some wonderful moments when you laugh or laugh, some jokes may be dry, but they are presented in a very visible way. Highly recommended!
