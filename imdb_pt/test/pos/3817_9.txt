The Outer Limits is a brilliant show that most of the time leaves me with very strong emotions. There are undoubtedly a few grumpy episodes, but it is essentially an old comic-pulp turned into a TV show, which can be expected. Most of the time, it is done in an excellent way, well-produced and directed, and often featuring some renowned talents who seem to enjoy working on a solid translation of short fiction to the one-hour television format. <br /> <br /> External boundaries tend to focus on fairly broad ethical / philosophical / moral issues and rarely ends without the voice being dubbed with serious thoughts. <br /> <br /> From time to time, the themes are hammered too much for all but the thicker viewers. Moreover, while a certain level of distrust of the government is conducive to effective democracy, you may unfortunately pick up several consecutive episodes bordering on absurdity regarding Army / CIA mistrust, etc. that any large group with power (the Roman Catholic Church, the Evangelicals, the People's Republic of China, and so on) is in a bad light on a frequency that varies from one to another. <br /> <br /> While the show can beat a dead horse if observed enough, the overall quality is astounding, and I am grateful that Sci-Fi has decided to continue broadcasting until they produce a set of DVD season -a-season (and I can afford it.
