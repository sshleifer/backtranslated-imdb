Peter Strauss, by nature in appearing in miniseries and films made for TV, often receives an unjustly high proportion of bad reviews - usually from casual watchers who watched ten minutes of the movie, having entered the middle of the channel. through. Well, I just read all the other 20 comments for this movie and I am very pleased to see that not a single bad word said about the Jericho Mile - That should be enough for you to be proud of buying this movie! <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss won an Emmy for his role in this movie and watching it once will show him why he deserved so much .... <br /> <br /> Looking to be objective, I tried to criticize this movie. Instead, I found myself discussing each of my possible choices. This is what true realist cinema is all about. This is not typical Hollywood hype, where everything is exaggerated - it's so realistic and true that people think it's based on a real event !!
