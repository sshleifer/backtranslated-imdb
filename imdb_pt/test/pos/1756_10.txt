Hello again, I've been thinking about this movie all my life. I saw when I was 5 years old in Los Angeles, California, in 1942. What a wonderful story to be good to each other, kindness and charity. You forget that they are errors related to each other. It was as if they were people. I love this movie and my adult children too. Such a beautiful color in this movie. I need to see this movie again. There is a story about an envelope in the movie, which I can not remember the "why" of it. <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening.
