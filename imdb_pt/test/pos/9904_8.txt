At the 2005 Phoenix Film Festival, it was no secret which movie was at the top of everyone's viewing list. Check Out (2004) brought crowds of moviegoers to the Harkins Cine-capri of Scottsdale. Festival participants, who waited in line for hours, were rejected at the door, despite the display capacity of two theaters. Checking Out (2004) is a beautifully made moving image; an inspiring comedy for a wide range of audiences to enjoy. The director, Jeff Hare, blends traditional film technique with a new twist of creativity, capturing Peter Falk in his most sentimental moments (usually shown in intimate close-ups) on the movie screen. With its inspiring blend of witty humor and the development of narrative plots, Checking Out (2004) is an independent reference film that deserves your attention.
