BRIGHT BIOGRAPHY FILM ?????? Well, this is certainly one of my favorites. Biography. This movie came as a complete surprise to me. I was avoiding this movie a long time ago. That's because I'm not a fan of Jamie Foxx. I'm not yet a Big Fan of it, but I'm pretty sure I'm a FAN now. <br /> <br /> Well, he deserved every BIT of that Oscar. His performance is one of the best performances I have ever seen in Long Long Time. He is truly sensational! <br /> <br /> Well, the narration, or the flow of the story is brilliant for a biographical film. I'm a DRAMA fan so I was not bored. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised to be enjoying the film so much that I did not see any glitches in the movie. I think there is no flaw in the movie. Maybe some event mistakes But hey, who cares? <br /> <br /> The performance of the woman who plays Ray's mother was also very good. Well, Kerry Washington? she has a lot of potential .. if given the right role She may just be the next Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> Well, the story of them movie was so emotional so playing .. I cried ?? I cried very bad ???? <br /> <br /> I do not give a damn if things are crazy or not because this movie drives me crazy to cry ?? And this is too much for me! <br /> <br /> All in all a SUPERB MOVIE ???? One of the best of this century! <br /> <br /> 10/10
