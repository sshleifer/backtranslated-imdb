Excellent cast, plot, performances. Totally believable. I realize the united group that exemplifies the Marine Corps. But this movie brought fear to my heart. The Marines let principles be condemned. It looks like this movie was based on real-life incidents. It shows how difficult it is to go against the establishment. Anne Heche was totally convincing. Sam Shepard's portrait of a Marine Marine was disappointing. And Eric Stoltz, as his lawyer, was so skillful, balancing his loyalty to the Corp, but also his customer loyalty, while he was at the top of his tightrope. He knew what his true course of action would be. But he was separated by his immersion in the tradition of the Navy, loyalty to the Body above all else. I sat riveted on the TV screen. All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.
