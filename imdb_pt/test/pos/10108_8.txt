Maybe I'm one of the only avid fans of terror who think the recent overload of Asian shocks is so exaggerated! Movies like "Ringu" or "The Eye"? which are praised all over the world? they simply did not convince me and they seemed more boring than scary. Well, this blunt opinion does not hold true for the South Korean gem "A Tale of Two Sisters". This is an elegant and totally complex psychological horror tale that really gets under your skin! The storyline, based on a local folk tale, may be a bit too confusing to put this film among the greatest achievements of all time, but the atmosphere and the creation of tension certainly provoke feelings of great respect. This is one of those few movies that are impossible to label: The events in "Two Sisters" qualify as mind-bending horror as well as intense family drama and a deeply psychological portraiture. In addition to a fascinating story, "A Tale of Two Sisters" also has all the great elements that I feel are missing in Asian horror movies such as compelling music, good acting and groundbreaking camera work. The mansion where family events take place is brilliantly illustrated as a truly sinister place, where secrets and perils hide behind every door. Various sequences (such as dinner with relatives or the nightly appearance in the girls room) are practically the ultimate in eeriness. They really made me feel uncomfortable and I like to believe I've seen my scary part of terror. "A Tale of Two Sisters" is a fantastic movie adventure and a must-see for fans of Asian films. A little warning for people with little attention: this movie forces you to have your eyes and ears focused at all times. It's also a movie that requires repeated viewing, even if no one ever "achieves" 100%.
