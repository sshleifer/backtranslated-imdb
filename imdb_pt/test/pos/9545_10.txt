Long trailer Whoever said that has to be kidding. this has to be one of the deepest behind the scenes or making documentaries ever made. how can it be a trailer when you spend several minutes telling the audience how the movie was conceptualized and then taken to the studios? This documentary also spends a great deal of time detailing how acrobatics were made and the new technologies created to achieve them. then shows us how the Woo Ping team came up with the fight scenes along with the blocking tapes that almost shamed the actual scenes with the actors. There are things mentioned about the reloaded array, but there's almost nothing really. If you are a true matrix fan, you have to see this documentary. the original documentary on DVD is good, but incomplete compared to this. for example, never explained why Keanu wore a cervical collar in the original documentary, but this is explained in Revisited. The Revisited DVD also shows Carrie Ann Moss twisting her ankle during the lobby scene and getting really disturbed because she feels like she's letting the staff fall. and that's just the tip of the iceberg. so ignore this comment "just a long trailer" and check it out for yourself. You will not regret. casual matrix fans do not need to apply ...
