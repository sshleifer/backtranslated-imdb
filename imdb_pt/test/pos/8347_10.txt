Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure is a cool movie that many kids can relate to. It's a well-presented story about a boy who yearns for the freedom to do things his way, and how he gets that freedom is only part of what makes this movie interesting. Just forget the little disappointments, like the fact that there were only adults in this movie based on the point of view of a puppy, because that's only 0.5% or less of the wonderful effect of the movie on the viewer. Great music, lively acting, talented animation and direction, and a powerful storyline tell the difference between freedom on the streets of New England and a cozy home with your family. And no matter how bad things seem, your family and friends are "always there" to help you in any difficult situation. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to get the soundtrack!
