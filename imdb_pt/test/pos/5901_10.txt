Everyone agrees with the technical excellence of this Jutra movie (whose life ended so tragically). As for the content, of course it makes a difference if you're a Quebecois, and that explains some differences of opinion. For me, it's for the movies what Vignault's "Mon pays, ce n'est pas un pays" is music. In addition, Jean Duceppe was himself part of the legendary Quebec. <br /> <br /> This film can be contrasted with "CRAZY", a current version of Quebec that is successful enough to be shown here in Spain and is also about the movie. 1960s Quebec Urban (mad) against rural Quebec (Antoine). But also a movie that must be something very different for foreigners and for people who know Qu√©bec from the inside.
