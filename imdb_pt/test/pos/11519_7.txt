Fascinatingly and hilariously bad, Lights of New York is the first feature of all talkies and we've hardly ever seen the light of day. <br /> <br /> Two naive barbers (Eddie and Gene) from out of town get involved with smugglers and end up talking. When a police officer is shot by one of the smugglers, the police begin to close, and the hawk (who shot the cop) decides to fix the murder on Eddie by instructing his henchman to "take him for a ride." But it is Hawk himself who carries the bullet in a turnaround that will surprise few. <br /> <br /> Filmed in a week at a cost of $ 23,000, "Lights" was originally designed as a two but Foy took advantage of Jack Warner's Absence to extend it to six. When Warner discovered this, he ordered Foy to cut back to the original. Only when an independent exhibitor offered $ 25,000 for the film, Warners actually looked at the movie, which grossed an impressive $ 1.3 million. <br /> <br /> Seen right now this is an extremely cheesy piece, with acting ranging from passable (Eugene Pallette) to trance (Eddie's Granny in a particularly risible scene) and much of the game is at vaudeville level. Since it's a first talkie (4 part-talkies have preceded it) it's about all the characters, and very slowly about it. The script seems improvised, the visual style is nonexistent (besides the silhouetted shooting scene) and the scenes roll endlessly. Title cards are interleaved, which redundantly advertise characters and locations. <br /> <br /> In spite of all this, "Lights" is a compelling experience, as we watch actors and crew struggling with alien technology, and changing the cinema forever. /> <br /> Pick it up if you can.
