(VERY moderately spoilerish) <br /> <br /> I must begin by saying that I am not generally impressed with science fiction, so Pitch Black (2000) was a pleasant surprise. He had called me from the beginning with rhythm, intensity and visual explosion that left me fascinated and glued to my place. I'm very happy to say that this movie was the best (ok, at least * one * of the best) science fiction pieces I've seen in a very, very long time. The storyline may sound simple - a spacecraft crashes into a supposedly desert planet and captain Caroline Fry (awesome Radha Mitchell) must take the survivors to safety. At first, a cold-blooded killer, Riddick (Vin Diesel, who plays the role with a very convincing replenishment style), may seem like the group's biggest problem, but as twilight begins to crawl, the creatures of the night begin to awaken ... This leads to a desperate attempt to escape bloodthirsty predators, which, as we all can imagine, does not lead to a happy family picnic. <br /> <br /> It's not the plot itself that makes the movie worth watching - - After all, let's face it, if you undress to the basics is not that original but the skill at which it is said. The story flowed forward, did not let me yawn (at least not much) at any point. The direction was a fabulous job. This was a very visual and even beautiful film; the purple night vision was a real treat. Although "beautiful" may not be the right word to use; Yes, the images shown were sweet to the eyes, but also added a touch of unspecified grotesque, eeriness, as if something was about to explode beneath the still surface. (Not to mention that the monsters were really well made, they seemed realistic, which seems to be rare nowadays [maybe people just can not be bothered to make them look real ...] > not only appreciated the visual side of the film, but also the psychological aspect of the story. During the movie, we see the characters unraveling - some fall, some of them rise - but what fascinated me most was the development of Riddick's character. I enjoyed watching the change in it throughout the movie. To go even further, the other thing I liked very much with Riddick was the incredibly well and originally performed UST (Unresolved Sexual Tension) between Fry and him that "no" (you'll understand what I mean when you see). . [It can not be denied that they had chemistry. Do not try or I'll look for you and make you hear me play Chopsticks until you scream * smile *] It was cool. As Radha Mitchell once said (a modified quote), "Pitch Black is a very sexy sexless movie," which is what makes it even more interesting. <br /> <br /> So to summarize, I recommend this movie - even if you are not a fan of "space stories." The suspense was kept to the end and, importantly, we were (or at least I stayed) wanting more. If you can not be bothered to think about psychology, subtext and such (as is my bad habit), you will still find Pitch Black highly entertaining. Just take off your shoes and enjoy.
