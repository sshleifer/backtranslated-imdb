Hey, now, I've never set eyes on a manga comic, but apparently this movie is based on one. Oh well, that's life. Anyway, this is a bizarre movie, to say the least, as things literally get out of control in a small Japanese city. People are getting obsessed with uzumaki (spiral) and this young girl watches her friend's father shoot a snail and later in the movie, people start to become snails? It also seems that this kid's father is so obsessed that he somehow commits suicide in an appliance. There's some bizarre humor here that might be at home in a Tim Burton movie, but there's some meanness & gore like only the Japanese can do with fairness. As with many Japanese films, the ending is the end, and something has been solved? Well, not in my opinion, it did not. There are some hints as to why all this is happening, but they are not exploited and there is a lot for the imagination, or else it was not considered important. Still, there are many things for the eyes to feast on and if you are not obsessed with everything that makes sense, it is worth seeing it because it is so original and bizarre. My favorite was the father with the eyeballs turning, personally. 8 out of 10 stars.
