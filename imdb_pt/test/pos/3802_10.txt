This has to be one of the most magnificent things I've ever seen in the movies. I do not know if it's as serious as it seems, but that hardly matters. This movie is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. Packaging and marketing only do this more because you know that often a mother has to reschedule her child to accept our reality after he checks it out at the store expecting something completely different. Look at the script, on the one hand! And where else in the United States can you see a ten-year-old boy swear as much as this and then get the eye ripped off by perverting Zed's rival from Pulp Fiction? And this food inspector scene is the best! The amount of acquaintances to actors vaguely recognized in this film is one of the best things about this: soon, much sooner than you realize, you will also find yourself saying, "Is this Meat Loaf? Is that Drew Barrymore? Hewitt, a doctor of Star Trek: Voyager? Is Flea? Is the owner of the Twin Peaks sawmill that heats the squirrels with the exhaust of the car? And this guy from the new Rob Zombie movie is not? He looks a lot like Shrek. that my favorite scene is at the end, with Phil in a full-length cast.I mean, please, why are not there more movies like this shown on airplanes? This director hardly has anything else in his name than Return To Salem's Lot , but he shows the true man-child genius stumbling on this creation! If you are an intellectual looking for something to spend your night, I suggest this movie to your satisfaction. arm of m enine fighting for an aggressive Meat Loaf, who seems determined to take his anger away by not being accepted in Guns N Roses, looks over his shoulder and sees Voyager's doctor enter the bar * Can you imagine what any middle channel surfer brain in the last six years would think about seeing this? Now imagine if you really cared about Meat Loaf or Voyager to get started! Or imagine if you are a fan of fleas. Rocky Horror Picture Show fans, this movie contains remarkable music, remember, but your soundtrack is more plasticine than Mad Max 3. What does this entail for you? This is the retarded, premier mongoloid inverted-sister-mother-dog of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. How about when Gus' sleeve flies back to the arm in an act of quality special effects access ability by cable? When I saw this movie, it was at the suggestion of my cousin, who had watched half of it in a half conscious childhood attack in the early nineties and since then has been haunted by vague memories of it, I even had not slept in three days. That made me laugh! Of course, it's also an anxiety movie. The song does not encourage suspense but eventually reaches the point where it is fully established that the American Censorship Committee has obviously completely missed this movie and absolutely anything can happen in it and probably at any moment Gus turns a corner or the sight as much as it changes the camera angles. I found myself obsessed with the possibility that those letters would come out of the window at any second. Watch this movie. Impressive!
