I really liked this movie. I've probably watched it two dozen times or more and still enjoy it. Being an old Navy guy, I'm still agitated by the interpretation of Anchors Away! I also love the pirate atmosphere "McHales Navy". I could have done without the female diving officer, but I'm just old-fashioned, I guess. She was still good to see, lol, especially after the staff finished washing their clothes. The cook, the sonarman and the electrician made the movie. Loved the old salty engineer and his first class PO too. And Grammer, in fact, did a very commendable job for being a grumpy officer. I loved the "driving scene" as they passed the golf course on the way in port, lol. Pure navy! And I swear I had an XO that was like that little weasel ... I'm so glad it's on the DVD, about bloody weather. : 0)
