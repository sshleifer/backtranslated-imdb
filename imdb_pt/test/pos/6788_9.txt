My family watches this movie several times. Even our 3 year old loved it. I like the "goodness" in the movie. Give the stranger a chance ... by showing goodwill to someone who obviously needs some unconditional acceptance. The film gives a sense of goodwill and victory. Another aspect of the film that makes it so appealing is the personality of the Velvet brothers. The bird lover. The bug lover. The Boy Lover! Very beautiful and happy movie. There is one thing, however, that is annoying about it. This is how Mrs. Brown often makes Mr. Brown seem foolish or foolish. She sometimes goes out as one knows everything, and he as an idiot, which he is not. Too bad to put that into such a cool story. However, we will continue to enjoy this wonderful old movie!
