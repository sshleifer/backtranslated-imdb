'This is not a movie' works because it's so true to what you're trying to say. If you ignore the dynamics of the plot and focus on the message, you'll see a bit of yourself in the main character, Michael. Be it man or woman, we all come to a point in our lives where we want to look back and reexamine a situation or a relationship. Did it really happen as we remember? What went wrong? Michael's desire to find Grace is completely selfish. Most of all, he wants to feel better about how things happened. But even so, he is a nice character, because everyone is selfish when it comes to relationships. We would not be in them any other way. When the movie ends, I'm not sure if Michael learned something new about himself or not. Our best measure in the relationship is through your friend, Nadia. She is the soul of the movie and reminds us of how there are always two sides to each story. I found Michael to be pompous, arrogant and simply clueless. Which is exactly why I liked it. He is a real character. If you've always wanted to go back and review a previous relationship, then this is a movie for you. In closing, it's a movie for everyone.
