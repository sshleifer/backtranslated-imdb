I was 10 or 11 when this movie came out, and it stayed with me for 35 years since then. When the film left, all the theaters in the St. Louis area distributed, as a 'bait', a packet of flower seeds that had the name of the film, etc. ahead. On the back of the pack you read, in so many words ... plant these seeds at midnight. If a white flower grows, you are saved ..... but if a red flower grows, you are doomed !!! Suffice it to say that for a child of eleven, I did not plant the seeds for fear of what might appear. Here's the spoiler: When the movie starts, you see a small toy tank moving on the ground. On a small road, a family is leaving the city and all of a sudden the camera goes back into the tank again, and it is full size. It rolls over the car, and you see bloody limbs coming out of the wreckage, so suddenly the tank is small again. <br /> <br /> The reason this movie stayed with me for so long was because I had an exact toy tank like that of the movie !!!! Unfortunately I do not know what happened to that, but I've kept a wary eye on this thing ever since !!! <br /> <br /> Turn off the lights, put on the DVD, make a sandwich and watch this movie. It's very good!!!
