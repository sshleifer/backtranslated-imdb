Family Guy is the best show on TV. EVER. He achieved great deeds that no other animated comedy, or any show, came close to achieving. <br /> <br /> In terms of animated sitcoms, this era should be called "The Age of Animated Sitcoms." because there are many of them, and almost everyone imaginable are being released on DVD. There are some good ones (ie South Park, Futurama and The Simpsons). Each animated series has its own style / technique to create humor. For example, Futurama is funny because it always comments or acts on what happened with a touch of humor. The Simpsons is also a great show because it uses the same comic technique and style that Futurama does, but The Simpsons deserves the credit for it, since it was in the air before Futurama and still remains in the air using the technique. South Park, in my opinion, is the funniest show alongside Family Guy, because it uses a clever mix of vulgarity and nonsense, since it's the technique of creating humor. <br /> <br /> But enough of other animated shows. Let me tell you what makes the Family Guy so funny. Family Guy uses a comic style that no other program has ever used before. He uses a technique of having flashbacks after every joke. This not only reinforces the joke but makes it look funnier. It also moves at a very fast pace. These two criteria make the show funnier on TV. You have to see the show to believe, but once you see it, you'll probably agree. (FYI, the two funniest moments in Family Guy were: 1) The 5 minute chicken fight on "Da Boom," and 2) Dick van Dyke's parody on "Holy Crap.") Family Guy is a very modest show because while other shows create humor by becoming familiar with their shticks / routines and characters, most of the Family Guy jokes are based on the nonsense of current events and pop culture. It also shows that the Family Guy is smart, as well as being modest because it reveals that the show has insight. And this technique is extremely effective because it relates their references to pop culture to the particular plot of the episode in which they find themselves. <br /> <br /> The Family Guy can be enjoyed by all ages, because while younger children may not understand references to pop culture, they will have fun with the characters' hilarious and silly antics, especially Peter. The show is, however, a bit more vulgar than The Simpsons and Futurama, but it's less ordinary than South Park. So in terms of vulgarity, Family Guy would be somewhere in between when associated with the above shows, but it would rank first in terms of humor and intelligence. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was canceled last. year, not because it was not popular, but because FOX kept changing its schedule, so no one knew when it was on. Fortunately, we have the sets of DVD boxes (which by the way, are selling like crazy) and reruns on the Adult Swim of the Cartoon Network available to us.
