Sean Connery is very good as the Great Raisuli, Lord of the Rif and Defender of the Faithful. This is an adventure film with Arabs, Germans and the USMC, all coming to one point or another. There is also a lot of humor in the interaction between the main characters and support. The story is based on the actual incident in which a wealthy Greco-American businessman was kidnapped by Raisuli in the early 1900s. Milius replaced Candace Bergen and her two children as victims of the abduction, and this opens the story to much literary license. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film gives Milius the opportunity to remember the story. spectator of two of the most famous (though forgotten) political quotes from the TR era. Brian Keith (very good as TR) says: "Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead!"; and John Huston (also good as Secretary of State John Hay) asks the Japanese ambassador for a dinner at the White House: "Do you like knifee, do you like fork?"
