In a critical scene, as Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) is in Swimmer's Cave, she writes something read aloud by Hana (Juliette Binoche), in which she proclaims that "the light has gone out now, and I'm writing in the darkness ... "A sentence of such poetic beauty could not be more perfect for the cinematographic brilliance of the distant English patient The English Patient. With such a sweeping sweep that keeps a firm footing and a force on the film that does not diminish, this film proudly celebrates the mysteries and novels of WWII, taking elements from Casablanca and Lawrence Of Arabia along with some independence in the form of Tuscany . <br /> <br /> The English patient blatantly pulls the strings of the heart and takes us through a mysterious first act, a second romantic act, and a beautiful ... beautiful final act, and it is not just the wonderful rhythm and scenario, is the performance of Ralph Fiennes, who keeps us friendly, even when Count Almásy, from the beginning, proves to be an absolutely unpleasant character. Usually typified as a villain, he shows stained but ultimately human colors as a man taken by a desperate love that he must fulfill. <br /> <br /> Many will criticize this film based on its so-called "glorification of adulterers." "The contrasts between the two periods (before and after the plane crash seen at the beginning) are spectacular, for the patient is the repentant man who suffers because of what he has done, the evil that one He wanted this woman, but he can not have it, Fiennes brings the human qualities of Almásy in a way that absolutely no other actor could have. I could not have been a better actor for the job. <br /> <br /> So, please take these comments to heart, see the movie, those who call it "boring" or "despicable" know nothing , and should be ashamed of such a one-dimensional view of the film, a view that they have not studied or corrected, and probably do not plan on correcting.The English Patient is the best of all the films that have won the Oscar for Best Picture, reasons hidden in their triu nfos poetics.
