This was a fantastically written script when it comes to noticing things from another perspective. The comedy was timely and not exaggerated, the acting was generally great, and the plot served a greater purpose of generating misconceptions when we think of people based only on their outward appearance. The plot plot as the brother / sister character of Amanda Bynes tries to play football on the boys team, instead finding a new loving interest along the way. Tatum Channing is where the true misperception is and he does an excellent job of disinterested at first, after realizing that the most important thing in life is friendship, not attitude.
