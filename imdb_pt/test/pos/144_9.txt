The Priest, in deep love and suffering, did not show the result of love, but the process of love and salvation has a great human soul (or vampire?) Beauty. http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/confuoco/diary/200911290000/ <br /> <br /> And the love of Femme fatale is not notorious, but adorable in leading responsible death as a vampire. She did not continue falling into the bottom of the lost paradise, but decided to leave humanity alone. Fragile but adorable Femme fatale! This movie made me think of suffering between humans and vampires, far beyond the priesthood and salvation. I also thought about love. Adam was not so responsible for Eve, but for this Adam (priest), sacrificial and responsible for choosing Eve from Paradise Lost, the world of vampires. Another symphonic poem by Adam and Eve, Paradise Lost.
