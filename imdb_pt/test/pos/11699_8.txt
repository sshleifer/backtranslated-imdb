Considering the terrible history of Mick Molloy since leaving alone, I had very low expectations for Crackerjack. Even the promotional posters in the movie made me nervous. In fact, if it were not for the fact that I got free tickets for the preview, I would have resisted the pressure from the mistress (who thinks Mick is a hottie - there's a concern) to pay for it. The first few minutes of the movie made me worried - it starts with one of Micks's tired routines "get mad at insignificant things," but it was given a neat touch, which at least made it a bit refreshing. The rest of the script was very good, and very light - even the typical mood of Mick Molloy (and Judith Lucy) was well received and although I never had to get up from the aisles, it generated a lot more laughter than I expected and was consistent). There is nothing new in the plot - quite predictable, but it moved quickly between phrases and other jokes - I never felt that it housed in any element too long or too short; Mick must have worked hard on polishing his script. There were one or two jokes inside the "Late Show," and one or two jokes that only the inhabitants of Melbourne would get - but certainly there are many generic things to a wider audience. Something I did John Clarke's relative disappointment was disappointing - he just did not seem to work like the bad guy, but that did not detract greatly from the film. <br /> <br /> Most of all, I liked this Australain. comedy, and was pleasantly entertained during the duration of the movie. I left the theater with a decent-sized smile - a very difficult thing for an Australian comedy to do in my books. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br />
