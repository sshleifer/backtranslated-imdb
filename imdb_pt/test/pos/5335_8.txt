Coming from previously developed characters in a series of highly praised short films, THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT is as far as the "family food" you can get: beautifully crafted and witty and intelligent dialogue Concepts, this is really a movie which will appeal to almost every member of the family. <br /> <br /> The story concerns Wallace and his dog Gromit, who live in a village obsessed with growing large vegetables for the annual fair and operating "Anti-Pesto", a human solution for all those pesky rabbits that plague passionate gardeners everywhere. The deal is a big hit - but Wallace is a bit too smart for his own good. When he tries to "rehabilitate" the rabbits from his vegetable crunching methods, he unexpectedly releases an old horror of legendary proportions: the wolf-rabbit! And suddenly no vegetable in town is safe! The film is full of crazy inventions, unexpectedly clever dialogues and references to everything from KING KONG to WOLF MAN - more than enough to attract even an exhausted teenager - but the real charm of the thing is in its characters. The amount of personality that artists and entertainers can extract from clay is incredible: they look as alive as any real flesh-and-blood actor. The release of the DVD (and I recommend the widescreen) includes a lot of informative and fun extras as well. Highly recommended! GFT, Amazon Reviewer
