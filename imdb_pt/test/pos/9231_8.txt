The 221 episodes of "The Lone Ranger" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1949 to 1957; and then for many years they played in local unions. For most of the original broadcast years, the series was ABC's most-watched programming piece. <br /> <br /> The new Pop Flix DVD contains the first 16 episodes (September 15 - December 29, 1949) and for some reason unknown to me 22 episode of the fifth season, for a total of 17 episodes ( the same 17 available at Mill Creek Entertainment's launch last year, so these are probably in the public domain). These sets virtually make the film "The Lone Ranger Legend" superfluous, since all three episodes that were combined in 1952 to form the film are included in these releases. <br /> <br /> The opening episodes go back to the radio, as there is much more narrative narration used as an introduction and to introduce the main moments of the plot. <br /> <br /> The series itself was a pure western kiddie, with good and badly defined distinctions and no romance. The title character (played by Clayton Moore) started Texas Ranger John Reid. The first three episodes provide the background for his transformation into the status of Lone Ranger, his partnership with Indian Tonto (Jay Silverheels) and the domestication of his "Silver" horse. <br /> <br /> There is an unambiguous code of positive morality that infuses each episode. The Lone Ranger is totally good, but he takes on the disguise of evil. While a masked man in the west was usually feared by good citizens and an Indian was suspicious, the Lone Ranger is feared by those who would do evil. A persistent theme is that when the Lone Ranger and Tonto meet for the first time a common citizen, they are received with distrust and, at the end of the episode, the citizen is convinced of its value. The end of the trademark was a secondary character asking the question "who was that masked man?". <br /> <br /> To really appreciate the series, you must accept it for the simplistic tale of morality you intended to be. If you do not take it seriously and continue to crave some self-reflective elements of extravagant parody, you will only be frustrated. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
