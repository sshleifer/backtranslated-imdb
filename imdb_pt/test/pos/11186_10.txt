"Curse of the Island of the Apes" is a treasure; in my opinion, the series as a whole was the holy grail of adventure games, not to mention LucasArts. <br /> <br /> But to return to Curse, what is beautiful in the WCC is that he is not afraid to be himself. He deviates from the first two, but still remains true to Ron Gilbert's productions (if only the same could be said about the fourth installment of the series!). The voice work is flawless, with Dominic Armato playing our favorite protagonist, Guybrush Threepwood. The animation, though quite different from the classic pixelated characters, is beautifully done. It really is absolutely beautiful. And the music is fantastic! It's never boring and you never have the urge to turn it off. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not much of a fan of novels, romantic scenes and themes are not at all dominant. They also have the rare ability to look sweet instead of tacky. That says a lot about a girl who routinely falls asleep during girls' movies. <br /> <br /> So, of course, it's the classic humor element of MI. CMI is quite adept at providing blank lines, totally absurd humor and simply good fun. Gary Coleman makes an appearance as a young entrepreneur on the rise, and world events are discreetly spiked without leaving the boundaries of the game. <br /> <br /> It is not entirely fair to compare CMI to MI and MI2 because it is really true. is in a kingdom of its own. Personally I can never find a favorite among the 3, as they are all very different from one another. However, if you want a good time buck with the style of the classic series, I insist that you give the game a chance. You will NOT be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars, hands down. <br /> <br /> - Emily N
