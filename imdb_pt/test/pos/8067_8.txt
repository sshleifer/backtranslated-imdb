Annie Rooney lives with her official father and brother Tim in the slums of New York, where she is constantly getting involved in many fights with the other children in the neighborhood. Annie secretly has a crush on Joe Kelly (whose younger brother Mickey is the gang boss that Annie constantly fights), who is in a gang that is in trouble, police officer Rooney says. Kelly sponsors a dance, where Tony plans to shoot Kelly to match him for making him look like a jerk in front of his girl, but cop Kelly is fatally injured. Tim (part of Kelly's gang) is told by Tony, and friend Spider, who Kelly shot at his father, then he goes after him in revenge. Annie learns this and will stop her brother if she arrives on time. Very good mix of humor and heart in this film, even if the plot does not start until the 40 minute mark of the film. Pickford is nice (despite having 33 playing a girl no more than 12-13) and really gets into his character. Haines does not play Kelly as hard as he should, but is able to make the audience feel for him on an emotional level. The scenes in which the officer tells Annie about his father's death and the ending actually cause a lump in the throat. Mixing all sorts of kids throughout the movie is fun to watch. Evaluation, 8.
