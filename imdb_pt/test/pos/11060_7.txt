Maybe this movie is a little too long, but it still has some charm 45 years later. The lead roles seem more appropriate for Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. I could care less about Gary Cooper, but Ingrid Bergman is fine, particularly in dark hair. It's worth watching the movie for the supporting cast: Flora Robson is fantastic as a mulatto servant. She is a white woman in blackface, and may have an evil expression or a voodoo lover. Jerry Austin as a dwarf servant has a delightful role, which keeps you laughing despite some too long scenes. Speaking of scenes, Florence Bates steals most of what she is as a social widow lady. I did not understand the result of the railroad fight at the end of the movie, and the last scene was pure Hollywood. It's a strange feeling when you realize that the title of the movie refers to a railroad rather than a piece of luggage!
