It is less visceral than the only other Tsai film I've seen ("Live L'amour"), but the idea of ​​doors (holes) in the emotions and existences of others is vividly portrayed here, as Tsai sets a long shot after shooting long, usually with long shots, suggesting a sense of alienation in Taipei. The musical interludes, inspired by Grace Chang, are perplexing, but milestones are added that add new dimensions to the slow evolutionary relationship between the upstairs young man and the downstairs woman. It's not necessarily an easy movie to watch (though it's not heavy, anyway), so I would alert any casual viewer who is looking for some "indie" entertainment (like Tarantino or Guy Ritchie). But if you would like to know something about the isolation between the inhabitants of the cities of Taiwan, and something more universal about the alienation of the city and the romantic yearning, then watch this movie right away.
