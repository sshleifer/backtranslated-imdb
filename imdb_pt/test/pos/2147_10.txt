I saw the Gate of Paradise in its opening week, almost twenty years ago. Tickets were sold in advance, based on the high expectation of seeing Cimino's lengthy follow-up to his 1978 masterpiece, "The Deerhunter." Critics arrived and critics vehemently destroyed the film. An influential New York film critic led the way and most critics followed suit at 3 o'clock. 40 min. film was taken from the distribution. United Artists got Cimino to shorten the film in about an hour and was re-released many months later for equally horrific criticism and discouraging business. The film at the time cost about $ 40 million (now considered low-budget), making it one of the most expensive in history and Cimino had free control over the project, with endless resumes, although it is only his third film. "The Deerhunter" also received a negative reaction based on a perceived political ideology, which was not popular. I mention all this to present a possible trend against Cimino. At the time I thought the film was very good and when I saw the shorter version was still very good, even less. The film appeared again in a museum in the early 90's. They were supposed to show the long version but could not find an existing print. However, watching the movie years later, I now thought that Heaven's Gate was a masterpiece. Finally, the long version started appearing in selected cities, I saw it recently and it was worth the wait. The Gate of Heaven begins with the graduation ceremony at Harvard University. Two of the graduates are Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt and we have some of the flaws in their characters from early on. Despite the mandate of Joseph Cotton in his speech to the graduating class to use their education to clarify and improve their country, many of the graduates behave as if they were part of an elite club. The film advances 20 years to Johnson County, Wyoming. A cattle company called the "Association of Shareholders" hired poor people to kill 125 poor immigrants, claiming they are cattle thieves. Kristofferson is on the side of the immigrants while John Hurt is part of the Association. Although Hurt is totally against this insane action, he is a very ineffective character to do anything about. A massacre happens, but immigrants do well to defend themselves. The United States Cavalry comes to the aid of the Association to allegedly arrest them after most of the damage was done when in fact they sanctioned mass killing. Kristofferson also suffers a great personal loss and the film ends with him years later, as part of the elite class of his times at Harvard, married, bored, on a yacht, living but dead inside. <br /> <br /> A very complex film that is brilliant in every department such as themes, structure, direction, cinematography, writing, music, editing, set design and acting. Kristofferson, Walken, Hurt, Huppert, Dourif, Bridges, Waterston and Cotton are all great complex characters. Some of the main complaints I read about this movie say that it is ugly to look at, incoherent, too long, that the characters do not make sense and that words are often unintelligible. In her defense, Heaven's Gate looks like photographs from that period, just like "McCabe & Mrs. Miller" did. Some of the scenes are smoky to suggest the industrial revolution or sometimes horses, carts, people passing by creating a sense of reality (the critic who called him one of the ugliest films ever done likes to use his thumbs. The film makes a lot of sense if you pay attention to it.Everything is not written for the viewer and you need to closely observe the characters' motives or themes. long, is a beautifully structured piece, sometimes moving, poetic, stimulating or devastating, with virtually one big scene after another. Sometimes some of the words are unintelligible, especially in some of the busy scenes of activity. a cinematographic film like this through the use of cinematic language, the looks between the characters or their actions. One day soon this film and it must be re-launched in its entirety so that people and critics can give a second chance. Do not let Michael Cimino become another Orson Wellesworthed enjoyed in his life and unable to make the kinds of great movies that he is able to do.
