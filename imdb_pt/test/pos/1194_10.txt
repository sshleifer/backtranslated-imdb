Absolutely amazing! Humor, bustling music and an anti-war message make this probably the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love how clever this movie is, particularly in the part of Vietnam. plot. It is interesting how they make the authorities of the army imposing the draft seem ridiculous. Follow this with the grave situation of the real war, and then the conclusion (which makes me boil with anger at the war); and yet there is absolutely no violence on the screen. Wow. <br /> <br /> Besides, the song is really cool. But what is very original in this musical (as opposed to Evita, or Wizard of Oz, for example) is that the lyrics do not tell the story. Humor does (along with visuals and between dialogue songs): "Donna" is an optimistic song that emphasizes good humor, while "Flesh Failures" has an intense and intense beat, in a small key. <br /> <br /> In addition, I notice that the LSD scene is not very flattering. Now I definitely will not use drugs (not that I have intended). <br /> <br /> All things considered, this is an incredible movie. The only negative comment I could say is that sometimes it is difficult to hear the dialogue. But who cares? 10/10 stars!
