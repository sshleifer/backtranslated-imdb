The Feast of Babette, for me, is about healing: repairing the schism between spirit and body in orthodox Christianity. This Puritan community in remote Denmark is losing an adequate appreciation of all the gifts of God in creation. They have taken the dualism of St. Paul to an extreme and emphasize the life of the "spirit," not the life of the "flesh." Both older sisters, in their youth, were frightened by the attraction of love and the temptations of life outside their simple village. They and their parishioners cling to the narrow biblical interpretation of their former leader and the sisters' father. The older congregation became impatient and quarrelsome, and the sisters do not know what to do. Between Babette, a French stranger and someone to whom they can show kindness. They have no way of knowing that she will finally return her kindness and give fertile soil to her dry and dusty theology. Babette will give all she has and in the process will teach the sisters and their flock about grace, about sacrifice, how sensual experience (as in the bread and wine of the Eucharist) can change lives and why true art moves . so deeply. When they can forgive each other and themselves, they can focus on the love of God that unfolds before them in a concrete way in the present. As a minister and an artist, I can not recommend a movie more. True art and true grace !!
