If you've ever been a fan of MTV's "The State," then these three guys are going to be familiar to you. But even if you just stumbled upon them over the internet as I did, you'll soon get to enjoy your unique brand <br /> <br /> Born of his stand-up comedy trio, 'Stella', Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter and David Wain produced these brilliant vignettes of surreal comedy to show off at their shows, and now after are available only to download two websites, they appear in immaculate glory on a DVD. Think of the uncensored comedy sketch, and you'd be halfway. <br /> <br /> No stone of decency is left to come .. who like their rude, self-indulgent comedy and childish brows (and I mean in the most flattering way) this is the DVD for you! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth the money for the comment of the two Michaels and David alone, you can not help liking les as they explain their actions, curl up in their own antics with their former toys and turn pat to each other in the back and vomit abuse. <br /> <br /> Fantastic. <br /> <br /> It should say something to Stella's appeal that the likes of Julie Bowen and Paul Rudd are willing to launch into action so fearlessly. And you must follow your good example, throw prejudices to the wind and prepare to laugh at yourself sick.
