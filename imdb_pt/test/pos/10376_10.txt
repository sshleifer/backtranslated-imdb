I was surprised that I liked this movie. But this reminded me of a 2004 version of the first Friday 13. There were a lot of cheese elements, but at the same time there were lots of cool elements. The plot was good - predictable if you've seen more than one or two horror movies, but full of effect phrases to make it worthwhile. There are some memorable scenes that are worth watching. Some problems I had with the plot had to do with the continuity of the characters. For example, in the opening scene, scarecrows (which were human on stakes whose blood was drained to grow crops) looked very real, but later in the film they looked more like fake scarecrows wearing blue masks. There were more than a few loopholes in the plot, and the acting was mediocre, but at least it seemed like people actually talk, unlike the Hollywood movies, where the dialogue is really fake when you think about it. The culmination of the last scene, when the main character says "I'm not a Baker, I'm a Connell!" and the scarecrow's head is satisfactory, since his friends were largely killed by these creatures at that point.
