Hmmmm I'm kind of lost here. I mean, I know I enjoyed the Death Bed, I know I'll be spreading the gospel of Death Bed to all my friends and acquaintances, and if you're reading this, I beg you to see the Death Bed, but I can not really Tell me why. Perhaps this is the secret of his charm. <br /> <br /> Plot? Well, more or less. There is this bed that eats people (and fried chicken, apples, flowers, suitcases, and anything else that comes close) by sucking them into the mattress filled with digestive fluid. Between his almost unlimited powers, Bed has the ability to keep the spirit of Aubrey Beardsley stuck behind an image to observe and narrate the events of the film. Several people end up in Bed's abandoned mansion (Beda's habit of eating anything that moves has given the place an unpleasant reputation), and lying down to have sex, take a nap, or because they do not feel well and are eaten at times having first trip dreams. And in the end we have the explosive final showdown between Beardsley, Bed's mother (you had to be there), and Bed. It seems simple enough, when I put it that way, it is not - well, except for the part of Aubrey Beardsley. But something seems to be constantly out of order, and the story seems to slip drowsy from scene to scene, even when indulging in cheap chuckles or strange effects. Imagine Bunel crossed with Bergman, then let himself dive into a large tank of Herschell Gordon Lewis. The tone of the story shifts from horror, to fairy tale, to comedy, to existential meditation, without breaking the stride - an incredible achievement for a budget film student filmed in the Detroit area. <br /> <br /> All in all, an amazing little movie that, most likely, no criticism can do justice completely. See for yourself.
