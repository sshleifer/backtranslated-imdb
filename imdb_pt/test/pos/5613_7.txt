I really liked this movie ... and I watch it from time to time yet. I used this in my music lessons at the school where I teach. Kids seem to enjoy themselves, though, they would like it to be in color. The best thing about this movie is, for me, who grew up after Heifetz died, is the chance to actually see the movie. master violinist works his craft! I was amazed at how "updated" the story is. Although, references to "school reform" are outdated. A boy whose father died and is being raised by his mother and stepfather .... most of our children today are being raised by stepfathers, although the film makes it appear that most stepfathers are cruel. I get very angry when the mother does not stay with him and defends his actions against his stepfather. <br /> <br /> In addition, music selections are hard to believe. I think it's unbelievable that a child, who seems to be about 8 years old, can play "Waltz Minute," or that a 13-year-old girl can sing an Rigoletto aria. <br /> <br /> Other than that, it's a very fun, feel good movie and I highly recommend it. I wish it was released on DVD.
