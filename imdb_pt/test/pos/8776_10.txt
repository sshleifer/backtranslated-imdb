This film is a brilliant acting masterpiece and timely patriotic sense of pride in America. The Nazi Saboteurs of the 1940s are replaced by the Middle East Terrorists of today. The intention is the same: to terrorize, to disturb lives, to destroy properties and to kill Americans! We saw Barry (Bob Cummings) unjustly accused in trying to uncover the real Nazi conspiracy, meet the beautiful Pat (Priscilla Lane) and together they travel to New York chasing after the devilish saboteur Fry, skillfully played by Norman Lloyd. Along the way, they find the also very sinister Otto Kruger playing the leader of the Nazi saboteur ring, but disguised as an illustrious model citizen, where Barry seeks the Fry saboteur, takes him to his trust, only to be surrendered to the local police. He escapes, meets a gentle gentleman blind and his niece, enters Priscilla Lane. From there, Barry and Pat travel to Soda City Cal. And they come across the west coast saboteur gang heading east. They trail ends up in the mansion of an unlikely New York Socialite. Things get tough when the thugs kidnap Barry Pat and he goes after her with a reckless abandon. The movie's climax is the famous Statue of Liberty scene, which is drawn in many compilations. This is a true blue flag patriotic performance at its best and what's wrong with that! Watch this movie if you do not see another Hitchcock movie. You will be snatched away by patriotic furor and the love interest between Cummings and Lane will make you wish they were paired up in other movies. She is the beautiful and ideal girl next door, often underestimated, her talent shows through this film. See and go bless America!
