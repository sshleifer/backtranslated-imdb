In the end, it is clear that the killers planted the murder weapon in Mrs. Columbo's car and went to the police ballistics laboratory. <br /> <br /> But where did the gun come under the hood, used in the demonstration? Would not the killers have cleared the stuff under the hood? Did they have a whole week? Or did the Columbus cops replicate the camera / gun under the hood used in the demonstration? How did they do it without breaking and getting into the car? Maybe that's why the killings seemed surprised by the ending. But how could Columbus have replicated his camera / gun device and have it calibrated for his locksmith? Columbo must have taken the gun back from the ballistics and have it re-planted under the hood of the car, and was very lucky that the rest of the camera device was still there and broadcasting. <br /> <br /> a 10/10 show until this glaring plotting error in the end.
