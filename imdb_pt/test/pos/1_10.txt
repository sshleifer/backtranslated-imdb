My boyfriend and I went to watch The Guardian. At first I did not want to watch it, but I loved the movie. It was definitely the best movie I have ever seen at some point. They portrayed the USCG very well, it really showed me what they do and I think they should really be more appreciated. Not only did he teach, but it was a really good film. The film shows what it really does and how hard the work is. I think being a USCG would be challenging and very scary. It was a great movie out there. I would suggest this movie to anyone to see. The end broke my heart, but I know why he did it. The plot was great. I give it two thumbs up. I cried it was very exciting, I would give 20 if I could!
