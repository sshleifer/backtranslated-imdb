This movie is a gem ... a Gerry Anderson classic yet to be discovered. <br /> <br /> The origins of "UFO" and "Space 1999" are obvious in this film, including the cast list that includes the late Ed Bishop. and George Sewell who both went to "UFO". <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate that Anderson, despite his many TV hits, has not had a chance to develop his talent on the big screen. Just think about what he might have done with the film version of "Thunderbirds" (which he rightly denied!). <br /> <br /> I am sure that if you give "JTTFSOTS" / "Doppleganger" chance you will appreciate its good qualities.
