I grew up in Baltimore, so I was exposed to the John Waters films, since I was too young to watch them. And if you have knowledge of John Waters is limited to Hairspray or Cry-Baby, or other movies for the family, then you should prepare for Pink Flamingos. Sexually explicit sexes, incest, an old lady who eats nothing but eggs, and unhealthy acts with chickens are but a mere portion of the depravity in this film. The movie ends with Divine, Waters' Â£ 300. cross-dressing star eating dog excrement. <br /> <br /> The premise is about two families: one is a pair of innate trash trailer, which includes Divine and Edith Massey as the lady of the egg; and the other is a rich, swinging couple. Both families are competing for the title of "Living Most Dirty Person". Enjoy the best John Waters movie, but just see if you're an open-minded guy with a strong stomach because some scenes in this movie will make you disgusting.
