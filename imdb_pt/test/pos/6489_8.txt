I bought this some time ago during a massive phase of martial arts movies. Although this is certainly not the best, I love this kind of movie, and there was a lot to keep me entertained in this movie. Leung Kar Yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars, I always appreciate the fact that although he does not have formal martial arts training, he usually gave a more than capable fighting performance. He also has a good beard. This film has him in a good and heroic role and although he does not kick as much as in some of his other films, he still acquits himself well. The first appearances of Cherie Chung and Chow Yun Fat are also cool, especially as Chow Yun Fat faces the bad guys without his trademark. He may not be a great fighter, but he's fine. Eddy Ko is a guy as bad as ever, he does the same villainy as in many other movies and is great as usual. The guy who plays Bu is also good, I do not remember his name, but he's also in the Magnificent Butcher. Although the fight is not as good as other movies of the day, the postman struggles to make up for it with great imagination, quality filmmaking and a very peculiar environment. There are some really cool scenes, good characters and a good eclectic mix of Hong Kong talent, all brought together for a decent effect. All in all, I would recommend this to kung fu and general action fans from Hong Kong. It may not be a stylized classic like the Shaw brothers' movies, or as nice as Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee, but it's a solid entertainment.
