Fritz Lang directed two great westerns: "Western Union" and "The Return of Frank James". Frank James's movie is like "Jesse James". "Western Union" is one of the great westerns of Randolph Scott. I've never seen Robert Young in a western before; he is fantastic as an employee of the telegraph. This is the only movie I can think of that is about the telegraph company opening in the west. It's a high-voltage story about the telegraph in the west, a triangular love story, and about loyalty. <br /> <br /> The support cast is superb. Dean Jagger, who made some westerns, plays the telegraph manager. Virginia Gilmore, who plays Jagger's sister, is the love interest in the film. Gilmore had a short film career. He left the films in 1952 and became a drama trainer. She is known primarily as the first Mrs. Yul Brynner. It's great to see Slim Summerville in a movie with Mr. Scott again. They were in two other great films: "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" and "Jesse James".
