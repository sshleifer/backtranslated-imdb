Inglorious Basterds is a comic fantasy gloomy and violent, gloriously. Built on the structure of The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds discards the long training sequences of The Dirty Dozen to dive into action immediately. In the process, Tarantino corrects one of the main flaws of The Dirty Dozen, giving the rogue screen time to remind us how bad the Nazis were. The Nazis with more time on the screen end up becoming the most completely human characters in the film, which ironically makes them even worse monsters. <br /> <br /> Bu waiving the training sequences, Tarantino is also able to give us a photo. of the whole war, showing us not only British, American and German soldiers, but also giving us glimpses of the world of French and German civilians, both collaborators and Resistance. <br /> <br /> Needless to say that any Tarantino film will have a fantastic dialogue, but when Tarantino decided that the French speak French and the Germans speak German, in addition to adding a level of authenticity, Tarantino also ensured that his dialogue in French was as strong and funny as intelligent. As an example, during the opening sequence, the Nazi "Jewish hunter" SS colonel Hans Landa (Christian Waltz) is interrogating French farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa suspects that LaPadite is hiding a family of Jews. While subtly pressing LaPadite, Landa orders a glass of milk. After swallowing the greed, Landa praises LaPadite for his daughters and his cows, "to the family and to the veils, je dis bravo". The thing is, in French "vache" means cow, but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. If he is reprimanded by this vulgar pun, Landa could, quite convincingly, claim not to understand French well enough to be like that, but Landa means so, and he considers it a threat. And LaPadite understands its meaning very well. <br /> <br /> This is a really subtle piece of word representation and interpretation that many audiences would never understand, or at least could understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat. The movie is rich with that kind of detail. All dialogues in French and English are chosen with the same attention to detail, and although I can not swear to German, I suspect he would show a similar level of office. Inglorious Basterds opens with the phrase "Once upon a time ... in Nazi-occupied France". Personally, this reminds me of the opening of all the books and films of Asterix, another comic fantasy in a war-stricken France. Like Asterix, Inglorious Basterds is frighteningly funny in some places, although the film also becomes sombrely serious. <br /> <br /> In his most serious moments, Inglorious Basterds reminds us that the first casualties of the war are compassion and the ability to relax. As in almost every elongated movie sequence, Tarantino finds a new way to create a cruel tension at almost unbearable levels. Tarantino also reminds us that the film is dangerous, even inflammable and that its power deserves respect. <br /> <br /> If you can see this movie like I did in a theater packed with knowledgeable fans who make all the jokes, you'll see this masterful movie the way it should be seen. If you're not that lucky, all you'll see is an excellent movie that provides a dark and funny effect.
