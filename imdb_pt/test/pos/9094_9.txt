Worth the entry price for the Rock-off alone !! Any fan of D will love this movie (even if it's a bit short) and special appearances by John C Reilly, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Meatloaf and Dave Grohl (almost recognizable) prove that D is hard enough for anyone. Even Dio ... The sasquatch / mushroom scene will become an instant classic (I do not want to say anything else and be accused of putting spoilers here). Fans of the original HBO series will see some nods for the initial appearances of D in characters like Lee and the open microphone host. I just wanted them to have played some songs from the first album and the omission of 'totally drug government' from the POD album is also a disgrace. In addition, this movie rocks. Obey the D!
