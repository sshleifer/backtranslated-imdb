This show is incredible! I love all the actors! It has great lines and characters. It's the perfect drama. James Caan and Josh Duhamel have a great dialogue. Both can be really funny. I miss Vanessa Marcil at General Hospital, but she's great here. James Lesure is great! It can be hilarious. Molly Sims plays an idiot very well. The writing is incredible! They keep up a great pace. The show can actually leave you hanging, which is one of my favorite elements of a show. I can not wait until the new season starts. This show reaches the top ten of all my shows. I hope this show continues for a long time. If people know what is good, it will happen. I never want the show to end. Ever.
