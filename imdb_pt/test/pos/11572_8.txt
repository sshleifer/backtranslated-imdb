"Thesis," "Open Eyes," and "The Others" were proof of Amenabar's talent and ability as a filmmaker, but (in my humble opinion) they were also flawed films in his attempt to fool the public, always offering a return of the film . tighten too much, favoring cheap emotions, twists and turns. Luck for Everyone Amenabar chose a theme for her new movie that would not allow for an astonishing ending focusing on the characters and the emotional ties that hold them. <br /> <br /> The result is a small miracle of a movie, beautifully written, photographed, marked, represented and directed. Everyone involved in this film delivers high-performance performance behind the scenes of the wonderful cast (Bardem shines, but Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Clara Segura and Lola Due√±as give the film an incredible authenticity) for the exquisite Aguirresarobe. lens. <br /> <br /> The film addresses many relevant issues and emotions effectively, approaches the heart and mind with equal power and offers a finishing touch that stays with you for a long time after the credits. This is a brilliantly executed film that will not only remain a landmark in Spanish cinema, but will certainly become a pleasant surprise when opening abroad (Sony Classics has paid a record $ 6 million to distribute it). He can get into the Oscar race ... There's no way to stop Amenabar ... Good work, Alejandro!
