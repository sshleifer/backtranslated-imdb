I saw this in Zone horror and hoped it sucks like most of the movies they play, but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie revolves around 2 friends and a maniac in a monster truck that is chasing them (I know it sounds crap, but it's actually pretty good), the movie is scary when it claims to be and it's funny in parts (not in an unintentional way, it's very rhythmic and it's a lot of fun, besides being very bloody, it has a very funny black humor as well.It's not the most original movie, but what if you're after Shakespeare, that's not it, if your after a fun movie, then this should be fine
