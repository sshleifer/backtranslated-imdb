Kazuo Komizu strikes again with "Entries of a Beautiful Woman", the sequel to "Entrails of a Virgin." This time the story is based around a psychologist (Megumi Ozawa) who decides to take over Yakuza to avenge the suicide of a doped and raped patient who ends up at his door one day. When she overcomes her head and Yakuza captures her, she learns his insidious betrayal of doping the girls and selling them to slavery. Apparently it ends badly when she overdoses on cocaine. But does it soon combine with another body to be eliminated to become dum, dum, dum ?? "Super Slime Hermaphrodite Zord"! Does he, she = does minced meat out of the yakuza and save the day ?? not really. <br /> <br /> Well, it's better than "Entrails of a Virgin", but not by much. Most of the movie (a whopping 67 minutes) consists of rape and sex with nebulization and the usual ho-hum stuff. Almost in the end we finally get into our sequence with a cool sequence (like an alien-inspired penis through the stomach scene and a sticky choking), but she still suffers from a low budget feeling that makes her fun, the z-grade soft horror-core fare.
