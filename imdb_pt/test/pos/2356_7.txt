Warner Brothers produced this 3D extravaganza that was the biggest commercial success for the westerns in 1953. Guy Madison leads a group of guardsmen and misfits to rescue two white women being held by the Indians, which essentially exists for this movie . The 3D format was in its early stages as a Hollywood trick to compete with the growing popularity of domestic television, and the effects work very well here. Rescuers flee with the women and are pursued by the Indians until the white men stand on an island in the bed of a stream. The Indian armament reaches the public without stopping everywhere, and a spray of tobacco juice aimed at a rattlesnake is played to good measure. Madison was quite popular as Wild Bill Hickock, of the television, and is good like a uncrowded farmer, that receives an thankless task of the army. For all the polish and presentation of the film, the film was made in just three days.
