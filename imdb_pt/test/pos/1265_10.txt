I'm surprised that Memento (which is a great movie) is so well seen in the Top 250 and this one does not even show up !! What the hell is that?? To be honest - when this movie ended my automatic reaction was that this movie is better than Memento. After the euphoria of the fabulous end is over, I have concluded that they are equal in their excellence. I'm just confused about why it's not in the Top 50 along with Memento. I'm going to take a hunch that (unfortunately) is because it's in black and white or because (again, sadly) that all the characters have British accent ... unfortunately, because that's no reason not to enjoy a great movie like this. <br /> <br /> I'm telling you that if you loved Memento, you'll also love Follow. Bright!
