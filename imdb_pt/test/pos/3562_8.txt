This pleasant euro-western opens with a scene that precedes a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to film for "Once Upon a Time in the West" but failed to persuade Clint Eastwood to appear. Three tough gunslingers ride in a city. One is dressed as the unnamed man in a poncho. Another is dressed as Colonel Mortimer of "For a few dollars more," and the third is dressed as Django, except that he rides a horse instead of pulling a coffin behind him with a machine gun. Our hero finds them on the Main Street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins. "Any Gun Can Play" is a spaghetti western with a joke in spaghetti westerns since the hero here erases the three assassins. In addition to a little too much comedy, especially in the acrobatic fight sequences, this is an above-average feeder. The notorious Mexican bandit Montero (Gilbert Roland of "Barbarosa") and his gang of happy gunmen steal an army train carrying $ 300,000 in gold coins across the border. Director Enzo G. Castellari, of Inglorious Bastards, stages the support of various camera angles that put him at the forefront of the action. The bandits seize the locomotive along with the chariot carrying the gold and separate it from the rest of the train that houses the American cavalry. While Montero and his gunmen keep the Cavalry immobilized, Pajondo (Pedro Sanchez of "Sabata") commands the locomotive, kills the engineer and his crew and takes her away, leaving the other gunmen behind to defend themselves. Essentially, Pajondo crosses Montero and steals the gold for himself. Later, Montero reaches Pajondo in Rio Grande. Before the bandit can reveal the whereabouts of the sack to Montero, however, a cavalry sergeant shoots Pajondo dead. Before dying, Pajondo tells Montero about a medallion that serves as a clue as to where he hid the treasure. The angry Cavalry captain (Ivano Staccioli of "Commandos") imprisons Montero, but he can not loosen the bandit's tongue even after using his whip on him. Enraged by Montero's reticence, the captain threatens to have the Mexican shot if he does not speak. Meanwhile, the jailers let a priest talk to Montero, but he's not really a priest. The six-armed Stranger (George Hilton of "The Ruthless Four") disguises himself as a cloth man and rescues Montero from a firing squad. Unfortunately, before Montero is rescued, Clayton (Edd Byrnes, from the TV "77 Sunset Strip") takes the locket and holds it for himself. Clayton is the representative of the bank that was sent to protect the gold. He is horrified that the captain wants to shoot Montero. Clayton's career in the bank depends on his ability to recover gold. The Stranger sets fire to the fort to distract the firing squad and Montero takes the Captain hostage and tries to flee, but the Stranger throws him off the horse. Before the authorities can verify that Montero is dead, the Stranger claims the body for the beautiful reward he will receive and he leaves with graceful thanks from the captain. As soon as they left the fort, Montero's men appear to rescue him from the Stranger. From this point on, Stranger, Montero, and Clayton forge short-lived alliances with each other as they seek gold. Castellari and the showman Tito Carpi, who has written several westerns like "A few dollars for Django" and another with Castellari "Seven Winchesters for a Massacre", rely on intelligent humor and reversals to keep the action fresh and fast. rhythm. A cool scene has Clayton sitting at a table about to eat his meal when he hears some suspicious sounds behind him. Clayton puts his drink on the table and sees the gunslingers behind him with six cannons in the holster. <br /> <br /> "Any Gun Can Play" lives up to its title. In fact, many guns play, and at least twenty or more corpses pile up before fade-out. This western is not so much a parody, but it's an imitation of Sergio Leone's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." Remember, bad guys and good guys fall as often as ten pins on a bowling alley, but their deaths are not portrayed in the brutal form of a western Leone. "Any Gun Can Play" does not take itself as seriously as Leone's masterpiece. The three lead from one side to the other for supremacy. Each one has a piece of the puzzle that will take them to the treasure, but they refuse to share their information until the end of the shoot'em up. The colorful widescreen photography of Giovanni Bergamini's Lenser is spectacular, especially the early shots of the train blowing along train rails with distant mountains towering dramatically in the background. Another great shot comes when Montero tests the Stranger's unfazed calm. This scene happens after the Stranger rescued Montero and the Mexican minions arrive to save the bacon of his boss. Confronting Stranger's six-gun pistol, Montero looks at the tough guy and empties the revolver, placing his bullets pointed harmlessly in and around the fearless gunslinger. Bergamini, who photographed Castellari's thriller "Inglorious Bastards," frames the scene with the Stranger in the background and his pistol in Montero's hand in the foreground for a nice three-dimensional photo. Meanwhile, Francesco De Masi's lively orchestral score is as memorable for his own idiosyncratic melodies as Ennio Morricone's soundtracks were for Leone's westerns. The opening song is reminiscent of a 1950s Hollywood western with its captivating lyrics and guitar riffs. Although not a big spaghetti western, "Any Gun Can Play" is always fun nonsense, with interesting twists and good performances, especially the tireless Gilbert Roland, who was 62 at the time!
