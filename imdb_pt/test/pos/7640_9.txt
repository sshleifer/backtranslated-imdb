I do not see why all the people are giving negative reviews to the movie?!?! I loved this movie! Bled is an abstract art form, and if you do not like art, I can see why you would not like this film. It was a great turnaround of the average, played vampire movie. If you're looking for a new, ingenious new vampire movie then this is for you. But if you want one of them to turn into bats, wolves and melt in the movies of the sunshine, then go watch your old Dracula movies. Of course, it's a little on the low budget side, but they did a great job with the budget they had. I'm very happy to have found this movie because I was about to give up the vampire genre. I thought this movie was brilliant! I give two thumbs to the writer, director and everyone involved in the film.
