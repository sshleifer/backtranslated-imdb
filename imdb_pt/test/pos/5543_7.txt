First, do not be fooled by my family name. My mother was Italian in blood, so I really know Italian families, and I love gay movies, even funny ones like that. <br /> <br /> For those people who have a bad rap in this movie (you know who you are you must have your movie privileges taken from you because you do not know what's good. I was not sure if I would be able to get a picture of Michelle Pfieffer, but I do not know if I would be able to see her. I got caught up in the opening song by Rosemary Clooney, who was as Irish as possible, but his pronunciation of the Italian words in "Mambo Italiano" is flawless and sets the tone for what is to follow perfectly. next day because of this.) Just the look of all the fussy things in the apartment that I personally saw in my relatives' houses, though not in the same place (which I found hysterical), sold it to me. This movie is like the Goodfe I just wonder why there are no Burger Worlds and what happened to the food these guys should have? My guess is that the crew ate. "The chips are crispy. The shakes are creamy." My mouth is watering almost as much as you are thinking of the beautiful Mrs. Pfieffer. (And I've never trusted clowns anyway.) And the three best things about this movie are the amazing mob wife of Mercedes Ruehl rejected, Dean Stockwell as her womanizing husband Tony "The Tiger" and last but definitely not least , the great assault of Oliver Platt, who should have more comedic roles. And notice to myself: find out where this black girl went. There! Why does she work so rarely? This photo is right next to the big Mafia movies as it should be.
