If I were only allowed to watch a show in my entire life, I would definitely have to choose "The Chaser War on Everything". Of all the satirical shows that have been on Australian television, I found "Chaser" the funniest of them all. It's so incredible, the boys are not afraid to do anything. <br /> <br /> Whether it is dressing up as Hitler to enter a Polish club, or pushing a huge ball of rope around Melbourne to experience the sightseeing ads or rock up the bare Coca-Cola factory in a shower of $ 2.40 to buy some water. The Chaser boys will go there. <br /> <br /> According to the above comments (and / or below), "The Huntsman's War on Everything" is more popular than the previous "CNNNN" program. But CNNNN was so funny. Some unforgettable moments of this show ... Clean Cambodia !!! Classic. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to prevent me from further Ranting, I recommend that you at least give Chaser a chance, you will probably find it HILARIOUS !!!!
