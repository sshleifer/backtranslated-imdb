Dead or Alive: Final, the film that supposedly brings together the three films of the very weak Dead or Alive trilogy, and linked mainly by its stars, Riki Takeiuchi and Sho Aikawa, and that each film has its participation in games and neuroses of the bizarre world. and stacks of violence, is admittedly the weakest of the batch. That none of the three films ends up being a disappointment is less a proof of the creativity of the material, but of the guts that director Takashi Miike takes with the environment and the material. Here he presents an openly dystopian future, no matter how discreet, where a homosexual prefect / dictator (Richard Chen) has the whole village drugged, except for a group of rebels. There are also replicant-robots in this year 2346, one of them is Ryo (Aikawa), a robot of complete lethal ability, but also with the ability to love and learn and so on. Then a police officer, Takeshi (Takeiuchi) is the mayor's main guard. But things start to unfold on both sides, Ryo joining the rebels and Takeshi with his employer, despite the bloody setbacks as a hostage exchange have been bad, and with Takeshi discovering his wife and son are robots (not made in an alien mood, remember, suddenly, as if in a power gone off), and that he is also one of them. And all this leads to a last and inexplicable confrontation between the two men. Strange that there is yet another film in which Miike has peaks and valleys here, sometimes finding the successful middle ground where science fiction can have any meaning for it. But there really is nothing to be taken away from this story, except that the mayor / dictator is a dingbat with no background story that gets rid of making sure his drug prevents couples from getting pregnant and that everything stays under control. He also has along with him his slave love, I think, in the hilarious non-speaker part of a saxophonist who also doubles sometimes as a human accessory, when it does not push away the melancholic blues. Meanwhile, we have the conventional sides to the stories of Ryo and Takeshi, and they are never uninteresting, just not totally convincing enough to keep interest. Of course Miike is not above having fun, as when Takeshi leaves Michelle (Maria Chen) in the water to make her swim after an almost murder attempt against the mayor, or when the original rebel leader speaks English for no good reason in all. There's even a fun tribute to the old science fiction cartoons at the beginning of the movie. But there's nothing very convincing in terms of substance, except for Takeshi's little detours by becoming "good" in the middle of the movie (helping a couple get away with having a child), and especially Miike's strengths this time around are purely stylistic and the choice of locations and settings. <br /> <br /> It's like a dirty Japanese Alphaville, where everything still has a contemporary twist through all the special effects. And I really enjoyed the yellow-green tone that Miike used in the film, as it impacted very well on outdoor scenes and added a bit of roughness enough in the inner scenes. But for peaks and valleys, you see this more clearly - and the level of visual effects of the science fiction movie, with perhaps a few more dollars invested in it - during the climax. It contains some of the funniest materials of the director's delusional and Freudian sensibility, even if it has to start with an unbearable intuition; the way Ryo and Takeshi finally meet is a kind of random and just a way for producers to try to put together the last two films when it was not necessary. On the other hand, in terms of the sheer entertainment value guilty of a movie like Miike's, in which he sees something totally unexpected and very crude sexually, he appears in the best scenes in Happiness of the Katakuris and Visitor Q. Overall, Dead or Alive: Final is an insignificant effort of 90 minutes that is not taken very seriously, and is even better for its evil inventions, militaristic decadence and cultural difficulties put on display at the pulp level.
