Owen loves his mother ... only he would love her more than a meter and eighty in that dark and laughing comedy that starred and is directed by Danny DeVito, with admirable assists of Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey in the main paper "Throw Momma From The Train "is a great comedy, even if it's not a great movie. It is very shallow in parts, and the end looks less organic than applied. But it's a sweeping ride most of the way, with Crystal and DeVito employing great screen chemistry while their separate comic books take on the essence of being a distressed writer (DeVito is avid but untalented, Crystal is blocked and bitter). Professor Donner believes his ex-wife stole his book (unfortunately called "Hot Fire") and can not write more than the opening line of his next book, which is not easy. He teaches a creative writing class of beginner mediocrity, including a middle-aged woman who writes fiction like Tom Clancy but does not know what the underwater captain is talking about; and an upholstered salesman who wants to write the story of his life. Mr. Pinsky is probably the funniest laugh-by-the-minute-on-the-screen character, a weird stranger who sees literature as an excuse to write his work: "100 Girls Like Pork." <br /> <br /> Then there's DeVito's Owen Lift, who calls himself Professor Donner's "star student," even though the teacher does not read his work in class. Owen is a somewhat unusual character to star in a movie, a 30-year-old man-child who lives with his domineering mother, Anne Ramsey, who calls him "lassass" and other captivating feelings. In any other film, they would ask us to feel sorry for Owen, but "Throw Momma From The Train" puts the cruelties of life on this sad sack of laughter and expects us to go along. That's one big reason why this movie probably loses a lot of people. <br /> <br /> For those of us who like the humor of this character, even identifying with it, and take the rest of what we see here as a joke, is not so big enough to go along with the move bigger than this comedy, asking us to watch in fun while Owen asks for help from Professor Donner on a plan to kill his mother. In fact, he first goes to Hawaii to kill Donner's hated ex, so he tells the professor that it's his turn to kill Mrs. Lift, "trading assassinations" as seen in Hitchcock's "Strangers On A Train." <br /> <br /> DeVito not only complements the performances of his actors with the setting that puts the accent on the dialogue, he makes some bold visual statements, throwing in pieces of fun unreality to keep the audience at his fingertips (and far to take things very seriously.) Help is also the writer Stu Silver, who keeps the laughs coming with his quoteable slogan. "You have rats the size of Oldsmobiles here." "She's not a woman ... She's the Terminator." "A little murder and I'm Jack the Ripper." These are all Crystal's words, but some of the funniest lines, which work only in context, but absolutely kill, are those of DeVito and Ramsey. Apparently, Silver never wrote another script after that, according to IMDb, and that's a shame because he had real talent for it. <br /> <br /> The best scene in this movie, when Crystal meets Ramsey, was actually used in its entirety as a theatrical presentation of 'coming attraction', the only time I ever saw a movie promoted that way. Owen introduces the teacher to his mother as "Cousin Patty," and when Mom says he does not have a cousin Patty, Owen loses panic. "You lied to me," he shouts, beating the professor's forehead with a frying pan. <br /> <br /> Of course, in reality, the teacher would not moan about something witty from the ground, but "Play Mother The Train" works effectively at such times by playing your Looney Tunes vibe for everything DeVito did not disappear from the movies, of course, but it's a mystery why he did not keep up with the promise of directing this movie. Maybe it's because 'Launches the lack of popular hit shows from Momma From The Train, kind of vision is not for everyone. This is too bad for those of us who can watch it over and over again, and like it.
