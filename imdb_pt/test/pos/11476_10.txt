"Sorte Nula" is the 2004 Portuguese box office film. This extremely low production (about $ 150,000) opened during Christmas in front of American blockbusters like National Treasure, Polar Express, The Incredibles and Alexander, but quickly captured the adulation of the Portuguese. viewers. Despite the stiff competition, the small film surprised well, surpassing all other Portuguese films of the last two years in the first weeks. The film is a mystery / murder with a humorous tone cleverly written and directed by Fernando Fragata, who has become a solid reference in the arena of independent European cinema. I like the movie? Oh yes!
