This film is not only the last piece of the Three Colors trilogy, but also the best of the three and one of the best films of the 90s. There is almost no other film that so wisely and consequently asks for humanity and respect for all human beings. <br /> <br /> Valentine (Irene Jacob) lives in Geneva, where she works as a model. Although she has a boyfriend, she seems to be quite lonely. One night she suffers an accident and injures a dog and takes her to her owner, a retired jugde (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who is cynical and spies on her neighbors' phone calls. Disgusted by him, she can not leave and they meet again. Two lonely souls meet and become friends and develop a deep love for each other. <br /> <br /> The story itself is too complex to be fully told, there is another connection between them in a young man who represents both the judge and the real love of Valentine's Day and there is more in their relationship than just friendship. The actors are wonderful, Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant developing a deep and authentic friendship. <br /> <br /> The themes are of an endless validity, Fraternity, not only in contact with each other, but also in respect for the right to privacy. Alarmingly, we seem to lose this more and more, which makes films like these even more important than they might have been in 1994. <br /> <br /> Red is one of the strongest colors there is , representing inner turmoil, love, anger and passion. Used here as another protagonist, it brings an incomparable depth to the film. A masterpiece!
