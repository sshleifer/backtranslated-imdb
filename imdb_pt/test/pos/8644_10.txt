Hitchcock would be proud of this movie. Even when nothing happens, it's suspenseful. Director David Lynch uses some cheap tricks here and there, but he interweaves them with other cinematic techniques to prevent him from becoming obtuse. <br /> <br /> Completely surreal, this movie is like waking up and remembering most of the time. Dream, but not enough to make it wise. I'm still trying to figure it all out and I'll probably have to see it again to pick up things I missed and that can help me understand it better. It is a very detailed plot that comes very slowly so you should be patient and pay attention. Take your trip from the bathroom before it starts. And yet, the plot is overshadowed by the theme, humor, character development, and shooting techniques. <br /> <br /> The two roles of the lead actress, Naomi Watts, show her tremendous talent. That is, when I could take my eyes off your co-star. What a pair of performances. <br /> <br /> Lynch surprises throughout the film with unusual camera angles, the length / editing time of the cuts, going back and forth between scenes. Combined with the clever use of music and sounds, it all helps create suspense in our minds, undoubtedly one of the principal goals of the director. Well, he kept me on the edge of my chair, even made me talk to the actors to be careful here, and not be so naive there. You know, the kind of thing you want to beat your kids to do in the movies.
