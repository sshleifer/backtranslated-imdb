"Out to Sea" is a fun movie starring this wonderful duo of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. This movie is not as funny as its comedies "Grumpy Old Men" (which resembles a lot), but there are lots of laughs everywhere. Lemmon and Matthau play some in-laws who take a cruise together. Once they get into the boat, the thing Lemmon does not know is that Matthau hired them as dance presenters so they do not have to pay for the cruise. This infuriates Lemmon who does not feel like dancing. What's worse, Matthau does not even know how to dance. However, they go along with the process and they meet some of their fellow travelers and crew members. Here are the crew members: there's cruise director Gil Godwyn, played by the fist by veteran Brent Spiner of "Star Trek: The Next Generation," who acts like an evil dictator. There are two dance presenters, starring "Barney Miller" star Hal Linden, and veteran musical actor Donald O'Connor. There is the owner of the ship, Mme. Carruthers, played by "Golden Girl" Rue McClanahan. As for the passengers: there is Vivian, a widow played by Gloria De Haven, who falls in love with Lemmon. There is Liz, played by one of my favorite actresses of all time, Dyan Cannon, who falls in love with Matthau. There's Mavis, Liz's mother, played by veteran actress Elaine Stritch. And they find others too. All these actors are a pleasure to watch while Lemmon and Matthau have fun with them. It's great to see Cannon here, it's beautiful as always; Stritch is a joke; Spiner is a funny comic villain who plays him as a serious mortal; De Haven is wonderful; Linden, O'Connor and McClanahan have a good time or two; and finally, the two main stars, Lemmon and Matthau, are well as usual. A beautiful little gem of comedy. <br /> <br /> *** (of four)
