I was so happy to know that Hari Om will finally be released in 2007. I saw this movie three years ago at the Vancouver International Film Festival and have been waiting for it to be released since then so I could send everyone I know to see it. It's like making a trip to India ... colorful, magical, thought-provoking. In addition to a rather strange Hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic. This is not Bollywood-style music and a dance movie, but it has drama, romance and humor. The interactions between the Indian taxi driver and the French tourist are a good reflection on the fundamental differences between Eastern and Western lifestyles and philosophy. The characters are a little broadly drawn, but the acting was very good. Visually, this movie is a treat because you really have a sense of what driving through Rajasthan is like a dream. Sometimes it's hard to believe that everything you're seeing and experiencing is real ... the movie has the same quality. Great soundtrack too!
