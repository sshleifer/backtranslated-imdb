A man's show by John Leguizamo is funnier and more engaging than most of the movies you'll see. Several devices, such as slide projectors, are used to hone the story, but this is essentially a good old-fashioned performance art. In particular, check out his hilarious rendition of "I Will Survive." *Highly recommended.
