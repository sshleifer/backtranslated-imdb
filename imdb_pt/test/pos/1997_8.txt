I watched the movie several times. And what I want to say about it is that the only thing that made this movie top-notch was the incredible performance of Burak Altay, absolutely nothing else. Not even this silly model named Deniz Akkaya and some of these popular names sometimes in the movie ... Burak is definitely very talented, I saw some work he did and passed. Even though this is a type of horror movie, it is doing a great job in comedy movies and also in dramas as well. I bet most of you saw Asmali Konak, the movie and the TV series, the two would give an example ... All I'm going to say is that it's best to be careful about new jobs coming out of Burak, so you'll see. Keep up the good work bro, lots of love ..
