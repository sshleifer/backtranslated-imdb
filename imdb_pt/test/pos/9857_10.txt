One must be careful about who is talking about watching 12-hour movies. It may be easy for people to assume that this is some sort of regular occurrence - indeed, even in the world of 'artruso cinema', these gigantic times are extremely rare for obvious reasons. That's one thing that Hollywood and art cinema have in common: the generally accepted runtime of 90-120 minutes, with a minority of films that dare to approach but rarely exceed, the three-hour mark. <br /> <br /> For this reason, a film like Out 1 (length: 729 minutes) is a challenge even for the most hardened moviegoer, and explains in some ways why it has only been shown on several occasions and remains extremely difficult. Originally conceived as a TV series by the director of Nouvelle Vague, Jacques Rivette, he sparked little interest from French networks and eventually received a brief theatrical presentation (Peter Watkins was forced to do the same with his brilliant pseudo-documentary nuclear war The War Game, although it has more to do with state censorship than with runtime). Shown a few times in 1971, Out 1 has resurfaced in a series of Rivette retrospectives over the past two decades, and many who saw it, including respected American critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, hailed him as one of the greatest films of all time. <br /> <br /> Is it? Well, yes, if you like Rivette. That alone is a big 'if', since Jacques Rivette has never been a commercially successful director. Only two of his films were hits (Celine and Julie Go Boating (1974) and La Belle Noiseuse (1991), both excellent), and many are still hard to find on DVD today (Oct 1 was only available on the internet after a rare video was uploaded). However, he is well respected within the film community, and with good reasons - his funny and surreal narratives, sense of rhythm and use of improvisation set him apart as one of cinema's most exclusive and satisfying filmmakers. Out 1 deals with a theme that is repeated throughout Rivette's work: the nature of acting, particularly in the context of theater and improvisation. His fascination with acting makes Rivette films a much more collaborative process than many of his contemporaries, since aspects of improvisation allow actors to play a much more active role in determining how the film joins. Oct 1 is divided into four major narratives, gradually intertwining and obscuring as the film unfolds: two consisting of actors trumps, each trying to invent postmodern theatrical adaptations of Aeschylus plays; the other two small individual thieves (played by the icons of Nouvelle Vague, Jean-Pierre Léaud and Juliet Berto), seeking eccentric methods of making money; and a comprehensive plot involving a mysterious Balzac-inspired conspiracy centered around an organization known as 'the thirteen'. <br /> <br /> As with any Rivette movie featuring a 'conspiracy' narrative, the secret mysteries and organizations are little more than a red herring. As the characters are slowly explored and revealed and their interpersonal plans and connections are broken, the film becomes more and more symbolic of post-1968 boredom and the decline of the ideals of that era. For a film made in 1971, these were remarkably prescient themes; another French director at Jean Eustache would approach this subject equally satisfactorily in his 1973 masterpiece, The Mother and the Whore. But this is not the scope limit of Out 1. <br /> <br /> Composed of eight episodes of about 90 minutes each (the beginning of each episode has a brief and abstract black-and-white assembly of events of the previous chapter), Out 1 is no less watchable than any quality TV series, and may even be best experienced on a one episode basis at a time. This is not to say that it does not remain challenging, even when seen in segments. Like most Rivette films, he uses the first few hours to simply establish the characters before embarking on the plot, and some of those early scenes (particularly the sequences that depict the 'exercises' heavily abstracted from the actors) seem endlessly long. These scenes are important, however, not only as an exploration of improvised acting methods that play both a literal and a metaphorical role in the film, but as a method of adjusting the viewer to the somewhat languid rhythm of the film. Paradoxically, long takes make long films much more tolerable for an audience, and this understanding of rhythm led Rivette, along with more modern directors like Michael Haneke and Béla Tarr, to create films with less commercial viewing times than in the However, they retain the ability to delight viewers. <br /> <br /> In a movie that is, in many ways, about acting, acting is fantastic. Many famous faces of the Nouvelle Vague appear, including the aforementioned Léaud and Berto, the notable Bulle Ogier of Michel Lonsdale and Rivette. Even another legendary director of Eric Rohmer has a great turnout as Balzac's teacher, who appears in a crucial scene. The people and architecture of Paris c. 1971, however, seems to play an equally significant role - the city's landscapes, crowded scenes and interested spectators freeze Out 1 in time, a document from a place at a point in history. <br /> <br /> After a little over 720 minutes, the film ends on an impossibly brief and enigmatic note; however, the exhausting journey that the spectator has accomplished is so full of possibilities, complexity and spontaneity that one would be forgiven for wanting to start all over again from the beginning or to see the next twelve hours in the lives of these characters. For those who have watched many types of movies and think they have seen all that the art form has to offer, Out 1 is a reminder that the cinema has the potential to be so much more and diverge in many directions more than the conventions current allow. For filmmakers, film critics and artists of all disciplines, this is something to be valued.
