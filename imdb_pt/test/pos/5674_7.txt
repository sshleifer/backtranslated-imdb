"Black Water" is a film that somehow surprised me and definitely exceeded my original expectations. "Black Water" is really a very well structured, unpredictable, thrilling, well directed and very scary film. The plot is actually a bit original, and definitely will keep you intrigued by it. One thing I love about this movie is the direction, mostly because it surpassed my original expectations. My original expectation of "Black Water" was that it was a made, directed, rhythm and boring film. It really was not. Well, acting is nothing to compliment because there have been times when I felt that they did not show enough emotions, and there are some lines that seem so scripted. However, I love the direction because all his takes seem predictable, but they are not. Like when we watch, the camera takes a slow picture of the water, and okay, you're like the crocodile was about to attack. However, croc's attacks are very unpredictable (which was bad for me, which does not deal much with movies like this), and that makes you jump. Also, I love it being one of those horror movies that do not count on the big sudden sound to make you jump, but the actual movie. I also like how the story is about people who are stuck in these trees, this made it seem very real, and definitely kept their eyes on the screen. I must say I did not think the 20 minute opening was well done, and I think they made the boat a bit heavier than it would have been in real life. Also, I did not like how they tried their best to make the situation of the characters look totally hopeless when it really was not. Also again I did not think some of the actions of the characters were realistic. For example, I would not have gone anywhere near the water knowing it was a crocodile, let alone a killer. However, these problems really are not that important, and I was still able to enjoy the movie. Overall, when it comes to movies, I've seen better, but as far as horror-thriller animals are concerned (a genre in which I easily get scars) is one of the best you'll see. And it sure is not perfect, but that does not mean it's not worth a shot.
