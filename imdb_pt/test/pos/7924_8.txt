This film has to be seen for the song, which is actually a wonderful cantata composed by Sergei Prokofiev. Obviously, the original soundtrack is not exactly hi-fi, but there are many excellent versions available in the classical music selections. The cantata can be enjoyed by itself, but having watched the film helps. <br /> <br /> History itself is a rather standardized anti-German propaganda of Soviet warfare. A fun anecdote is that Stalin was so eager to gain time to appease Hitler at the outset of World War II that Eisenstein was seconded to a German film for a short period, such as penance. Prince Alexander Nevsky (venerated as a saint by the Russian Orthodox), having earned his nickname by defeating Swedish invaders on the Neva River, gathers Russian resistance against the invasion of the Teutonic knights and concludes his victory with a stern warning to other possible invaders. <br /> <br /> An interesting scene: Alexander sees a convoy of Russians being taken as slaves by the Mongol soldiers, and does nothing to prevent this, since the Teutonic knights are his priority. The historical Alexander Nevsky paid tribute to the Mongol khans, like his father before him, while working to consolidate the future independence of his kingdom.
