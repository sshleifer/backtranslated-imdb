Some movies simply disappear, but Tourist Trap has stood the test of time and has justifiably become a cult favorite. Although not completely original - it owes a lot to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, he keeps up with a sense of humor, genuine scary moments, a brilliant soundtrack to Pino Donaggio and the entertaining performances of Chuck Connors and the cast. Do not let the PG rating keep you away, this movie proves that free nudity and nudity are not necessary in all horror movies to make it fun. These elements are usually used to cover the lack of emotions in a movie. Here, the scares are well-deserved and effective. Also, only Chuck Connors could take a scene in which he has to share the soup with a mannequin! A classic scene, in fact. Now more affordable on widescreen DVDs, this movie is a must for horror fans of the '70s.
