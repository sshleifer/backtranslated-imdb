On the advice of a friend, I got this movie. I really like computers in general - so a 1995 Internet identity theft movie could not be left unseen. I had some negative echoes about it, but in the end, I was not so disappointed: the story, although classic, is kind of interesting and must have been very new on the days when it was released in theaters. I was surprised when I discovered that, contrary to what we have seen, computer-implemented actions are somewhat realistic, since they use Windows 3.x and normal computers. The narrative is medium and does not bother the viewer. The ending is typically American. The performance of the actors is overall OK, Sandra Bullock usually irritates me with the way she behaves "oh my god, why me", but this time she seems to have controlled herself. I recommend this movie.
