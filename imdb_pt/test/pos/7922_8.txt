(Attention: spoilers! - although it is difficult to spoil this movie by telling details of the story.) <br /> <br /> Eisenstein's black and white propaganda film is not for everyone. It is very old and it is awkward. What's great for me is the soundtrack, not the original, but the updated soundtrack. Better yet, the orchestral version that Prokofiev created (my favorite performance is by Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony). <br /> <br /> The movie is really funny in some places. It is reminiscent of the old "Midsummer Night's Dream". Some of the outdoor scenes are quite magnificent. Some of the actors are also quite magnificent. (The actor who played Nevsky could have been a superstar today.) Idem for the warrior girl, Vasilisa - definitely a rocker.) <br /> <br /> This may be the best collection in the world of incisive Russian proverbs (there are many of them - they make up most of the lines). <br /> <br /> The battle scenes actually look much more realistic than the high-budget Hollywood flix. These guys are as clumsy with their fight as the real peasantry would be. The guns seem unpleasant, so the actors were probably trying to avoid hurting each other. The actor who plays the German "grand marshall" is actually trying to look scary at the beginning of the movie, but he looks like he was really a kitten. Once he is captured, he looks so pathetic. (Speaks volumes about the target audience, of?) <br /> <br /> A really funny touch is that the German army brings an * organ * with it, played by a character in a black cloak. Watch the Russians knock this guy out * while he's playing. <br /> <br /> After the battle is over and almost all Germans are dead comes the best part of the film (and music), the song sung to the dead soldiers who died defending the homeland. This part is so sad that it's almost an anti-war statement. <br /> <br /> Ten times more men than women rated this movie. For what reason? <br /> <br /> Attention: Joseph Stalin liked this movie. Ironic - he killed more Russians than anyone. "Those who come to Russia carrying a sword will die by the sword."
