After seeing Big Fat Liar, I think Jason learned a lot more. When he told the truth about Marty stealing his story, it was like the boy who wept wolf. People heard him but did not believe him. Nobody did anything to help him. Besides, not only are Marty's movies stinky, but his advice as well. The truth is not overrated. I'm so glad he was exposed for what he really is. Everyone discovered that he stole from that boy, including his parents. Not only did he steal from that kid and lie about it, he gave them the work of someone else and tried to call his own, which is plagiarism. Does not he know it's illegal to plagiarize someone's idea? Another reason he was fired. He is not reliable. He is a liar, a cheater, a thief, a cheater, and a plagiarist. Do you have this Marty? You are a plagiarist. Plus you have everything you deserve.
