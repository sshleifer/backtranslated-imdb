I saw this show when I was younger. It's a great show to watch. It is very educational for children from 1 to 8 years old. Barney is definitely super-duper. B.J. is very funny. Babie Bop is very cute. The kids are really cool too. This show is about learning about numbers like Sesame Street, but different kind of show and characters like Barney, Purple Dinosaur, B.J. The Yellow Dinosaur with a baseball hat on his head, and Baby Bop the cute green dinosaur with a pink bow. The first one that started was a very old Barney and Friends show. But the second was different to be new episodes. Also the last one in year 2000 was the new scene of the park of Barney. They also have a Barney show at Universal Studios in Florida where you see Barney, B.J., and Baby Bop, and then when the show is done you get to go play, shop and meet Barney. It is a very good show to watch this show when you learn about many things you will like the movie, and the live show at Universal Studios Florida.
