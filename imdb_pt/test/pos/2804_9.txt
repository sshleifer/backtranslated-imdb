There are some things in life that we can not experience more than once and the university experience is one of them. Especially if we are living in a foreign country and in an apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier, the main character leaves his life tidy in Paris, his former hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study Spanish to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a French doctor and makes friends who make him look differently. When Wendy's brother (Wendy is one of the roommates) comes from England, the movie starts to get a lot more fun. Well, anyway, Xavier gets to see things differently with all his new friends and he probably lives something he will never forget and it will change his life forever. Overall, a very enjoyable nostalgic film, which becomes even more interesting because of the multinational cast. I found it very interesting that you could see all these children from different countries, all of them speaking different languages ​​and having different cultures doing well and fun. I gave it 9 out of 10 because I left the theater with a smile on my face and thinking of things I have not done while I'm still in college and I'd like to do it before it's too late.
