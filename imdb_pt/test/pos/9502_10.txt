Cecil B. DeMille directed a series of comedy dramas in late adolescence and early 20's. He found his perfect protagonist for these provocative plays in Gloria Swanson. In Do not Change Your Husband, Swanson plays a bored housewife whose rich husband and manager (Elliott Dexter) pays more attention to work than to her. She is chased by a beautiful roe (Lew Cody) until she gives in and divorces her boring husband to the new lover. <br /> <br /> Things soon become familiar and Swanson discovers that the new husband is as careless as the first. To make matters worse, she discovers that Cody has a woman next door (Julia Faye). After several clashes and convenient meetings, things are settled. <br /> <br /> This was a huge success in 1919 and helped make Gloria Swanson a big star. Although she was only 20 when filming this, she is very good as the wife may be silly. She looks great and wears some gorgeous dresses. <br /> <br /> There is a memorable scene that is 100% DeMille in which Cody is attracting Swanson with promises of wealth, pleasure and love. As he coos to her, she imagines the scenes. Pleasure is a fantastic Swanson scene in a spider net swinging over a swimming pool while people dance around. Wealth is a scene in which Swanson is dressed as a queen of Babylon, while the servants bring their jewelry box, which is thrown aside. Love is a scene in which she is a wooden nymph making love in a forest clearing with a Pan character (Ted Shawn). Pure Hokum, but very fun, and Swanson looks great. Dexter is very good as the mild husband who shaves his mustache and starts working to win his wife back. Cody is also good as the lovely fake who is a liar and cheater. Faye is funny as the other malicious woman - called Toodles no less - who gets hers. Sylvia Ashton plays Mrs. Huckney. Ted Shawn was married to Ruth St. Denis and together they were innovative and influential modern dancers (Denishawn School). <br /> <br /> Swanson impresses me the most every time I see her. She seems to have been such a natural actress and yet there is a way for the camera to capture her expressive face that is simply hypnotizing. She is a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Very fun movie with lots of shades of color in various scenes to keep things lively. And many of the furniture is back in style 86 years later.
