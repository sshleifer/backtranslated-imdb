In 2023, in a world governed by the economic interests of large corporations (not by will or politicians), Kam (Bobbie Phillips) is a hybrid human and agent of the IBI (International Bureau of Investigation). It is called sub (subhuman), and its genetic makeup is 80% human and 20% animal. It has a combination of puma genes, which gives it strength and flexibility; hawk, which gives you an increased ability to see and hear; and chameleon, which gives him the power of camouflage. In the first film, she was a very seductive and amoral woman, using sex for information. I have not watched the second yet, but in this third, the story is full of action. A group of scientists has been developing a new and dangerous form of power generation for fifteen years. The search has not yet been completed, when one of them betrayed the other and stole the search. The problem is that due to its molecular instability, a black hole will be created and will suck the entire planet. Kam saves Dr. Tess Adkins (Teal Redmann), the survival of the team of scientists, and tries to recover the dangerous invention from the hands of the "bad guys". There is a very strong 'sub' in this gang that causes many difficulties for Kam. This action and science-fiction movie is better than the first, remembering 'The Terminator' in some parts of the storyline. Bobbie Phillips is a very beautiful actress, and her outfit is really cool. I'm becoming a fan of this good entertainment. Fans of science fiction movies will not be disappointed. Now I'm trying to buy 'Chameleon 2'. My vote is seven.
