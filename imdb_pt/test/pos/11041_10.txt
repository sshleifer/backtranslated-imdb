He saw this great classic film by Greta Garbo and thought that his performance was excellent. However, the German film version that had English subtitles was its highest performance. Greta Garbo even mentioned to the press that the German film was her favorite, where she had to make the change from Silent movies to sound. Greta had a shrill voice and had to take lessons to lessen her voice for her future roles in movies. This story was very sad because Greta Garbo (Anna Christie), "Ninotchka", 39, was abused on a farm by young boys and her father left her years ago as a sailor and then as captain of a coal barge. There were many scenes of Old NYC, Brooklyn Bridge, Coney Island and the skyline of Manhattan. Charles Bickford (Matt Burke), "Days of Wine & Roses", a veteran classic actor gave a great supporting role.
