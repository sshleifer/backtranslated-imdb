This movie is wonderful! I can watch again and again. Robin Hood is perfectly shaped, and Marian is beautiful. I personally think Marian's German man is the funniest character along with Latrine and the sheriff! While the space balls have become boring and stupid after a while, this one always holds your interest! This was a great movie, and it never gets boring. A great cast is in the papers, and it's fake perfectly, and makes a lot of sense, and can be seen again and again! You'll love this movie if you only watch, except if you hate comedy, or do not think Robin Hood should be tampered with. But this old story gets boring, and this movie gives a great new flavor!
