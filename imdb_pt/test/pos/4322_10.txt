This episode so far is the best of the series. The story was told perfectly. I especially liked how the writers made it an episode of Desmond; was his best performance so far and he definitely deserved the Emmy for his performance. <br /> <br /> We've had some of our questions answered in this episode, but since the show is called Lost, we know there will be more questions. brought too. First, the answer: Walt finally reunites with his father Michael, second, Michael's betrayal is exposed to Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurly and because of this betrayal, Kate, Jack and Sawyer are all captured by the Others. This was a great way to end the show. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the island we see Locke going through a mental collapse with the button. This leads to another question answered about how the plane actually crashed. However, there are some unanswered questions: First, what happened to Locke, Eko, and Desmond when Desmond turned the security key and what was the agreement with the scientists in the Arctic in search of electromagnetic anamolies. I think we'll find out next season, however great end to the best show on TV.
