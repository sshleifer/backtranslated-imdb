I have just revisited this madness lovingly remembered from my early days, and I must ask you to beg to steal or borrow. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a duel between a Shaolin priest and our villain. Abbot White, needless to say, Abbot White kicks Buddhist ass, and disburses his campaign against unimpeded Shaolin with the help of his new allied ninja (a gold wrestling with a gold ring, a black dress that fights with a spear, and my favorite, the one who struggles with a pair of knives that may disappear and reappear like a flying carpet). The rest of the story concerns the training of Shaolin monks disciples killed by Abbot White, one of whom is Alexander Lo King. While we are treated with punishment training sequences the two young avengers must move on to learn the Shaolin Finger Jab technique required to defeat Abbot White's invincible armor technique, we see some of the ways our villain keeps in shape ... mostly using Taoist magic to extract the blood of naked women. We all know how this will end, but it's the psychedelic journey between which we're here. In conclusion, this is a good example of what Taiwan was doing when Hong Kong was getting sick of martial arts films, and this is making martial arts movies increasingly scandalous. This movie is very well choreographed, has some nudity, some gore balls and enough for the gimickry wall to keep even the most tired spectator entertained.
