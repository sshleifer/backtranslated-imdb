I am amazed and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who failed to point the Black Snake Moan. These are not black-and-white relationships or old / young relationships, though I think that director Craig Brewer deliberately played both elements to adjust imaginary taboos. It's not sexual abuse or sex addiction, although Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies them. It is not a popular religion in the black community, although religion plays an important role. It's not a love story, although there are not one, but two happy couples in the end. And it certainly is not about the south, where "everything is warmer", although it is situated in the south and is undeniably warm; holy smokes, even the tag-line writers did not understand the point. <br /> <br /> Black Snake Moan is a parable about Mississippi Delta Blues; who feels them, who writes them, who interprets them, what they are doing, how he heals them. It's as if the producers of the film would sit on a blank slate and ask, "Okay, if we were to help people understand what the Blues really are, how would they look?" place in the rural south. So they dream of two characters, one whose wife left him to live with his best friend, the other who goes to war and his battered girl sleeps with everyone in town. So we play in the worldly grayness touched only a little by popular religion (they know that Jesus wants their lives, and although they respect Him, they know they can not give Him that), some violence between men and women, and many and many. of smoking, including - ready to go over the top? - a black man wearing a sleeveless T-shirt, holding a half-naked white girl caught at the end of a 40-pound chain. Fill it with authentic delta blues sounds, do it with a genuine blues selector, use the music as a primary healing element in the plot, beat up clips of blues man Son House on both ends and Voila - you have one modern parable about what blues are all about. Even the climax of the movie is not conflict of characters, but the whole city dances steaming dances to hot and daring blues. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a dilemma here. Rae (Ricci) is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust, and is being healed by Lazarus (Jackson's) home religion and firmness (and do not forget the chain.) But then, we are shown the restored Rae dancing roughly to the blues at the end . Is this an expression of a restored and healthy life force, or just more of the same useless behavior that ruined it in the first place? Brewer wants both, but the blues is really about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I suppose he would say that the blues gives healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without triggering either. I have my doubts. <br /> <br /> Not for the first time, Samuel L Jackson plays so well that we forget that we are watching Samuel L Jackson; the man is unbelievably good. He even chooses some of his own songs in the film, and his playing style is authentic, dirty and hot. Christina Ricci is not that good either. Granted, half of her work is done by the costume that was not there and her slinky figure, but she is a wonderful combination of cynical desire, rebellion and vulnerability; angry at her, she arrived. I was impressed by country preacher John Cothran Jr. I had to check the database to make sure he is a professional actor and not a genuine minister in the country. <br /> <br /> Parents need to be aware of what they are getting if their children bring it home. The language is far from the cards, the first half hour is full of explicit sex, and women are raped in a dozen ways throughout the film (Lazarus means well and is it decent, but honestly, to chain a woman to the radiator?) In addition, Ricci spends half of the movie dressed for sex; if you have teenage boys, they'll be licking the screen halfway through the movie. I would not recommend this to children of any age. Only adults, please. <br /> <br /> That said, Black Snake Moan is informative and accurate about blues, popular religion and sexual abuse, and tells a story that is redemptive in many ways. It's not orthodox, but it's worth it. And, my God, it's the hot soundtrack.
