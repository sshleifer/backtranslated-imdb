A bunch of mostly ugly and grossly ugly teens flock to an ancient, scary, remote, decadent funeral home located near a graveyard to attend a Halloween party being hosted by eccentric eccentric occult obsessed Mimi Kinkade. hungry friend of bimbette Linnea Quigley. The manly, profane, beer-drinker and happy with sex can not hold a session as a joke (a very bad idea, because of course it is said that the desolate and ancient dive is haunted by demonic spirits). Of course, that ill-advised session awakens those decidedly grumpy and hostile evil spirits who kill and possess most of the boys, turning them into ugly ugly killers with fangs, claws and wounds that cause the terrible destruction of all time . duration of an especially long, dark and distressing night of sheer terror. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is essentially the energetic and relentless "Evil Dead", filled with closed images, there is no easy way out for a confined and claustrophobic environment, excessively excessive backlighting, an unceasingly accelerated synthesizer soundtrack , a total sense of nightmare gloomy and charged with terror and vibrant - his manic cinematography of caresses (the long-awaited hyperactive hand camera that induces haste, smooth and sinuous tracking photos, madly titled camera angles, even the camera in a cart making a gracefully sliding 180-degree eight figure). Fortunately, Kevin S. Tenney's sleek, stylish and assured steering keeps the extremely thin and derivative procedures running at high speed; In addition, Tenny gives the film a polished and attractive look and effectively creates a certain omelet-booga carnival funerary atmosphere that is eerily energetic and enthusiastically grotesque. <br /> <br /> However, the wonderfully bloody and imaginative make-up effects of Steve Johnson are: true star of the show. Bloodthirsty highlights include the disgusting and fat Hal Havins (who played an equally annoying and obese role in the immortal "Sorority Babes in Ball-A-Rama" at the same time) having his tongue ripped out, Quigley pushing a whole. A tube of lipstick on one of her breasts (yow!) And plucking eyes from a guy while she's making love to him (double wow!), A libidinous teenage couple being kicked out while doing exactly what you think of a coffin neck crackled while the guy had his arm cut off), Kinkade burning his hands and, in the most unpleasant scene of the movie, an evil old man had his throat cut from the inside out after eating a piece of apple with razor blades. The trashy'n'thrashy rock score also smokes. And then there's the incredibly wild, sexy, uninhibited demonic dance of Kinkade, a sizzling number accompanied by a flickering strobe light and amazing jump cuts that Kinkade choreographed herself. Okay, so that does not equate to anything more than a scrap movie but if you're in the mood for fun fun this cheesy crass and juvenile slag does the trick really well.
