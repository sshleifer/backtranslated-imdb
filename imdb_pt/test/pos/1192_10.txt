I will not say anything about music because this topic can be so deep that it can become a major separate criticism, so let's focus on the movie that is brilliant ... Undoubtedly, one of Forman's best works. <BR> The simple story about love, friendship, freedom and ideals ... oh yes, the ideals for which even pacifists are ready to go to war ... <br /> <br /> There is not a single fake word, only fake character, only false sense in history, because love, freedom and friendship is not something complicated for the characters in the movie. These things are not something that "everyone can see from a different angle." These are not things that need much reasoning to understand ... your love is simple, your friendship is simple, your ideals are as simple as the word "simple" "and that's why these characters are so deep. Berger, the leader of a hippie played by Treat Williams, is a guy who lives to live and that is the greatest happiness for him ... he has his butt - (as he sings in one of scenes of the film) and that is enough to make him happy with his property ... <br /> <br /> Berger never accepts that something can not be done ... and his certain ... If he wants to go for a feast of rich guys with his old dirty clothes and long, huge hair, he'll do it ... if he wants to go to another state to just see his friend, he'll do it ... he never thinks twice. .. he just does. <br /> <br /> How? Why is he so powerful? The answer is simple: because it is FREE. <br /> <br /> Just watch how the wind does the hairwave in this movie and you will understand everything, maybe even free yourself too.
