I'm afraid I have to add my name to the long list of people who remain open-mouthed that this movie has not yet been released on DVD on DVD. It is one of those mysteries that makes the mind perplexed, especially when you consider the amount of DVD currently available containing material that should have been discarded years ago. I still have an excellent digital VHS copy in English with subtitles and Nicam Stereo, so my scruple is more a principle than a frustration at not being able to see the movie. As for the film itself, this is an excellent multipurpose with good image quality, soundtrack more than satisfactory, lively plot involving suspense, emotion, sadness, frustration, feeling good and exotic environment (for a European). How true the film fits with reality in Burma I have no idea, in fact, that it is less important, the essential thing is that, in terms of entertainment, it is a success. A logo clings to each of the main characters and I admit to having my heart in my mouth during the final scene of the river. It's a shame we've heard so little about countries like Burma and this movie at least gives some insight into the country. Has the situation changed since 1995? The events that will take place at the end of this month seem to answer that question with a resounding "no" and the regime in force seems to be as brutal as ever, not even sparing the lives of monks, much less women or children!
