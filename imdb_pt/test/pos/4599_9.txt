Shame on Fox for dumping this movie. It was a total revolt and I just hope it finds a second life on DVD and cable. <br /> <br /> This is a hilarious satire. It takes the "And if" situation to an extreme and causes no punch (or groin kick). It makes you wonder ... what is it to become of this empire once we become totally lazy and stupid? Everyone is hit in this esp. a number of big corporations, and even Fox News gives a punch (that's probably why the movie never had a proper release - beyond the marketing department thinking about the campaign and not knowing how to market it, "then we'll give up!" ) Some may find the film exaggerated due to kick in the groin and farts, but the film is much more than that. You get what Mike Judge is saying or do not know. Most of the negative comments I read seem to come from people who just do not understand or are movie snobs. <br /> <br /> Probably it will play for a week in the selected markets, so if you get it wrong Keep an eye on the DVD, it will be worth the lease and eventually I'll have it in my collection. Good work Mike Judge, it's a shame you screwed up, but you made me laugh out loud and I'm looking forward to the next movie you make.
