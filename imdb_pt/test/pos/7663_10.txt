I can never understand why people are slow to review movies that they do not fully understand. I know people will read compelling comments on these pages of this film, and this will prevent them from looking for copies of this rather overlooked, late-'20s, but 1932, film that should probably be called "Indecent" as is the case. name in the main titles. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy, better known as a comic actress in many different roles, shows up poorly in all of them. She was a real dramatic actress, something I did not know before watching this movie, which predates all her famous roles. She's exciting and moving here, two things she's never been on the side of the graceful and refined William Powell. I'm still a little shocked at how good she was. <br /> <br /> Becky Sharp (1935), the first Technicolor of three tracks, is more familiar, but this is much better artistically and an adaptation. It's also very poignant as an expression of a movie style that was about to die. You can not believe my word, you should see it.
