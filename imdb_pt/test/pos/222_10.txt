The funniest show of all time on TV, although humor is not for everyone. I realized that it would have been difficult to keep the program updated if it had run longer, but it's a shame that only six episodes were filmed. The jokes fly fast from the opening credits to the end, when you would see Drebin and his boss, Ed Hocken, pretending to be freezing as the final credits rolled, during which the (still on the move) criminal would see all the other real estate and try to escape . In another episode, the building began to collapse while Drebin and Hocken remained frozen. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen was brilliant as Frank Drebin and the perfect fit for this show? how he managed to keep a straight face through some of these things is beyond me. As jokes and jokes are so frequent and quick, you can watch episodes for the 2nd and 3rd time and pick up things that you missed the first time. If you are like me, you can watch them over and over and still find yourself laughing. Even the jokes that made no sense, nor apparently had any reason for them, like the "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln" in the opening announcement, somehow worked? perhaps they were thrown there precisely for that reason. Cleverly cheating on old Quinn Martin detective and police shows of the '70s, the Police Squad would return from the commercial break with the words "Act Two" appearing on the screen, which was immediately followed by "Yankees One "or any other joke. In opening credits, the title of the episode would appear onscreen, but the announcer would give a completely different title. My favorite jokes and lines in this series are too numerous to list, but one of my favorites is when Drebin asks an unhappy boxer who has played fights, "Do you think you can beat the champion?" The boxer replies, "I can take you blindfolded!" To which Drebin replies, "But what if he is not blindfolded?" A minute later, referring to the boxer's dirty little apartment, Drebin tells him, "I'll help you get out of this sewer." The next thing you see, Drebin is popping up through a manhole cover on the street! In another episode, Drebin and Hocken are questioning the fragile alibi of a suspected bomber. Drebin, not believing him, says, "Okay, let's just say you went to the movies." After a short pause, Drebin, Hocken and the suspect look at the camera and in unison say: "You went to the movies." A few moments later, when Drebin is forced to let the suspect go free due to lack of evidence, he pulls away and screams in anger, "Tell that bomber to take off!" What is seen next is a police officer giving the sign of approval for a World War II style airplane on a lane outside the building! Although there were many classic quotations from Drebin, one particularly memorable one was, "Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Twice. We would have gone earlier, but your husband was not dead at the time." Another classic was: "I am a locksmith and I am a locksmith". When the father of a visibly shaken kidnap victim asks Drebin, "What do I do?" ??? Drebin, in a classic and impassive way, replies: "Well, as I understand it, you're in the textile business." Like I said, humor is not for everyone ?? many people simply do not "understand" this. During the brief presentation of the program, I remember the reaction being very mixed. Some people thought it was absolutely hysterical and one of the funniest things in the world, while others thought it was dumb and dull. For me, the Police Squad more than 20 years later is the funniest thing I've ever seen on TV. For younger viewers who like this kind of humor, but who have never seen the Police Squad because they were very young when the series aired, I highly recommend it. I found the six episodes even funnier than the subsequent "Naked Gun" movies.
