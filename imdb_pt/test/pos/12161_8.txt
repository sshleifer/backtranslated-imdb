Great Britain and France declared war on Germany in 1939, but by then almost all of Europe had fallen under the advance of the Nazi war machine. Entering the war, Britain practically started from scratch, with scarce supplies and an air force that was outnumbered by Germany from ten to one. But the will of the British was firm, encouraged by its new Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who declared, "We will never go down." <br /> <br /> On August 8, 1940, the Battle for England was under way. However, for the first time since Hitler's declared position to conquer the world, he hit a wall. Although numerically at a disadvantage, the British Royal Air Force went on the offensive, and within the space of twenty-eight days in September and October 1940, German Luftwaffe casualties rose to two thousand three hundred and seventy-five aircraft and lost crews. Hitler's anger was boiling, but he had to call a momentary time out. Responding at the end of the year, Hitler launched a massive bombing of London on Christmas Day 1940. When I say that there was never a catastrophe film that rivaled the actual live footage of burning London during this attack would be a euphemism. Perhaps the most surreal effect of this chapter in the "Why We Fight" series would be to see British citizens emerge from their underground shelters after the bombings to take back what was left of their life above ground. Even as you watch, there is no way to understand the living horror that these people must have passed, while the city of London was left in complete ruin. <br /> <br /> The Nazis were also stunned and frustrated as well. Everything Hitler wanted to believe about freedom and democracy was now turned to the head. Instead of being weak and complacent like the French, the British would not give up without a fight. And they fought, taking the aerial battle to Germany and responding in kind with attacks on the German homeland. It was a turning point, forcing Hitler to rethink his strategy.
