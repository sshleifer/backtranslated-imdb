A rich experience is gained by watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a seemingly simple story of a gifted student, Yiu Kwok, who later becomes a teacher of classical Chinese poetry. He is married and has two children, and things at home seem normal. He still loves his wife after twenty years of marriage, and his children fill him with pride (the eldest) and disappointment (the youngest). <br /> <br /> His passion for poetry makes him an object of love. passion for a senior student in one of his classes. The student, Choi Lam, takes pictures of him during class, significantly, one of him with a flower coming out of his mouth. It causes more with your intelligence than with your sexuality, although this is also an element. Of course he is not immune to her attention, although he tries for a while to keep the line of demarcation between teacher and student in place. <br /> <br /> The reason he did not succeed in the end is complicated. First, there is a real depth to the communication between him and Choi Lam. It becomes clear that she really likes him and is mutual. Secondly, there is a longstanding problem in your marriage that is brought to light when an old friend of both his and his wife becomes ill. The consequences of the wife's involvement with this friend, past and present, are almost too sad to bear. <br /> <br /> Nothing is treated trivially in this film. All characters have a vivid inner life and an easily discernible story. The two leaderships, Jacky Cheung and Anita Mui, are excellent as are Karena Lam as student Choi Lam and Shaun Tam as the eldest son On Yin. Recommended without reservation.
