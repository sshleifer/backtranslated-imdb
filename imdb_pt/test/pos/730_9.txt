Nemesis Game is an amazing movie full of puzzles, death, mystery and philosophy. In its simplest sense, the film tries to find answers and what happens when you finally find them. The search for answers leads Sarah Novak down a path that gets darker as she becomes more attractive. The final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth, but Sarah is so close to understanding everything. What would you do if you were offered the ability to finally understand the chaos of life? <br /> <br /> The film was written and directed by Jesse Warn. Although this was Warn's first feature film, the film does not reflect this, but shows Polish and an artistic approach to telling the story. Carly Pope was powerful in the lead role and showed a depth of complexity that was fascinating to watch. I would definitely love to see more of your work. <br /> <br /> Being based on puzzles, this is a very cerebral movie. It's your thing, as it is mine, so I totally recommend seeing the Nemesis Game. Rating: 4.5 / 5
