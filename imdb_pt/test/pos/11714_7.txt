"Sharky's Machine" is clearly a Burt Reynolds vehicle designed to allow the star's room to showcase his talents and he paints the machine, the movie plot, with colors of other films and other styles, offering a variety of mood within a history of nutrition. Made in 1981, at 119 minutes (long for the time period), the film went well, with box office receipts at $ 37,800,000. It had a lot to do: actor and director of Burt Reynolds, a solid one-two punch; an adaptation of William Diel's novel, and the southern land of Atlanta Georgia, at this time a land of opportunities for Hollywood film production. Tom Sharky of Reynolds falls in love with Dominoe, Rachel Ward, the prostitute-with-heart-of-gold is echoed here as it was in "Hustle" when he played alongside Catherine Deneuve, and this movie also had a corrupt politician at its core, but with pessimistic finality not the happiness of Hollywood in "Sharky Machine". <br /> <br /> The story is pure Detective procedure / actioner. Sharky, a narcotics detective, mismanages a drug dealer, causing the death of some innocent bystanders, and is lowered, literally transferred underground, to deal with perverts and other misdeeds that "compliant" police consider latrine duty. His new digs give him the chance to meet many standing officers who are doing the dirty work no one else wants. When some attention is drawn to a certain pimp, Sharky examines some evidence and discovers that a particular prostitute, Dominoe (Rachel Ward) - Dominoe is being protected by police forces and political forces, and Sharky assembles a 24-hour surveillance force to watch over her . . During the time he watches, he discovers that the current governor-elect Hotchkins (Earl Holliman) is visiting Dominoe, as well as an Italian heartthrob Victor (Vittorio Gassman). Before police can build a case with evidence, Billy, Victor's brother, a cocaine shooter (Henry Silva) shoots through the door of Dominoe's apartment apparently killing the beautiful Dominoe, but when Sharky learns that the murdered victim was in the Truly a roommate Tiffany (Aarika Wells) Sharky confronts Victor and tells him that he will arrest him. Sharky is captured by some Ninja killers led by Smiley (Darryl Hickman) and is tortured by information to lead to Dominoe, but Sharky dominates them and arrests the governor and in a heated chase kills Billy after he has killed Victor. Reynolds wants to show the inner workings of a rooted rogue cop who falls in love, but the story-telling storyline tempered with the noir element and Reynolds' ability in film development tends to improve the dynamics of relationships. <br /> <br /> We have come to learn something about some of the men and this leads us to reason why they are working for their pensions instead of fighting real crimes - this element of the film seems incomplete under the improvised direction of Reynolds. performance. <br /> <br /> There is always uniqueness in a Reynolds movie. He likes to hire stars, character actors or others and then allow them to improvise, sometimes with varying results. <br /> <br /> With his team in "Sharky's Machine" he gets some good times, and sometimes exaggerated ostentation but always a feeling of togetherness and good nature. With Reynolds as auteur, it works. <br /> <br /> Reynolds, the actor / author always seems to be smiling to himself and the viewer as if to say that it's all false, but fun. <br /> <br /> Great phrase: In the scene with Victor when Sharky plays the challenge "You're walking everywhere with people like you, and you want to know the worst part? You're out of state." This seems to be the biggest insult the cop can throw at a criminal. <br /> <br /> Reynolds made the film in Atlanta at his career point having killed himself by reading the phone book and would certainly have targeted and demographic. /> <br /> The film marked the appearance of Rachel Ward, who was named New Star of the Year in 1981 for the Golden Globe. <br /> <br /> Reynolds has always had presence and star power and has chosen to make movies close to home, Georgia. <br /> <br /> I bought my DVD from half.com for $ 7.99 and unfortunately it does not contain any comment or feature, which is a shame. Maybe the next generation will have them. <br /> <br /> The film is still a lot of fun and both Reynolds and Ward are great-looking actors in their heyday.
