If there is a good thriller, this is one of them. James Stewart makes a stunning presentation as the American Dr. Ben McKenna who, with his wife and son, is in Africa on tour. They stumble into a murder scene, and Dr. McKenna's son is kidnapped hours later. <br /> <br /> Before you can say, "Fasten your seatbelts," Dr. McKenna finds out a lot about an assassination attempt and tries to stop it. However, other people know that it can be dangerous (dangerous for them) and try to get rid of it. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Hank, the son, is found alive and well. <br /> <br /> If you like suspense movies, this is the one to watch. <br /> <br /> My score: 8/10.
