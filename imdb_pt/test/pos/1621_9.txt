I recently started the movie and all I can say is a good movie. There are many famous monuments of Rome and historical sites. He is the same writer and director of The Da Vinci Code. Tom Hanks star along with Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer. The film begins with the space and time experiment in Sweden until one of the canisters is stolen by the most hated enemy of the church, the Illuminati. The plot is difficult to discuss without ruining anything. It's a race across Rome following the Illuminati trail to reach the secret meeting place of the Illuminati. While racing against time to find the path of the Illuminati. Mostly its a movie that is worth seeing the hell I watched it 3 times and I still like it so in the end go buy it. It's much better than the 2010 film. And the ending has an incredible turnaround.
