Just go see this movie. He plays in everything that is fantastic about rock and roll, the band comes with great songs (Classico, Pick of Destiny, Master Exploder etc). All this with the humor of Teancous D makes this the best movie of all time. <br /> <br /> The Cameos are great in the back, with Meat Loaf and Dio singing to JB. Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins are great, I really like the character of Tim Robbins. You also find out who Satan really is! The musical and musical references are hilarious and impressive. Play great songs from The Who, Dio and others just complete. I personally did not think the band could beat the incredible songs of D, but they did with songs like Classico and Master Exploder. Seriously awesome music. <br /> <br /> Just go see, it's a must for those who like rock!
