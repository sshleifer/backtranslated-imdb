Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) were hired by the British government to protect a Swiss scientist Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.). He has a bomb that the British want to win the war. Unfortunately, the evil Dr. Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) is working with the Nazis and will not hesitate to receive the doctor - and his invention. <br /> <br /> The shift from Sherlock Holmes to the 1940s seemed like a stupid idea, but it works for a reason - Basil Rathbone. Probably he's the BEST Sherlock Holmes ever put on screen. He interprets the character so well (and accurately) that no matter what time he is solving crimes. As for Nigel Bruce as Watson ... everyone has a problem with that. He plays Watson as an old idiot ... who is not the Watson of books. You really wonder why Holmes confronts you. Still, it grows in you (in a way). Then there's Atwill having a whale of a time playing Moriarty - the discussions and intelligence battle between him and Holmes are great! I've never liked Dennis Hoey as Inspector Lestrade - he's an idiot. It makes Watson look like a genius. And the Post Jr. is very good as Tobel (even though his accent keeps changing!) <br /> <br /> This film is elaborately done and only runs for over an hour. Still, he has his vague points and I never understood the secret code section. <br /> <br /> Still, it pays to be contacted by Rathbone and Atwill.
