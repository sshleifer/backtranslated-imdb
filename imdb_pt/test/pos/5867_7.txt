When I was very young, my mother had a series of four short Looney Tunes / Merrie Melodies on tape and I watched them all several times. A Coy Decoy was one of those shorts, and I was really shocked to read in another comment that had been banned. When I was young, I probably did not even understand the Black Beauty joke to begin with. Still, that's probably why it was banned, though until I saw it on a video site, I did not even remember the joke. Watching the video, I remembered certain pictures-in particular, the shrinkage of Daffy's hat and Daffy's eyes becoming watchmakers when the gimmick circulated in The Lake. I was not bothered with the gag which was probably the reason the gag was banned. Instead, I was awash with childhood memories of watching this short. Because of how much I enjoyed this short as a kid, I rate it 7 out of 10.
