The historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented. It was never meant to be a serious story, but a fun saga and there it happens. Errol Flynn was never better as this paper was tailor-made for him. Olivia DeHavilland has never been prettier. Arthur Kennedy never more villain. Anthony Quinn never nobler than Crazy Horse. He had lots of humor and excitement and kept all his interest. The only historical aspect I found most inaccurate was the "Last Stand" final, which occurred on the banks of the Little Big Horn. The film version was filmed in a desert with no river in sight. However, I still find wonderful entertainment typical of the Golden Age of Hollywood.
