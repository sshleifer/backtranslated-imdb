This movie is really a fun, good clean and fun movie for kids. Kaley (played by Nickelodeon's talented Amanda) is the partner of an undisciplined boy who has a hard time telling the truth. He eventually works this out on a movie script that is stolen. I will not bore you with the details. If you have kids and want to see a fun, if not thrilling movie for kids, I highly recommend this.
