I'm not sure why some people complain that this movie is not a comedy and at the same time it is very unrealistic. If it had been realistic, there certainly would not be much comedy. I also do not think a comedy needs to make you laugh out loud twenty times. There was a lot of subtle humor, sweet feelings, and Kim Frank just portrayed a dreamy character. In real life, there are many people whose facial expression does not change much, so Kim Frank kept his expression. The ending was quite unrealistic, I would say, but happy. It's a cheerful movie with a finale of well-being. I liked. Loved it, actually. A serious part was Krueger going to Schwedt, and I'm glad they did not show what happened to him there. Showing him how he was when he came back, he made it clear.
