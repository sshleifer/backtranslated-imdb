Craig Brewer is now officially a writer / director for whom I'm going to watch any movie, no matter how bad it may sound. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites of that year, with its emotion-filled plot and realistic and fallible characters. I was not sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this second work. The cast looked great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would turn out to be absurd and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks. The acting is astounding, the superb writing and editing style, as well as juxtaposed, fascinating music all the way. Brewer seems to be a master at getting his characters to have the right mix of compassion and malice as they go their way toward redemption. <br /> <br /> The first moment I knew I was about to receive treatment was during the sequence of abbreviated credits at the beginning. As it did with Hustle and Flow, Brewer puts the music on the widescreen outlets perfectly with simply titled sources popping up statically. The aesthetics of the 70's was welcome and helped to show that this would be another great piece of vain character of those of that decade of some of the best in the cinema. From here we continue with the little fragments in the lives of Lazarus and Rae, each vignette mirroring the other as they travel to the fateful moment that their paths finally cross. The editing between them was fluid and relevant, rather than cut abruptly before the scene ended with its purpose. Rae's boyfriend leaves for service and Laz's wife leaves him for her brother. Does each person feel the loneliness and revert to what they know in this situation? Rae for sex and Laz for the bottle. Just when Rae is left to die by the side of the road and her savior comes from her farm to take her, the reasoning for her actions finally begins to be clear. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic. like the old bluesman farmer trying to reconcile his life with God and the flesh and the pain he brought. There are moments of stoic severity as well as those of kindness with your captive / patient. You never look at setup as something comic or unreal because it sells what you are doing so well. In addition, Rae's character is not stuck for long, despite what the trailers want you to believe. The situation gets a bit embarrassing until we see that the thread was for its own sake and is actually used for just a day or two. As for that chained girl, Christina Ricci really shines. I've never really seen her as something special, but that role is a real breakthrough for her. This girl is so upset that the past sexual abuse marked her deep down. Every time she is away from his love, she begins to see flashes of the man who took his childhood innocence away and itches to be touched by any man available to let the picture go away. His nymphomania is not for pleasure, but for the survival of the haunting nightmares always hidden behind the eyelids. Ricci fully inhabits the role and shows all the emotional trauma with great effect and realism. Mention should also be made of Justin Timberlake, again showing some real acting talent. From where this guy came I have no idea, but I hope he keeps making more movies and getting away from most of the crap he produces. <br /> <br /> Although not as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow, Moan still fits equally into it, in my mind, because when it's turned on, it's spectacular. In the end, we have a truly charming sequence with "This Little Light of Mine" singing and, earlier, the interaction between captive and captor, when the chain is first introduced, shows a high-level job. The truly magical moment, however, is when Jackson sings (yes, it's all the time, like Terrence Howard in Hustle) the main song as a storm roars and the lights flicker. If I do not see a prettier sequence of photos all year, I will not be surprised. What these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of. One thing I really like about Brewer's work is that he does not show sinners becoming redeemed heroes. Instead, it shows us that no matter how bad you have been or how bad life has been, everyone can fight for redemption and be better people. We have no saints here, but fallible people looking to repair their ship. If the course remains true or falls into darkness, no one really knows, but at least they can say that they tried as hard as they could.
