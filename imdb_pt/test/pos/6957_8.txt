This is a great underrated film and Rip Torn, well known as he is, is a seriously underrated actor. I read Howard Frank Mosher's novel many years ago. How well Craven captures the book and the beauty of the Northeastern Kingdom of Vermont! I was fortunate to grow up in VT in the 1940s and 1950s and still lived there when the "Irasburg Incident" occurred. I did not see _Stranger in the Kingdom_, Craven / Mosher's collaboration based on the incident (and another Mosher novel), but this film inspired me to track him down.
