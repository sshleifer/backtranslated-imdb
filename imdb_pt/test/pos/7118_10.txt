I do not play video games, but my kids do. <br /> <br /> I had so much fun with it. I'd like to see more of this kind of movie. "very cool," as my younger son would say. <br /> <br /> Interesting characters and the general plot were interesting. Like I said, I do not play video games, but I think my kids liked that. It was not full of bad language and that is a nice change. This visual concept was different that caught my eye. Also, the soundtrack was very good. I can even try out some of the games my kids play to see because of this movie. Who knows, maybe I'm a gambler someday.
