Over the weekend I watched the movie Tipping the Velvet and if I had to score this movie at 100, I would have to give 100 without question. I am a true believer in true love and this movie moved me in many different ways and the actors fit into the parts without a doult. But I have to say the ending was not so good because I did not see that spark in Nancys eyes when she looked into Flo's eyes, while her eyes sparkled every time she looked at Kitty, Kitty just had to be in the room or in the thought of Nancy and Nancy would just shine with that spark. Kitty told Nancy that he could not find her and that she searched for her but could not find her. Kitty was ready to give it all up to bring Nancy back. In Kitty's eyes, you could see Kitty's pain. I believe Nancy should have let Kitty see that her love is true and strong and that she would not let it go so easy. You need to do a two part and have both together but you should not let anyone else play the roles that has to be the real Kitty & Nancy or it will never work. My mother once told me that true love is simply not real. I'm not silly I know we all have a true love somewhere just waiting for each of us and I believe with my life that Nancy's true love is just the true love of Kitty and Kitty is just Nancy. Come on let's play the game the right way, the only way. Let Nancy's eyes shine again ... Kitty lost everything, losing Nancy. And Kitty is not the only one to blame. I'm gay and being gay is not easy !! WAKE UP!!! in 1889, I did not want to be gay, Kitty was lost inside her and in 1889 maybe the right thing to do was marry a man. Even though you love a woman. Kitty needed Nancy to face her Nancy needed to fight for her. I remember how deeply I loved this girl and let her go because I thought I was doing something wrong and went back to my ex-boyfriend. I thought I was doing the right thing, but I know I was wrong to leave her and I will pay for the rest of my days, for, like Kitty, I have not found her anywhere. I hear she's married to a man in the US somewhere. I even heard he hit her. I think in the end we both lose. Give the two girls another chance that life can be very lonely if you are not faithful to you and your loved one. Thank you, Kristen Ann
