After seeing the trailer, it was an easy decision not to see this movie. I mean, I do not care for "idiot" idiot comedies. I'm sure it was also an easy choice for many people to join, smoke a bowl and take a look at that movie with The Simpsons guy and a guy called "Billy Bob." It should have been a good time, but the movie is not so funny - shame that someone had to be upset. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I discovered that the trailer was wrong after it was gone. the theaters, so I had to wait for the video. I really liked that. Pleasant venues, quality production and excellent performances from the entire cast. Looking back, the plot twists were not entirely unexpected, but I did not find it to be complicated because the premise was so engaging. So why was this absorbing drama marketed as a comedy? Did something happen to the producer, leaving the associated producers to do the marketing alone?
