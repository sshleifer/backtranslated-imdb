Ernst Lubitsch gave us wonderful films like Design for Living, Ninotchka, The Shop Around the Corner, To Be or Not to Be, and other wonderful films. But people often put Bluebeard's eighth wife as one of Lubitsch's weaker films. <br /> <br /> But I consider this movie as an important movie. This film began the collaboration of Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder. Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder and Walter Reisch wrote Ernst Lubitsch's screenplay for Ninotchka. Naturally, Lubitsch worked with writers in the scripting process. After that, Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder worked together. They together wrote the screenplay for famous movies like The Lost Weekend and Sunset Blvd. <br /> <br /> There are many funny moments in the movie. I thought "The Taming of the Shrew" was very funny. There is a famous expression called "Movies are slices of life". And here's a great example of Bluebeard's eighth wife (1938). <br /> <br /> In the first session of the scripting process, Lubitsch asked the following question: how does the boy and girl get together? Billy Wilder readily suggested that the opening scene should be the men's shop in a department store. "The boy is trying to buy pajamas," he reexposed. "But he only sleeps on the tops, he's thrifty, so he insists on buying only the tops." The clerk says he should buy the pants too.It looks like a catastrophe.Then the girl walks into the store and buys her pants because she just sleeps in the pants ". Ernst Lubitsch and Charles Brackett were delighted. It was not until months after they discovered that Billy Wilder himself is a lonely sleeper at the top and that he had been taking care of the idea for months waiting for a chance to use it. <br /> <br /> I got this information from a book. I think this film can be considered as the return of Ernst Lubitsch. Soon after this movie, he made wonderful films like Ninotchka, The Shop just around the corner, and to be or not to be. <br /> <br /> I thought Gary Cooper's performance was good. I think Lubitsch chose Gary Cooper probably because Gary Cooper played Long Fellow Deeds, who inherited the fortune of Mr. Deeds from Frank Capra in the city. But this is just my opinion. <br /> <br /> As for me, I really liked the movie. I rate this film 9 out of 10. Lubitsch's films are different because their films are slices of life.
