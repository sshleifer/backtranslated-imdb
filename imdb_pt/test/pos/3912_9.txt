This is the best horror movie this year. "House of Wax" is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. This version really embarrasses Vincent Price's version of the film. I only know some of the young cast of the movie. The always problematic Paris Hilton; the pain in the you know what seems to be more seductive than ever. At least she did not try to copy her infamy. Well, if she likes to make terror, she's better than Vanna White's "Wheel of Fortune." She beats Vanna HANDS DOWN! And the scene from where "House of Wax" was made was no joke. The house was made of wax, and the victims managed to get out of there before being waxed as their friends. These two twins, Bo and Vincent (the deformed twins) were maniacs from the beginning. The parents raised them well except for Vincent. And I think they've become equally deformed. How's that of the other pick-up is scary, but not as bad as the other two. This is another story in the book. I think he had to follow his heart, not the other twins who turned Ambrose into a tourist trap for innocent victims. This movie is like "The Phantom of the Opera" meets "The Rocky Horror Picture Show". And this movie is one of the scariest of 2005! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
