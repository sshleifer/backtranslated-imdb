"Black Water" is one of the most tense films I've seen in a long time. The story moves quickly as it follows three tourists (all great actors) in a swamp on a tour with a butch tour guide on a small boat. Soon after anchoring in a remote area of ​​the swamp, they are overturned by something huge in the water. <br /> <br /> In a hurry, the three can turn into a tall tree nearby when they realize that a crocodile has attacked them. Over the next two days, they have to desperately try to escape the watchful eye of the crocodile, and he does not seem to want to leave. The movie drags a little, but what can you expect from the scenario and limited budget? It is much better than "Primeval" and other recent crocodile / underwater predatory thrillers. The tension is heavy and all three tracks give great performances. Really creepy, this movie struck a deep claustrophobic fear in me. Apparently based on true events.
