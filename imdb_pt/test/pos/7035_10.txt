This timeless summer love story is a classic and will never be dated. I can not even count how many times I've seen Dirty Dancing. This is a movie that I could probably watch every few weeks and still love. <br /> <br /> There is something timeless about this movie. I loved other "blockbuster love story movies" like Pretty Woman and when Harry met Sally. I think they're up there, but there's something about Dirty Dancing that makes it absolutely perfect. The characters, the chemistry between Swaze and Gray, the direction of the movie, the AMAZING dance, the warm summer atmosphere, everything about dirty dancing is absolutely perfect. It's an instant classic and I've never seen a movie like this before or after. <br /> <br /> I do not think there is one element in particular that makes this movie so loved, but many things, a lot of which are mentioned by numerous reviewers. Dirty Dancing has a nostalgic, languid, summer mood, realistic characters, an honest and relatable message, incredible music and dance, and the best dance sequence the movie has ever given us. <br /> <br /> This movie is always on TV and I will continue watching while they show. But I will mention that I have no interest in seeing "Havanna Nights", which they should have left alone.
