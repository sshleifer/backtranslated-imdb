To see the fictionalized biography "The History of the City of Phenix," I say, is to enter fields where American filmmakers rarely ventured, director Phil Karlson received his work as a director on the TV series "The Untouchables" largely based in Kansas. "The Confidential City" and this film, and became one of the most admired and most imitated films of all time.The rarest feat for the North American filmmakers seems to be the film or anti-crime TV series focusing on heroism; to the viewer as the powerful producers of "Cain's Hundred," "Hardcastle and McCormick," and even "The Untouchables" had to work to produce anything but episodes devoted largely to the unofficial activities of criminals, not their This powerful, seminal, and very blatant film has its own style, and its lesson seems to be the attention to detail about opponents and victims of criminal organizations as well as their gang members.There is a prelude of twelve minutes to the film, in which reporter Clete Roberts interviews the actual participants from the city of Alabama who fought against their corrupt gangs of addiction.The problem arose from the presence of Fort Benning on the other side of the river and the existence of almost a century of vices in the area. The film details the return of John Patterson from Germany, where he has been a promoter. His father, defeated by the Alabama Attorney General, refuses to join his pursuit of the vicelords on 14th Street despite several taunts, including a beating of his son, avenged by Patterson on his tormentor. There are several well-developed characters, including Ellie, who works in one of the clubs and her honest boyfriend, union leader, Pattersons and John's wife, Ed Gage, the agents of the vicelords and Zeke Ward, an honest black man. victimized by their opposition to them. Harry Neumann's cinematography and art direction by Stanley Fleischer are on B / W and are very similar to news films, increasing the film's realistic power. Harry Sukman's music contributes to the film effectively. Writer Daniel Mainwaring and Crane Wilbur have produced a quick and direct story that is divided into parts. The first part illustrates the empire of the vicelords from within one of their clubs, showing the fate of a victim who is beaten and then taken by the police in payment of the Mafia. In Part Two, Albert Patterson refuses to oppose class leader Rhett Tanner. In the third part, the young Patterson returns and, after several incidents, including the need to beat the head of the Mafia to get revenge, he decides to command his father like State Attorney General. His wife is horrified; and the Mafia kills Zeke Ward's daughter and throws the body at Patterson's house with a warning that her children will be next. A few more of these incidents, including the loss of a trial in which the Patterson proved that the fool killed a friend of theirs who had found the car involved in the murder of the girl, and watch the investigation declare accidental death, persuade Patterson to run, and he wins the Democratic nomination statewide, despite statist mafia tactics - and is promptly murdered. John Patterson prevents a crowd of vigilantes from starting open warfare with the mob on 14th Street and uses their voices to call the capital and demand martial law for Phenix City. The clubs are closed and the equipment confiscated, but not before the girl inside is murdered by the mob mobster, and Patterson needs to be stopped by Zeke Ward from killing Tanner instead of handing him over to the law. The end of the drama is optimistic; but the prognosis for the city is less sanguine than painted; the crowd actually tried to get back, then moved to Tennessee. In this well-represented classic of anti-crime film production, Richard Kiley is young but very strong as Patterson, playing without an accent. John Mcintyre as his father is very good, while Edward Andrews as Boss Tanner is caliber prize. Others in the cast include Kathryn Grant as the girl inside, Ellie, Jean Carson and Kathy Marlowe as Mob Women, John Larch as his Henchman, Biff Mcguire as the Young Victim, James Edwards as Zeke Ward, Lenka Peterson as John's Wife, and some good character actors as citizens and mafia bosses. It's hard to say enough good things about the realism and lack of posture in this film; is certainly one of Phil Karlson's best directing efforts. Karlson also did "The Scarface Mob" later also "Walking Tall". A sober and inspiring look at the ease with which compliant citizens of a public-interest democracy can agree on tyranny and how some honest men can teach them the need to fight for their rights.
