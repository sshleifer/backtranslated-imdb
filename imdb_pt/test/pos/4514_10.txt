I just saw in a preview, I did not read the book, but I heard a lot of good things about it. <br /> <br /> The film was absolutely fantastic, very moving. With a roller coaster of emotions you connect totally with the characters. Shaun Toub was great, it was a complete departure from his usual roles, and his acting for those who understand Persian / Dari was incredible. <br /> <br /> It is one thing to note that Khaled Hosseini really loved the movie, which is unusual for book adaptation films. Even after seeing the movie several times "he was sobbing". <br /> <br /> Also the introduction animation was exquisite, with names displayed as if it were Persian calligraphy, very original! Sometimes the translation did not convey the message clearly, but on the whole it was a great movie.
