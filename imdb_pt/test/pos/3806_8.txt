This movie may be the best of all, if you like watching movies and laughing and then submitting your friends to watch these movies too. If you're like me, and probably are, you'll laugh for years at the jokes of this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus picks up money with a guy with kids and then the guy takes the kids to the woods, like Hansel and Gretel, so he and his wife go home with them. The soup kitchen scene is filled with comic genius of buffoonery: "Inspection officer - here!" and the following lines will stay in my mind forever, probably. When I show this movie to my friends, they usually say, "What was that?!?" so if you're up for one of those types of movies, yippee! This movie is so OOP is not funnier then probably the easiest way to get it would be online auction. The first time I saw it was a rental.
