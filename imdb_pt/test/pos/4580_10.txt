I stumbled on this movie by accident. I mean, how else could I find out? It was not sensationalised by the studios, I did not even hear about the release of my normally connected friends. After throwing my money at so many bad movies this year, I wish I had seen this movie in theaters as opposed to the DVD. Mike Judge is the master of disguising the deliciously clever humor in a package of low brows. Just watch "King of the Hill" for a while ... it's ostensibly hickory humor, but it's a very subtle scam on rednecks, being very friendly at the same time. I read the slogan of this movie and immediately I asked for it on the internet. I really do not understand where these negative reviews come from except maybe from Carl's Jr. This movie is not only hilarious, but it's also balanced. Moments of lightness are interspersed between hilarious jokes and scams in our current superstar / corporate culture. Of course, there is some fart humor, but it's just to laugh derisively. The premise is only semi-plausible, but since when does it matter? I do not see people scorning "Futurama" because the premise is very similar. Just watch this movie. If you do not laugh then something is really wrong with you. Maybe his father works for Gatorade or something, and he was really offended by the movie. Maybe you're an idiot. Probably the last.
