This movie was great. It had everything a true action fan could want. Many people being shot and / or mutilated, the least romance involving sex, a hero who can be identified, violence at many intervals rather than a meaningless plot storing only one scene at the end, and villains who are just asking for it. Bronson seems to be at his lowest level of tolerance in this movie and shows this. Ed Lauter makes a great cop and was perfectly worked on the Bronson plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie does not involve such a boring or excessive plot that you watch this movie once and never again. Instead, you want to see the Kersey in action and the plot just sums it all up. That's great.
