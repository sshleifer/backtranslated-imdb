I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue, despite the recommendations, dismissing the film as a clich√© theme of extreme emotional dramas and overreaction. From time to time, movies like 15 Park Avenue pass by and sweep you off your feet. <br /> <br /> The film grabs your attention very early and there is no time to rest after that. Aparna Sen did a wonderful job of casting the audience across the lines of the film. The development of impeccable character, the "just" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to combine with all this ... I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly interprets the schizophrenic Mithi. She surpasses expectation again after Page-3 and Mr. & Mrs.Iyer. The role of Prof. Anjali is very well developed and Shabana does complete justice to the character. Rahul Bose, Shefali Chaya and Waheeda Rehman add an incredible flavor to the film. <br /> <br /> I define "bathing moments" as thoughts of scenes from a movie that you meditate without stopping until your wife / girlfriend. Mom knocks on the door. 15PA offers many "bathing moments," especially the conversation between Anjali and her mother, where the mother is cautious in talking to Anjali about her thoughts. Immediately brings Anjali's personality to the public. <br /> <br /> The end is a very bold statement from the director; probably too Westernized for the Indian public; still delivers the elements to promote the film from a "good" status to a "great" one.
