This is one of the most notable horror movies I have ever seen in my life. Forget about the exorcist and all the other horror films out there. John Carpenter made a tour-de-force horror epic with excellent special effects performances by Kurt Russell and company and a great soundtrack that will haunt you forever! The biggest thing about this movie after 17 years is that it's not dated looks fresh and new and you do not get many movies like this. In 1982, this was against E.T. and of course it failed and it was a box office bomb. Over the years, THE THING has been a cult follower of video and video sales and many new fans. In the end, this movie kicks the butt and for me, as never the loss is the edge to scare the pants of you and me that a horror movie. Viva John Carpenter !!
