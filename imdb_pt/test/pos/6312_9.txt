This is a very visual movie. By this I mean that the dialogue is sparse, almost to the point of being a silent film for some very long takes, starting with the opening shot. <br /> <br /> Silences, however, are broken by an impressive sound. range ranging from discordant beats, staccato to an amazing blend of violins and interspersed with vocals that sound like dreams. It is a feast for the ears as well as for the eyes, one of the earliest visuals being a man walking down a street, so preoccupied with his interest in a well-made woman, that he enters a post: one of the consequences of love and one metaphor for what's in store ... <br /> <br /> Long time, another movie? Love Story (1970) - said that love is never required to apologize. This narrative reverses this idea in many ways, starting with the main character, Titta (Toni Sevillo), a seemingly innocuous long-term resident in a luxury hotel somewhere in Switzerland. Every day, week after week, does he sit down at the same coffee table, enjoying the passing world, his cigarettes, his coffee, his solitude? and he's been doing it for ten years. He sits down, he remarks, and once a week he engages in three very surprising activities that you will discover when you see this little work of art ... <br /> <br /> Love is explored in another way, a direct counterpoint to Titta's solitude and reserved nature: two of the hotel's older residents are still very much in love, but the man wants to die spectacularly when his time comes, while his long-suffering wife chastises him for cheating the cards with the other. guests, one of whom is Titta. Now, Titta knows about her quarrels, her love, the man's cheating, her apologies to her wife and her whining. As? In a surprising and comical way ... one of those surprise activities I mentioned. <br /> <br /> But this is not comedy, in fact, although it touches the idea of ​​human comedy in a Balzacian Sense: the irony of life and what to do with it. This decision was taken by Titta ten years earlier, when he left his wife and began to live in the hotel. He keeps in touch occasionally, and of course he still loves his kids (now grown up) and the sadness in his voice says a lot. But there is more than just sadness ... A life like Titta's, of course, seems to be totally boring, and in fact it's from many perspectives. It is only when we learn what is under the almost mortal countenance, however, that the horror of his situation reaches the viewer between the eyes. But not before we know that the female waitress, Sophia (Olivia Magnani), is very interested in Titta and strives to arouse Titta's interest in her. <br /> <br /> And that's where things start to unravel. Titta: he eventually succumbs to his femininity and in doing so discovers, once again, the consequences of love. Ironically, in doing so, he finally realizes what he must ultimately do with his life, and in a more spectacular way. <br /> <br /> I know that all this is a little enigmatic; but to say the least would spoil the movie and the story for you. If you like Italian cinema? I love it! ??? I recommend you to see this. The acting is superb; the soundtrack cools the column; the camera work is truly groundbreaking; the direction shows the maturity of a true artist. <br /> <br /> I know I'm going to see this movie again and again ...
