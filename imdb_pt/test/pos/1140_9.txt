This is the kind of movie that may need to be seen several times to capture all its beauty and intelligence {as the Frankenstein curse of 1957}. If you do not like non mainstream movies, avoid this masterpiece. For me, the work of art alone in this movie is worth the purchase price of the VCR. The plot is a bit fantastic, but it seems to come true in our world today. Being produced in the 1980s, this movie is proving to be a prophetic vision of what will come with Big Government and Big Brother wanting to control and monitor us. <br /> <br /> There are many slow sections and the dialogue can be quite difficult to capture in many scenes {that's why I've watched it 6 times now} but if you can digest it all, it might be worth your time. <br /> <br /> The film is basically about a world where people have evolved into robotic machines that have lost their individualism. They are only concerned with accumulating and procreating. The film's hero did not succumb to this disease and was not "tagged" and monitored by his older brother. Its mission is to release a secret drug into the water supply that will change the way human robots think and will allow individulism to once again be a part of humanity. <br /> <br /> Yes, your budget is very low, but for your time the computer effects and sound effects are very unique and the paintings are totally fascinating. If you have an open mind, this movie should impress and your prophetic visions are scary.
