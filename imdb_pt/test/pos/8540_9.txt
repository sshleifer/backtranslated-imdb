The box in my video store is because I rented this one. It looked cool from the faces of the guys in the middle, so of course I had to try. I was pleasantly surprised when I actually watched as a fan of "Evil Dead". Swedish manufacturers must have been fans as well as included many references in this masterpiece. A criminal tries to break into the house The evil Ed was editing the movies that went crazy and says "groovy" when he looks at his gun as Bruce Campbell does when he ends his chainsaw hand in Evil Dead 2. many posters from that movie have spread through the house and the movie studio. They do not just cheat Evil Dead, as there is a Gremlin-style puppet monster who curses at Ed in his refrigerator. My personal favorite is when he chases his wife around the house and says "I'm coming to get Barbra", which in case you do not know is the main line of the Barbra brothers in "Night of the Living Dead". This movie has pretty much all good storyline, cool characters, funny stuff (Gremlin puppet), scary stuff (medical devil), excellent effects (exploding head) and a fair amount of female nudity. I only gave it a 9 because it's a little slow before Ed goes crazy, but it's worth the wait. So if you liked "Evil Dead 2" or any of the other movies I mentioned above, you have to rent and watch with a friend, and when you finish try "Brain Dead" because I heard it is similar to this work -cousin. <br /> <br />
