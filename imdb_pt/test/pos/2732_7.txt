SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> 15 PARK AVENUE: My humble interpretation of this movie <br /> <br /> Now, for a moviegoer who has tastes as severe as mine, movies like 15 Park Avenue should to be palatable to my sensibility. With that thought and a slight feeling of shame at not having watched the full movie before, I watched this movie last Saturday. There are some initial similarities with other works such as the legendary Mulholland Drive (David Lynch), of which, this film lends at least 3 concepts: - a) Which (at least some) truths are relative b) The first scene of Shabana and Konkonam circling in a car like the opening credits, is strangely similar to the car ride that Betty and Rita did on Mulholland Drive. In both cases, the object of investigation becomes a place that is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more overtly symbolic in the Aparna film. C) The incident involving the mad beggar is again reminiscent of the whole 'occurrence behind Winkies'. involving a vagabond, but while that frightening creature is an incarnation of something and that that 'something' as well as the character by itself is perfectly connected to other works of Lynch (watch closely the long unkempt hair), the effect of the beggar on 15 PA seems to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message. The other films of which 15 PA also borrows is Blow Up (especially the last scene is a throw back to the movie ). true vs. perceived true poser posed at the end of Antonioni's masterpiece). Of course, the angle of the teacher and schizophrenia also brings to mind: "A beautiful mind." Although admittedly the subject here is the high physics of the eyebrow, and Shabana, who professes it, inadvertently turns out to be the brilliant antithesis of the illusory hallucinations of Konkona's character through these same prophecies. In a remarkable scene of the film, some of these elements are juxtaposed one to the other and this scene moves away from the "real" world of Shabana, where Quantum Physics and Relativity Theory justify the finitude and the composition of the universe, for the artificial building of the Mithi-making world. But for all their differences, the sisters are also equal. Both are unable to form lasting relationships - one out of choice and the other out of nature. Thus, Mithi's pain at being rejected in love by Joydeep is in harmony with Shaban's inability to form a special bond with Kunal (Dhritiman) or Sanjeev (Kanwaljeet). But I'm getting ahead of myself. Viewers generally tend to see this film in one of two ways: - Hypothesis 1: "It was Shabana all the time" There is a certain part of the audience that thinks so. But this explanation is not only very improbable, but also invented as it would mean that she was dreaming of so many other characters too (ie all those characters she viewed as visualizing Mithi along with her). Hypothesis 2: "There was a true Mithi and the ending is a metaphor" This POV says that the essence of the film is summed up in a dialogue in the film when in response to a statement by Joy (Rahul Bose) that Mithi is looking for something which she will never find, her wife Laxmi (Shefali Shah) philosophizes that we are all really looking at that illusory utopia, the end of the rainbow where there seems to be the mirage of happiness and contentment. <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 3: "Shabana and Konkona are alter egos of the same person" Hypothesis 4: Shabana is also an invention of Mithi's imagination. "Hypothesis 5:" The old, downcast, perhaps mad, the beggar woman is the true protagonist of the story "<br /> <br /> Do these hypotheses deserve to be tested? Well, your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> "Why 15 Park Avenue?" Contrary to the popular perception that she was thinking about Park Avenue in NY, I believe she got the brand name of a semi-popular bath soap. Remember, she affirmed Jo Jo's profession as "Prime Minister of Shikakai", which, as you may know, is a popular ingredient used in the manufacture of shampoos. The prefix '15' is used as it was on December 15 that Mithi became engaged to Joydeep and after her strike, she remains forever at a time of bending. The movie has its fair share of flaws - lack of use of a strong soundtrack, which in movies like these can actually increase the narrative, some sloppy dialogues unshaken by some forced delivery of dialogues. Inconsistent performances (Shabana and Dhritimaan are excellent, though IMO) by some of the cast members, although many members of this ensemble cast were wasted. Shefali Chaya's sudden insecurity toward her husband seems to be an unimaginable dimension in the plot. I give it 7/10 because it made me think, but no more than that, because I can easily understand their sources of inspiration and have experienced (and mostly appreciated) those previously, I've thought of similar lines previously. Thus, the experience after 15 PA is bound to be a certain degree of novelty. Where I come from? I gave 9.5 / 10 to '36 Chowringhee Lane '(although there is still rumor that a ghost of Satyajit Ray directed it), 7.5 for' Paromiter Ek Din ', 7 for' Mr and Mrs Iyer 'and 5 for' 'Paroma'. On an existential level, he failed to invoke my interest, not even how to say a 'Truman Show'
