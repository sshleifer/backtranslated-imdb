A story about love and hate, tragedy and happiness, and above all, friendship set in the very interesting time of the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> It gets you interested in history, it involves you emotionally and makes you wait feverishly for the next episode. <br /> <br /> In addition, the cast was splendid. Many superstars appear in small special appearances, major roles are played by a wide variety of talented pamperers - Kirstie Alley and Terri Garber should be mentioned here - this is simply a great example for a TV production as it should be. <br /> Not to forget the sheer beauty of Wendy Kilbourne who portrays Constance :-)
