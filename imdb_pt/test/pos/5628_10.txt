Whenever I'm not giving 150% to my dreams or my goals, I think of Mark Borchardt, the real-life theme of "American Movie." Mark's stubborn persistence in having his first feature-length produced and shot is so captivating that it will make you laugh, shaking his head sadly and cheering for him. <br /> <br /> I have not seen such an honest documentary film in the R. Crumb. The supporting cast (Mark's family and real life friends) are all great. Give this movie a chance and you will see a great movie and a wonderful picture of the things that the American dream is made of.
