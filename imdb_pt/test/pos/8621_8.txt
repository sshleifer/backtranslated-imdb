It is very difficult to find new information about JFK Jr. and this great movie had very little, but it was a joy to watch. The cast was very good and the script, although resembling a documentary, was also good. My only complaint was that there was not enough time. Perhaps a two-part film could have told us more about his "pre-George" days and his relationships with his mother, sister, and other relatives. Part of the book's material, "American Son," by Richard Blow, would have greatly improved the film. WTBS should be applauded for producing such a fun movie.
