I can understand how Barney can be annoying to some, but the hatred he gets is very ridiculous. Barney was made simply from the beginning and simplicity is not bad, especially for the youngsters he enjoys. I personally think this show is a very underrated period. Barney & Friends is a very educational show in my opinion and even 17 years after its debut (and almost 21 years after the character's debut in the home video) he proves several times that he still appeals to small children. Maybe less than in the early 90's where Barney was the Hannah Montana of the time, but it's still a classic. As a Barney fan, I feel I should defend it in a way that does not look like spam. The way the purple guy teaches things can be too simplistic and unrealistic, but would you rather they heard about the war? Be grateful for someone (a costumed dinosaur, but still) is there to comfort the children and let them simply be children. In this day and age, I feel we hasten our children to grow and Barney is there to say that you can still be a child at heart. Also, many of Barney's lessons about current plagiarism episodes, being honest and yes ... even death, could please everyone, not just their target audience. In addition, our children need to learn to be kind and respect others for who they are, and it helps them do that. In short, Barney can be annoying to some people and I completely understand why, but I give him some time off. All he and his friends (along with HIT Entertainment, his producer) are trying to do is to help children learn not only the skills they need but also to have fun and also to look at the positive parts of life. If more people heard their children's favorite character and saw it through their eyes, we might not be so negative about him and possibly about life itself.
