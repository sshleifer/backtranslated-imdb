This is a better than average entry in the Saint series - it keeps your interest and, as the mysteries should, keeps you guessing to the end and has several suspects to choose from. <br /> <br /> Many movies of The Golden Age is not for everyone, especially the younger ones. They date from clothes, cars, settings, etc. Who today asks for a highball? Or do you wear a suit and tie all over? And the legal process was much simpler - it must have been a shortage of lawyers back then. Frankly, much of the value is missing from those days. <br /> <br /> In any case, go with it and enjoy. It's good - in an old fashioned sense.
