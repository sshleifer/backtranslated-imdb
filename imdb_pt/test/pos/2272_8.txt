This is precious. Everything Is Illuminated is sweet and sublimely funny from the first delicious line of dialogue. Oh, how I've been waiting for this to arrive in Austin. While Elijah Wood is as charming as ever, as Jonathan Safran Foer (the real-life author of the novel Everything Is Illuminated), is Eugene Hutz (interpreting Jonathan's translator and translator, Alex) who actually steals this movie. Alex is a Ukrainian break-dancer who loves hip-hop and who, along with his grandfather, helps Jonathan find the woman who saved the life of Jonathan's grandfather during World War II. The Ukrainian camp never looked so gorgeous. I'm thinking of fixing everything and moving to the old Soviet state. The tone of the film, however, changes when Jonathan and Alex finally meet the woman they are looking for, and suddenly this adorable comedy turns into a heart-wrenching drama about a Jewish village which was annihilated during the Nazi occupation. Everything is enlightened is about the history, inheritance and wisdom that can be gained by discovering the past. Is perfect.
