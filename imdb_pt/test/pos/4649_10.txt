This is my all time favorite movie of all time !!! <br /> <br /> I remember seeing it when I was younger and since then I have fallen in love with it. I used to rent it so often from this video store that I used to carry it, and when we moved I could not find it anywhere, so I went back to the furthest store to watch the movie again! I finally found it for sale and bought it and I saw it again and again .... great movie! Since then it was my first DVD I got after I got my DVD player ... OK, well, I got them at the same time, the DVD quality is so much better than I could not believe! You have to see this!
