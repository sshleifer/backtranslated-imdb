I've seen (unfortunately) the dubbed version in Encore. <br /> <br /> Student Paula Henning (Franka Potente who was also in the cult favorite "Run Lola Run") stars as a serious medical student entering a prestigious school in Germany. But she soon discovers that some of her students disappear and the bodies they work in in the anatomy lab are incredibly cool ... <br /> <br /> I was stuck watching the version dubbed in Encore. It hurt a lot (words that did not match lips were really annoying), but I still liked what I saw. The acting was good, it was beautifully photographed, it was not HORRIBLE and I was never bored. Even more refreshing was a nice heroine who fights when the bad guys chase after her. The (light) nudity was, in a refreshing, macho twist! An earlier poster mentions Benno Furmann (who is excellent) showed his butt, but I do not remember seeing it. Regardless, this is a well done, scary and excellent thriller. From everything I read, the original German version is the best (I do not doubt that for a second), but the dubbed version is watchable. I give it to 7.
