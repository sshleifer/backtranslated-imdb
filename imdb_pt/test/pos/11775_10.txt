Talk about your classics! Ernie Fossilus (the Foss from here onwards) came up with a cute, creative trailer totally spoofing Star Wars. This gem is so jammed with tributes and jokes I laugh every time! Not only that, when Star Wars did a re-release with new special effects, Hardware Wars did the same! Talk about a parody that just will not die! There is a reason why George Lucas calls this his favorite parody. He was so impressed that he even hired Foss to work on "Return of the Jedi" (Do not believe me, see his article on IMDb!) <br /> <br /> This has to be the first, and in my opinion, the best parody ever made. I think the Special Edition was a little overdone, but reflecting, I think it's PERFECT for the modern re-launch of Star Wars, and proves that sometimes it's wrong to tinker with perfection. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's only 10 minutes, but well worth your time. <br /> <br /> You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll say goodbye $ 3! Well, maybe 15 for the DVD, but you will be very glad you did.
