I like to walk around in a museum. You can enjoy the great talent of the main composer, Michael Cimino and this fabulous art desinger of light .. ZsigmondVille. As I said, it is like being in heaven discovering all the creation that this man can apply to a single picture. Imagine when you can look at a moving image of this artist. I can say: this movie is one of the best.
