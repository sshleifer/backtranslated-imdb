This was the best film of 1998 and one of the best of the 90's. Yes, it's a robbery of the Goodfellas. But, as the saying goes, good poets borrow, great poets steal. And the PTA stole brilliantly from some of the best, plus added some cool touches of its own. I gave it to ten (which is very rare for me). <br /> <br /> The main reason I'm commenting on this (because I could just stay rave all night) is all those people who saw in VHS standard issue ... what are you thinking? This deserves the FULL SCREEN experience. Look at the relationship in which it was filmed! I've seen it 5 times in the movies and I did not bother watching it on video. <br /> <br /> Nuff said!
