I saw fame when it first came out. This is the high school class of 1980, coincidentally my graduation year. I saw the movie in the summer between high school and college and, being an artist, I have a special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The biggest criticisms of fame usually have to do with continuity, and there are definitely some lines of history that are not complete or do not make sense. However, these problems are more than compensated by the passion and emotion of the characters and the incredible music. <br /> <br /> I've seen it again recently and I was surprised that I still loved it as much as I did the first time. Fame is often compared to Flashdance, which I do not think is fair. Although Flashdance has great songs and Jennifer Beals is beautiful, I think the fame is far superior in the development of their characters and the complexity of their stories. For those who truly love the arts, this is a must-see movie.
