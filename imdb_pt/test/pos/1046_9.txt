I discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a good surprise. A classic Christmas is also one of the best comedies of the 1940s. The plot is simple: Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) makes a living writing culinary columns for a magazine. At Christmas time, her boss, Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) asks her to invite a weakened young sailor to the Connecticut farm on which she writes. The only problem is that she has no farm and does not know how to cook. To get out of the mess, Elisabeth agrees to marry a wealthy friend (Reginald Gardiner, who owns a farm) and flies to Connecticut with her wonderful cook Uncle Felix. <br /> <br /> There is a good direction of Peter Godfrey and the cast is really wonderful: Stanwyck has never been as good as this witty and romantic woman. Greenstreet, Gardiner and Sakall make hilarious and human supporting characters. The only weakness is the leader, Dennis Morgan. It starts well, but as the film continues, it really becomes a hassle. She almost feels sorry for Elisabeht Lane ending up with him and not with Gary Cooper or David Niven, who would be better suited for the role. Anyway, this is a merry Christmas movie with a refreshing score and I would advise everyone who likes to spend funny and sweet ... in Connecticut.
