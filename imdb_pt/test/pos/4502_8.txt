I have not read the novel in which "The Kite Runner" is based. My wife and daughter, who did, thought the film fell far short of the book, and I'm prepared to accept his word. But on its own, the movie is good - not good, but good. How accurately does it portray the chaos created by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan? How convincingly does the Taliban intolerant regime that followed follow? I would rate C + on the first and B + on the second. Human history, the American Afghan who returned to the country to rescue his childhood partner's son, is well done, but it is in that particular that I was told that the book was far more convincing than the film. The most exciting part of the film, however - kite contests in Kabul and later a mini-contest in California - may not have been matched by the book. I'd bet money on it.
