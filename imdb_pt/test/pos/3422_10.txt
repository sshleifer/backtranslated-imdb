I have not seen a movie in a long time that moved me and grabbed me in such a way; that I could not take my eyes off the screen. I was busting in the bathroom; and I did not even want to take a break because I was attracted. Emotive; powerful; very touching; horrible and heartbreaking. It gives you an incredible insight into South Africa; their struggles and their lives. The acting on the leads was amazing and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events unfolding in this film and how horrible the story is; I was captivated. I do not even want to try to explain the story; it is very complex and I would not do it justice. Please see this; You'll understand why when you do. Congratulations, Hol
