A very charming representation of the European Union beginning to operate between the young generation as representatives of this group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, ​​where they are all studying in international scholarships. Central to the story is Xavier (Romain Duris) who may have lived a fairly conventional life with his mother in France but who quickly becomes a leader in the group by helping them deal with owners and other problems. He learns about life and love quickly. Duris has a healthy appearance and gives a good performance. The rest of the cast also plays well. Occasionally, they all switch to English when they want to make sure they are communicating, uncertain about the ability of all their apartment mates to understand French or Danish or whatever languages. Remarkable cinematography including beautiful views of Barcelona and its famous Gaudi towers.
