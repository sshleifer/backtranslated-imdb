A legend on the screen informs us that it is "the Caribbean Sea, May 1891". A small lifeboat wanders aimlessly at sea, containing six doomed from a shipwreck, and the ship's doctor, Lieutenant Claude De Ross (Claudio Cassinelli). At night, a strange current takes the boat to a strange island, unnamed and unknown. The boat hits some rocks and is shattered. One of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a mutant fish creature. The next morning, Claude wakes up and finds himself on a beach. He finds a pool of bubbling white water and one of the dead prisoners beside her. Claude warns another surviving prisoner Jose (Franco Iavarone) not to drink the water, as she will kill him. The two ended up meeting with the other surviving prisoners, Peter (Robert Posse), François (Francesco Mazzeri) and Skip (Giuseppe Castellano). François vague on his own to try to catch an animal to eat, he finds and kills a large water bird. But in turn, he is killed by one of the fish-men. Claude, Joseph, Peter and Skip continue to explore the island, putting Francois's death in some sort of animal attack. Shortly thereafter, Skip is killed when impaled on a peak at the bottom of a hole. Now only Claude, Joseph and Peter are left. They stumble into a graveyard with many empty graves and signs of recent rituals of black magic. Claude sees a snake on a nearby stone, suddenly a shot is heard and the snake's head explodes. A woman on horseback named Amanda Marvin (Barbara Bach) is revealed as a savior of Claude. She tells them to leave the island immediately as it is owned by an Edmund Rackham (Richard Johnson) and he does not like visitors. Claude, Joseph and Peter decide to move on, eventually finding Rackham's large house in which they are invited to stay. That night, Peter goes after Amanda and tries to rape her in a swamp, Peter quickly becomes food for the man-fish. And a voodoo priestess named Shakira (Beryl Cunningham), who lives with Rackham, performs a ritual of black magic involving cutting a chicken's throat in the graveyard. The next day, Claude and Joseph decide that they should leave the island because they feel very uncomfortable with Rackham and think he is lying to them. Joseph gets out on a horse and gets lost. Claude is saved from one of the fishmen by Amanda and is again told to leave. Claude wants to confront Rackham again. Rackham reveals that he has a scientist, and Amanda's father, named Professor Ernest Marvin (Joseph Cotten), needs to be kept alive. Rackham says that the more Ernest stays alive, the chances of his own survival will increase dramatically. Rackham tells Claude about his plan. Rackham found the lost city of Atlantis at a depth of more than 2,000 feet. He is using the fishmongers as a means of getting the lost treasures of Atlantis, and needs Amanda and his father to control them. He claims that the fishmen are descendants of the original inhabitants of Atlantis. Rackham offers Claude a piece of the treasure if he helps him keep Ernest alive. Later, Claude remembers the name of Ernest Marvin as a scientist convicted of experiments on transplanting organs from animals to humans. Finding Ernest's secret lab, he discovers that Rackham lied to him and the fishmen are not descendants, their really genetically altered ones became amphibious creatures by Ernest's grotesque experiments! Rackham has finally had enough of Claude and decides to end his meddling by putting him in a large tank and slowly filling it with water as the island volcano begins to erupt and send lava flying everywhere. Rackham wants to leave the island with his treasures and Amanda, will Claude escape almost certain death to save Amanda and leave the island before the erupting volcano destroys it? Directed by Sergio Martino I really liked this movie that mixes several genres. Sergio Donati's script is fast, interesting and fun. The plot is revealed little by little, which kept me interested in watching all the way. I must say at this point that I saw the original version and not the one with added scenes inserted for its US release by Roger Corman. Barbara Bach is an extremely attractive actress, but I hated the way she was introduced, throwing a snake out, I thought it was more than a little unpleasant. Richard Johnson makes a great villain and Claudio Cassinelli a nice hero. The fish themselves seem a bit fake when the camera stays on for a long time, but their cool looks and I've seen worse. Some of the miniature effects seem a bit poor too, but overall, again I've seen much worse. There is nothing real, violence or nudity, but it does not really bother me. The photography of Giancarlo Ferrando and the production design of Massimo Antonello Geleng combine to create a very beautiful film. Vintage costumes, props and sets such as Rackham's house and Ernest's laboratory with its old scientific equipment. The settings of the verdant jungle also contribute to the show's visual splendor. I really enjoyed this movie and was entertained throughout the execution time. I'm not sure who I would recommend as well, since it mixes several genres, I think someone who might like something a little different and usually well done. If you can find a copy, try it.
