Charles Bronson is back in his most famous role. In my opinion, this is by far the best movie in the series and my favorite movie of all time. This film is not taken seriously, because filmmakers knew that all the social comment that was needed was put on the first film. Golan and Globus have made this film for Bronson fans, not for critics, and it works. DW3 has been unfairly criticized as "junk" and "a tired entry into a worn out series". These statements would be true if the film were meant to be taken seriously or to release a statement, but it was not. If you figure it out, DW3 is a fun, action-packed joke, with Charlie doing street punks what we all wish we could do. The action is uninterrupted, the atmosphere is great, and the film is just the best Bronson movie ever made. You can say that the Cannon group that spent a lot of money spent a lot of money on this. It is believed that Bronson thought this film was very violent, and that was the reason why the winner did not direct any of the following entries. I can understand your concern, but as is always the case with the sequences, you have to push the envelope even more to pass an earlier entry. Anyway, this movie was no more violent than any other film made during that period. What makes DW3 the best of the series and my all-time favorite movie (not the best, just my favorite) is the action, the presence of Charlie, the memorable villains and the ability to make viewers Enter the wave. The first movie may be the most technically well done, but this is the most fun. For the first time, Charlie really has some clever lines (although he does not say much) and an interesting story, photography, action and direction to support him. Charlie has never been more intense or super cool than this one. Yes, he's an explorer, he might promote stereotypes, and maybe it's the same story as before, but the Bronson films always had and will always defend the common man and give the audience what they want to see. Many argue that the DW series manipulates its audience, my answer is that the movies do not manipulate us, the fans are responsible. We demand that Bronson destroy the scum he deserves, and in turn, Winner and Co. deliver the goods. And for those of you who still want to knock him down, remember a few things. The DW3 was the # 1 movie in America when it came out and was among millions of people's favorites in video and television because they realize that not all movies have to be epic, they just have to be fun. ********** / 10 You can not get better.
