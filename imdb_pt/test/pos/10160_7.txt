Ostensibly, a story about the young son of Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day. The kid is kidnapped to keep his parents quiet. They know something about a plot to assassinate the ambassador of an unnamed country during a presentation at Albert Hall in London. <br /> <br /> The film is rich in Hitchcockian incidents. A sympathetic but opaque Frenchman seems to attach the innocent Stewart - an Indiana physician - a little too intensely to be merely curious. Later, the Frenchman appears disguised as Arab, with a knife in his back, and whispers some information about the murder plan for Stewart. Stewart tells his wife - Doris Day looking very cheeky indeed - but refuses to cooperate with the police and risking his son's life. <br /> <br /> Instead, the couple try to track down the killers, buy them and take their son back, taking them from Morocco, where Hitchcock gave us his usual view of manners, places, and food for London. There's a hilarious and crazy chase involving a set-in between Stewart and the staff at a taxidermy store. Officials are more concerned with keeping their half-stuffed specimens than anything else, and they cling to protect the carcasses of a leopard and a swordfish. In the course of the fight, Stewart manages to prevent his throat from being cut off by the swordfish, but is bitten in the hand by a stuffed tiger, the action driven by Bernard Hermann's score. The scene ends with Stewart running through the door. Hitchcock ends with a photo of a gaping lion's head on the beaten door. There is also a well-made joke about some visitors waiting around the couple's hotel room in London, waiting for things to be explained. <br /> <br /> There are two serious issues that are lightly touched. One is the relationship between Stewart and Day, which is not as rosy as it should be, considered a bourgeois ideal. She has been a musical star for a few years and is known internationally. And she gave up everything to marry an ordinary guy who happens to be a doc. This is understandable in, say, a nurse or flight attendant or almost any other woman besides an international star with a promising career by itself. It is not thorough, but the nervousness is noticeable, as it was not in the original version. This reminds me a bit of a trade-off between Joe Dimaggio and his then-wife Marilyn Monroe, who had just returned from entertaining troops in Korea. "Oh, Joe," she said, "have you ever seen ten thousand people stand up and cheer?" "Seventy thousand," murmured Joe, a former New York Yankee hero. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that of loyalty. Who has the greatest social value? The young son himself? Or an unknown ambassador. Do we put ourselves or our loved ones at risk because of national stability? Day faces this dilemma in its heaviest form at the climax of Albert Hall. His solution opts for loyalty to political stability, although his motives are problematic. Does she scream to save the life of the ambassador, or does she just do this to release the anxiety that is overloading her? (Cf: Alec Guiness falling on the detonator at the end of "The Bridge on the River Kwai".) The picture is extremely good, and the settings can be menacing, even on a quiet street in a residential neighborhood of London. It's noon and Stewart is alone and determined but scared as well. There are footsteps echoing on someone's Gulliver Street, somewhere. Is he being followed? Is your life in danger? And where the hell is everyone who lives on this street? Hitchcock pays so much attention to the details of the location that we can distinguish the brick wall from the bricks beside it. The director had a rare disagreement with Fran√ßois Truffaut when he was interviewed for Truffaut's complimentary book. Truffaut argued that the earlier version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" did not have the depth of the later version. Hitchcock replied, "It seems to me that you want me to make films for the art house audience," but finally agreed that the 1930s version was the work of a talented amateur and that version was the work of a professional. No argument there. <br /> <br /> This is Hitchcock practically close to your zenith.
