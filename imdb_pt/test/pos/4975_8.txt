This is one of my favorite westerns. What a cast! Glenn Ford plays his part in his smooth, controlled and firm manner. Ford plays one of the smaller ranchers in the shadow of the powerful anchor ranch who wants to swallow the whole territory. Edward G Robinson plays the crippled patriarch of the anchor farm and Barbera Stanwyck plays his malicious wife. There is a lot of action In this western that is quite impressive, the scenery is delightful and the letterbox-scoped photography is breathtaking and the soundtrack is stereo! I would say this western had a budget of sufficient size. Sounds expensive. One of a series of great westerns by Glenn Ford.
