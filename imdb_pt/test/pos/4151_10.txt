This movie played in Lexington KY for 7 days. I saw it on the last day of its execution and regretted that I could not recommend it to others because this is a movie that claims for a great screen experience. The aerial shot where the crowded ship moves away from the equally crowded dock is a masterpiece as is the scene where the two main characters flirt on the deck - almost a ballet and sexier in their suggestiveness than many more explicit films in the days of today. I just shrink at the thought that more people will not have the opportunity to see this good movie in a theater; the DVD experience will not be the same. Here's an idea: If you live in a college town, see if you can lobby for it to show up at a film festival on campus.
