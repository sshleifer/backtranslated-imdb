For those of you who have seen this photo on VHS, I would recommend the DVD. In fact, VHS is total trash. The main reason is that the film was filmed in widescreen (2.55: 1) and the producers ran out of money making the VHS version and released in 4: 3. The result is that several actors are not on screen, and in many Less than half of the cars are showing up, since one of them is on each side of the screen. The DVD is actually a reasonable version of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many of the best scenes in the movie were cut before the final release. They were seen as very offensive to minority groups. In fact, the prospect of a US release caused even more cuts in the film. For example, the Americans supposedly did not understand words like Petrol & Strides. <br /> <br /> Mike's father and mother should be hippies. The father survives in the film as a drug-smoking guitarist. But the next scene with his mother was cut off. The scene occurred in the space of the roof of the house, which was lined with foil, fluorine lights and full of plants ... you get the picture. The producers had gathered many real plants to the foreground and when they saw the result in the large sheet, they were startled and the scene was cut off. Cowards! <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is known as a classic Australian cult. Elected the number 2 in street machines with the 100 best films of all time, narrowly losing to Mad Max II. The latter had more than 10 times the ROE budget. In fact, the budget for ROE was so small that the director could not afford to destroy any of the cars ... even if there was a public outcry if someone had destroyed a real HO. (compare this to Smoky and Bandit or the Blues Bros, where dozens of cars have been destroyed.) <br /> <br /> So there's a real GTHO and two fakes. One of the forgeries was purchased from the local Indian community in Cobar after the GTHO collapsed in the back of the Country Boy truck. (That was not written!) The car was bound to explode on the side of the truck.) Because the budget was so tight , the car was made with a common brown adhesive tape, instead of the gold painting of the real thing. The 55 chev is absolutely real. The car began as a very simple door and was bright and quickly converted to the '55 blown in the film. The engine was a 545 marinade which produced about 1000 bhp. This was reduced to about 600 for filming. The car was able to easily to 170 mph as shown in various scenes of the film. <br /> <br /> Just for the record, anyone with $ 12,000 could have picked up all the cars after the movie. The HO, the Dodge, the '53 Ute, the Rammer 53 Chev ... the lot. Imagine where they are now? <br /> <br /> SW
