Do not let the uncontrolled criticism of the movie stop you. You will love or hate according to your own tastes. However, if for no other reason, see "Greystoke" to experience the thrill of a great actor grabbing his heart as he breathes life into his role. Ralph Richardson was not a great actor for how perfectly he could deal with Shakespeare; instead, he must be remembered for his sensitive treatment of all the characters he portrayed. He was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor. His reading of the Sixth Lord of Greystoke, his last performance, should be appreciated by everyone who loves the theater.
