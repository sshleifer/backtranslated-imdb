He did one at Christmas to try to bring back a number one song, and now the fantastic Justin Lee Collins wanted to bring together the cast members and maybe some members of one of his favorite TV shows as a child, The A-Team. The only member he could not do was the late George Peppard, who played the main character Colonel John "Hannibal" Smith, but he got some sort of psychic to try to help. He was able to reunite all members, including Dirk Benedict (Lieutenant Templeton "Faceman" Peck # 2), who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (Captain HM "Howling Mad" Murdock), Melinda Culea William Lucking (Colonel Lynch) and Lance LeGault (Colonel Roderick Decker, the only member of the team to die). He spoke to Mr. T (Sergeant Bosco "B.A." Baracus) in an early interview, but he was not available to attend the meeting. It was so much fun to see him trying to find them and talking to them, even if they probably did not want to, and the meeting, of course, is the climax. Very good!
