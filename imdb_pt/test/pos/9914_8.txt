I sympathized with the situation of the first man, Schmitter, we see dead in this episode. It reminded me of the fear of being an isolated security guard at night somewhere - the kind of work I did briefly 20 years ago. Of course, he never risked getting burned, as the boss of the colony (Lynch) likes to describe. The monster in the dark here, murdering members of a deep mining colony, creates a scary impression in the first act. We do not really see this in the opening scenes and, as many of us realize, the best monsters are sometimes left to the imagination. 'Big and shaggy' is a sound description, but it actually resembles a large, lumpy Calabrian pizza, sliding across the floor like a silicon centipede - a limitation of the program's budget, unfortunately. This also shows the latest matte painting, famous for Trek fans, the only way to convey an image of mining operations. <br /> <br /> But, the whole theme of this episode is about what's inside, rather than outside appearances, anyway. Of course, this Horta, a newly discovered silicon-based life form, looks like a stupid monster at first glance. Thanks to Spock's telepathic ability (probably the best use of a Vulcan mind for plotting purposes), we have learned that he is a highly intelligent and sophisticated creature. In addition to Spock's instrumental use of his talent, McCoy manages to overcome his usual medical routine - healing a rock-like creature or asbestos. He is also able to pronounce one of his most famous phrases: "I am a doctor, I am not a mason!" I find him very faithful to life in his scene, where he rejoices in his success, though he fails to persuade Kirk to share his enthusiasm - Kirk is too busy organizing the results. The episode casts unexpected turns on character and motivation in the audience as the story progresses; Spock defends the need to preserve the life discovered, since Kirk takes the habitual position to avoid the death of red shirts (without half measures, as in "The Man Trap"). But later, it is Kirk who for some reason stops himself from firing a deadly blast, as if the heat of the hunt had passed and he had time to reflect on Spock's argument (I believe it was during the filming of this episode that Shatner learned that his father had died). Incomparable for most of the first season, this has a happy ending. The conflict stems from the needs of basic capitalism, such as meeting standard quotas, versus protecting the natural environment and its inhabitants - a spatial-era version of owl protection from the tractors of modern advancement. Somehow, despite many murders and a feeling that anything could go to hell at any time with a high phaser, Kirk and Spock manage to broker a deal that satisfies everyone. I think people and silicates are more reasonable in the 23rd century.
