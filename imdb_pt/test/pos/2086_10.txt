This movie was full of suspense and was well directed, the black and white effect became a great mystery. Fay Emerson, (Hilda Fenchurch) who was married twice to the famous musician Skitch Henderson and also the son of Elliott Roosevelt, (Son of FDR) fell in love with Zachary Scott (Ronnie Mason / Marsh). Ronnie conquers the hearts of all the women in the photo, up to Mona Freeman (Anne Fenchurch) and proposes marriage whenever she can. Rosemary DeCamp (famed radio and TV actress in the '30s and' 40s played mostly in the small town MOM'S) warned the ladies about Ronnie Mason's unhealthy mind and the abusive childhood he had when he grew up, which caused his love / hate relationship with women. Fay Emerson and Zachary Scott would have been bigger stars with more rewarding roles, but their lives were short in real life. This film is beyond criticizing, it's a great classic movie from 1945 for many generations to see and enjoy!
