TRACK SPOILERS !!!! Dr. Boch (George C. Scott) is the chief medical officer at a large New York hospital. He left his wife, his children disowned him, he is impotent, he drinks a lot and thinks about suicide. There's also a murderer roaming the hospital. Then he meets a very strange Barbara (Diana Rigg) and falls in love. She wants him to run away with her - but can he completely give up his old life and start a new one? <br /> <br /> Very strange film with an Oscar-winning screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky. He features a main suicidal character and shows us a hospital full of nurses and overworked doctors who are executed incompetently. He can (somehow) really make it look really funny. It's not high humor laugh - it's very dark humor. Also acting is on target - Scott is great (and nominated for an Oscar) here. You see him trying to keep his sanity in a totally crazy situation. Riggs's character is more than a little strange, but his way of acting does indeed work and she is also incredibly beautiful. The script is strong and brutal - but it never hurts. I think this messes up the ball at the end with a situation that goes way beyond the top - but still worth seeing. If this had been done seriously, it would probably be impossible to take. Also look for Katherine Helmond in a little bit and Stockard Channing and Christopher Guest in unprocessed pieces. I personally had trouble taking this seriously. From what I heard hospitals were so bad in the 1970s, but no more. See for the acting and screenplay. I give a 7.
