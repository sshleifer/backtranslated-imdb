Alfred Hitchcock shows originality in the remake of his own 1934 British film, "The Man Who Knew Too Much." This 1956 take on the same story is much lighter than the previous one. Hitchcock was lucky to have collaborators who went with him from one film to another, thus maintaining a standard in his work. Robert Burks did a great job with cinematography and the George Tomasini edition shows his talent. Ultimately, Bernard Herrmann is seen driving at the magnificent Royal Albert Hall in London at the climax of the photo. <br /> <br /> James Stewart was an actor who worked well with Mr. Hitchcock. In this version, he plays an Indiana doctor on vacation with his wife and son. When we find him, they are on their way to Marrakesh on a local bus and the intrigue begins. Your wife is the lovely Doris Day at her best. She had been a well-known singer before her marriage and is now the perfect wife and mother. The film has a good supporting cast, Brenda DeBanzie, Bernard Miles, Daniel Gelin, Alan Mowbray, and others, do a great job of portraying their characters. <br /> <br /> Although this is a "lightweight Hitchcock", one can not rule this out as a failure. "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is a change of pace for Hitchcock fans.
