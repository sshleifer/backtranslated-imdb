Choose your destination: the terrible tykes of the fourth form, playing tricks involving axes, or the ... ummm ... well-developed girls of the sixth form, who have long discovered cigarettes, gin, sex, and how easily men can be diverted. The problem is that one set comes with the other. They are all there at St. Trinian's, that remarkably easy English school for girls led by director Millicent Fritton (Alastair Sim). As Ms. Fritton likes to say, "In other schools, girls are sent unprepared for a ruthless world, but when our daughters leave here, it is the ruthless world that needs to be prepared." Miss Fritton looks like something of a fusion of Julia Child and Eleanor Roosevelt, and definitely has Sim's funky, expressionless comic genes. In the Belles of St. Trinian's, a chaotic comedy by Frank Launder's team and Sidney Gilliat, St. Trinian's is, as always, on the verge of financial disaster. Salvation may be at hand, however, when a wealthy sheikh sends his daughter to join the fourth form and receive a proper education in English. Sheikh also owns a horse and one of its pilots, Arab Boy, is being trained near the school for a run. It's only a matter of time before the fourth-form girls form a pool of races and strongly bet on Arab Boy, with Miss. Fritton adding to the pool the funds the school left. (Much of the girl's money in the form of a bedroom comes from the gin they make in chemistry, then they bottle and go down rope to Flash Harry (George Cole), a Cockney usher, for distribution. "There's something ... I do not I know exactly what, "says Miss Fritton in proving the material," but sending some jars to my room. ") Miss Fritton, however, has a brother, Clarence Fritton (who, by some coincidental cast, is also Alastair Yes), a bookmaker who not only put a pack on another horse but who also has a daughter. And he put the Arabella early in the sixth form to keep him informed. Soon the sixth form kidnapped Arab Boy, the fourth form took the horse back, Flash Harry joined forces with Miss Fritton, the sixth grade girls are determined that Arab Boy will not leave the second floor of St. Trinian, Clarence and his gang of Homburg arrived, parents are going to Fathers Day and the Ministry of Education arrived in the person of a very appropriate inspector. Total war bursts into St. Trinian's. It's hard to say which is more dangerous, African spears or flour bombs. <br /> <br /> Alastair Yes as Millicent Fritton does a tour de force performance. Fritton is a tall woman with majestic breasts, with long embroidered lace dresses and feathered Edwardian hats. She takes it all stride, even an ex-beating room in something in chemistry class, and after hearing an explosion a few minutes later, results. "Oh dear, I told Bessie to be careful with that nitroglycerin!" She is adamant in believing that St. Trinian's is "a gay arcade of happy girls". Yes it was one of the great eccentric actors of Great Britain. Besides the chaos of all the small (and not so small) girls doing terrible things, it delivers a lot of the enjoyment of the movie.
