This movie was a riot, he mocks "Madonna - Truth Or Dare" in all the right places. I love Madonna and I love Julie Brown. How could I ask for more ... The parody of Julie's "Vogue", entitled "Vague", was hysterical ... "Kelly LeBrock thinks she's great, she's just a cold boazona on a paper plate." "Brooke Shields, Dawber, Pam Spam Personality" !! I could have died! And wait until you see what she can do with a watermelon !!
