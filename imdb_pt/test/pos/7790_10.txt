Well, for starters, Rajkumar Santoshi is not a comedy filmmaker, and this is really unfortunate because the only comedy movie he did is a masterpiece. This movie is really funny. High on bits, exaggerated in some scenes, but still in the dialogues really laugh riots and characters r really fun. Story line in simple daughter of a billionaire come to India for the wedding and two young people behind her, the story has a twist too with a connection of a gangster. Aamir playing a street smart guy Amar has played his part with glow and Salman has played the role of an innocent stupid to perfection. Raveena did okay, but Karshima really becomes annoying in some sequences. But real show stealer r Paresh Rawh and Shakti Kapoor, they enter the frame and automatically u start laughing. Overall, such a nice movie that you can watch it any not. of times without getting bored.
