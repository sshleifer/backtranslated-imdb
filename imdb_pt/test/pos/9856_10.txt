I loved this movie! So it's worth the long run time. I need help with the ending though .... <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * Marie's ending at the end - is to suggest she's still looking for Renaud? or possibly that she was the one who wanted to reinvigorate the 13? (she seemed to be the one who delivered the initial letter to Colin in the first place) I do not quite understand, but I know I really enjoyed it. So if anyone has seen it and remembers it or just seen it, please explain about the ending. Thank you
