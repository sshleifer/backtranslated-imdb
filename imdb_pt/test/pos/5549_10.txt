This movie seemed very true to life. I liked the ending that seemed to settle naturally, no big moments, but with a lot of little moments together. You could say it's an honest love story. No matter what the 'sexual orientation' of the main characters, it's still a story about love and understanding. <br /> <br /> There were many scenes that involved the family. The scenario is during which for some people it is a very stressful time. That is, "the holidays". Christmas to be precise. <br /> <br /> Like most good movies, it deals with issues of love, adaptation, expectations and prejudices that can not be overcome. In the end, Alexandra and Casey make a choice for each other, knowing that love is difficult and about giving. Well done.
