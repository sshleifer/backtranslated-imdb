Alfred Hitchcock made many brilliant thrillers, and many of them came to be acclaimed as some of the greatest films of all time. A movie that tends to get lost a bit under Vertigo and Psycho is this movie; Strangers on a train, the most attractive film Hitchcock ever made. The story follows Guy Haines, a tennis player and a man about to marry the senator's daughter if he can divorce his current wife. One day, on the way to see his wife, he meets the mentally unstable Bruno Anthony aboard a train and is soon dragged into a murder conspiracy that can not stop or stop; and one that could ultimately cost you life. <br /> <br /> The conversation aboard the convoy between Bruno and Guy is one of the most intriguing and provocative movies ever made. What if two people "exchanged" murders, thus solving all suspicions of crime, and rendering their motives irrelevant? Could this really be the perfect murder? What makes this movie even more frightening is that the events in which Guy is led could happen to any normal person from day to day. Everyone has someone they'd like to get rid of, and what if you met an insane man aboard a train that killed for you and then made him do it? The chances of this happening are unlikely, but it is the idea that anyone could be a killer who is key to the message of Strangers on a Train; and in that situation, anyone could. <br /> <br /> Is there any actor on earth who could have played the character of Bruno Anthony better than Robert Walker? The man was simply born for the role. He manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely commands all the scenes in which he is. Bruno's character is crazy, but he's not a lunatic; he is a calculating and conniving human being and Robert Walker makes the character believable. His performance is extremely malevolent and yet discreet enough to keep the character firmly within the realm of reality. Unfortunately, Robert Walker died just a year after the release of Strangers on a Train, and I believe it is a major loss to the cinema. No one in the cast shines as much as Walker, but it's worth mentioning his co-star Farley Granger. Granger never impresses much, but his performance is good enough and he stands against Walker. Also noteworthy in his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person; And that's how it should be. Ruth Roman is Guy's wife to be. She's not really in the movie enough to make a lasting impression, but she does the best she has. Alfred Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, takes on the final role of the four central roles as Barbara, the sister of Guy's fiance. She is suitably adorable in this role, and she tends to steal many of the scenes in which she is. <br /> <br /> The direction of Alfred Hitchcock is always sublime, and it is well in this film. There is a particular shot, which sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses. This is an absolutely brilliant photo and it creates a great atmosphere for the scene. Hitchcock's direction is melancholy, and is very much in keeping with the film's noir style. The climax of the movie is spectacular and exciting, and I do not think anyone, other than Hitchcock, could have achieved the great effect that was shown in this film. It's really exaggerated and out of turn of the movie; but it works. There is a reason why Hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time, and the reason for this is that he does not just use the script to tell the story of the movie but also uses the camera to do it too. Strangers on a Train is one of the greatest thrillers of all time. Its story is intriguing and thought-provoking, and will surely delight any movie fan. A masterpiece.
