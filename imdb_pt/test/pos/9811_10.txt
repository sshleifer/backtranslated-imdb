I'm not sure about calling this child drama or fantasy movie. When I first watched this I really could not understand the ending and this is the only part of the movie that seemed to have no depth and left me a bit depressed for a while. So I watched a second time and realized how great was the performance and had no idea why he had received the little attention he had at the time. <br /> <br /> Unforgettable presentations of the young Mazzello and Wood should have done. This movie is a classic. Although the film has probably been a fantasy / drama from the original author / director (Evans), since Donner took office, presumably he did so with a more dramatic, especially ending, view left much to be desired as to what really happened to Bobby - Was he killed? Did he escape and actually did all those fantastic trips? Or was it just an imaginary story woven by Hanks to prove a point to the children? <br /> <br /> But in all this was not the end of a happy ending that we are so accustomed to in a children's film. Maybe it's because that's not all. <br /> <br /> To see what may have been a more classic ending, check out the Official Elijah Wood Site, where you'll find the first draft of the film's completion (presumably by the original writer) > Also a note from Hans Zimmer's music, which is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, a mixture of childish and somber feelings throughout the film. A great CD to grab, if you can. <br /> <br />
