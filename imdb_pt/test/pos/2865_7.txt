I did not know much about this movie, but I discovered that Kane was a fighter, which did not excite me, but hey, I liked "Santa's Slay" and he had a wrestler, so what the hell. The story begins very strange and promising, but after a while becomes not much more than your typical horror movie terrorist, although the settings help some. A bunch of young criminals are arrested and taken to an old hotel that used to be a luxury palace, but now it's a dump, to clean it up and prepare it as a homeless shelter. The driver is a man with a prosthetic arm, being a veteran of the opening scene of this movie in which he finds this great ego that has just killed his partner and blinded another woman. Teenagers, all being smart-headed punks, obviously object to having to do any real work, but they are part of some exclusive co-ed work program, yeah, which is a great idea, of course. One hardly suspects that there is someone lurking in the hotel who, in his way, will save some money to the taxpayers of that state. Of course, it's the guy who likes to collect eyes, and he has a good collection. There will not be much here that horror fans have not seen before, but there are some brutal scenes and enough to satisfy the fanatic. The configuration of the old hotel is also a perfect location for a movie slasher, and there are small sub-stories, such as the search for a supposed safe full of money and the search for babies, since this work team is balanced. Most teenagers are deservedly killable as well, so this works well. Not great, but a lot better than Silent Hill or When A Stranger, and maybe better than some of the other crap I would not bother seeing. 7 out of 10.
