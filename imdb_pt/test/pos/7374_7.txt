Definitely, not only for the aficionados of urban legends, Campfire Tales is an often scary and always fun ride through various popular stories. It's also a movie that exceeded the expectations (lows) I had. A horror movie that I had never heard or read about, a direct release for the video (granted, the latter often presents us with a pleasant surprise but with horror movies nowadays may be all or nothing), a cast of unknown . .. well, I'll leave the math to you. <br /> <br /> The film proves to be a fun, suspenseful and very enjoyable experience. The four stories are very rhythmic and satisfying. The only one I felt was a little weaker was "The Locket", for the simple reason that it offers almost no explanation for its plot or character actions; however, I still loved the tale, its atmosphere and end. My favorite was the third story, "People Can Lick Too" - the thriller in it is not only palpable but also educational. <br /> <br /> I found the Campfire Tales as one of those terror jewels that one discovers chance, and then continues to recommend to everyone. <br /> <br /> 7/10
