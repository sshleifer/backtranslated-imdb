<br /> <br /> 5 years ago, if you watched an Australian movie, you'd expect to see crocodile hunters, war stories, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians in. General being depicted as imbeciles living off the ground, saying words like "cobber" and generally being the classic loser. <br /> <br /> Fortunately Australian film has evolved over the past two years and is producing modern day ?? classics such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People. <br /> <br /> In this evolution of the film we also find Two Hands. <br /> <br /> Placed at Kings Cross in Sydney, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival at the end of town. Pando, played by Bryan Brown, is a Sydney mob boss. He is the king of organized crime using strips, carrying a stocky and helping his son with his origami. He is cruel, but real. As is your 'mob', holding the gun on someone's head in one scene and then playing board games in the next. They are well respected and if they ask a favor, you do not say no. <br /> <br /> Enter Jimmy, played by Heath Ledger. Jimmy is the average Australian guy in his twenties. He's a cool guy who wants to make a name for himself without being on the bad side of anyone, so when Pando asks Jimmy to hand over $ 10,000, Jimmy accepts. <br /> <br /> Things start to get exciting when 2 teens manage to steal money while Jimmy is on the beach. So now, Jimmy has $ 10,000 in the department of a big mob boss. From here we begin to see all interconnected stories with Jimmy and his attempted bank robbery to recover money, Jimmy and Alex (love interest, played by Rose Byrne), Pando trying to find Jimmy and of course the two teenagers and its new prosperity. The concept is deepened by the narrator, Jimmy's dead brother, Michael, who was killed by Pando and his gang years before. <br /> <br /> In the end, all the stories connected very well with a surprise to shock and stun. the audience. I enjoyed that. <br /> <br />
