This is an excellent bather from the war years. John Mills leads an excellent cast of regular British B movie loyalists in a solo underwater attack on a fictitious enemy battleship. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Filmed in black and white, it is well paced and also well placed considering that a war was going on at the time. If anything, it shows how seriously the authorities carried positive propaganda. <br /> <br /> The mission side of the movie happens in genuine submarines. Things are tight and claustrophobic. The actors seem adequately dirty and sweaty without being too offensive to the heroic palate. Other commentators have already drawn attention to the small authentic details, such as keeping the boat in place and forgetting to read the instruments, as well as the activities of the engine room. <br /> <br /> This is probably the first film in which debris (and a dead German) is blown from the torpedo tube to fool an enemy destroyer. And it is the ONLY TIME that I saw part of the exposed ship in a sinking feign - a high risk bet if ever there was one. <br /> <br /> I'm a bit skeptical about whether or not a submarine could break through a network of steel cables. The submerged speed was almost double the human speed, and the network would have a lot of "give". In addition, the engineer was on the same workstation and operated the same levers on the surface and submerged. This also seems implausible, since diesel or electric engines were used and they were in different sections of the ship - or at least it was said. <br /> <br /> There was a bit of drama on the coast for my taste. But then, this was a propaganda effort, and it clearly contained a subtle message for civilians to care about their behavior, as that could adversely affect the morale of the service and thus the war effort. <br /> <br /> Little adventure. Nowadays, films of that time tend to be shown in the afternoon, while more modern and lower films are shown in prime time. But then; it is no longer politically correct to mention war in the presence of our European friends (many of them are guilty), or our own left-wing fascists (of whom none have ever fought for the freedoms they now ascribe) an underwater film, is eminently collectible. Better than 'The Enemy Below', I think, though less demonstrative. It's not as authentic as "Das Boot" by any means, but it's not as rude either.
