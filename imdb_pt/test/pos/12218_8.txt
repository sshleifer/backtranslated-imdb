*** SPOILERS *** What else can (or can not) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted. The cinematography is simply breathtaking (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not the state of the art. Conceptually, the program offers a little bit of everything - and for virtually everyone (parents, kids, fantasy and / or fx fans). CLOSE MEETINGS OF THE THIRD TYPE OF BLACK LAGOON CREATURE with a bit of JAWS and GODZILLA played to good measure, say. Nor was there a single bitter note in terms of performance; some surprisingly solid releases here. This SURFACE series apparently out of nowhere and, by the sheer force of its direct narrative, drove the viewer through most of an entire season. All things considered, a job well done. I just hope this turns out next season ...
