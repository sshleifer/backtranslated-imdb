Bloody wonderful. Recommended by a friend who knew I liked Thomas Kretschmann in The Pianist and Downfall. I loved the flow of the narrative - how the characters moved from hope and value ideals through shock, fear, disintegration, despair and utter annihilation. A top-notch anti-war film that must have created a major uproar in Germany. It is not a moment of pride for anyone and the study of a lost generation. This film was excellent in conveying the removal of command from the ground troops and in tapping the futility of trying to control the untamed nature and the Russian psyche. If I did not know, I would have thought it was a Russian movie, it was so fatalistic. What an uncompromising end. One pieta.
