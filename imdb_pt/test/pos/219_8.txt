The creative team of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker had their roots in improv theater in Madison, Wisconsin, I believe it was. They had a group called 'Kentucky Fried Theater' (or something like that). They put a lot of their pieces on the celluloid as 'KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE' (1977), which was long, irreverent, Estonian and very funny. <BR> They followed with the very popular, AIRPLANE! (1980), who actually put them on the map. In it, they picked up some well-known veteran actors in Robert Stack and (especially) Leslie Nielsen, and placing them in prominent roles, have parodied all the clichés of all aviation films since the days of John Wayne (Batjac). AND POWERFUL (1954). With pockets full of money and now getting noticed, the trio made a deal with Pramount Television and the American Broadcasting Company's TV Network to do a half-hour parody of the almost uncountable Police Crime Drama program we saw and went on our television screens over the years. Remembering the good work that Mr. Leslie Nielsen had delivered to AIRPLANE! He was cast for the lead. As the sergeant / lieutenant / captain Frank Drebbin (the change in job designation is one of their comic parts), he presided over a large series of successive puns, vision jokes, non sequitors, and exaggerated cops / crime clichés. All of these, united by some, seemingly standard scripts. Added to this is an overly dramatic opening narration, expressed by information contradictory to visual printed information. They have always used that in giving the title of episode titles, where voice and print titles never matched. They had a great musical score, which despite being somewhat exaggerated, would have passed as a theme and incidental. The musical score, the opening titles and the format of having the episodes divided into Act I, Act II, Epilogue, etc., were part of the obvious, but affectionate, nervousness of QM. (Quinn Martin) Productions. (They even had the same announcer as the real QM's.) One thing that such a short series in a series did not have was a technically enhanced laugh. And boy, they sure did not need any fake deal. The nature of the parody was such that it demanded close and almost undivided attention from the viewer, and this proved to be the ultimate reason behind the fall of POLICE SQUAD. Regarding the cancellation of the series, an ABC executive explained that the episodes "... required a lot of attention from the viewer." So, is not that what somebody would want? <br /> <br /> So, after only 6 wonderfully crazy and hilarious episodes, the afterlife of the cancellation of the series was POLICE SQUAD !, just to be reborn in THE NAKED GUN trilogy, made for the big screen in homes of cinema. Again, they did very well at the box office. Well, the loss of TV is the gain of Cinema, thanks to you, Mr. Idiot TV Exec! <br /> <br /> * THE HIGH AND POWERFUL was produced by Duke's Batjac Productions and released by Warner Brothers. It was unavailable for a good number of years, and Wayne's family finally made arrangements to cast it on television and video.
