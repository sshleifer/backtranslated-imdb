While this movie is not the most fun in the world, I think it's better than most. I mean, I had little laughs and just a good feeling. It's not very common to see two old weirdos just amused with age and honestly amused by the jokes. Walter and Jack had a great chemistry together as friends / brother-in-law. Just seeing them dating these women was fun and you cheered for them to the end, because if we had to admit it or not, for their age, they still had a game! : D I loved the whole plot of being able to move on and have fun, no matter how old you are. I recommend this movie for a good laugh if you want one. <br /> <br /> 7/10
