SPOILERS A Jew Frodo? Yes, that will be Elijah Wood again. From the final part of "The Lord of the Rings," Elijah Wood, like Frodo, found it increasingly difficult to get away from the lead role. Playing a football hooligan, a psychopath and now a young American Jew, Wood tried every way he could escape from this typecasting. Now, with "Everything Is Illuminated" he could have finally achieved that. Performing a role that is not as radical as other efforts, it really reaches the soul of your character. Still, it's not as if Wood did it alone. Helped by a magnificent first-time adaptation of directing Liev Schreiber and a wonderful performance by newcomer Eugene Hutz, Wood has found a magnificent production to spread his wings. "Everything is Illuminated" is a magnificent and moving piece of cinema. <br /> Jonathan Safran Foer (Wood), a young American Jew, leaves for Ukraine to find the mysterious girl who rescued his grandfather and helped him get to America. Arriving in the country, Jonathan knows everyone talking, all dancing Alex (Hutz) and his racist grandfather (Boris Leskin). Traveling through the country, the three slowly learn more and more about the history and relationships that Alex and Jonathan never knew existed. <br /> <br /> It is a strange sensation when the film advances to the second chapter (in fact it is divided four in general). The first part, although occasionally a bit funny, is mostly serious and intense. So when we are given a brief history of Alex and his family in the second part, switching from serious to hilarious is a strange step. It does not work very well, but as the film progresses, it definitely learns the lesson, as this mix of humor and sadness blends better over time. <br /> <br /> For the final credit of all involved, as the story goes on, so we begin to fall to the characters over and over. Elijah Wood is magnificent, Boris Leskin is so intense and strong that it raises questions why Hollywood has never noticed him correctly. The most notable of all, however, is the newcomer Eugene Hutz. Playing an intensely disturbed character, Hutz is absolutely brilliant. He shows the division between his kin and the real world with almost perfect skill, and when your character is communicating with Wood, you genuinely connect with him on a deeper level. Without Hutz, the story is so strong that the movie would still be magnificent, but with it, it reaches the next level. As a debut work for the actor who turned director Liev Schreiber, the story is also brilliant piece to begin with. A work of passion (Schreiber's grandfather, himself an immigrant to America), he is able to truly embrace the thrill of content, and by gifting us with some truly beautiful scenery and some magnificent photos, he can really hit the jackpot. The final half hour in particular is so beautifully created that it is a challenge for a tear to not form in any viewer's eye. It's a touching story, and with the help of Schreiber, it becomes even more powerful. <br /> <br /> Built with love from a passionate director, "Everything is Illuminated" is a beautiful piece. A road story with a difference, is magnificently represented and wonderfully written. It's a movie that everyone should see, and it's the perfect way for Elijah Wood to finally put Frodo to rest.
