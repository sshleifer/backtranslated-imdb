This is one of the best films made on the 80's punk scene. I saw this a few years ago in a "pirate" copy and I was impressed. Very few children today know the true roots of punk and this movie shows some of the 80s punk legends like The Germs and shows what it was like back then. Nowadays, both punk has become popular with MTV and radio and it's good to see the true underground rebel movement from the original scene. Darby Crash (from The Germs) is one of my heroes and this movie shows why. A must see for all "punks" and anyone curious about the 80's punk scene
