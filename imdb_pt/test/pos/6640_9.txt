This is one of the darkest, most harrowing Bergman movies I've seen. I also think this is one of the most powerful films about the ugliness of war and what it does to human souls. The couple of musicians, who left a large city for a remote island and made a living as farmers, find themselves capable of indescribable and shameful acts that would have been ordinarily impossible for them to imagine, as they struggle to survive the horrible reality of war. They betray their souls, their friends and even each other in a desperate attempt to simply survive another day. Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow are brilliant as always, as a lost, confused and terrified couple who got caught up in a civil war. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
