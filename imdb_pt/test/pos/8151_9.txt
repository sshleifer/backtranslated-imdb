I love a candid movie with a happy ending. This movie could be considered a drama, about two characters perceiving true love, but the story is so touching and so sweet that in my mind is a novel. Sure, the acting is not so good (that's not 10) but they do the job, and they do not overdo it (thank goodness) plus they're cute, but the story is powerful and just adorable (some of love- perfect will choke) !!!!!! is an excellent watch for a love story, but if ur homophobic, STAY AWAY! for everyone else, I loved the movie, it's so sweet! I felt its a brokeback on a smaller scale ... but with a happy ending .... so enjoy!
