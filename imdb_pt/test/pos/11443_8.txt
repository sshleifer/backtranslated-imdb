Night Of The Demons is definitely a definitive horror movie from the 80's demons in the same vein as the brilliant Evil Dead and Demons films. This movie combines sexually active teenagers and demons in a fun movie. A definite welcome addition after the 80's was invaded by horror movies, it was nice to see something a little different. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a group of teenagers who all meet for a Halloween party in the hulk that used to be a funeral parlor hosted by Angela. About 40 minutes of drunkenness and sexing eventually lead to a demon or demons finding their way out of the oven and owning each of the teens. Add some makeup effects, lots of cool gore and demons, and you'll have a sweet 80's party that would be ranked as one of the best demonic movies on the lists of many horror fans. Firstly I loved the setting for this movie, "Hull House" is really scary and scary and the perfect setting for a horror movie and more when the demons emerge is when the action really kicks in and turns into a night of terror and fear. This movie spawned two sequels, the first in 1994, which was ok, but nothing comes pared for that and the third titled Demon House was absolutely horrendous. This is one of those horrors that have definitely stood the test of time and continue to be a true pearl for many years. <br /> <br /> All this is a fun movie with Demons that is worth checking out.
