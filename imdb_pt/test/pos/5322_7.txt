One wonders about the state of a society that produces a father like Albert T. Fitzgerald, whom we first encounter on a plane as he is heading towards the place he abandoned long ago, and where he left a wife and a son who is now accused of murdering a mentally ill boy. When we see him for the first time, he picks up a headline in the newspaper that the woman in front of him is reading. Rather rude, he asks her if he could have the newspaper, and you offer other sections. Well, that's not what he asked, what he wants the woman to do, is give him the front section she's reading. <br /> <br /> Matthew Ryan Hoge wrote and directed this disturbing movie that reflects, in many ways. our society as it is today. In fact, Mr. Hoge is pointing out exactly what is wrong with this. <br /> <br /> The film features Leland, a teenager who can not even distinguish between fantasy and reality. It is evident that killing a human being, even the sweet innocent boy who did nothing to deserve it, will have fatal consequences not only for himself but also for his own family and for the family of the murdered child. In fact, Leland seems to have no idea what motivated him to commit the crime, for he does not show repentance about it. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that Leland was traumatized by the divorce of his parents. His own father is an indifferent man who did not care for him. It's Pearl, the teacher at the juvenile detention center who sees the turmoil inside the young man and wants to help, but unfortunately he has no chance. <br /> <br /> The best thing in the movie is Don Cheadle, a great actor who always delivers. The cast does a good job under the direction of Mr. Hoge. Kevin Spacey has a good opportunity to play the egotistical father of the accused killer and makes us hate him for being an arrogant jerk. <br /> <br /> Although a bit long, the movie leaves us with more questions than what it answered.
