I remember watching this movie in 1981, when I was 7 years old. It was absolutely brilliant! I found the DVD just a couple of months ago. I was almost jumping for joy !! I bought it and showed it to my children. They also loved it. They asked what words the seahorse was singing (I did not tell them, however, because I do not think saying the words 'gay' and 'ecstasy' to 6 year olds is too good for parents). The songs are brilliant. I still remember them all. I'll still remember them when I'm 60! There, or close to abouts. Tommy Pender is (was) such a brilliant actor. It's a shame he gave it up. <br /> <br /> If you find the movie, BUY IT! You will love!
