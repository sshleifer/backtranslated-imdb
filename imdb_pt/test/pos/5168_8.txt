The joy and tragedy of the Christmas season lie in the fact that, for the most part, it revolves around the family. That's why some people call it a "children's holiday". As we get older, natural friction and progress removes the people and things that have given us our special memories. John Denver, in one of his sweetest roles, plays George Billings, a New York architect and widower who lost his wife about a year earlier. Her life is focused around her 9-year-old daughter, Alex; both are still suffering their loss. George is trying his best to make this a special Christmas for his daughter. Enter your boss, Thomas Renfield (misinterpreted by the wonderful Colonel Flagg of M * A * S * H ​​guy, Edward Winters), who sends George to Georgetown, CO to explore a possible real estate deal. Lying to his daughter that the purpose of the trip is a vacation instead of work, George and Alex fly into the city where they are immediately greeted by a collection of generous but rather eccentric groups of characters whose main eccentricity is that all believe in Santa Claus. Georgetown is a community of picture books that we all love to live in and we love people to the neighbors. George soon finds a love interest in Susan (Jane Kazmarek). If it was not for the grinch (Renfield), it would be an ideal time. But the fact is he is in town to find properties for Renfield to develop, and there is a beautiful ranch near the town about to be closed, and the dark edges of the film revolve around the impending closure and reactions of the villagers, the farmer and the strangers. I will not ruin the ending for those who have never seen the movie. It is a typical happy ending to Christmas, but it is treated in a very subtle and believable way, which shows the best of the human spirit without being too sweet. All in all, this is a more enjoyable way to spend a couple of your Christmas TV hours. John Denver and Jane Kazmarek have good chemistry and Gennie James as Alex does a good job. I've always loved the work of Mary Wickes, an actress of recognizable character, and all the other cast members do a good job with less fleshy parts. This is a regular Christmas rate for my family; I rate 4/5.
