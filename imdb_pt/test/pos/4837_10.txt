We will never see this movie aired on HBO in the near future, if at all. If someone somehow comes across him at a video store, just pick him up before anyone else does, because I doubt he'll be re-released again. An unbelievable and timely film about the first attack on the World Trade Center on February 26, 1993 and how the government agencies that work is to identify and prevent terrorists from causing harm and harm to American citizens and The American property completely fell into work and inadvertently allowed that to happen. <br /> <br /> Chilling bone, since we all know now that the terrorists who were arrested at the end of the movie would not be the end. of our nightmare that resurfaced on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> The film brought everything that went wrong in 1992-93, which allowed the first tragedy in the WTC to happen. It took another eight years to realize that we should have learned from the first WTC attack to be more vigilant and ready to prevent the second and much more devastating World Trade Center attack from happening. I found this movie harder to watch after the events of September 11 than the video of the September 11 attacks. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this movie is do not watch it alone. The very end itself is as powerful as it is prophetic that it would shock you to know what we know today and possibly need someone who is with you but not watching the movie to seek medical attention.
