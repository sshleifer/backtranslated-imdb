What makes this low budget movie one of my favorite movies? No kidding, I was already watching 10 times or more and I did not get tired. Is the melancholy tender in any whole thing? Is it the resemblance to classics like "Niagara"? I was thinking about this a long time ago. And I discovered: I think it is: there is no hero, there are only people. Some try to be good. Some gave up trying to be good. Some are cases without hope, but still carry the courage of being human inside. It's the story of a catastrophic night at a motel at the end of the world. One way in which catastrophe is nothing more than the end of a chain of coincidences. The other way tonight reveals the logical consequences of their lives, because they are in a certain constellation that cuts across the rest of the world. There's something about a Dostoevsky tale.
