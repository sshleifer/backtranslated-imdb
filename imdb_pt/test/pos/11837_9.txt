Toplines this ok comedy about an elderly father (C. Aubrey Smith) who decides to reunite his adult children from around the world. Davies is working as a showgirl in New York when she gets word that "Daddy" wants her. Hmmmm, sounds familiar. Davies's considerable talents as a comedian save this comedy in another way so absurd that it disturbs the calm British landscape with its brazen American personality. Not as sharp as some other Davies comedies, but still worth a look. Ray Milland plays his long lost brother. Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray and Halliwell Hobbes are also fun.
