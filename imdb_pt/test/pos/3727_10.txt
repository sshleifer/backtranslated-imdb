It's hard to use words for this movie, since it does not contain any. <br /> <br /> But the images he conveys, both powerful and radical, are those that remind us why we watch movies. And you may be saying, "Well, Leonard Maltin does not like it, it can not be that good ..." But you're wrong. Watch this movie. French cinematographic brilliance in ensemble.
