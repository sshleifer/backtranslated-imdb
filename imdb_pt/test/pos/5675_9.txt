If you've ever seen Open Water, this is the same kind of indie movie style. I liked the action, suspense. the slow building of it all, I just hope they do not do to this what they did to Open Water with this sequel .. but anyway, the only thing I did not like was the annoying younger sister, I was cheering to the crocodile all the time .. movie starts very well as it should, children packing for a trip, they hire a guide who mysteriously left 5 minutes. before they get there, so I think his assistant takes the two sisters, and the boyfriend in the water, now remember that this is the second day of their adventure, curiously the first day they passed on the hour, hmm crocodile farm .. so they are out there and everything is good for a short time, so bang, crocodile time ... very intense, you know something in this movie that you do not see the crocodile, a whole lot of a lot, but when you do, damn it's too scary, I love the snout and eyes of the crocodile, and the fog shroud that seems to wrap the crocodile every time he lifts his head above the water, very very scary, but good, in general, this is a great movie if you can pass up boring sister.
