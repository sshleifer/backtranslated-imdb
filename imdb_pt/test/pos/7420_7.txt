Terry and June was one of the classic British sitcoms in my opinion. You knew what to expect - and this is not so typical! :) Unlike modern sitcoms with fully planned plot lines, this show is still a breath of fresh air. How lovely they did not see or hear comments about bodily functions or did not see a family PERFECTLY late for breakfast or a family with impossible teenagers. And there's the secret: Terry & June was based on a middle-class couple who live in relative harmony, instead of today's tense plots with the dysfunctional 'de rigueur' family (made to look more modern). <br /> <br /> I vote on the episode "Bridge to Far" as one of the best. In a way, Terry's tricks remind me of Basil Fawlty - both sometimes almost impossibly embarrassing! <br /> <br /> Terry & June is highly recommended. Have your tea and cookies ready!
