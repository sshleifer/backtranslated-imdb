Marco Poloni (Costas Mandylor) was born into a cooking family in the Bronx. Although the Polonis have been well known for their confections over the decades, business has fallen on hard times. Meanwhile, Grace Carpenter (Lauren Holly) is one of the most talented dessert makers in Manhattan, but it seems she can not get a privileged confectionery position because of the glass ceiling. An accidental meeting between Marco and Grace results in a conversation about a possible solution for both. There is a high-profile bake-off, The Golden Whisk, occurring in the near future and Marco wants Grace to partner with him. There's a lot of "dough", haha, in play for the winners, enough to put Grace in her own business and save the Polonis restaurant as well. Reluctantly, Grace agrees. But there are complications. Some of the judges and fellow competitors may have previous problems with Grace and Marco. Besides, although Marco and Grace have some kind of attraction for each other, Grace has a very rich and long-time boyfriend. Can Marco and Grace win the contest? This is a beautiful movie for the romantic at heart. First, there is the legal cast. Holly has always been a lovely actress with a remarkable husky voice that promotes her attractions. In this film, it is perfectly cast as the determined but beautiful grace. Mandylor, a newcomer, also delights as the good-looking rival baker. The rest of the actors, including the wonderful Brenda Vaccaro as Marco's mother, are very cool. Like a Hallmark film, the costumes, scenarios and production products are impeccable and the script still manages to look cool and funny, despite familiar themes. Pamper yourself, romcom lovers, for a cuter confession, ensuring a preview of this movie. It's definitely the cinematic equivalent of a great box of quality chocolates.
