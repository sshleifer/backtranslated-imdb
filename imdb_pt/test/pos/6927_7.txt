A ham actor without a penny. Who better than Michael Caine to play such a character? He is totally and utterly hilarious, but, like most of Caine's performances, he does it for real. The film seems to be a showcase of Dylan Moran and he is splendorous in his double act with Caine. This, however, is where the script fails. Moran's imitations should have been incorporated more organically. They are very much of an act on their own and makes the potential plausibility of the plot fly through the window. Nevermind. Get it if you can find it. There is enough to make a trip enjoyable.
