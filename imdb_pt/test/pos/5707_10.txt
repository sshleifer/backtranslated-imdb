As a long time resident of West Pa I have an intimate knowledge of this theme and found it was so authentically captured on film! Congratulations to the producers of this epic !!! And what a great legacy for the children of the school for years to come. <br /> <br /> The attention to detail and realistic representation of this complicated web of events make it a unique production. <br /> <br /> Viewers will feel mesmerized by the plot and captivated by the narrative. <br /> <br /> Grahame Greene is magnificent as the presenter. <br /> <br /> BRAVO !!!
