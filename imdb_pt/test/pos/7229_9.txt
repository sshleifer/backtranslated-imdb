In the decaying streets somewhere in New York City, a solitary punk named Tromeo (Will Keenan) has friends, but all they do is tattoo, stick and just party all the time. He falls in love with a beautiful rich girl named Juliet (Jane Jenson), who is also worried that his father is being a very abusive son of a you know what, but as our characters get to know each other and fall in love, things start to become make them magical. Unfortunately, their parents are with each other, because Juliet's father wants to take over the movie studio of Tromeo's father, but could love really conquer all of them and end this rivalry? Satire of hilarious and crude horror comedy drama from the crazy and disgusting people at Troma is a wonderful modern day take on Romeo and Juliet from William Shakespeare. This was released in theaters in 1997 and has some good reviews for this is a dark and humorous satire of the legendary story that started it all, has some good laughs, piercing, graphic violence and gore as a head being crushed in a fire hydrant. For me this is Troma's third best film alongside the immortal "Toxic Avenger" and "Troma's War" being the second, yes the acting may be a little bad as some Troma movies, but the above things make it up and this is a must see movie if you like horror comedies, Peter Jackson and Troma or if you want to see a comic version of a beloved story, BTW also look for a couple of fun appearances by The Toxic Avenger and SGT.
