Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly shaped in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Song in its sensitivity. The success of the film depends on the lineup of Sydney Greenstreet as the character of Alexander Yardley. Yardley is the modern equivalent of Dickens Scrooge in the way he exercises control over his employees - until the spirit of Christmas conquers him. The role is a "walk in the park" for Greenstreet, who had been one of the big Falstaffs on the stage when he was part of the Lunt company. Greenstreet had only entered the films five years earlier when, at age 61, he took part in what would become a classic film, the first and best film John Huston directed: "The Maltese Falcon." Sakah 'Cuddles' has probably never been better in its traditional role as the personification of gemutlicheit of the European average. The attractive set worn during most of the film is a pleasing jewel to the eye.
