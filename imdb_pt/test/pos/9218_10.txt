This was the first movie I saw in the movies alone. I was 7 and to this day it's one of my favorite movies. It's pure smarmy cheese. The cartoon was marketed to girls, selling dolls with soft bodies and large plastic heads, one for each color of the rainbow, with their own special animals, sprites and even a rainbow-talking horse. Typical of the time period, each show was about how hope, togetherness and magic can make 'everything better'. <br /> <br /> The film concerns the arrival of spring, when all light and color return to the world, but this time this is not happening to our lovely hero. A spoiled Princess plans to overtake the universe's giver of light (and implied the life-giver), who happens to be a giant diamond, for her tortuous purposes, regardless of reality, and now Rainbow and her new friends Orin, Onyx, and Chris must save the universe. Like I said before, it's cheesy, but it's cute, and it's just like all the other drawings from this period, like the CareBear, Strawberry Shortcake, Rose Petal and Smurfs movies. All the movies created to sell dolls for children. And this works. :)
