K-PAX is exactly what a heart warming film should be. The story is about a mysterious mental patient Prot, played by Kevin Spacey, and his unbelievable psychiatrist Dr. Powel, played by Jeff Bridges. The two have a very friendly bond, and as their relationship grows, Dr. Powel can not help but wonder if there is more in his mysterious patient, who insists he is from another planet called K-PAX. This movie is very funny, and Kevin Spacey pulls from a well-placed liner as if it were his second nature. K-PAX is a clever film, and I did not expect it to go where it went. In the end, I found myself thinking about the little things in life, and the wonder and magic of daily life that we so often take for granted. I left the theater with a warm feeling inside, and for families and couples on a date, K-PAX is a splendid movie that will not disappoint. I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in anything more than the monotonous launches of brilliant, action-packed festivals.
