Cardiff, Wales. A bunch of 5 comrades are deeply bored in this town. There's the Jip who works in a clothing store. Coop, a laid back DJ. Nina, inseparable from her best friend Lulu and Moff. The week is hell for them and they only wait for one thing: the weekend. At this point, they went out to a nightclub and to the sound of technology without music, they try different drugs, particularly ecstasy. So they usually continue to party for a friend. At the end of this really good time on Sunday, the feelings are as follows: tiredness, melancholy, just the memory of a crazy night ... <br /> <br /> Surfing the wave of the notorious success of "Trainspotting" (1996) , this debut film written and directed by Justin Kerrigan brings and develops a new variation on the notion of hedonism. This means: how to have fun as much as possible knowing that you have a shortened time lapse. In fact, as I wrote earlier, for the 5 main characters in the movie, the week is hell and the weekend is the only time they can break free and have a wild time without the pressure (Jip in a sequence talks about the positive aspects of firing on yourself: you are numb, do not feel any pressure, you are like an astronaut in orbit on the Earth. to take full advantage of a hedonistic weekend. In addition, to spice up the festive atmosphere in which his film bathed, Kerrigan is not afraid to include dream sequences that represent the fantasy or the embarrassment of his characters. , "Human Traffic" (1999) is also served by a particularly lively soundtrack. It allows to file briefly The usual image of popular social classes, British cinema studied a lot. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, when a film (conscientiously or otherwise) explores the fame of another famous, it rarely matches the brilliance of its class. predecessor. "Human Traffic" is in this condition. There is little inventiveness at the level of narrative structure and the introduction of the characters and you can note some useless digressions (Jip who, in the nightclub, goes to the manager's office and tells him a story of dick and bull to allow Moff to join the club , but this is not useful because the latter can arrive without problems). One can also blame Kerrigan for ignoring the dramatic sides that history might have involved. His film can also be read as a transition from euphoria to paranoia and the dramatic connotations of this second pole are not virtually explored. It's a shame! I could have conveyed the following message: even in the happiest moments, there may be something terrible preparing, that can flop them. The same observation can also be said when Coop has a fit of jealousy because Nina approaches a guy. <br /> <br /> It may not be the last great movie of the '90s, as it is said on the cover of the DVD, but "Human Traffic" should be interpreted as a good, incisive little film that conveys the styles and fashions of the end of the twentieth century, a desire to have fun without ulterior motives and problems. An ideal movie to start any party or before going to a club.
