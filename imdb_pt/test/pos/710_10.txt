I love watching Jericho's mile. I mean, watching Peter Strauss run the mile is like watching Usain Bolt Sprint at 100 meters. I think Peter Strauss is an excellent actor and must make another movie running. He is very fast and has a lot of energy and can run a mile in less than 4 minutes and that my friend is amazing. No man alive can run out of rain Murphy I mean the man runs 80 miles a week, no one does that, but him. I have watched the mile of Jericho 100 times and will watch 100 more. Great movies are seen more than movies that are not. Thanks to the creators of this film for having given years there to live. They are great and I bless them all. Thanks for letting me spread my word again, thank you all.
