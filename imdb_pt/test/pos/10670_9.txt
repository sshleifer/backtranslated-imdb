This movie has been my favorite and is intertwined with Christmas holidays for me for two reasons: (1) growing up in the 1960s, everything was related to the advertising space for television shows and even Santa Claus found himself on ships during this period. it was; and (2) I saw this movie during a Christmas shopping trip when I was ten years old and brought good memories of my favorite TV shows when I was even younger ("Supercar", "Fireball XL5" and "Stingray" ) So, I'm a bit biased when it comes to this movie for personal reasons. That being said, as a longtime film student, this is mostly a film for Gerry Anderson fans (and Barry Gray, oh, that marvelous punctuation!), While the casual movie observer will be put off by the vision of the past (digging wild cars, commercial airplanes, clothes, etc.) and so-called "plot twists" however, if you can look after the "2001: A Space Odyssey" desire to make a science fiction movie with a "far away" plot, and if you like imaginative special effects then you will enjoy this jewel of a time when the man had just Nadar on the Moon and people were still staring at the stars in wonder and hope for the future instead of looking down on the banal traps of the present 21st century.
