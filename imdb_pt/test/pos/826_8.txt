Like Steven Seagal, I'm also a big fan of Van Damme and I've followed most of his films since the beginning of his acting career. In this film, Van Damme takes on the role of Jack Robideaux, who is a cop who has just moved to New Mexico from New Orleans to work as part of the Border Patrol. Haunted by memories of his past, it is up to Jack to wipe out a group of former Navy Seals from smuggling illegal drugs into the United States that killed his daughter. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found this movie to be very good, Van Damme has been in very good shape for 48 years and can really move. The action scenes are very intense and the movie even plays a couple of twists to make you guess. Unfortunately, Van Damme did not have the same intensity as 10 years ago, regardless of The Shepherd: Border Control being the third solid movie that Van Damme did possibly opening the door to a larger project. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to a fan of Van Damme or fan of action movies in general; The Shepherd: Border Control is a great movie, not as good as Until Death, but better than Hard Corps. Make sure you try this, you will not be disappointed.
