I just saw Mar Ardentro and felt I had to comment on this movie. Euthanasia is a difficult subject in any field and unfortunately can sometimes distort the true value of a movie. Many people loved the excellent cast and its beautiful pictures / cameras. Certainly Javier Bardem is an actor who brings something extra to every movie he does. To say that it encompasses the real Sampredo is a little silly, since I do not think any of the reviewers have known Sampredo personally. Standing still and using a certain charm is an acting skill that, while well executed, does not constitute a "perfect" performance. Bardem only does what he does well ... and that's it. The work of the camera is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the film itself does not present. Sampredo here is shown as a man who bows so hard to die that he leaves his loving family behind and marries a woman he seeks only when the other does not help him in his quest for a worthy death. Now I am not here to say anything about the right for or against euthanasia. The problem is that by commenting on movies like this, you can hardly escape. The subject of the film is so strong that you are almost compelled to discuss the film in this strong subject. I think it's a weakness for the movie - not intentionally - portraying Sampredo as a non-asynthetic character. Someone who is much smarter than his family as portrayed in the simple cousin who does not "catch" the double layered poem addressed to him. Someone who will leave a loving and caring family because he thinks his life is unworthy. A scene that is juxtaposed with the lawyer who, according to the film, makes the "wrong" choice end in a state of distant dementia, thus indicating that the choice of Sampredo was correct. The woman who constantly seeks him is almost disregarded by the beautiful lawyer, but is suddenly married to Sampredo when she agrees to help him to die. These choices make Sampredo a calculated figure, no matter how charming Bardem represents him. Argumentative I would say that it is not totally convincing and I kind of think that Amenabar did not intend to add this element unbalanced in his film. For a young director, it is still an impressive film and certainly has its strong moments (the discussion between the priest and Sampredo, for example). The work of the camera is impressive and the film is well represented. But 10 out of 10 ... not the movie does not achieve that excellence.
