Five teenagers started doing some camping in the Oregon desert, and despite being warned by the park's guard, they soon realized something was hidden in the backlands waiting to strike. <br /> <br /> When it comes to old horror movies, the only one that keeps popping up in all the conversations is Friday the 13th, so I decided to find those good old horror movies that were simply compared to Friday, Fair 13, JUST BEFORE DAWN. being among the ones I met, and it was really very impressive, it was not as bland as some of the things you find today, it was very strong in terms of character development, since it had a few short ones, and it has this very casual rhythm , it's not in a hurry to get to the hack and slash bits, it takes your time to set the mood and tone and it's very atmospheric and builds some suspense killer, allowing you to always have that feeling of fear like, somethings out there but you do not know where it is or when it will be trike. <br /> <br /> Where I live, it's definitely a neglected gem simply because people have never heard of it or will not give it a go, but I'll say it's not a Friday. the two concepts do not even come close, but in my opinion, it's usually one of the most impressive slashers I've seen in a while.
