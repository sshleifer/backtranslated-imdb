SPOILER WARNING <br /> <br /> I got this dino documentary on DVD for Christmas 2004. I was looking forward to it and was not disappointed. The score is memorable (my favorites were the theme song "Sauropod" and the song "Winters Coming"). The effects were stunning, you could almost believe they were there. You really learn something too; Stegosaurs may have been able to pump their plaques with blood. The T-Rexes MIGHT women made a killing before laying their eggs. I know there are many people who think that this is very much based on speculation, but there will always be questions we can only guess. And there is also a lot of unconditional and undeniable FACT. We know that some dinosaurs traveled in herds, we know that the Diplodocus swallowed stones to crush vegetation in their stomachs. Despite this "speculation", the series did extremely well. So well, in fact, that it generated an accompaniment, a prequel and several specials. If you are a dinosaur fan then this is for you. It makes Jurassic Park look small and full of weeds.
