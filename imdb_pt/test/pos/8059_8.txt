After World War II, the crime in progress in Phenix City, Alabama, fueled by money from an army base across the river in Georgia, got worse. Gambling, prostitution, moneylending, and the like helped an organized crime apparatus in the city. Soon it was very bad and violent until tolerating more. This movie is based on the real story of this fight. <br /> <br /> By the 1950s standards, it was shockingly explicit. Although low budget, this same budget helped with the realism that required filming on the spot. A very violent movie. Richard Kiley was wonderful as always, and John McIntire was impassive. <br /> <br /> Why this good movie is not on video is a real puzzle!
