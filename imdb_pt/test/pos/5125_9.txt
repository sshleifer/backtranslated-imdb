The story is incredible, it starts with a new kid in town named Roy, while on the school bus he notices a kid running without shoes, and the same day he breaks the nose of big bullies who are trying to fight him. . Roy soon discovers that the boy is a fugitive, and he and his sister are trying to disrupt the sight of a building that can kill all the beautiful owls that live there. Roy decides to help them fight there, they can win this fight before the clever and clumsy cop Dave Delinko (Luke Wilson) stumbles on them. A nice, fun and adventurous film. I admire Luke Wilson for taking on that role. I do not think his brother Owen would take that role.
