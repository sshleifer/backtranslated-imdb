This is a low budget, well acted little gem. Alice, a small teenage town in Massachusetts, tired of her existence, takes the road to escape from her mother who turns burgers and her own job as a checkout in a super market. She goes out to Florida and to stay with her richest college friend who is a freshman in Miami. After her car suspiciously breaks the freeway and she loses all her money, she ends up with a retired couple in a trailer that also travels to Florida. The couple, brilliantly played by Judith Ivy and Bill Raymond, are overly hospitable. and, it seems, a prostitute and her pimp. Slowly, Alice is drawn into the prostitution of trucks, while the caravan snakes down the road in the general direction of Florida. Through intermittent flashbacks, we learned a little more about Alice and her desire to leave the tiny Milford. We also see the couple in a new light and their lives and the choices made by the couple and Alice seem quite reliable. An excellent and well-made film about which you'll think about when you're done.
