I really like this particular production of "The Mikado". Producers have added a few taps to make it more entertaining for the modern audience - for example, "Some Day It May Happen" is completely up to date, and some lines are improvised throughout the album. Touch. Freedoms were also taken with the scenery. The costumes are not Japanese, but the English of the 1920s (although some of the "tittipudlianas" girls wear kimonos inspired by the 1920s). This production is well choreographed with some dance styles of the 1920s, and there are some extra dancers and messengers to keep their eyes (as well as ears) entertained during the songs. If you are a purist Gilbert & Sullivan, these changes may bother you, but I think they are fine - and I love the costumes! <br /> <br /> Felicity Palmer (Katisha) is absolutely hilarious; all her scenes make me laugh out loud (one of my favorite add-ons is when she first makes an entrance - the dance boots annoy her with her antics, so she screams at the top of her voice, "STOP !! "). All the other main characters do a good job too. I particularly like Mark Richardson as Pish-Tush (that wig!) And Lesley Garrett as Yum-Yum. <br /> <br /> You should keep in mind that this is a stage production being filmed and set your expectations accordingly. There is no configuration change, although the filmmakers used some 1930s film techniques to add interest. If there is a downside to this production, it is that the stage makeup was not modified for close-up photos with a camera. The foundation lines are usually visible and there seems to be an excess of eyeliner, lipstick and blush everywhere. I've seen this kind of thing happen before with plays, and it's kind of shocking at first. However, I hope you get used to it and enjoy "The Mikado" for what it's worth - a completely nice interpretation of a classic!
