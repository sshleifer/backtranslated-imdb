Wow, this movie is incredible. It's a great movie. There are some sick scenes (not as sick as Terror Firmer or Citizen Toxie) some nudity, and this was the debut of the penis on film! This set the stage for many of Troma's films, this is a very three-dimensional film. Mixing comedy, romance and my favorite, HORROR / GORE! Not much gore in this movie, but enough to satisfy. This is the best adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Much better than any other version. They are so fun and fun to watch. And we have Debbie Rochon ... hehe ... I like her. :) All I have to say is that this is a great movie, very funny, and Lemmy is a good host for it. The performance is good, and Kaufman runs elegantly as always. Must see for all TROMA fans!
