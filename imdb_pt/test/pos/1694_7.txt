In Landscape after the Battle, Andrzej Wajda in the second era of his film career, portrays the emotional and psychological confusion in a former Nazi prison in Poland, released immediately after World War II. <br /> <br /> A handheld camera explores many extreme close-ups and vivid colors. The final credit as graphite on the flanks of train cars symbolically concludes the film. The soundtrack is great except Vivaldi, who sounds tacky in pop-art fashion, following opening.
