Good movie, great story, great characters, I really enjoyed it, enough to buy the DVD when it came out. <br /> <br /> The real-life story she's meant to tell is more fascinating and captivating than anything creationists could come up with. My friend who is in the media business said he should not show insider trading like this, that gives the company a bad name. As if. <br /> <br /> However, there are some problems with the DVD: First, the volume of the sound is very low, so you need to increase the volume of the TV to watch it. I realize that's how it is when HBO executes it on the original production copy. Second, during the first five minutes, the left side of the video is cut, ie the image is cut about 2.5 cm from the left side. After five minutes, it fills the screen correctly, from left to right. Sloppy technical production like this is very amateurish and I do not know why the director and the producer let this slack pass. <br /> <br /> Even so, even with technical flaws, it's a nice story, one of the best on HBO. I think.
