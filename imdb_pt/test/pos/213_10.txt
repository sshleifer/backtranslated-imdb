Two years after the success of Airplane, Jim Abrahams and Jerry & David Zucker created this brilliant sitcom starring the great Leslie Nielsen as the common-clothing detective 'Frank Drebin'. Also in the cast were Alan North as 'Captain Ed Hocken', Ed Williams as 'Ted Olsen' and William Duell as 'Johnny The Shoe Shine Boy'. "Police Squad!" he had funny jokes and intelligent visual jokes playing in the background. Each episode would end with a false freeze frame in which the characters in the frame are completely immobile. One of the best 'freeze' sequences saw one of the characters pouring coffee into a glass while standing still, causing the glass to overflow! Guest stars were killed in the opening titles, one of which included Georg Stanford Brown being crushed by a safe fall! Despite winning positive reviews and very critical acclaim, "Squad!" lasted only six episodes before being canceled. That did not mean the end, however, five years later, the show was transferred to the big screen for the first of the trilogy of the films "Naked Gun".
