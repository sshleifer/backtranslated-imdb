The Curse of the Island of the Apes. Released exactly six years after the success of Monkey Island 2. You could think with the strange ending of Monkey Island 2 that would end Monkey Island once and for all. But, all turned out to be a trick to lure Guybrush into captivity. But enough about that, the whole story of it is that Monkey Island has returned, and the voices are just phenomenal. If LucasArts made a movie / cartoon of Monkey Island, it would probably be that way and it would seem. It's plot is very good, and all about it is just fantastic. If you have not heard of the Monkey Island series yet, buy Monkey Island Archives or Monkey Island Booty Pack and play all games starting with The Secret of Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2 and The Curse of Monkey Island. The Monkey Island 4 was very good, but this is one of the best.
