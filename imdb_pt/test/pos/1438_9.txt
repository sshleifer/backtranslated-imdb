Great book, great movie, great soundtrack. Frank Sinatra shows in this movie that when he wanted to put the effort, he could act. The ending is a little weird, but for the time it is understandable that the studio wanted a happy ending. The graphical nature of heroin addiction (innovative for the period) is an advantage. Add the great soundtrack and you'll have one of the best American movies.
