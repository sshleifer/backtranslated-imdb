"The Phenix City Story" is a brutal and forceful docudrama about what has been dubbed "America's most perverse city." The film documents the events leading up to the assassination of the Phenix City crime syndicate of Albert Patterson, an Alabama lawyer who made a proposal to the state attorney general's office as a way to clean up the addiction and corruption that plagues his hometown . His son, John Patterson, took his father's cloak after his death and won the position, making Phenix City's cleanliness a prime item on his agenda. <br /> <br /> Director Phil Karlson has created a movie that has the capacity to shock to this day. The severity is so relentless that the film is really hard to watch. We see the crime syndicate beat and kill to get what they want - beatings and murders include women and children, and a particular scene, which revolves around the death of a little black girl, is especially disturbing. It's not exactly a nice movie, because there's very little payback at the end to reward the viewer for going through the irritating events that led to it, but it's a well-made movie filled with intense, angry energy. A 15-minute prologue includes a series of interviews with the actual inhabitants of Phenix City, some of whom are portrayed by actors in the fictional part of the film. This gives the film a quality of urgency that transits into the narrative, so we feel like we're watching a documentary all the time, a feeling that was helped by Karlson's choice of filming on actual locations. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to have seen this movie, but it's one of those movies that fill you with a feeling of outrage and then make you feel helpless because you can not do anything about it. <br /> <br />: A
