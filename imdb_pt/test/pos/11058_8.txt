This was my first Gaspar Noe movie that I watched and I have to say I was shocked. I do not care about blood in general, but that's not even bloody, it's a real slaughter. For some of you, some scenes may be impossible to see and I mean really disgusting. Leaving these aspects aside, the main ideas revealed here and the dialogue are quite brilliant. When you are given a strong argument against bringing a new life to the world and the way in which it is given, you can not stop and take a minute to think about it. The actors did their job well, representing general masks of a toothpick few people found deep in a sick society. The movie is full of metaphors, but I'll let you figure it out. Do not watch if you want to have a light and relaxing time. I recommend this movie to all those who want something to think about or simply watch something different from what you find in your average movie.
