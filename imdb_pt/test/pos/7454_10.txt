"Duckman" is a great show. I first saw it when I was 10 at the time and after school I ran home and called Comedy Central. I saw a cartoon called "Duckman" and I loved it! It's such a funny and cool show. It is created by Klasky-Csupo, who are great cartoon creators. They animated some of my favorite shows, such as "The Simpsons" and "Rugrats." <br /> <br /> I've seen many episodes of this show and I think they're all very funny and sweet. The voice actors did a great job expressing the characters as well. <br /> <br /> I wish Comedy Central could bring this show back, along with "The Critic" and "Dilbert." <br /> <br /> But this is a great show from Comedy Central. Great work, Klasky-Csupo!
