I saw the movie for the first time a few years ago and was totally and utterly impressed, but its sensuality. It's one of the most moving movies I've ever seen, though it may seem a bit pretentious and artificial - just too beautiful, if you like. Anyway, one thing is for sure - the cameraman did a great job - each image deserves to be cut from the film and displayed as a separate art peace, comparable to the paintings of Chirico or Bernard Buffet. <br /> <br /> Music forms a perfect background for the story, especially that of U2, played between the first and second novels on the beach scene. As for the casting - I can not be objective, since I really like Sophie Marceau and Jean Renaue and I can not add more to the praise of others. <br /> <br /> However, the very fact that many people (critics and those sophisticated in the movies) criticized the film made me watch it with a more critical eye for the second time. Without a doubt, the scenery is splendid and the cast is beautiful. But that is not enough to make a film comprehensive and cohesive. The second novel (when Sophie Marceau tells her story to Malcovic is somewhat superficial and does not talk much about the motivations of the people involved - was it just about filming a beautiful and sensual love scene with the naked Marceau or what?). Apparently this adds nothing to the idea of ​​the film and even Malcovic's hoarse voice is being unable to link it to the main plot. <br /> <br /> Other stories are more justified and are actually beautifully filmed, which satisfies many of the logical fallacies within them. The scene in which Jean Reneau is looking at the city through the huge window of his apartment at the top of the building is absolutely incredible. The feeling of damp air and fine mist, which is being spread by the first scene of "Ferrera", can literally be felt through the screen. Without a doubt, Antonioni is a great master of shadows and semi-shadows. My favorite romance is the latter - the most romantic, deep and meaningful - I think is the closest thing to Antonioni in the entire film - almost a parable. Probably the overall positive impression of the film is mainly due to the last shot somewhere in a small Italian town Ghotic with its narrow winding streets and crooked sidewalks, fountains with the cathedrals of l'eau potable and monumental ... It was laconic but really moving. <br /> <br /> I hope my impressions and comments about the film, however chaotic, would motivate someone to spend a night watching (works best with the home theater, having someone caring for you, movie theater). Enjoy. <br /> <br /> I apologize for imperfect English and possible misspellings.
