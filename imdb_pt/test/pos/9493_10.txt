I just re-watched a few episodes of this series on very bad VHS tapes that I recorded in the series. I'm glad I did, though. <br /> <br /> Ramona is based on the children's books of Beverly Cleary and follows the adventures of the eight-year-old title (Sarah Polley). She has fun with friends and family and gets into trouble like many eight-year-olds. All ten episodes are very good. "Mystery Meal" I kind of like vegan, but it's funny to see parents trying to get their kids to eat the cow's tongue! And any episode that mentions Godzilla vs. The Smog Monster twice can not be all bad. I like Ramona's "Bad Day" more. While it is disheartening to see Ramona going through a difficult day, she imagines revenge on her friend (a pre-Psi factor, Barclay Hope), who always plays with her. "The Perfect Day" is also good. <br /> <br /> Lori Chodos plays Beezus, Ramona's sister. I swear I saw it on something else, but the IMDb does not list anything other than this show. Unfortunately, this series is not on DVD. Why is every low-quality show being done on DVD, except something I'd really like to buy? An injustice if ever there was one!
