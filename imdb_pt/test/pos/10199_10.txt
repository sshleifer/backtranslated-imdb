Rising to power in 1933, Hitler and his "National Socialist Party of German Workers," which of course we all know as Nazis, increased control over the country more and more over time. At the beginning of their trampling on the German people, they called all the artists, journalists and filmmakers to Nazi headquarters, so that they could be informed about the newly declared "Third Reich" (also known as "Empire"). ) expected of them. <br /> <br /> WHEN the Master Director of the Age of Impressionist and Expressionist Silence of German Cinema, Mr. Fritz Lang, was called to meet Herr Goebels; he listened intently and said nothing. Immediately after leaving the office of the Minister of Propaganda, Herr Lang went directly to the train station and picked up a passenger directly to Paris. Not even returning to his home, Fritz Lang did not return to Germany (at least not until many years later.) He remained in France, eventually immigrating to the United States of America. to work in the United States, creating a variety of films that were more enjoyable, solid, and substantially literate for many years.In this list of titles is the subject of today, WESTERN UNION (20th Century Fox, 1941) TYPICALLY a film about the Old West and the Pioneer Days needed both quality and quantity cast.Western UNION has qualified on both requirements.We are treated with a wide variety of starry talents as well as a supporting cast which makes every minute and every scene a delight to our senses. Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger, and Virginia Gilmore perform, others prominent as John Carradine (who does not play a vampire or another scary guy, but a doctor), Geor Summerville "Slim" (veteran veteran actor, veteran of Silent Film and graduate of Mack Sennett's Keystone Comedies), Chill Wills (always former vocalist and guitarist for "The Avalon Boys" ) and the burly bandit Barton MacLane. In addition to this mix, we have names like Russell Hicks, Victor Killian, Minor Watson, George Chandler, Addison Richards, Irving Bacon, James Flavin, Francis Ford, Frank McGrath and Ken Maynard's brother Kermit Maynard. <br /> <br /> PROMINENTS in those American Indians featured are: Chief Big Tree, Chief Thundercloud and Mr. Jay Silverheels. It is also noteworthy that a great representative of the Aboriginal Peoples of North America is that great, uniquely impressive and memorable example of the Red Man, Louisiana native Iron Eyes Cody (born Esperanza DeCorti of Sicilian immigrant parents). <br /> <br /> Filming the beautiful outdoor scenes were done on locations in Arizona and Utah and rendered to the highest degree of Technigolour available. (There is no Monument Valley, but this is the Province of Mr. John Ford.) In some ways, this film is a far more amazing accomplishment than we might think; because it took a sort of magazine report, adapted to the tastes and idiomatic expressions of prewar America in the late thirties and early forties. All this being done by a German-born director who was only in Hollywood and the United States for the shortest period of time. <br /> <br /> In his final analysis, WESTERN UNION, although it may not be the most historically accurate example of the Western genre; we just do not care. It is punctuated in all the categories necessary for a great night at the movies! So who really cares about small details like "precision"? <br /> <br /> We give Mr. Lang and 20th Century Fox a rating of ****! <br /> <br /> NOTE: We have just seen a special on the PBS WTTW station, here in Chicago it was all about all the filmmakers, directors, and other artisans to whom the Nazi rise to power took refuge in America and Hollywood. (It seems that Movie Folks and Scientists was the biggest export to Germany at this particular time, and the scientists who built the atomic bomb, as well as the future personal NASA, came from Europe at the moment. > POODLE SCHNITZ !!
