I avoided seeing this movie for a while, but I finally got a copy.

Leave some of the songs (The Bed, My Conviction, Frank Mills) and other cuts (Walking in Space). However, what is left is presented very well. All the singers and dancers are excellent, and the main actors (especially Treat Williams like Berger, Beverley D'Angelo as Sheila, John Savage as Claude) are memorable. Like a party and hippie anthem, "Hair can keep itself potent even in a movie made ten years too late. It was no longer the era of peace, love and Biba, but the punk rock era ... although watching this movie now, at the time of Iraqi problems, reversed the Vietnam issues of the 1960s. Milos Forman , who also did 'Amadeus', did a good job in directing. In its scope and I feel it reminds me of 'Jesus Christ Superstar' by Norman Jewison, especially with the joy of the scene 'Aquarius' and the intimacy of 'Easy To Be Hard'. <br /> <br /> I really liked that movie and consider it a good representation of a musical born of the first era truly hedonistic.
