The 1970s saw a rise and fall of what we know as "Blacksploitation" Films. The term is a reference to a broad catch-all type, rather than a true genre of film. In short, any comedy, drama, adventure, police or western or urban thieves that are so constructed and shaped as to attract the large urban black population of the mid-twentieth century. This, in fact, could cover the broader type of films, provided that the trend was for the black population of the city center. <br /> <br /> It seems that the idea of ​​producing these films of special interest for black Americans their genesis with the Easter Launch of 100 RIFLES (Marvin Schwartz Prod. 20th Century Fox, 1969). In it, former All-American Syracuse University football player and Cleveland Browns All-Pro Fullback All-Pro Fullback Jim Brown made a Co-Starring Billing. Having appeared in a number of films already, such as RIO CONCHOS (1964), THE DIRTY DOZEN (1967), ICE STTION ZEBRA (1968), and others, it was beginning to make more sense for the studios "That Jim was a property <br /> <br /> Now, this number of 100 RIFLES brings a record number of black clients to the central districts of major cities on Easter Sunday to see Brown. <br /> <br /> Why not start filming more? adventure, and other types of films with more Black Players and Stars? Why not, in fact. ** So we saw a succession of Cops & Robbers, Bad-ass Private Detective Films, Comedies, all following the way. (1974), The TAKE (1974), CONRACK (1974), and finally CLAUDINE (1974). CLAUDINE, we did not find stigma nor easy classification as "Blackploitation", since that history is universal, and could easily have been made as a story about people from a ny descent, anywhere, not just in the 1970s USA. <br /> <br /> That story was made from a single mother, Claudine (Dianne Carroll), struggling to keep a family together after "... two marriages and two almost marriages.", is far from a Harlem style shoot-em-up. The problems that plague the ordinary citizens of our nation are confronted and examined under the sociological microscope. <br /> <br /> But we also consider Claudine's physical and psychological needs as a woman. For "The woman needs the man and the man to have her brother-in-law" *** and we admit that point. (That's the sex we're talking about, Schultz!) Claudine meets up with a very masculine, broad-shouldered guy, Athletic in Private Scavanger Garbage Man, Ruppert B. Marshall (James Earl Jones) and they go on a date. The Great Welfare State intervenes with the couple as Claudine's welfare worker, Miss Tayback (Elisa Loti), snooping around to see who this loose man is, who suddenly pays so much attention to Claudine's family. After a humiliating experience with the Welfare Department's audit and the "deduction" of drinking, which would be the norm for the family, the two decide to marry with or without the blessing of Big Brother. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Claudine's eldest son got involved with some great conversations, but little doing the Black Activist group. But, with the help of Ruppert, he and all of them go through it A.O.K. <br /> <br /> This ends on a happy, upbeat and hopeful note. We know it may not be exactly "... Happily Ever After!", But what will do it all together! If there is a single criticism we must state is that sometimes in a movie like this, a misconception spreads to a large proportion of urban blacks. And this is the apparent implicit myth that all Whites are rich, having none of their kind in need of help, no work, or any deficiency. <br /> <br /> Well, guys, it's just not true! NOTE: At one point, Jim Brown's career was a real success as a sturdy actioner. He was even being styled as "... the Black John Wayne." NOTE: ** The idea of ​​producing films with All-Black Casts, filmed for All-Black consumption was not a new idea. In the 1920's, 40's and 40's, we saw productions from people like Noble Johnson, Spencer Williams Jr. and Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> NOTE: *** That's "As Time Goes By," you know, Schultz, it's from CASABLANCA (Warner Brothers, 1942).
