I liked that for a couple of reasons. The emotional tangle was sometimes confused and imperfectly resolved, but the mixing of news images with the film's narrative was often compelling. The other element I appreciated was the depiction of the Werewolves, the fanatic Nazis who continued the struggle after the formal surrender. I do not know of another movie that deals with them. They murdered the burgomaster Oppenhoff of Aachen on Palm Sunday, 1945, for example, and created problems for the occupation. The film then defies the sanitized version of victory and occupation with some brave realities. "Human issues" are presented not so much through the characters here, but through the historical reality that was holding those who had survived Hitler - both conquered and overcomers.
