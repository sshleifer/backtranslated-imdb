Harry Langdon's "Saturday Afternoon," is often ranked among the biggest silent comedies, at least for short subjects and therefore may be a little disappointing for some. Unlike some of the other well-known classics, such as Keaton's "Cops," or Chaplin's "The Immigrant," this film is in some ways a familiar, conventional comedy, and does not offer much in terms of laughs; one might even wonder if Langdon belongs to such a rare company. However, in my opinion, it's a perfectly charming comedy in its understated form, and Harry is fascinating to watch. For a modern viewer created on TV sitcoms, the plot of "Saturday Afternoon" may suggest Newlyweds or their many children: two depressed boys, one of whom is married and is under the thumbs of his wife, try to run away with a couple of nice girls for a fun afternoon; but everything goes wrong, and they end up having to fight the girls' tough boyfriends. Does this sound familiar? And maybe a little sad? Well, the premise was already worn out when this movie was made, but in addition, nothing about Langdon was typical. He was strange, starting with the fact that he looked like a middle-aged baby who was half asleep. Any Freudian who picks up "Saturday Afternoon" will have a picnic with the scenes between this shy baby with a squat face and his stern, gently domineering wife. When Harry tries to hide money under the rug, but she catches him in the act and forces him to surrender it, you can swear he's witnessing an interaction between a 6-year-old boy and his mother. . . and maybe that's why Harry Langdon made some people shiver, and still does. <br /> <br /> But he's a compelling figure on the screen, and it's not what he does as much as the way he does it. In that scene, with the coins under the rug, for example, Harry finds the coins placing one foot before the other, carefully, like a tightrope walker, counting his steps until he finds the right place, and his technique is hypnotic. Langdon moved like nobody else. Whether he makes you laugh or not, the guy is mesmerizing, seemingly in a world of his own. Where the plot of his films is related, Harry is curiously passive, and almost never takes the story further. At the end of Saturday Afternoon, when the big fight is taking place, Harry star Vernon Dent is in the middle of the action, but Harry is stunned for most of the time, and ends up punching. drunk between two cars (sitting on the stirrup of one of them, but with their feet in the other) as they race through the streets. It is a memorable image and, as the critic Walter Kerr wrote, she encapsulates the persona of Langdon's canvas perfectly: he is a passive figure who somehow finds himself in the middle of a frenzied action, blinking sleepily as the world runs by. It is also worth noting that Langdon and Dent, who have worked together frequently, have a relationship in this film that suggests a plan that Laurel and Hardy would follow when they joined for a year later. Langdon's style was probably an influence on Stan Laurel, especially here. <br /> <br /> "Saturday Afternnon" and its star may not be for everyone, but the film is well worth it, and you may find that Langdon makes an impression that is hard to shake.
