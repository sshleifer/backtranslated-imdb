In KPAX Softley, brushes in the subtleties of Eastern religious customs, from the small archetypes built into the whole film to the real goal of Prot. Spacey (Prot) plays a predominantly didactic role throughout the film - it's as if the statements he makes incorporate general truths about a culture of peace that is strongly enacted in Buddhism and Hinduism. One can say that Prot is the eye of the storm - the world is in disarray and is "bright" and the false veil of reality is what everyone sees, but Prot sees the truth - he sees the minute - and appreciates it and in some points they fear it as it transcends its social construction of reality and becomes more humanly. <br /> <br /> The film is particularly detailed, so I recommend you see it at least twice to see how Softley interprets nuances. Listen carefully to the narratives at the beginning and the end, for they really touch upon concepts that are not commonly presented in Western philosophies. <br /> <br /> 9 rating out - Excellent - with nominal space for improvement.
