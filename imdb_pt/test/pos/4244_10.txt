"Bride of Chucky" is one of the best horror movies that has come out in the last ten years and could be one of the best horror films of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** Chucky's girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) manages to find her remains after being sucked by the fan at the end of part 3 and bring him to life in her trailer. Her neighbor, Jessie (Nick Stabile) and her girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) are being plagued by their uncle. (John Ritter) Tiffany disturbs Chucky when he refuses to marry her, so she buys a doll for him to play with. Chucky kills Tiffany and then transfers her soul to the doll she picked up. For them to be put back into human bodies, they have to travel to New Jersey to retrieve an amulet to do so. Jessie sees this as an opportunity to escape from Ritter, and they set out for the journey, but not before Ritter is killed by Chucky and Tiffany. Along the way, several bizarre incidents force them to stop at bed and breakfast. When several people die, they call their best friend (Gordon Woolvett) to straighten the situation. They convince him not one of them is the killer, as the police began to solve the crimes. He finds Ritter's body in a chest in the back of the van. Thinking that he was created, he confronts them about it. Chucky and Tiffany then become real to prove they did this, which leaves Woolvett dead. The group steals a trailer and arrives at the cemetery. Jessie and Jade make Chucky and Tiffany turn to each other, giving them enough to escape. Chucky recaptures Jade and forces her to pick up his amulet. Chucky and Tiffany restart their rivalry, which gives Jessie and Jade enough time to kill both while the police arrive and get rid of the crimes. <br /> <br /> The Good News: I have to give as much props to the FX department as Chucky and Tiffany as dolls seem completely convincing. The scenes with them combined are the highlights of the film, including a hilarious conversation where Tiffany advises Chucky about how serial killers in the 90's work. That said, the amount of one-liners in this movie that are really funny is incredible. Chucky makes the most of it, but Tiffany also wears some gems. In fact, it's funnier than Hollywood calls comedies these days. The blood is plentiful and shockingly realistic. Several deaths in this movie are truly original and creative. Turning Ritter into a new form of Pinhead was a totally brilliant scene. The couple on their honeymoon was also a good death scene. For teenage love, the pairing of Stabile and Heigl works very well. They have great chemistry together and really behave like a normal couple. I also have to admit that the first time I saw this movie, I jumped into certain scenes, and it shows the incredible work that director Yu did. He learned enough, apparently, to do the same thing with "Freddy vs. Jason". He knows how to organize set-ups and rewards, and here he shows some great skills that have a look and style influenced by Hong Kong. He could be the next great director of horror if he keeps filling his resume with movies like these two. Nice soundtrack, too, like "Freddy vs. Jason". <br /> <br /> The bad news: For fans of cheese movies, this will be a great find. However, this movie has a high cheese factor that can prevent serious fans of horror movies from having fun with this movie. The film knows it's a rough movie and has fun in it, making it a serious fan to be turned off because of things like the one-liners. It's not that bad of a movie, but it has to be seen in the mind that it's a kitschy movie, and that the tackiness of certain scenes adds to the film, not to get it off. Get out of that frame of mind and you can have fun in this movie. <br /> <br /> The Final Verdict: Film fans and the other "Child's Play" movies are going to love this movie. For serious horror fans, take a look at this, but remember that it's not a serious movie and that the fight should be there and you might find yourself liking it. <br /> <br /> Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity on a Doll, a dark puppet sex scene, some drug use, and countless drug references.
