I have to say that this is my favorite movie of all time. I've seen it well over 100 times (actually had to buy a new copy as a result of observation) It's how the eighties were and what a romantic story with some moral principles. I recommend everyone who wants to relive the past. secondary schools again. Buy a copy now is a classic !!!!
