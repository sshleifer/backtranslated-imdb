Aaliyah takes all the women out of the water cast, including official love interest Marguerite Moreau. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this movie being the power trip of Akasha. Aaliyah is simply electrifying whenever she's on the screen. She makes you sensual, beautiful, and menacing at power of 10. Watching her take a full bar of vampires is a sight to behold. <br /> <br /> Lena Olin is cast in the ungrateful role of the "older woman." , which is extremely unjustified. She looks fantastic and at age 46 (according to IMDb) still looks impressive. <br /> <br /> The story is unfortunately very limited in terms of plot, we've seen it before, etc. <br /> <br /> The most painful is the scene of Akasha's death, especially bearing in mind what happened to Aaliyah after the filming. <br /> <br /> All in all, a remarkable vampire movie.
