This is a romantic movie, though tacky, which is one of my all time favorites. It is one of many CLASSICS of the 80's genre like "Pretty in Pink" or "Some kind of Wonderful". Nic plays traditional punk in love with the traditional valley, Julie. It's a comforting love story that makes you hope that he wins the girl in the end. <br /> <br /> True, most of the acting sucks, but ... <br /> <br /> I've been in love with Nic since seeing it in theaters and have seen almost every movie in which he has been since. He really grew up as an actor, but it's obvious in this initial movie that he had a lot of potential. <br /> <br /> If you love the movies of the 80's, you'll love this classic. <br /> <br /> / It will rent you !!!!!
