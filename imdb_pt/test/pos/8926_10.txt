I read comments maliciously hidden in previous comments stating that this movie featured a bunch of gays playing around because of their homosexuality. <br /> <br /> That could not be more misleading. "Eighteen" is not a gay movie. He has only three gay characters and one of them is a victim of the prejudice of people like the one who wrote the comments, despite his confession of justice. <br /> <br /> Pip's grandfather was not gay. The soldier's tender scene and his sergeant are male bond at the crucial moment of death. But some people are shocked by a kiss and a welcome scene coming out of the man killed by a bomb. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is the direct relationship of Pip and that sweet girl and the face of them social obligation and parenting. <br /> <br /> Ralph Rewes www.r1313.info
