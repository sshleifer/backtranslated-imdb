After watching this DVD, I was shocked. It's so wonderful. Not only does it capture Led Zeppelin during convent presentations, but also a few years. It only shows the growth of the band and the growth of their great music. This DVD is a must have! The DVD is over 5 hours long, with extras. The extras are also great pieces, some are from the band playing in Denmark, and other various promotional spots. This contains images that were previously considered lost, happily recovered, and carefully restored to 5.1 Dolby Digital, under the direct supervision of Jimmy Page himself! Includes many timeless classics, such as, Stairway To Heaven, going to California, what is and what should never be, Moby Dick and many more. Great acoustic songs are also included. This will correct any prediction that Jimmy Page is not a guitar legend!
