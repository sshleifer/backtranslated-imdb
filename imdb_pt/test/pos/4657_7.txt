I had completely forgotten Midnight Madness so far when I found it while navigating IMDB. Now it's all coming back to me ... It was one of Naughton's first films (as well as Fox's) and insightful connoisseurs will also choose Kaplan (Henry, from the TV series "Alice"). ), Fiedler (he makes the voice of Piglet in the cartoons of "Winnie the Pooh") and Blocker (Dan's son "Hoss" Blocker of Bonanza TV). <br /> <br /> But the two that stand out in my mind are Furst (from "Animal House") and the superdude itself - Eddie Deezen. Furst plays a villain this time and has one of the best scenes when he asks his father, "Why can not you just accept me as I am?" His father looks at his sloppy, obese picture and gives a simple, one-word answer - "Eww!" <br /> <br /> And Deezen ... well, he's a spectacle unto himself. Like Jerry Lewis in the last few days, he stumbles around, runs through miniature ponds, puts melon halves in his ears and ends up having Maggie Roswell fallen for him. My hero. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it is typical of the stupidity of the early 1980s with college kids staying after curfew and going on a hunt across the city to prove which student division is the best at campus. : the athletes, the nerds, the rich children, the feminists or the group formed by a little of each one. <br /> <br /> Who wins? Who cares, you'll have fun watching the first Disney Pictures incursion into PG territory before creating Touchstone Pictures. <br /> <br /> Seven stars. Grab "Midnight Madness" any way you can! <br /> <br /> Viva Leon!
