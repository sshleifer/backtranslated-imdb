I like the Breillat movies, but this is the best I've ever seen to balance animal heat with sexual intelligence. Anne Parillaud is electrifying, and the script is incredible - especially considering it should happen on the set of another of Breillat's films. You do not have to agree with her about everything to make the most of it. It made me think a lot about vulnerability and power. Try to imagine a man director with Jeanne's opening - not impossible, but a bit mind-boggling. The unheralded sexual currents that are always present when humans gather to do anything are held here, but not a cold light.
