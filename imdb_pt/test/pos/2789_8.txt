L'Auberge Espagnole is full of energy and is honest, realistic and refreshing. It's not a comedy or a drama, but it's a slice of the life movie about this particular group of very interesting but still normal young people who share an apartment in Barcelona for a year. Beautifully photographed with a good soundtrack. If you are older, this movie should bring back a flood of good memories. If you are young, learn from this example.
