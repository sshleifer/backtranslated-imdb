Chop Shop, Ramin Bahrani's second feature, is a rare breed. It is an American film that tells a story that is not usually found in American cinema, the story of a minority living in poverty. It's a simple beauty job. Filmed in Queens, New York, in the shadows of Shea Stadium, the Chop Shop is neo-realism. Featuring a cast of non-actors, he has more in common with the classic Bicycle Thieves than Vittorio De Sica than anything done in the United States. There is no punctuation or soundtrack, all songs and sounds are diagonal. Watching as if watching a great foreign film, takes us to another world because it is very unusual to see. However, this other world is not post-World War II, neither Rome, nor Istanbul, nor New Delhi, is the contemporary city of New York. <br /> <br /> Bahrani tells the story of Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), better known as Ale. He is a 12-year-old Hispanic boy with no parents or family unit to care for him. He lives in a small room upstairs in the car shop where he also works. He shares the same bed with his teenage sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales). Neither of them passed the sophomore year. Ale, though young, is hard and mature. He acts as the head of the small family. He hooks his sister into a job and he even does anything to make money when he's not working the cutlet shop. He sells pirate DVDs on the streets and candy on the subways. He searches for scrap auto parts and sells them to the many auto shops lining the street where he lives. <br /> <br /> Alejandro is heartbroken when he learns that his sister is working at night as a prostitute. He himself becomes progressively disinterested in complying with the law. He starts stealing, first pieces of cars and then wallets. Like Antonio, the desperate protagonist in Bicycle Thieves, we can not blame Ale for becoming a thief. It is merely survival. Ale and Isamar save on the hope of buying a food van for $ 4,500. They see the van as an exit and there is a lot of optimism. However, as is often the case with neorealism, we know that this will only lead to disappointment. <br /> <br /> Polanco's fascinating performance is what gives legitimacy to the realism of the Chop Shop. Here's a 12-year-old character who needs to be incredibly independent and vulgarly naive. Whether he's driving cars to the store, selling movies and Snickers bars or playing with his sister in his sparse room, is authentic. <br /> <br /> Chop Shop is a troubling reminder that not all American children grow up in a land of opportunities. Ale's lifestyle is what many in middle-class white America consider "third world." They act aware of poverty and deprivation in foreign lands as they sip their coffee and read the New York Times on Sunday morning, but become blind to it in their own streets. Once you attend Chop Shop, you will think differently than children selling sweets on the subway. <br /> <br /> More comments on www.mediasickness.com
