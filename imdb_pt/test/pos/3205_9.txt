I really like this show. It has drama, romance and comedy, all in one. I am 28 years old and I am a married mother, to be able to identify the experiences of Lorelei and Rory in the program. I've been watching mostly replays on the Family Channel lately, so I'm not up to date on what's happening now. I think women would love this show more than males, but I know some men would like that! I really like that it's an hour long and not half an hour, as the hour seems to fly when I'm watching! Take a chance if you've never seen the show! I think Lorelei and Luke are my favorite characters on the show, mostly because of the way they are with each other. How can you not see that something was there (or take so long to see this I guess I should say)? <br /> <br /> Happy viewing!
