I am a professional musician who was inspired almost 20 years ago to start playing the guitar after listening to Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin II. Although I do not play in the same genre or style, the impact of this man has been enormous. Now, almost 20 years later, I finally got to see something more than the not so good, The Song Remains the Same. Once again, I have seen so many bands playing, some small - some of the current 'masters'. No band, no place, was never able to take the magic that you really can taste watching this DVD. Robert Plant may be a little too much at times, and you may almost feel Page's annoyance at having forgotten the lyrics, but that did not matter, I think - especially for the time. Bonham's genius shines brighter on this DVD than any album with Zeppelin, Band of Joy or Lord Sutch. JPJ is very common - but the magic of this DVD is how well the four play together. The world loved to imagine that they were in black magic (k) etc. This was just a matter of interest to Page. The magic (note that I say that a lot) is that this DVD captures a rare look at the crudeness of 4 boys who can play brilliantly, no matter how sloppy they are playing. It did not matter. <br /> <br /> A quick collapse. The first of the two DVDs is where the real magic is. You should be able to feel the power and crudity that Zep had in her early days. At the end of the second DVD, Page is fighting his sanity during Knebworth's songs. (It's no secret that by now he was severely addicted to heroin). So I recommend the first record for ANY music lover, and the second for the only true fan of Zeppelin. <br /> <br /> I may be going too far for some guitarists, but I would say that after watching this, Page is certainly more inventive and inventive than Hendrix. Yeah, I said that. And if you do not agree - watch the DVD.
