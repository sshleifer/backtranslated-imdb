I came out of a Coen movie before and did not know how to feel. The two best examples of this are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so full of weird humor that I had to like it. On the other hand, there were some unnecessary daydreams with flying people and killer bowling balls that just did not seem to fit the mold of the movie. Still, I liked the movie and now I have a copy of it. Fargo made me howl with hysteria, sometimes I did not know why I was laughing so hard that it made me cry, but still I was. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo, but after further investigation, they were really real people talking about real situations. That's why the man with the shovel (or a broom) was so funny when he told the cop about a funny man at the bar the other night. And that's also why the theater burst out laughing when he says there are some funny clouds popping up (I also own a copy of this movie). The Coen have a way of masking their movie and their characters as being a bit eccentric. and maybe a little off the wall. But if you look more closely at some of these same characters who look wicked, you will always find that somehow weird, they all sound real. That is what is quite exceptional about The Brother Where Are You? This is a movie out there. I mean, it's not even in the same stadium as a traditional movie. I reviewed the Shaft movie last summer and said Shaft was a good movie I've seen a thousand times before. But you can not say that about a brother Coen's movie and you certainly can not say that about this. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything inside a prison, corrupt politicians of the south, muses, references to what I can only suppose are historical figures, riverside baptisms, bank robberies, violence against animals, bands of religious fanatics , KKK, lynchachos and so on. There are obviously many references to Homer's Odyssey here as well, but I would not know this because I never read Homer's Odyssey or even knew one thing about it. All other newspaper reviewers seem to know all about it and they think that this cynicism and spoof-like quality toward it make the movie so much better. Welcome to a guy who knows nothing about it, I can tell you that it's still a fun movie. There were times when, again, as usual for a Coen movie, I was not sure why I was entertaining or laughing, but I was. <br /> <br /> This is a photo of the road in which three men travel down the path to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he hid for his other two cellmates. He has to take them along because they were also chained to him when they had the chance to escape. <br /> <br /> I like all the main actors in the movie and many of them are Coen's co-stars. It was good to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro, who seems to have a place in every Coen movie. It's a shame they have not found a place for Steve Buscemi, but that's a different story. But back to Clooney. The man only has charisma. He is also a great actor and here he is not as stupid as the others, but even he has his own idiosyncrasies. His work here is quite impressive and I really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any kind of character. <br /> <br /> Now, after all this compliment in the movie, let me say that too. I really did not like the movie at first. I found it to be very tedious and a bit annoying. There were many ideas here and there was not enough care to take advantage of them for all they were worth. But then the movie started to grow in me. It took a while, but it grew in me. I do not think this is their best movie, but it's still a good movie and I'm giving 8.5. But the reason I recommend this movie is for a single reason. <br /> <br /> Every day you can go look at the paper and look at the movies that are playing and say to yourself, seen, seen, oh, seen last year, is the same as this movie and is the same as that movie. Most of the films were recycled in some way or another. Not the Coen films. They were not recycled and if they did not know. That's reason enough to see something they've thrown. Originality counts a lot in my books. Coen are original and are good. And this is not common in today's cinema. Enjoy them while they are allowed to make movies. Because you do not have a vision like that in a lot of movies, so when you do, have fun!
