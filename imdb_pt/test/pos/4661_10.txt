They do not make movies like that anymore? although some might say it's a good thing. Although this is one of the first Disney movies with PG, it has more of the feel of the G movies that his studio made in the 70's (like "Freaky Friday") than the PG movies that came out on ("Watcher in the Woods", "Tron", "Something Wicked This Way Comes"). Because of Disney's support, "Midnight Madness" obviously had a big budget. A huge cast and a ton of different places will show that. But zaniness, a crazy treasure hunt and spectacular visual style were not enough to save the movie from being a huge flop ... A failure at the box office, most of us were introduced to the movie on HBO in the beginning ?? The 80s, on days when the same movies would be shown 29 times a week (Oh, wait, they still do that!). Essentially, HBO did for this movie what CBS did for "The Wizard of Oz"? they have created a huge cult audience for a sugary mega-flop .... <br /> <br /> The biggest problem that makes this a "bad" movie is that there are many characters and very few of them are trimmed out? ? Eddie Deezen's team does not even have names! The blue team, although they are the villains, is the most captivating and has more work on their characters (with the exception of the girl, who can not act and does not have enough to do). Harold, perfectly played to the max by Stephen Furst, is really the only one whose character is fully realized in the film. The other prominent character is Melio, who was touched with much charm by now director Andy Tennant. Although then-dr. Pepper spokesman David Naughton should be the star, and his character is often unpleasant, particularly when confronted with his brother Adam, Michael J. Fox. While everyone has favorite characters, I do not think anyone who loves movie might disagree that Furst and Fox are the only two characters that you really learn anything. <br /> <br /> Despite the film's many flaws and bad actors (most fell on the face of the earth after this movie) still works because the actors seemed to be having fun - and fun on set is just like the fun on the screen. Come on, what high schooler does not dream of floating in a barrel of beer and what zodig girl does not dream of stealing the show at the local disco ... er ... I think it would be a rave nowadays. .. Campy, clean fun for those who were young in the 70s and 80s, it is only fair that this has finally gotten the mass video release it deserves. But where is the widescreen DVD release with the commentary, the trailer and the full version of the music that plays in the disco?
