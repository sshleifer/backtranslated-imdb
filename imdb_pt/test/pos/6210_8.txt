The story of Tom Garner begins with his great funeral and is told through a series of elegant flashbacks narrated by his faithful friend of life, Henry. Henry and his wife discuss whether Tom was a great man and a worthless genius or scoundrel. The film is beautifully written, acted and directed, and I strongly recommend it. Tom was the fabulously rich and successful owner of a great railroad, dominating his board and his competition, terrorizing his employees, the slaughter of strikers. Tom's ambitious wife, Sally, was responsible for all of Tom's success. When he met her, he was illiterate and totally satisfied with his work as a trackwalker for the railroad. Sally teaches him how to read and takes on the crawler job while Tom goes to school. He begins to climb one step at a time through the railroad's hierarchy until he eventually takes over as president. <br /> <br /> But as Tom becomes a business tycoon, his marriage to Sally gradually collapses. His spoiled son despises him, and he engages with a much younger woman (aptly named Eve), with predictably catastrophic consequences. In his business life, Tom is a total success; in his personal life, a disastrous failure. Much like the Hearst figure in Citizen Kane, Tom symbolizes the best and worst of the capitalist system. <br /> <br /> Spencer Tracy is terrific as Tom Garner and the business scenes sound authentically. Colleen Moore is also great as Sally; both age beautifully in multi-generational history. The film was written by Preston Sturges, but it's nothing like the crazy comedies for which Sturges became famous.
