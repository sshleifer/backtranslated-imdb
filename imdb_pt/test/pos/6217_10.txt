Every episode I saw when I was an innocent child was stupid. There were some funny-looking puppets called "The Mitts," who always discussed childhood things. They would play this song before the part "The Mitts" of the program that says "Let's join the Mitts ..." There was a Groucho Marx doll that told jokes. Before the session, this man sang "Hot Fudge! Right On!" There was a green puppet with teeth called Seymore. We would always see more Seymore. He would make jokes and sing all the episodes. There's always been morality in every episode. One episode, one man sang "Liars are losers!" Another episode he was singing about sharing and caring. Seymore told me about these two girls "Sharon and Karen". Holey Moley's part of Hot Fudge has this man doing weird stuff and they played weird songs.
