An awesome movie experience. I really enjoyed seeing this truly magnificent movie in the theater when it came out. There is nothing to add, except that it is a pity that Mr. Albert Finney is not yet accepted by AMPAS (American Academy). After the roles in films such as Tom Jones, Murder on the Orient Express, Under the Volcano (to name just a few - for which he was nominated for an Oscar), The Dresser is undoubtedly his highlight yet ... I know, Oscar is just a competition for popularity, but if Americans like British actors and actresses ("and the Oscar goes to" Jeremy Irons, Daniel Day-Lewis, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Glenda Jackson etc.) deserved the prize!), why did they always leave Mr. Finney empty-handed? <br /> <br /> On the other hand, they gave to John Wayne and Marisa Tomei (in Cousin Vinny). I do not know, I should laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the two protagonists in The Dresser, you will not forget the art of acting. Watch this movie and enjoy! I recommend it to everyone who loves art. <br /> <br /> I give 9/10 for this excellent film (1 point missing for non-cinematographic material, after all it is "just" a theater) <br /> <br /> Note: My criteria are much more stronger than that in IMDb (10 just for the cinematic masterpiece that should / may last forever).
