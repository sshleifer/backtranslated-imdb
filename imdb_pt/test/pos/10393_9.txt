Beyond the clouds is, in many ways, the strangest movie I've ever seen. Not because of his appeal to worship, blood, or even his ideas, but because of the elements that combine to make this a masterpiece of cinema. Beyond the clouds was directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, one of the most famous directors of Italy. However, if you gave this film just a quick review, passively I mean, it sounds like one of those melodramatic and often nonsensical novels. This film deserves great attention, to the point of embracing all its cheese. For cheese I do not mean a slice, but a whole brick of cheddar! The song seems to be from an Italian porn movie, from history and dialogue like a Japanese soap, and the metaphors are so obvious that you want to hit it in your head. <br /> <br /> But once you've gone through all this, you're engaged in an existential work of art. The cheese feeds the subtle footage and draws attention, perfectly, to what needs to be known. The basic plot is four chapters, unrelated and all about love. What we have learned is that no matter what happens or what is said, people can not communicate with one another. Instead, they can only communicate through each other. I suppose that's why the dialogue and the plot are so cheesy, because the conversations are overly irrational with lack of causality and overly melodramatic people's reaction. <br /> <br /> I left the movie thinking to myself; perhaps all of life is a great melodrama. We judge our feelings toward others as real and purposeful. I hate it because I'm right. But what does the hated think? Maybe they think my hatred is stupid and arbitrary. In other words, melodramatic. Thus, melodrama is, in fact, an existential function. A tacky novel is simply human interaction placed under a magnifying glass, allowing us to see the futility of who we are and what we do. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, I recommend it to everyone!
