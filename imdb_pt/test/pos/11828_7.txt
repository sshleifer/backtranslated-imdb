I do not think this drawing was as bad as some might think. Of course, I was only five years old by the time I left. But, I found it very fun at the time and would still take a look today if I had the opportunity. Batman and Robin being dubbed by Adam West and Burt Ward was a nice touch, and it gave him a sense of familiarity to me as I was also watching re-runs of the exaggerated 1960s action show "Batman" at that age. This cartoon also introduced some new twists that I had forgotten, such as "Bat-Mite", for example. Looking back, I'm sure he was as annoying as many think, but he did not bother me much at the time. The best I can remember, his voice sounded like a cross between Dumb Donald and Orko. Wow, I wonder why? :) Anyway, take a look if you can and make up your own mind. You may be surprised.
