Charlie Chaplin's Little Little Tramp or Little Man character won World War I, called The Great War at the time, alone, even capturing the Kaiser, something the Allied military could not do. It's a shame that everything ends up being a dream, which is a little out of the way and the weaker part of this mesmerizing short film (almost a feature film in the 46th minute). <br /> <br /> There are many inventive jokes including Charlie having to put on a gas mask to eat Limburger cheese sent home, then using cheese as a weapon against the Germans; Charlie sleeping underwater in a flooded trench next to a soldier he continues to bother; Charlie disguising himself as a tree - one of his best sketches of all time - and Charlie pretending to hit his friend who became a prisoner of war, then hugging him when the enemy is out of sight. One surprising feature is how much Charlie, when behind the enemy lines dressed as a German, looks like Hitler more than ten years before Hitler and his Nazi thugs got up to dominate German politics. Obviously, Hitler modeled his appearance after Charlie from that film.
