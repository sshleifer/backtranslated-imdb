The film begins with a board meeting at a large advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board for no other reason than being black, and the agency needs a "signal" on the board. Swope is ignoring the meeting by reading Jet magazine at the big table, and everyone is ignoring Swope ... Suddenly the CEO croaks on the spot. There is no time lost. A janitor is called to remove the corpse, and the council immediately and unceremoniously faces the business of electing a new CEO. And as the votes are counted one by one, the tension builds up and finally shines in a hilarious and ironic climax to the vote, which gives the viewer a delicious plate of logical implications to savor the rest of the film. If you've already talked to some stupid TV commercial, you'll enjoy watching this movie. Too bad there seems to be no real Putney Swopes in the world.
