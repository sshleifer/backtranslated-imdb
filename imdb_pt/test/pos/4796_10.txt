I love the absurd and biting humor of Buñuel's surrealist films (like "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" and "The Exterminating Angel", to name a couple). Other early works (such as "The Forgotten," about juvenile delinquents from a slum in Mexico) are more serious and provide a strong social message. <br /> <br /> However, I believe it is "Nazarin", which more success shoots to the heart of the viewer. Although it is true that it is full of irony, it reveals an aspect of Buñuel that seems to be intrigued by the beauty and solemnity of the spiritual search. Here, as the (quite typical) director casts countless blows on the Catholic Church, he also seems to show, surprisingly, a sense of admiration for genuine Christian thinking and his practice of unselfish love. <br /> <br /> "Luis Buñuel shamelessly praising a figure resembling Jesus?" I always thought of him as a completely cynical artist, without a trace of faith in human virtue ... that is, until I watched "Nazarin." My appreciation is that he satirically exposes the difficulty of following the example of Christ in a society infested with wickedness, ignorance and sin; but he also presents the hero, Father Nazario, as the beacon of light in the midst of a sea of ​​darkness. No doubt at the end of the movie, I was looking at him and not at him! Some would argue that Father Nazario's doubts about his faith point to the loss of his holy values. (Unfortunately, if he can not do good in this world, who can?) But I would say that this "failure", his frustration, makes his character even more heroic because it shows how human and challenging his struggle within should be. And who says that the priest could not emerge from that "dark night" and regain his confidence? Perhaps we have presented only a difficult part of your spiritual journey. The elegant, open ending (in which he desperately accepts the fruit offered by an unknown woman) allows us to imagine the end result of the story. <br /> <br /> I recognize in Buñuel the aggressive and authoritarian atheist. endowed with brilliant intelligence and social consciousness; but after watching "Nazarin", I also feel in him a certain warmth, a depth and maturity that are not so evident in his other work. <br /> <br /> For contrast, I strongly recommend seeing after that. short film "Simon of the Desert" (also made in Mexico several years later). It is a similar matter - the abandonment of the ego in the face of temptation - only in a hysterically amusing and totally irreverent style.
