In the changing world of CG and what not of animated cartoons etc. etc., the Fairies were a warm welcome at least for me. I think it's important to show this kind of movie from time to time to preserve them and help us remember where the originality and fun of the cartoons really came from. People were talking about how annoying it was because of the graphics and stuff, but hey! think of the movies that will be considered boring if all the movies resemble the new state of art that everyone and their mother are doing these days. Call me old-fashioned but I liked it. It's a wonderful story about supernatural beings and humans and all they really need from their audience is their imagination.
