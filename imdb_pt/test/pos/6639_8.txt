What Bergman has here is "What if all these bad things happened here in Sweden, for cool people like us?" And what he gives us, in the Swedish language, with Swedish actors, in Swedish locations (and using what appear to be genuine Swedish military vehicles) is what was familiar in war films set in almost every other European country - the confused invasions and counter-invasions, political lies, concentration camps, false confessions, summary executions, torture, turncoats, "collaborators" and so on. As in a modern tale, it is done in an abstract way, without names, cities or real countries used. But the strongest faction is "Nazis": they stand out, and some wear shiny knee boots. One even lashes things with a whip (okay, actually it's a cane). The victimized couple is called Rosenberg. Aside from the shame they feel in finding dirtier ways to survive - and they would not do what they did - all this suggests is that the title is clearly meant to refer to de facto complicity of Stockholm with the Nazis. In fact, what is shown to us is what Sweden might have looked like if Germany had asked for more than just mining concessions. <br /> <br /> The first half is like a comedy of black humor. We see the "fog of war" from the point of view of a comically passive couple who ignores the surrounding troops, the long trains, the bombed buildings, the news, etc. They do not even bother to find a working radio. They are the ultimate in "Not in My Backyard". They speak of wine and blueberries; Meanwhile, friends are mysteriously recruited and an increasing number of soldiers appear in the city. They are not curious about the war that has been going on for many years. <br /> <br /> The man (Von Sydow) is cultured, cranky and attentive; the woman (Ullman) is a little more impulsive, passionate and turned towards the outside. There is a beautiful scene in which the man talks about his violin: the maker, he says, fought in the Napoleonic Wars, but his own interest in the cultural artifact in his hand - or, more precisely, what his own warm feelings. about the property and the security that this property assumes. Not in my yard! But when war finally invades his bucolic idyll, man's shyness, an irritation in the good times, becomes a disadvantage, one that he ends up compensating for - as is often the case - as Bergman demonstrates subtly and beautifully. Definitely worth seeing.
