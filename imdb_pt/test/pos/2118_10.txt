I loved this movie My daughter is 3 1/2 and a country girl at heart. There are no movies for small children. I loved this because the worst thing was when one of the boys said "stupid". I applaud you for going out and making a real family movie. I rented the first time we saw it and know looking to buy to add to our collection. My daughter can not stop talking about it. This goes along with our lifestyle. We live in East Texas. I hope to see more family films like this. She even named one of our "Hokey Pokey Keen" calves !!! I can not say enough about this movie. I look forward to many more movies like this.
