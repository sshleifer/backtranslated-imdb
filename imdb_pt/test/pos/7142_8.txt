The 90s movie with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger is rightly praised, and I really enjoyed it, but this TV original is as good as, and in a way, more appropriate. Claire Bloom is not a daring joy, but she is still confident and throwing her cap at her favorite author (played by Joss Ackland in one of her best performances). <br /> <br /> Quieter, calmer and less emotional than the Attenborough movie this may be, but it does justice to what is a wonderful piece full of meaningful dialogues. You'll still cry over this version, but maybe you do not have the musical stimulus to challenge it. There's room for both of you - and having seen it onstage, I'd say the Ackland / Bloom one is a bit more faithful. But both are excellent.
