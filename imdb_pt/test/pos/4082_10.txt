I recorded The Murison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie Network and Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I'm glad Walker got his brother Luke to confess to murdering his parents and brother Bobby. I like to see true stories on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie Network and on Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. Next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv, I'm going to watch The Morrison Murders again because my favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders. I give Morrison Murders a ten because it's a good movie about Walker who tries to find out who killed his parents and his brother Bobby and in the end Walker discovers that it was his brother Luke who murdered his parents and his brother Bobby.
