I hope Robert Redford keeps making more movies like that. Hillerman's books are wonderful and, like a little child raised in the southwest, his stories come home! Adam Beach is a very underrated and underused actor. Wake up Hollywood, not everyone thinks your Mel Gibson is cool! Many movie goers today want to see movies that make you think. I've seen all the Redford / Hillerman series. They are attentive, scenic and have great plots. Hopefully, if enough people write to Robert Redford, he decides to do some more! Thank you Adam Beach and Tony Hillerman for great entertainment! If anyone has a chance to read Tony Hillerman's latest book, do it! It's great. I also recommend traveling through Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. Stop at all the viewing sites and feel the configuration of Hillerman's books. Amazing experience.
