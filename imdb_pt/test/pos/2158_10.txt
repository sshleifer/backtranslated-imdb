Yes, actually we have a winner - a winner in the best dunce action movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I chose to vote a 10 for this movie is because it is so incredibly bad that it actually becomes funny. "Night Hunter" is basically about Jack Cutter, a vampire hunter (vampire hunters have been in his generation for centuries, apparently), and his mission being that he has to kill the last remaining Vampires. <br /> <br /> This movie contains one of the most cheesy scenes I have ever seen in my life. Not to mention the very bad shooting scenes. When people are filmed in this movie, blood splatters are thick like ketchup all over the place, this makes the film look so cheap and lame that you end up losing interest. A constant camera shake is what irritates me most during the fight scenes. This is, I suppose, done to create an "action effect", although in my opinion this has no effect. It's completely ridiculous! <br /> <br /> All stunt scenes are done extremely poorly. For example, a scene in which the dead vampire leader is thrown off a roof. When the corpse hits the ground, it swings like a wobbly rubber doll. A scene where Jack smells the ground, having a vision was so annoying that it made me laugh hysterically. Lame music, grumpy scenes, bad interpretations and stupid filming techniques are obviously the functions that make this movie a malfunction. To say that this is a good movie would be tantamount to stating that nuclear bombs are good for humans. Clearly those of you who say this is one of the best action movies have not seen many in your life. <br /> <br /> This is basically a class B vampire-action-movie that deserves 0/10, but I'll give it 10/10, just for its skill (being the worst action movie I've ever seen ) to make me laugh and because I just can not live without it.
