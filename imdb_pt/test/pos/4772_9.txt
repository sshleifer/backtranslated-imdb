SPOILERS <br /> <br /> As you may know, I have commented on many silent short films in recent months. Now, I have no idea why I'm commenting on Steamboat Willie, I think I was desperate to comment on anything, so I watched it, and now I'm commenting on it. This, or course, is one of the first cartoons, and I believe it is not the first cartoon with sound. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot. Mickey Mouse is driving a steamboat when Pete throws it away and he drives it. When they stopped to load, Minnie Mouse tried to enter, but failed miserably. Mickey catches her by a crane. Then a goat eats its sheet of paper with Turkey in the Straw. They use the goat to make music. When I say this, I mean they used the goat as a Victrola. Mickey throws the animals on the steamboat for the instruments of the music. Then a furious Pete plays Mickey in a potato room and Mickey is forced to peel potatoes for the rest of the day. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is another groundbreaking silent short. I mean, this is the third Mickey Mouse design. Yes, the third. Also, this is not the first cartoon with sound. I believe there were two more before this one. Anyway, this movie is really groundbreaking. Mikcey was also more violent than he is. I mean, he throws a potato at a bird and may have brutally killed him. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> Recommended Movies: Plane Crazy.
