Made on a budget of more than $ 20, this thirteen-minute long stunt cheerfully parodies George Lucas's legendary science fiction blockbuster "Star Wars," in the most infectious and stupid way imaginable. Writer / director Ernie Fosselius offers a winning and often sweeping mix of playful sound effects, unprecedented action scenes, rudimentary special effects (far from being) (you only need to love film-striped lasers, aluminum foil asteroids, and household items) . gadgets ... er, I mean spacecraft being twisted around obvious strings), barely voiced in dialogue, shamefully disrupting the performance, and Richard Wagner's engaging piece of classic music "Ride of the Valkyries." The characters are presented in appropriately broad strokes; my favorites are Wimp's shrill Fluke Starbucker, venerable Jedi Knight Auggie "Ben" Doggie, and hateful archi villain Darph Nader (who speaks nothing but incomprehensible jargon). In addition, 4-Q-3 is clearly based on Tin Man's "The Wizard of Oz", while Artie Deco is definitely a cheap vacuum cleaner. The real master of the film is to cast the legendary voice actor Paul Frees as narrator; Frees's deliciously rich and richly tuneful tones contribute immensely to silly and yet entertaining joy (lines of choice: "You'll laugh! You'll cry! You'll kiss three bucks goodbye!"). A total joke.
