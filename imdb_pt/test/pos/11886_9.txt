If you're looking for a kung-fu action movie, look elsewhere. While there are fight scenes, the film revolves around its provincial protagonist, who struggles to find his way into the Americanized canton. Unlike most "kung-fu comedies," the action scenes are used to reinforce comedy instead of the other way around. <br /> <br /> Cheung Booi is a statement about the ridiculous nature of kung fu movies where the stars always seem to find some reason to fight. Instead of a great drama about honor and respect, little misunderstandings cause the characters to yell at each other and start hitting each other. My Young Aunt, as it is known in the West, is the story of Cheng Tai-nun, played by Kara Hui, who is a young woman who marries an elderly landowner to prevent their possessions from falling into hands of his greedy and corrupt brother. After he dies, she moves to Canton to live with her nephew, played by director Lau Kar Leung, and his son Ah Tao, played by Hsiao Ho. <br /> <br /> The basis of irony is that although Cheng is the same age as Ah Tao, her way is more like her great-aunt's status. While Ah Tao speaks English (extremely badly), plays the guitar and attends costume parties, Cheng fails to adapt to her Canton lifestyle, complete with makeup, revealing dresses, high heels and dance scenes. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie great is its accomplishment. Lau Kar Leung is perhaps one of the greatest, if not the greatest director of his generation in Hong Kong, and Kara Hui won "Best Actress" at the first Hong Kong Film Awards in 1982. In addition, this is undoubtedly the best performance of Hsiao Ho. His chemistry with Hui is remarkable, and although he has had a career celebrated in kung-fu comedies, often working alongside Sammo Hung, he has the perfect combination of athletics and comedy. While romantic tension and intrigue builds in the second half of the movie, his whole face changes. He can no longer wander through life without a care in the world. He becomes the straight man and his companions the Kramer, Elaine and George. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is how suddenly the comedic aspects of the movie die during the conclusion. The film transitions from total farce into a dramatic intrigue with little more than a change in incidental music. But there is a certain symmetry in that. The film starts focusing on the intrigue, focused more on Lau Kar Leung's character, and ends that way too. But the final scene returns to the comic roots of the film, concluding both aspects of the film.
