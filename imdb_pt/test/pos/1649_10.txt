Many experienced and excellent actors mingled in a continuous plot of an uncountable part of World War II on the eastern front. Well portrayed characters and unforgettable. One episode leaves you wishing the next. Pay attention to the final credits where the thousands of Shtrafbat battalions are listed. An untold story involving hundreds of thousands of people. Sometimes brutal, sometimes romantic, always full of real people and dialogue. Produced with excellent sets and camera work. Heroes and villains, criminals and priests, patriots and traitors. Portrait of people struggling to survive and overcome a more terrible moment. I want to buy a copy of my collection to be able to enjoy the series over and over again.
