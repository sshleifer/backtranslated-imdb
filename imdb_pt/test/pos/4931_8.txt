It is in the opinion of this critic that the best time to be a child was in the 1990s, a time when cartoons were not heavily censored and talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family entertainments to reach the airwaves. The best producers of the Saturday morning entertainment were at Warner Brothers Television, which experienced a great Golden Age with Steven Spielberg's Tom Ruegger and Paul Dini's dream team. Along with serious and somber series like Batman, they also relived strange cartoons made by the famous Looney Tunes. Animaniacs was the biggest hitter with his black humor and homage to the celluloid of yesteryear and today, but Tiny Toon Adventures was equally popular in reinventing the Looney Tunes for a new generation, while still retaining that crazy cartoon violence and intelligent comedy that can any age, no matter how old you may be. Even when the Tiny Touches were stretched for a feature film with How I Spent My Vacation, it did not seem like a longer episode in the television series, a curse that so often plagues other long adaptations of popular animated shows. The Tiny Toon Gang are young off the springs of the classic cartoon characters who made the audience laugh in the 1940s and 1950s and are currently learning cartoon comedy to "earn their Toon Degree." Summer vacations have started and each character has their own idea of ​​what to do. Buster Bunny (Charles Adler) and Babs Bunny (Tress MacNeille) start a water cannon fight that eventually leads to Acme Acres being flooded and the two sailing through the Mississippi. Plucky Duck (Joe Alaskey) joins Hamton Pig (Don Messick) on a car trip across the country to the Happiest Theme Park in the World, but Hamton's family turns out to be more difficult than he imagined. Meanwhile, in other scattered stories, Elmyra Duff (Cree Summer) tries to find a cat to hug and press, Fifi Le Fume (Kath Souce) tries to go out on a date with her favorite skunk star and Shirley the Loon (Gail Matthius). ) goes to the movies with a high-pitched mouth (Rob Paulen). <br /> <br /> Although the premise seems weak for a feature film, the many directors and writers make all stories work well together. The best of them is Plucky's unhappy car journey, which uses a comic gold opportunity very well: feeling sorry for someone, while laughing at their situation. Plucky's angry reaction to all the bad things that happen to him is a perfect blend of script and animation, all on the edge of a small car full of pork. The story of Elmyra definitely comes in second only to see how a small, almost innocent girl can cause fear in so many jungle animals. The violence of the above-mentioned cartoons definitely comes to the fore with the story of Buster and Babs, which makes us smile not only because of the hilarity of the results, but also nostalgically, since Ruegger and company probably would not be allowed to show half of what they do in this segment. Nearly half of this segment functions as a parody and homage to Deliverance, including a clever twist on the dueling banjo scene featuring the unforgettable theme song Tiny Toon Adventures. <br /> <br /> Part of the universal appeal of the Tiny Toons. is that humor is very clever as it strikes individuals with a ferocity that proves that it does not deserve the full title of "child fare" that people seem to come across. An entire segment with poor Fowlmouth etiquette at the movies mocks the yappers in a perfect way, along with an additional hit on the Lucasfilm logo THX. This scene is made so perfectly that it must be presented before any movie screenings. There are also a few moments that make fun of Disney World, the movie-plot holes, and even Warner's legal department. The fact that today's cartoons are insipid and uncreative makes these smart moments even more interesting, since there will probably be no other animated series to come. After watching How I Spent My Vacation for the first time In many years, I can say for sure that they do not make cartoons like they used to. With the continuing censorship that today's family entertainment receives, we wonder if anything like that will ever be done again. This review is not only a recommendation for a really clever film, but also an appeal for Spielberg, Ruegger and Dini to come together again and bring a magical creation to our minds once again. God knows that the children of the twenty-first century need something with the intelligence of the Little Toon Adventures. This is not a simple cash-grab, it's a wonderful movie, full of spirit, madness and hilarity.
