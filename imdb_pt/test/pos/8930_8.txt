EIGHTEEN as written and directed by Richard Bell may have a few stories to count simultaneously for a 102-minute movie to have complete success, but there is such a perfect feeling of commitment on the part of the whole cast and staff that the viewer ends up wanting the movie works - and it does. Yes, aspects could have been solved if the producers had more money to spend on the final cut, but as a small independent film from Canada, this is a tender, kindly humorous and very touching story about vulnerability, communication and commitment. It works on many levels. In a nicely choreographed opening, we are voyeurs at a family dinner where something obviously went wrong and resulted in a father and two kids taking off in a car and suffering an accident. in which one of the children is killed. With an introduction like this, the mood is set for 18-year-old son Pip (Paul Anthony - looking too old for credibility as a teenager) to abandon his family and live on the streets. He meets Clark (Clarence Sponagle), a prostitute who gives food and shelter to Pip, Jenny (the excellent Carly Pope) who saves him from an attack by Derek (Ryan McDonell) and engages romantically with Pip, and with Chris (Alan Cumming ) on a paper sympathetically finely forged as a priest. It is Pip's 18th birthday and his father (Serge Houde) moths Pip to give him a gift from his late grandfather with instructions that the gift should be opened on Pip's 18th birthday. <br /> <br /> Pip, although drinking too much and full of rage, pawns the tape, but keeps the tape and begins to hear the words of his grandfather Jason (voice of Ian McKellen) recounting his own 18th birthday in the World War II in France, where he (now the very sensitive actor Brendan Fletcher) has an experience with an injured doctor named Macauley (Mark Hildreth, also superb) and reflects on his one night wedding with a cabaret singer Hannah (Thea Gill of Queer as Folk and an excellent singer and actress here), for something to live during the war: Jason offers aid to Macauley while he dies, with a beautiful scene of redemption for the two men in the end. Pip's parallels and Jason's grandfather interact every time Pip hears the tape and takes Pip to ultimately alter his vision of life and love. Subplots include Clark's isolated existence as a cheater being altered by Jeff (David Beazely - in a surprisingly good movie debut) who simply wants to be loved; by an unexpected pregnancy between Jenny and Pip; by the trust that Father Chris instills in Pip and Clark in a good manner of pastor: and by a flashback of the car accident where Pip could have saved his brother Daniel (Paul Dzenkiw) from an abusive act at his father's hands shortly before the accident but failed to do so, opening his deep guilt and resulting anger shifted, mirrored by his grandfather's recorded experiences. Each of these subframes joins at the end, creating a sense of closure for each of the people involved. <br /> <br /> There are aspects of this film that make it seem like a big budget production: Bramwell Tovey's musical score is played by members of the Vancouver Symphony, Kevin Van Niekerk's cinematography is appropriately atmospheric, and the overall acting quality of this Canadian cast is very good. Although Paul Anthony handles well with his role, climbing a very young teenager into the lead role would have made the work of the story much better, and Richard Bell, with just another "Two Brothers" movie on his resume, promises a young talent to watch. Despite the shortcomings, EIGHTEEN is a worthwhile film worthy of attention. Grady Harp
