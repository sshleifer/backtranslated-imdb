Robert Florey and James Wong Howe gave a scary expressionist look. Scenes are filmed at odd angles - especially scenes involving the figurative and literal killer Zachary Scott. His sociopathic behavior foreshadows another excellent medium-budget film, "The Stepfather," for more than two decades. The whole cast is excellent, though (though it's not her fault) it's hard to think of Joyce Compton as anyone else except the "Awful Truth" singer.) Scott, Bennett, Emerson, DeCamp (especially, and despite interpreting a beautiful older woman) - they could not have been covered. <br /> <The definition of a frightening story of a woman in a psychiatrist setting is a risky trick that pays off beautifully. Nothing cheesy at all. Nothing cheesy at all. <br /> <br /> The resolution is a little pat, unfortunately. Emerson is not joining Bennett. That makes sense. But Scott is dispatched very quickly. I look more like Mr. Ripley's character, who could have escaped everything - botulism, murder rap, envious sisters - and disappeared into the big world beyond this story. That would not have prevented the essentially happy end of the secretary and her boss finally coming together.
