The beads look real with a human factor added to the blend. Much sadness. I'm sure glad that I was not him .... another thing to add is that all the women in this show were not really much real women accounts. But I do not think it was about women, although it was for the passion of JFK Jr. What a shame. any loss of life is a real shame. It sounded like a good account of his life. I recommend it if you are into biographies and melodrama!
