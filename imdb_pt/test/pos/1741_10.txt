I loved this show. Such talent; and I'm so disappointed it's canceled, after just the beginning. I've looked forward to this show all week. And I'm sorry for the people who expected to be the only one. I'd love to see who would win. It just started, and in my opinion, should not have been canceled. I hope these young artists have been seen by talent scouts and have the opportunity to achieve their goals. I voted, and sat waiting for him to appear; never knowing that it was canceled. And I could not believe it was. I'm amazed that it has low ratings; because it was in my opinion one of the best reality TV shows.
