There is nothing left to be done about this masterpiece by Perry and Croft - as good as any of the best episodes, fortunately still filmed in time before the late James Beck sadly passed away to be included in it to show his talent. He shows from the outset how the platoon is formed from the state of national emergency, showing the boys as inept under the command of Captain Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe) and Sgt. Wilson (John Le Mesurier) as they are usually on the Serie. Along the way, Mainwaring makes his usual urge to show authority, but comrades can not help disappointing him at every turn, during war games and suspecting an invasion. They have a chance in the movie to redeem themselves when they actually capture the Nazi airmen who take the church congregation hostage. <br /> <br /> This was a good ending, especially since Mainwaring had been able to prove to the General. , being given one last chance to shape. A great movie, lots of good lines and laughter, is another one for the DVD - I'm glad the BBC is repeating - and on this day 2.8.08 they deservedly had 'Dad's Army Night'. To not lose!
