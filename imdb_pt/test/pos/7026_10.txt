I have to admit, before watching this movie I thought, this is one of those love stories where everything works fine and all the way. but I was proven wrong when I actually sat down to watch this. I discovered that it was a really good story about a family going to a dance park for a 3 week vacation and there the younger daughter, baby, finds love but finds it difficult to get there with her new love found due to misunderstandings with her father. But along the way helps another dance instructor, and risks the entire relationship ... A truly moving film, like no other. <br /> <br /> 10/10
