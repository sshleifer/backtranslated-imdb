Call it a manipulative maneuver if you want, but I fell in love with it. Of course, there could have been more character development. Yes, there could have been better cinematography and less a constant "movie of the week", but Ed Harris was flawless, Cuba Gooding was adorable and touching, and let's face it in real life how many of us really got to know the motivation of others . Not many. We did a little glimpse of the coach's motivation (a very provocative dialogue in my opinion so as not to be soon forgotten) so, in my opinion, this was a beautiful tribute to a human being who stepped out of his "comfort zone" to reach for another human being, and in the meantime, touched the lives of hundreds more. A lesson we all need to remember. Why is the right thing to do so often the hardest thing to do? I recommend this cute little movie to anyone with a heart. You will not be disappointed. And bring your tissue. 8/10
