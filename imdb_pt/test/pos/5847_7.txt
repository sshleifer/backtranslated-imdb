I liked this movie. Unlike other thrillers, you learn to know the killers very well. You also know the two detectives who hunt you. The killers are two high school boys. They are very intelligent and want to prove they are smarter than the police, so they plan the "perfect crime". We all know that this crime will not be perfect. What we do not know is whether they will be caught, or may be just one of them, or even none at all. In a way, I kind of hoped the two would get away, though I did not know if that was the movie's intention. <br /> <br /> The story is told in a cool way. You are getting to know the people involved. The character of Sandra Bullock is nice, but has her own secret, which works against her. Ben Chaplin is very good as Sam and the two kids are great. The scenes between them are the best scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think you can say that the movie is very good and not as predictable as you would think. For a nice night out with a movie, 'Murder by Numbers' is a good movie.
