The brilliance of this film is not in the filming process, which is a conventional but executed tale, interwoven with the lies of three recruits after World War II, but in the fact that this story was told to everyone. Samuel Goldwyn deserves credit for daring to go through a movie that has as a leader a disabled veterinarian with hand grippers, an alcoholic and a failure.
