Josie is a newspaper reporter who has the task of going back to high school, since she will be 17 again. <br /> <br /> While she's there, she remembers some really awful things that happened to her the first time she was in high school as we see in flashback scenes. <br /> <br /> In the flashback they show that (little spoiler) Josie was kind of nerdy in high school and was picked on a lot and one day the cool guy tells her that he's taking her to prom, just on the night of the prom as she leaves the house. Egged by the ass and her bitch. what a horrible thing to do (some will find it difficult to watch as it is so unpleasant and will make you feel warmer with Josie). <br /> <br /> I did not find this movie so funny, but there were some funny things in the office scenes that were a lot funnier than anything that happened at school. <br /> <br /> This film had the perfect happy ending, as it brought tears to my mother and sister's eyes. The acting in this film was not excellent, it was good for most of the film, there are some poor acting in some parts of the film. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this movie 7 Oct 10.
