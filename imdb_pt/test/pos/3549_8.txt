I'm an opera fan and the operas are full of sex, blood and death. It can help you get to know the opera librettos of the arias to really enjoy this movie - my mileage is very different from the Tug-3. I am a lover of classical music and I liked this movie. I loved Ken Russell's "Nessun Dorma" segment and would like to see him producing Turandot, because the opera should be overwhelming, truly multimedia experience, but I loved Lisztomania. I love * Turandot * and knowing the libretto so well may be why I do not think that segment the farce that Tug-3 did. <br /> <br /> The Buck Henry / Rigoletto segment is probably the most accessible to the public. average viewer - they are likely to recognize the songs, and it is a classic room farce. I like room farces, so the nonsense did not bother me. <br /> <br /> The segment "Liebestod" is so extraordinary that I recommend that people watch this piece by themselves. "Depuis la Jour" was, to me, wonderfully spiritual. And Caruso's recording of "Vesti la Giubba" (also known as I Pagliacci) with John Hurt as the clown was wonderful. But people who only want naked women may feel that there is a lot of music and little naked flesh and sex.
