I remember actually liking BATMAN RETURNS when it was released in 1992, but now I think this is the best of all Batman movies (even about Christopher Nolan's fantastic BATMAN BEGINS 2005 and definitely about the seriously overrated 2008 THE DARK KNIGHT!). I originally remember thinking that the first BATMAN with Jack Nicholson was the best (and I still love it). But I think this movie really hit the nail on the head. The 4 main characters (Batman, Penguin, Catwoman and Max Shreck) are all vivid and memorable. You can actually see what Batman / Bruce Wayne is in Keaton's fantastic characterization. Keaton is the best Batman, not Kilmer, Clooney, or even promising Bale, who was exceptional at BB and could have stolen Keaton's top honors if his character had not been destroyed by Nolan's production of the TDK! <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito as The Penguin is disturbing, scary, hilarious and lethal. DeVito is great and does not need the scenery to perform well as the Nicholson Joker. The spectator can really sympathize with this disfigured outcast and his situation to fit into normal society. I've never been big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer until this movie, but this is definitely my favorite performance of it. Selina Kyle, from Pfeiffer, is silly and strange at first, so when she's turned into Catwoman, she's both sexy and scary, a total mortal bastard! Also, I feel that Keaton and Pfeiffer have more chemistry than Keaton and Basinger from BATMAN; they form a tragic love story. And Christopher Walken as Shreck is, well, as always, Christopher Walken! <br /> <br /> BATMAN BACK, more than BATMAN, is more confident and focused. Film production is assured from start to finish. The way Burton introduces the background story of the penguin grabs him from the beginning. The first 5 minutes are among my favorite starts for any movie: Danny Elfman's song sets an ominous tone of omen that sets the rest of the film apart. It's a modification of the original BATMAN and a great one! <br /> <br /> So, let's move forward 33 years to today's Gotham and we're introduced to the powerful Shreck businessman who wants to build a new power plant in Gotham. During the same scene, we find Shreck's secretary, the submissive and intimidated Selina Kyle. And not long after all this, the exciting opening action sequence of the film, such as Batman, must combat The Penguin's Red Triangle Gang, a fun and deadly group of outlaws and circus performers. Penguin sets in motion the plan to attack Gotham's Christmas party, kidnap Shreck in chaos and force him to help reintroduce him to society. Meanwhile, Selina discovers Shreck's criminal plans and then he "kills" her by pushing her out of his office, so she's revived by cats. <br /> <br /> Complicated sound? Yes, but Burton never claimed to be putting a realistic story. He has created a world where the viewer can accept that things like this can happen, a black and noirish world composed of maltreated and deformed pariahs who deep down just want acceptance and fit. Tell reliable stories if you ask me! <br /> <br /> The action scenes are few and far between, but they are all exhilarating, fun and entertaining. They are not only there to show, as some in BATMAN are. And they all make sense. The climax scene with Penguin's "army" marching to Gotham's center, with Batman zoning in Penguin's hideout and butler assistant Alfred (Michael Gough in a welcome return from the original!) Helping Batman is succinct, solid and fun I also love the Christmas, winter setting that enhances the super dark and cold feel of Burton's Batman world. I also love the way Burton slowly introduces us to the "toys" of Batman without pushing them in our throats. Each "toy" is appropriate for that moment in the film and we are required to accept them for its purpose. And though dark, RETURNS is still a funny movie. DeVito Penguin has many funny lines. The same goes for Walken's Shreck. The Batman-Catwoman trades are extremely stimulating and full of humor too! A great set! All in all, BATMAN RETURNS is a well-crafted tale of dark forces at stake in Tim Burton's fun comic book world.
