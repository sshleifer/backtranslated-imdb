Well, the day Rob Schneider plunges even deeper into the black hole of notoriously bad movies starring "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo" (hmmmm ... there was not an absolutely unwanted movie) called Roadtrip which was followed by a sequel called Eurotrip? And now there's Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo followed by sequel Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo ....... I smell a pattern Maybe soon there will be Spiderman: European webs are warmer ..... or not) I'm writing about this very slandered film (at the time of launch). I was one of those evil ones, I must admit. I sniffed at myself as Chris Farley pushed cocaine through the nose and the SNL cast struggled for one of the worst seasons of its history in 94-95, despite Norm McDonald's anchor. Films like Happy Gilmore, Tommy Boy and Black Sheep came in the two years after that period and we realized that there was a bleak future for the caliber of Spade-Farley-Schneider-Sandler films. However, I watched this movie the other day, ten years later and eight years after Chris died and could not stop laughing. Yes, it is not particularly sophisticated. Farley does what Farley does (not unlike Manny's Manny) but his motivational speaker "Van Down By the River," in which he laments that he can not "wash enough" or "wear tight-fitting clothes" or "use deodorant plus ". than twice a week "translates well here as the always discreet character who realizes that he is not the brightest, or the most handsome, and can lose a few kilos.However, he is trying his best to do what and David Spade just throws off his craziness as he did for Spade's Hollywood Minute and basically fuels Farley's self-esteem.There is not much else to say than that.I love the scene when Farley catches Spade beating his monkey and then do a couple of pranks on it.I do not remember what the first of them is, but the second, they're lying on their hotel beds and Farley tells Spade, "Do you like baseball?" Spade grunts something inaudible in response and Farleys says "the New York YANK-ees?" Anyway, Farley makes his awkward, painfully sensitive, frat boy.
