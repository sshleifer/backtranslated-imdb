I admit that I almost gave up watching TV shows. Because? Because most of them are about doctors, forensics or some girl / boy, they can predict a murder sitting on the toilet seat. But I must say I was wrong when I watched the first episode of Oz, one of the most brilliant TV shows to date. Oz is a safe maximum prison program and shows episodes of the lives of all spouses inside the prison and their frustrations. What I like about this show is the fact that it has the courage to show real life in prison without any annoying characters, stereotypes and unrealistic dialogues. Even though you thought the characters in the show should not be heroes, you quickly became attached to them and their lives. Of course, there is a lot of violence in this show and some disturbing images of rape and drugs, but this is the purpose of this show; to present how brutal and frustrating life can be in prison ... hell, you can not show prison life as a "clean environment" with "friendly characters", right? Oz is perfect in every way, the actors are doing a great job and all the time this show is going really fast. The only thing I did not enjoy at this show was the last season of the show, I think it got very strange and brutal and the ending was not satisfactory. But overall, Oz is still my favorite TV show so far, it beats Sopranos and millions of crap CSI and Dr. House with just one major title. Bright show that has the balls to show what other shows are taking from us; realism.
