Zeke Rippy (Mic) is great, you totally believe in your character. And it's scary as hell, I spent half of the movie covering my eyes, the other half on the edge of my seat. It's cool to see something so full of suspense and fear that it's not just blood and courage - but it gave me bad dreams. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is a great movie - see the first chance you get.
