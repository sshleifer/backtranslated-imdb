I saw this movie as part of Midnite Madness in Sitges. Set in 18th-century England, the plot covers the life of Arthur Blake from his first outing as a tomb robber apprentice for his final confession on the eve of his execution. <br /> <br /> The plot follows through a series of misadventures involving Arthur and his partner finding several disgusting characters and bizarre situations. The first thing that draws attention to this film is the precision with which they have managed to capture the appearance of the horrors of the Hammer period, the atmosphere is set with many fog-laden cemeteries, noisy scenes, and a excellent design / costumes. For a movie titled I Sell the Dead, did I expect the emphasis to be primarily on terror? do not get me wrong, there are some scary and bloody moments, but the tone is very comical, driven by the situations in which the characters got in and by the dialogue. The closest comparison between the scenes between the two protagonists (Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan) is the interaction of characters seen in the classic English comedies Only Fools and Horses, the Two Ronnies and Morecambe and Wise. <br /> <br /> is strong and the cast of very familiar faces in Ron Perlman and Angus Scrimm elevates the film above many of the others on display in Sitges. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film offers something very different from the current crop of mainstream terror. and will leave a smile on your face.
