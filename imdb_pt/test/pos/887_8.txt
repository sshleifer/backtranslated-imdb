I saw the movie in its North American debut (July 14, 2004) at the Fantasy Festival. I was a bit disappointed to be expecting a more epic cast movie along the lines of Musa the Warrior. Instead, the film concentrated only a much smaller number of characters. Still, the film was solid, thoughtful and visually intriguing. There was a slightly shocking tone of the dominant pensive and realistic tone of confused loyalties, intrigue and blood, versus the lighter and more extravagant martial arts sequences. It was almost as if the filmmakers could not decide whether the film should be a martial arts "movie" or a historical epic. The story touches very well the question of the need for loyalty versus the need to adapt to new situations. Is it worth your life and your friends to be loyal to your master, or is there a time when someone will have to submit to the winds of change? Is there perhaps greater courage in leaving old forms to new ones? How does one decide? These questions are raised in this film and, ironically, there is the suggestion that the answer given may indeed be the wrong one!
