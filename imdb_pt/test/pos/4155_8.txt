"Nuovomondo (2006)" (shown in the US as "The Golden Door") was written and directed by Emanuele Crialese. This film is different - and, I think, better - than most films about impoverished people who leave Europe and come to the United States. <br /> <br /> The film begins with scenes in a poor rural region. Sicily We have always heard that Sicily is a rocky island, but you will not really understand the implications of this phrase until you see the first half hour of "The Golden Gate". <br /> <br /> The middle part of the film is dedicated to the long trip to the USA. Most immigration movies show ten minutes of people in the third class section getting seasick and then shows us the Statue of Liberty. Not this movie - we have a feeling of life below the deck, and it's not charming. (We also never saw the Statue of Liberty). <br /> <br /> Finally, the typical movie will give us another ten minutes of Ellis Island, and then the immigrants are walking down the Lower East Side of New York. Not here - the Ellis Island experience takes up about a third of the filming. <br /> <br /> Vincenzo Amato is notable as Salvatore Mancuso, who is bringing his two sons and his mother into the new world. Charlotte Gainsbourg is equally good as Lucy Reed, a mysterious Englishwoman who also speaks fluent Italian. <br /> <br /> There are some strange touches in the film, especially the soundtrack with songs by Nina Simone. There must be some symbolism there, but I could not understand it. <br /> <br /> Another critic has already pointed out that this film will be better seen in a theater than on DVD. Still, big screen or small screen, worth looking for.
