Well, as you can see, I came to this party very late, but I have the advantage of reading all the previous posts before making my comments. I found this site by chance when I was looking for other Marine Corps films. So let me start by telling you that I played a Boot Marine in the movie, Pvt. Labarsky, and was at MCRDep, San Diego at the time. Jack Webb and his team selected 15 permanent members, some of whom had the spoken part, and 15 other Marines who had just completed Boot Camp. This comprised the platoon and the Marines who portrayed the various "IDs." To the best of my recollection, the captain and Pvt. Owens (Don Dubbins) were not in the Marines. We spent about three weeks in Hollywood (Studio City Film Lot), CA filming the section of the movie we were involved in, and then they completed the other scenes after we left. <br /> <br /> So, as I digress here, let me clarify a little of what was questioned in the previous entries in the best possible way. "Cuff Daddy" was commenting on our Platoon's ability to shout "Yes Sir" without moving and etc. ,, Yes, we made the Scream for the Sound Guys, and it was during the filming of the scene. As your fellow Marines remember, when the DI or anyone who started asking a question and before completing it, you had already breathed air, allowing you to scream at the top of your lungs the appropriate response. That's how it happened. <br /> <br /> "74Sooner" commented on walking through the same building on Paris Island, however, as I mentioned earlier, all scenes were filmed in Studio City, California. They were built from photos taken on the Island of Paris and from on-site travel and marine consultants on the Ile de Paris. Sorry, you were in the real buildings, not the sets. <br /> <br /> "schappe1" brought many good points, but, about the incident with the peloton on Paris Island at the time, all that Jack Webb said to "The film came about because of the accident, and the Marines The Marine Corps did not want to expose anything that could impact any of the Marines' family members who died that night. Although, the Marine Corps would provide any Marine and necessary assistance for a film by responding to the public why a Navy DI does what it he does ". <br /> <br /> As mentioned by some of you, I too at the time when we were recording the scenes, I got myself thinking this dialog box was cleaned for a lot and obviously this is not what happens in real life. In the '50s, this was how it had to be done. <br /> <br /> One story I would like to pass on is the interaction that has taken place between us, Marines and the Film Team, and between the Film Crew and Jack Webb. From the beginning, by custom, the Marines responded "yes sir" to anyone who moved. Going into the second week, it was getting more common to hear "Yes Sir" coming from all directions. On the stage, someone would ask for something to be done with the lighting and, out of nowhere, on a catwalk above the set, a "Yes Sir" response would sound. For all of this at one of our informal meetings, said Jack Webb. "If I had known that I would have received such respect from this team, I would have brought you here years ago." There was a lieutenant brought in from San Diego to play the ID of the other platoon and the one with whom Jack Webb fought, but during a shootout he was willing to take the number 32, and yet Webb kept trying to work on it. through how he wanted and showed no lack of patience with him. The next day, they used the Paris Island advisor who was a DI sergeant. of the island of Paris and it worked very well. At the time, I was a camera aficionado and I met Still Camera Man to get a pointer from him and, in the end, he would give me pictures and some of the 35mm movies from the daily shoot that would not be used. Those film strips I cut and made slides of them. After the movie came out on VHS tape (The DI, 11706 B & W / 106 min.), My children and grandchildren are amused when they try to meet each other on the screen more often.
