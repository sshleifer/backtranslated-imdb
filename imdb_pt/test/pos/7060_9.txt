This is easily the best of the summer camp movies. In fact, few of the others are fair, the closer they are to being as much fun as this. <br /> <br /> The film is simply ready to have something good, clean and fun. Many people who went to summer camp when kids summer that it is presented here faithfully as it used to be, but with the mixed slapstick comedy. Bill Murray, as the camp's top adviser, Tripper, leads a beautiful cast, and is usually at the center of the rampant absurdity. Tripper has great releases, generally conveying his jokes as pseudo-announcements about the camp's public address system. Several great supporting actors have made campers and advisors build a myriad of fun and interesting subplots. , all the time sprinkled among the many incidents of the hi-jinx camp. Spaz (Jack Blum) and Fink (Keith Knight) were two particularly well-made characters. The adventures (and misadventures) of these two are hilarious. Each one has classic lines, and they are characters you like and twist. Look for Spaz in the nightclub pandemonium scene. <br /> <br /> The girls of the story are also realistic characters. They are not stupid, na√Øve, weird, overly sexual, nervous, or any of the other stereotypes of a teenage character, overused and abominable. Kristine DeBell, Kate Lynch, Cindy Girling and others make these characters believable. The necessary pranks are plentiful, usually at the expense of camp director, Morty (Harvey Atkin). The nature of these games begins with a scandal and progresses from there. However, with all the nonsense, Tripper and the others have their serious sides. For example, Tripper befriends a shy, lonely boy, Rudy (Chris Makepeace), and puts him under his wing. <br /> <br /> The story culminates with a sports competition against a rival camp. It's a great end of "root for the underdogs". When the chips are weak, Tripper's motivational game is "inspired" and is one of the highlights of the movie. And get ready for root: "Spaz. Spaz! Spaz !!!" "
