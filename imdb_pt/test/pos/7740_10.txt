I have often heard people express disappointment that Mazursky's "Storm" has little to do with Shakespeare's original. In my opinion, this is true and false, but most of all, it is a bad starting point to offer criticism. A work of art should never be criticized for what it is not, but for what it is. The film "Tempest" is nothing like a faithful representation of the play, but in my opinion it is true to Shakespeare's work in spirit. What "Storm" is, then, is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time. No, not experimental as in handheld and murmured but experimental dialogue as in exploring the convolutions of a story without undue consideration for box office earnings. Mazursky's Tempest is epic, sad, realistic, joyful, full of life, but most of all, it is imaginative. Cassavetes' portrait of Philip / Prospero is already worth a note of 10/10, and when you add Gena Rowlands, Susan Sarandon, a wonderful and deep Molly Ringwald, Raul Julia, the dialogue, the music and the suggestively suggestive little pictures scattered throughout Photograph. ... I rest my case. One of the best films of the 80's. Do not miss it.
