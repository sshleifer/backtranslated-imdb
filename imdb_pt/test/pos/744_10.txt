'Do not Look In The Basement' is so easy to hit but the truth is simply that Brownrigg is one of the real Underground Horrors stars and IMHO is long overdue some proper recognition. "No" is his undisputed masterpiece. This sneering psychodrama misleads the viewer into such a strange, disconnected and claustrophobic world of sweaty insanity that you have no idea what the hell is going on. It makes you feel strangely dirty, simply filthy, since Brownrigg's world is this cell of annoyances, obsessions and all the shadows of mental illness. And he uses his low-budget palette to wrap his blanket around you like a bad memory. There is something so beautifully strange about the whole thing. In short, classic ... Also, if you watch "Do not" first then you will get an idea of ​​the insane psychodrama style that marks the other Brownrigg movies. In short, they really are no more esoteric than that - well, in fact, they track Brownrigg's "Keep My Grave Open." Crazy genius. Do not accept substitute.
