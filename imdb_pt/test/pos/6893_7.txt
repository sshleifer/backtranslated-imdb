I saw 'I Smell the Dead' - sorry, 'I SELL the Dead' - in a press briefing. Glenn McQuaid, the writer-director and publisher of the film, is an Irishman who introduced the exhibit by announcing that - while it was in progress - he would be "going out for a beer." I do not envy him a drink, but-by telling us about it-he seemed to feel he needed to certify his mania or his Irishman, or both. When the opening credits rolled, there was - as usual at press releases - loud applause for the names of every actor or staff member who had friends in the audience, and silence for those who did not. McQuaid returned to a witty Q & A later. <br /> <br /> This horror movie is not taken seriously, which is good because its humor is considerably stronger than its horror. Only one scene is remotely scary, and most of the "horror" is just gross, but I laughed for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be in Ireland around 1850 (by what time the robbery of tombs was largely extinct). The story is told in flashback: we get flashbacks in flashbacks, and the narrative character recalls stuff he did not know because sometimes he was not present or (in one case) because the action is unfolding in the back. The story begins with a prisoner being taken to the guillotine. Guillotines were not used in 19th century Ireland, but - for once - we actually see a plausible guillotine sequence. The prisoner struggles on the way to execution, the rope clips are accurate, and the prisoner can raise his eyes to see the blade at the top. (And there is a reward to justify the historically inaccurate use of the guillotine itself). The characters are ostentatiously Irish, but one main character speaks in Cockney slang terms: using phrases like "a mug game" and "pick up a butcher" (to "take a look"). For the first time, nineteenth-century role actors exhibit nineteenth-century dental hygiene, but almost all clothing and hairstyles (and women's makeup) are resolutely of the 21st century. I'm not complaining in the case of Heather Bullock, who wears a very attractive black miniskirt that looks like PVC. Phworr! <br /> <br /> The leading actors (except Ron Perlman) are excellent, but most of the supporting cast has no notion of the Victorian period. The worst offender is Joel Garland as the publican, whose characterization is firmly rooted in the 21st century. Just when I thought Garland's performance could not get any less Victorian, he used his fingers to make "ironic" quotes in the air. <br /> <br /> The sets (especially Angus Scrimm's lab) are detailed and impressive, nonetheless. could not convince me that people actually lived and worked in these places. Most of the interiors contain lighted candles, but I have never seen what would have existed if they were true Victorian homes or workplaces: remnants of previous candles. <br /> <br /> One scene features an alien: he was annoyed that McQuaid had looked for a stereotypical "gray" Schwa alien rather than something original. <br /> <br /> There are splendid set sequences, but McQuaid opts for flashy effects - split screens, aerial shots - that does not suit history. I was struck by a recurring blue screen device overlapping the heads of the main characters over other backgrounds. Less efficient was a recurring Creepshow-like motif of camera shots turning actors' faces into drawings that resemble art panels from the 1950s EC horror comics. I'm a fan of EC Comics but they do not belong to Ireland of the 19th century. The money that McQuaid spent on the flashy photo F / X - showing off his editing skills without serving the story - should have been spent on accurate costumes. <br /> <br /> BIG SPOILERS NOW. Ron Perlman gives an "Oirish" performance full of acting school ticks. Ostensibly playing an Irish priest of the 19th century, he writes with his left hand. (In Victorian Ireland, left-handed children were punished for using the "devil's hand" and were forcibly withdrawn to become right-handed). But Perlman's character turns out to have a reason to hide his right hand. Elsewhere, a character is bitten by a zombie but has no ill effects, so I knew there would be a reward later. Several scenes that would happen more logically at night are filmed in daylight, apparently only because this was easier and less expensive. (Since McQuaid is a proficient director and editor, he could easily film "day by night" ... but using a process photo effect to help tell the story seems to interest him far less than displaying his editing techniques flashy.) <br /> <br /> McQuaid seems to be paying homage to those great old hammer horror movies. But these Hammers were so good because the actors and production designers worked hard to convince us that we were actually witnessing events in 1888 at Whitechapel, or wherever. 'I Sell the Dead' hardly evokes the nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> Glenn McQuaid shows talent as a director, screenwriter, and publisher, but in all three capacities here he makes strange choices ... so largely does not justify those choices. But I liked 'I sell the dead'. I'll rate it 7 out of 10, and I look forward to your next movie.
