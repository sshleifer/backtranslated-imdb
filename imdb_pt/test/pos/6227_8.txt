I have to admit that thanks to this movie I'm afraid of mannequins. haha ha. <br /> <br /> But yeah, first, the acting in this movie at least by my standard is very good. most of the actors are quite decent in their roles. The script also seems to be very good as well, certainly a few extravagant things there, but also some decently written character and some very scary scenes. I still shiver thinking about that scene with the guy and the mannequins. brrr. <br /> <br /> Yes, I'm going to say that you should check out this movie, it's very good, and a lot of fun. a good watch. 8/10
