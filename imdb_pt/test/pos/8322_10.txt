As John Grierson pointed out, "The documentary genre can be defined like this: the creative interpretation of reality." <br /> <br /> This fabulous 180-minute documentary marks the first time that a computer-generated dinosaur project respects intelligence. of the viewer. <br /> <br /> When I saw Jurassic Park, which I had expected with great enthusiasm, I was extremely disappointed. Of course dinosaurs were fine, but storytelling was unnecessary. I thought, "What if they made a documentary about dinosaurs, no children crying or bad puns, only dinosaurs made as realistic as possible, to let us marvel at what was once reality." <br /> <br /> My dream come true. The BBC produced an exciting documentary exploring the different eras of dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> This part is for all people who seem to disagree with the fact that they had to guess at many points about behavior, skin patterns etc: Of course they have to. No one was there. I think it's fantastic that they can present something as realistic as that. The assumptions are all based on the knowledge of many paleontologists and allow the viewer to have a good idea of ​​what it was like. If you want to stay with what we know for sure, then go visit a museum of dinosaur bones. That's why I included the quote from Grierson at the beginning of this comment. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the hat to the breeders.
