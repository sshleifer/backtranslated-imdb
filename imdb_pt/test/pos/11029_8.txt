This is one of my favorite movies that goes back to my childhood. Set in the remote Siberia desert at the turn of the century, a small community is buzzing when an extremely cold winter forces two tigers to come down from the mountains in search of food, attacking farms far away. In this atmosphere we are introduced to Avakum, a hermit hawk hunter who lives in the jungle when he arrives in the village to sell his annual catch to Boris, his closest friend and, in fact, a village friend who runs a shop . At the request of Boris, Avakum accompanies the arrogant son of his friend, Ivan, in hunting down the menacing tigers. The collapse of personalities and moods are exalted as Avakum, older and more experienced, criticizes Ivan's amateur methods, a meeting perceived also by the other members of the hunt. On the second day, the hunters see their prey and chase. In a thick wood, Ivan injures one of the tigers, who then attacks the unhappy man. Avakum, seeing Ivan get entangled with the raging beast, fires, but accidentally hits Ivan. He kills the tiger as he runs. The other hunters arrive suspiciously. <br /> <br /> Back in the village, the doctor works to save the wounded Ivan. Avakum tries to leave the village, but is confronted by Ivan's friends. The hunter pulls them away and speeds up with his dog-drawn sleigh. The young villagers swear behind him that they will come to him if Ivan dies, which he does later, but before dying he explains to his father that it was an accident. Old Boris, knowing that his closest friend was fleeing the village, straightens the crowd of lynchers and leaves behind Avakum, to find him and set things right. And so begins the main story. <br /> <br /> A simple film raises the conflict between man and civilization versus nature, especially Avakum's struggle to survive alone in the wilderness. The winter landscape is beautifully filmed. Perhaps the strongest element in the film is Jimmie Haskell's soundtrack. Very sentimental and evocative, the main theme reminiscent of the Adagio of Albinoni. Other movements reflect Russian styles, as well as some folk music type songs. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is not available for purchase, as far as I know, it's a shame. My copy, recorded on TV almost twenty years ago, is slowly deteriorating. This movie is a must see for those who can enjoy it if they can find it. 8/10
