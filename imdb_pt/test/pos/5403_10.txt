I just watched this movie in Australia via satellite. As I have been avoiding the more than usual news over the past week coming from the United States on snipers, well, to be absolutely blunt, this movie is a prescient gem. A big brave one for everyone involved. I had only a small idea of ​​what the film implied, as it is more often in terms of good results, and this certainly has resulted in film products. the scene of the scene is effective in the truest sense of the word, with all the hairy confrontational subjects of the world today in relation to their own faltering, though suburban, family. The first forty minutes define a theater so professional that I was not prepared for the laughter when they came. Although the cathartic moment built via comedy and character as family and neighbors unite in an extraordinary way. <br /> <br /> All this is a foretaste of who and what we are. A very significant and unforgettable film. <br /> <br /> write down the date of this review.
