Possible spoilers of care ahead ... I only watched "Joe" for the second time. The first time was over 30 years ago at an Air Base. I remembered that for the Air Force jacket with Tech. Sgt. Stripes used by boyfriend / retailer; we, airmen, laughed a lot the first time they appeared on the screen, because that's a 'lifer' rating. Over the years, I uploaded several other images from the film. She was, above all, the absolutely beautiful and vulnerable daughter of the executive. As someone commented, you could not take your eyes off her. I did not know until now that this was a 20-year-old Susan Sarandon in her first movie. What a loss she did not make any more movies when she looked like that. I also remember the irony of having a counterculture hero like Peter Boyle playing the title role of a right-wing lunatic. Not unlike George C. Scott acting generals on Dr. Strangelove and Patton. And, of course, the shocking ending made a lasting impression. <br/> <br/> For more than 30 years, it was the most talked-about movie ever made at the base. We thought it was a great movie and I was reluctant to see it again because I was afraid it would be as dishearteningly dated as Easy Rider. But watching today, I was struck by how well the film stayed. It's a very strong script with few holes, but you have to wonder about the boyfriend immediately getting out of the tub when Sarandon stays with him. <br /> <br /> Looking for an explanation of why this movie is still so much fun. I have to think it has something to do with the perfect physical cast. Boyle was physically believable as Joe (as others have pointed out, his portrait would inspire the character Archie Bunker a few years later). Did Ted Knight model his character 'Caddyshack' - Judge Smails after Dennis Patrick's advertising executive in 'Joe'? They look and sound alike. Patrick was totally believable as the middle-class executive, very tight. And Sarandon's innocent eyes with the Raggety Ann doll still evoke a protective response from all male viewers - the perfect cast. <br /> <br /> Nudity and drug scenes really hold up (they were very provocative for their day) and are as explicit as anything that can be found in 'Thirteen'. About the only thing that dates this movie is that violence is not realistic or graphic. 'Joe' was about the same time as 'The Wild Bunch', and the tone of film violence just started to change. <br /> <br /> Another reason for this movie is that events over the past two years have brought back the relevance of the theme and context of this film. In the film, the two types of "conservatives" are portrayed as filled with fear and hatred over unconventional counterculture modes; and full of envy in their free and hedonistic lifestyle. The counterculture is portrayed as mocking the hetero culture; and although paranoid over the conservatives (legitimately, given that this was only a few months after Kent State), they can not resist flaunting their lifestyle in an attempt to antagonize. The political landscape is not that different 30 years from now. I'm not sure if Conservatives envy young people and liberals until 1970, but they fear them and hate them more. <br /> <br /> An excellent film that is surprisingly as relevant now as it was in the early 1970s.
