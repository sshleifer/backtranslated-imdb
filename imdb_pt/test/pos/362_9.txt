The first murder scene is one of the best murders in movie history (almost as good as the shower scene in Psycho) and Robert Walker's acting is fantastic. A psychopath involved with the tennis star in exchange for assassinations. the story and this movie is very good, but there is a problem: why Guy Haines does not go to the policeman in the first place.4 / 5 <br /> <br />
