This was a daring movie for Indian cinemas when it was released. The first film may openly portray lesbian tendencies among Indian women. The leading Indian film actress Shabana Azmi added substance to the film with her hot and passionate scenes with Nandita Das. <br /> <br /> The film overflowed with sexuality and the director used sex in the best possible way. Sex was not for erotic purposes, but it was in the context of the movie. The scene in which Nandita Das loses her virginity with her husband was certainly the first of its kind in Indian cinemas. <br /> <br /> Good performance from all actors, especially Nandita Das amid criticism from the Indian audience
