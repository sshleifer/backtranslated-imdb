On a lonely road in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, a black man driving a car is chased and hit by a truck, falling off the road and dying. His daughter Cassie Robinson calls his ex-boyfriend Dean and asks him to investigate the mysterious accident. Sam and Dean see that three African Americans and the city's Caucasian major were killed in strange accidents on the same road. When the truck threatens Cassie, her Caucasian mother, Mrs. Robinson, recounts a tragic racist murder that happened thirty years ago, and the brothers realize they need to fight a spirit of hatred in a ghost truck. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Dean reveals his first and only love to his brother, surprising Sam and showing that he has feelings, but also that his desire to hunt is stronger than his love. The story is just reasonable, touching the delicate theme of racism in an efficient way and blending it with a supernatural event. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Route 666" ("Route 666")
