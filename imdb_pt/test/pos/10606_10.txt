If you're looking for a movie that does not take itself seriously ... than Haggard is for you. I must say before writing anything else, that if you have not seen any of the CKY (Kill Kill Yourself) videos, the movie probably will not be so funny. My advice is to watch some videos of these videos that Bam and his friends have made. Haggard does not take everyone seriously, and that was never the purpose. Throughout the movie you will have random moments that have nothing to do with the plot, which can be annoying, but nothing is out of control. Even with all this, the storyline remains focused and the story of the character of Ryan Dunn unfolds very well. This storyline I was told is based on a true story (for the most part) of Ryan Dunn's ex-girlfriend. Brandon Dicamillo is by far the best character in the film. He has a lot of talent and knows how to make people laugh. He stole the movie if you ask me. Overall I love this movie because of its simplicity and strangeness. It's a Bam movie people, it will not be normal. Haggard is full of hilarious quotes that my friends and I have used constantly since the first time we saw him. I've seen the movie 6-7 times and still find new things every time. The soundtrack is so good. Everything from Gnar Kill to New Order and some techno. Just do not enter the movie with high expectations, let everything unfold and then judge for what it is.
