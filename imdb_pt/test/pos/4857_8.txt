I do not know if the directors intended to make sure the sky was almost always sunny and beautiful in this movie. Macy is back from the war. (Her neighbor asks, "Hey, is it true that you have a Fritz there?"), And that's the romantic image that many Americans have from the time this movie goes, is trying to get on with his life, but one day he gets a new pair of glasses (hence the name) and sees things clearly as the surrounding situation turns out to be rabid anti-Semitism, and Macy and Dern could wrap it up. Macy is continually harassed to go to the "meeting." His presence brings him to the forefront of his life, and he is a man of his own. <br /> <br /> In 2005, it underwent a complete reversal, with ordinary citizens who took patriotism and religion as its unifier supporting the Republican Party and vend o organized labor as part of the 'unpatriotic' left-wing America. <br /> <br /> A big picture to watch, if you mind seeing the nice, shy and meek Macy (played beautifully by him) caught in the carnage of race and hatred in the mid-1940s in New York. <br /> <br /> A hard, emotionally charged movie.
