Be prepared for the trip to Haneke's "La pianiste" ... The psychological illness of the main character, beautifully played by Huppert, exceeds any limit you might expect. The most impressive part is that you begin to feel compassion for the character Erika. Trash-sexuality (without naked scenes), perversion, masochism, incestuous relationships ... Haneke gives us a raw meal, heavy to digest; sometimes the only way to escape the extremism of some scenes is to start laughing at it. The "mise en sc√®ne" may not be the most attractive part of the film, it has obvious Austro-Germanic, sometimes Scandinavian, notes: static, long but never boring scenes. The settings of vienna, the French language used, make the whole look like a European blend. The Germanic permanent music Background (Schubert) is beautifully chosen. Above all, the two Cannes awards for best actors are well-deserved: one of the year's greatest performances by one of the greatest French actresses of all time.
