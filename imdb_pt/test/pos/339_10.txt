This movie was amazing how good it was! The plot is extraordinary and the performance spectacular. At first I thought this would not be so good because of a summary, but after the first five or ten minutes of the movie, it occurred to me that I was completely wrong. I literally cried about four or five times in this movie, and despite that, I must have watched the same scenes again and again about thirty times in a week! No, the music scenes were not as fantastic as they might have been, but the plot is what really leaves you. American or Asain, I would recommend this to anyone - and I have now. I guarantee that after seeing this, you will get the best out of it and your plot. I hope you feel the same and write a very positive review!
