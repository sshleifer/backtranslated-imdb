I have to say that. Gary Busey saved this movie. If it had not been for his acting talents, this movie would have been insignificant. I recommend the movie, but only badly. <br /> <br /> The biggest difficulty with the film is its widespread disrespect for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? How was Buddy Petty's producer ignored? Where are the daily trips to Clovis studio in New Mexico? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate field to destroy Holly's sound? Why was Buddy's two-week courtship with Maria treated as a complex, taboo and racial stereotype? Why are Buddy's cartons as light as feathers? Finally, why are crickets portrayed as problems in stopping Holly's talent? Taken ahead of him, these inaccuracies should mean disgrace to any movie that proclaimed "The Buddy Holly Story." However, Busey makes a moving portrait as the man whose death led to the day the song died.
