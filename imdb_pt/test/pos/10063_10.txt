Fantastic, Madonna at her best, the film is funny and her acting is brilliant. It may have been made in the '80s, but it has all the qualities of a modern Block Blockter from Hollywood. I love this movie and I think it's totally original and will brighten anyone falling in a matter of minutes. Fantastic.
