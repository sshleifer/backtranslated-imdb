"Sir" played Lear over 200 times, but tonight he can not remember his opening lines. Looking into the mirror, his eyes reflect the madness of the king. His dresser gently encourages him, uttering the words. There is an air of despair about these two men. The great actor, knowing that his powers are fading, his valet enjoying with great dome cum consciousness and substitute wife - aware of the decline of his boss in madness and knowing that he is powerless to do more than relieve his death. "The Dresser" is really a love story between the two. Over the years they have become mutually dependent on each other, insofar as none can conceive one future without the other. Defined during World War II, it concerns the fate of a frankly second-rate Shakespeare tourism company comprised of an equal number of aspirants and aspirants led by "Sir", a theatrical knight of what could be called "The Old School ". Whatever part he is playing, he grabs the center of the stage and sings over the spotlights, intimidating his audience into applause. But somewhere in it, buried most of the time under the ham he regularly prepares, there's still an occasional glow. of its former grandeur. It is to catch a glimpse of what your audiences fervently expect. Mr. A.Finney focuses very skillfully on the ham, often to the point of caricature, and only when you are ready to reject your performance as mere hyperbole and bragging, will it produce a moment of delicate subtlety and vulnerability that makes you realize that great actor is playing a great actor. The same goes for Mr. T.Courtenay. It is easy to write his interpretation of Norman as an exercise in stereotypes. Here we have a middle-aged effeminate, rather than a theatrical camp dresser, following his path through life. , enjoying the company of "The Girls" and loving Insider's perverse gossip in "The Theater." There were - and I strongly suspect they still are - many men like Norman in The Profession.Infinitely kind and patient, knowing more about the Beyond many of the actors, they rush backstage with wisdom and affection. I believe the vast majority of them would shout at the approval-laughter of Courtenay's portrait. I saw "The Dresser" on the London stage where, against the perception of wisdom, Courtenay's "Norman" was a little more restrained than in the movie. "Sir" was played by the great Mr. Freddie Jones with great acclaim from the public. was a memorable performance that overshadowed Courtenay's, reducing him to a "generalist" as opposed to an actor at the ticket level. The idea that "Sir" and "Norman" may be almost incomplete one after another left the scene. the window. "Norman" was reduced to being his puppet, which I'm not sure was what Ronald Harwood intended, but made for the theater to take his breath away. Finney and Courtenay compensate for the balance in the film, restoring equality to the relationship. Both men have come a long way since their first appearances in the British "New Wave" films when they became the darlings of the vaguely leftist "middle class and shame" movement. When British cinema practically compromised Hari-kiri in the 1970s, they focused on the theater, in addition to some roles to keep the wolf out the door. With the revival of more substantial films, they reappeared, blinking in the unscathed light. <br /> <br /> "A Dresser" marked his return, still seething with energy and talent, shouting to the whole world, "We're still here." It's not a great movie, but it sure is great.
