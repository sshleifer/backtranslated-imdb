This is a very funny ripping movie, very funny, and Russell Crowe is amazing! Those who know you only from Gladiator will be surprised to see the range of your acting skills. Arthur Baskin (your character) is one of the best virgin nerds I've ever seen. Watch this movie - how can we re-release it in NTSC format? <br /> <br />
