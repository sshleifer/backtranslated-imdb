I am an Australian currently living in Japan. I saw this movie on TV here and was very impressed by the accuracy and honesty in the portrait of Western and Japanese ideologies colliding. Who wrote the script and directed this film must have a good knowledge of what it is like to be a foreigner living in Japan. The only part that I thought was very Hollywood was when the character of Tom Selleck kisses the woman in the middle of the office and she leaves him . Public displays of affection are not really acceptable here. Finally a movie that highlights the true 'gaijin' experience! 9/10
