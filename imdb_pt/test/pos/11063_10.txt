I grew up in New York and every afternoon ABC showed the 4:30 movie - Saratoga Trunk was one of the first movies I remember watching as a kid. I loved this movie and it stayed with me for years. Recently I watched it again and still thought it was great - maybe I'm just a romantic - but I thought it was well done. I do not want to say that this movie was good just because of the main actors - I did not really know who they were when I first saw this movie - I guess I only knew how to act quality as a child. Both Bergman and Cooper were excellent. I particularly loved seeing Old New Orleans during the time period of this movie. If you have a chance to visit New Orleans - you should watch movies that show the city during that time period - when you get to see some of the old houses in the French Quarter (not just Bourbon Street) or uptown, you can really imagine life as it was 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I love old movies - this to me is a good movie !!
