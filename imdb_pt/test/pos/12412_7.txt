I can understand why others reacted unpleasantly to climax, producing a turnaround that is really hard to take seriously. I think, however, that the development of this works very well. The music, quite threatening and creepy, actually delivers a scary aura that matches the relentless sound of a constantly playing phone that is taking the atrocious English actress Joan Matlin (Jean Marsh). She is borrowing a friend's beautiful apartment while trying to start her career in New York City (and the city buildings outside the window look as realistic as David Letterman's) and she is unceremoniously greeted by a noisy telephone that sounds like a little by bit knocks against the wall. In search of answers on the person responsible for such disrespect to her sanity, Joan discovers that no one rents that room, and that a former tenant has in fact strangled. Without the manager's help, Joan will decide for herself who is causing such anguish. Joan discovers the empty room and the telephone with a particular female voice that will haunt her. <br /> <br /> The episode, I think, is a tour-de-force for Jean Marsh which is a show for a woman. She is the only visible actress and we follow her through the crisis that slowly erodes her, the telephone and the beats of that other room causing her much anguish that grows in fear. Instead of leaving, Joan remains, so shaken by the noise and to the breaking point, where she just wants the phone (or whoever is ringing) to stop. The episode provides a possible answer on who is grieving Joan and why. A character named Beth enters the story a little late as Joan struggles to find out who the female voice on the other end of the line knew her name on that dreaded phone she discovers in the room across from hers. Beth's fate may just tell the viewer why Joan is being traumatized. I think this episode is an exercise in ghosts rather than credibility, some did not particularly like it, but I certainly enjoyed it. I admit that the phone, as a physical threat "crawling" toward Joan, is hard to take seriously, not to mention that it is an attack on her, but I thought the intense opening twenty minutes before that was adequate enough compensate for this.
