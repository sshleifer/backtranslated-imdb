A drawing of Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE. <br /> <br /> STEAMBOAT WILLIE, a naughty little rodent, neglects his pilot home and his way into cinematic history. <br /> <br /> On November 18, 1928, a young man in distress genius debuted the world's first successful cartoon with synchronous sound. There would be no turning back for either Walt Disney or his alter ego Mickey Mouse. Financial struggles would remain, but essentially the world was his oyster bed and Mickey eventually would rival Chaplin as the most recognizable cultural icon of the century. <br /> <br /> As entertainment, STEAMBOAT WILLIE is still fun to watch, with great presentation. work by animator Ub Iwerks and showing a Mickey with all the passions and indifference of a small child. He has to deal with a tyrannical captain (Pete, without his wooden leg, he had appeared in Disney cartoons since February 1925), a playful parrot (in a few years would be a Duck) and a cute Mouse named Minnie. Together, the two rodents insensibly make music on the living bodies of a goat, a cat, a goose, a suckling pig, and a cow (a forerunner of Clarabelle) -all of them by chance were conveniently aboard the steamship . The public was clamoring for more, and the pattern was set for subsequent Mouse cartoons in the following years. <br /> <br /> ********************** ******** <br /> <br /> Walt Disney (1901) -1966) has always been intrigued by photos and drawings. When he was a boy in Marceline, Missouri, he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper; later, as an ambulance driver in France during World War I, he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle. Back in Kansas City, along with artist Ub Iwerks, Walt developed a primitive animation studio that offered animated commercials and tiny cartoons to local cinemas. Always the innovator, his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series began to put a living figure in a cartoon universe. Business reversals sent Disney and Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923, where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager and counselor. When a slightly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched by the distributor, the Mickey Mouse character emerged in Walt's imagination, ensuring Disney's immortality. The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut, STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), a tremendous hit with the use of synchronized music. SILLY'S SYMPHONICS soon appeared, and Walt's growing team of marvelous and talented entertainers was rapidly conquering new territories in color, depth illusions, and radical advances in personality development, an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable. Mickey's unruly and grumpy behavior conquered millions of fans, but he soon would join other animated comrades: the moody Donald Duck, the intellectually challenged goofy and Pluto energetic. All of this was in preparation for Walt's biggest dream - animated feature films. Against a flood of pessimists, Walt persevered and in the following decades charmed children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi and Peter Pan. Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse, or that the childlike simplicity of the message and a lot of hard work are always worth it.
