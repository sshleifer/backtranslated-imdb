This movie is brilliant ...... no doubt. I watched it some time ago after insisting with family members who are right in their science fiction films (which I am not), and thought it was very good. But after recently seeing some documentaries on outer space, etc. we watch again ... and it's fine. Kevin Spacey is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors of all time and I really like Jeff Bridges (Great Lewbowski, Blown Away, Arlington Road). The film revolves around a patient in a nursing home who claims he is from another planet. Yes, you think ... but what if his story is so believable that even your psychiatrist begins to wonder if he's telling the truth. <br /> <br /> This is how the story evolves with Bridges going through all sorts of emotions dealing with Prot (as he is known), his own psychiatric colleagues, his wife and family, his brother-in-law and his fellow cosmologist astrologer (which after getting some data from Prot, pretty much admit he might be telling the truth!) A great movie ... you're wondering ..... 8/10 Dave
