Great great! The west coast has "Dirty" Harry Callahan, the east coast has Sharky. Burt Reynolds plays Sharky in "Sharky's Machine" and I enjoyed every minute of it. Playing an independent narcotics cop in Atlanta, GA is exactly what everyone wants. Instead of suspension, he is sent to the deputy squad. Like Dirty Harry movies or any other detective film, the captain will always be the idiot. When I was a kid, I was curious about what that movie meant "Sharky's Machine". Well, I knew who played Sharky, I wondered what his machine was. It was his group of police colleagues. After discovering the murder, he goes out to find the criminal. When he turns out to be a great mob boss, Sharky does not play. When he puts the other prostitute safely, Sharky fights hard and well despite losing a finger to the bad guy. And I also like the part where evil is blown out of the building through a glass window. That was the PUMP! Randy Crawford's "Street Life" really put the film in a good mood, and the movie itself is really a huge success for me, ALWAYS! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
