I do not know exactly why I asked "Fingersmith" from Netflix - probably because I like BBC dramas, it was on a list of recommendations. I had no idea what I was about to see. The plot, which I will only describe generally in order not to spoil it to anyone who sees it after reading my commentary, has more twists and turns than a mountain road in the Rockies, the kind that usually appears in "caper" movies. They are very unusual in a period drama. Not having read the novel (and I do not intend to), I was totally unprepared for the surprise that ends the first segment of the DVD and equally surprised by the subsequent twists and turns. However, she is extremely well represented by the two young directors (by Sally Hawkins in particular as Sue and by Elaine Cassidy as Maud) and, in important supporting roles, by Imelda Staunton as the maternal figure in a thieves' house and by Charles Dance like the rich uncle who collects pornographic materials and rescues the young Maud from the crazy house where his mother lived to be his secretary. The lesbian affair between Maud and Sue is the "big news" in the film, but it's not really its centerpiece. The centerpiece is a plot to steal the fortune that Maud is due on her 21st birthday. The twists and turns of the plot add tension, though not much credibility, to the movie. However, no viewer can doubt that Maud and Sue will somehow end up together - unlikely - as the credits roll. Although one has been educated as an adjunct and serves a collector of pornography, and the other is a pickpocket who passes by a maid, the author obviously means that they live together in the end. It is a little difficult to swallow, since each conspired to deceive the other. Despite these reservations, I really enjoyed movies. He does not deserve much praise from others. The most fearsome and interesting scenes happen inside the hospice where one of the two young women has been confined until she is able to escape and return to London to bring the story to its unexpected conclusion. Sally Hawkins (Sue) is a very impressive young actress, able to convey cascading emotions and change her character with her facial expressions and her eyes. No doubt we'll see more of her. I certainly hope so.
