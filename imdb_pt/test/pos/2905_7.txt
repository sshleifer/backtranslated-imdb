"The Egyptian" is set during the reign of one of the most fascinating figures of the ancient world, Pharaoh Akhnaton, who thirteen centuries before Christ attempted to introduce a monotheistic religion, the ancient Egyptians. The main character, however, is not Akhnaton, but the fictional Sinuhe. As a baby, Sinuhe is found mysteriously floating in a basket on the Nile River and adopted by doctor Senmut and his wife. As he grows into adulthood, he follows his adoptive father to the medical profession, initially working (as his father) among the poor of the city, but he stands out after he and his friend, the ambitious young soldier Horemheb, save the Pharaoh's life during a desert hunting expedition. Sinuhe is appointed doctor of the court, but is obsessed with the Babylonian courtesan Nefer. Sinuhe not only ruins himself in a vain attempt to win his love but is also dishonored when his neglect of his duties means that he is unable to save the life of Akhnaton's daughter. Sinuhe escapes into exile, where he achieves success as a healer in neighboring countries, but returns to Egypt when he discovers a Hittite plan to invade. Although Akhnaton promptly forgives him for his previous offenses, Sinuhe finds the country in turmoil. Pharaoh's attempts to introduce a new religion have led to civil strife between his followers and those of the priests of the ancient polytheistic faith, and he is very peaceful in nature to take any measures to confront the Hittite threat. Sinuhe engages in a conspiracy of Horemheb, now the general of the Egyptian army, and Akhnaton's sister, Princess Baketamon, to overthrow the pharaoh and replace him with a more effective monarch. <br /> <br /> The weaknesses of the film come mainly from its members. two romantic subplots. In the course of the film, Sinuhe is revealed as the long-lost son of the ancient pharaoh and half-brother of Akhnaton and Baketamon. It may, therefore, surprise the modern audience that she should fall in love with him; marriage between brothers and sisters was not necessarily considered incestuous by the standards of Egyptian royalty, but the standards of the 1950s film audiences were generally less liberal at that point. In any case, the love triangle of Horemheb-Baketamon-Sinuhe is an unnecessary complication and diminishes Baketamon's role in the film, that of the voice of cynical realpolitik and cold-eyed. Nefer's subplot, which occupies most of the first hour of the movie, is overwritten and overly melodramatic. Nefer is morally useless but fascinating, and the role needed an actress of great beauty and also great dramatic ability to make it credible, especially when Nefer achieves the difficult task of conquering Sinuhe away from a woman as lovely as Jean Simmons (who interprets Merit, the rival of Sinuhe by its affections). It is therefore regrettable that the role was for an actress as inept as Bella Darvi, whose only qualification was that she was the producer's lover, Darryl F. Zanuck. Darvi was not just a wooden actress, but she also spoke with a strong foreign accent, made even more incomprehensible by a hunch. She was neither particularly attractive compared to the two legendary Hollywood beauties in the movie, Simmons and Gene Tierney, who play Baketamon. <br /> <br /> The film is best when it focuses on its major political and religious themes. The other actors are better than Darvi, although Peter Ustinov as Sinuhe's employee, Kaptah, makes the same mistake as "Spartacus," that of trying to bring comic relief to a movie that does not need it. Her voice, however, was too patristic for a role of "comedian." <br /> <br /> Edmund Purdom, a little-known British actor, was put on the lead when Marlon Brando retired at the last minute. , but more than adequately fills the shoes of the great man, although his style of acting is quite different. He copes well with the challenge of showing the changes in Sinuhe's character, from unthinking idealist, sickly fool, embittered cynic to the enlightened visionary of the final scenes. Victor Mature has never been the most expressive of the actors, but is well adapted to the role of Horemheb, a man of practical action and down to earth. He is better here than in his other 1954 epic, "Demetrius and the Gladiators." Simmons is luminously beautiful as Merit. Michael Wilding (hitherto known as the second Lord Elizabeth Taylor) plays Akhnaton as a would-be philosopher-king who ends up as a kind of sacred fool. His inability to make difficult decisions makes him an inadequate ruler, but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice that gives him an air of moral grandeur far beyond those who hope to replace him on the throne. Although Aten had more in common with the Supreme Being of the Deists than with Jehovah of the Old Testament or the Trinitarian Christian God, there is a very deliberate attempt to draw parallels between Atheism and Christianity. In the film, the Atheist symbol is the "ankh," undoubtedly chosen because of its resemblance to a cross, but in reality it was an ordinary Egyptian hieroglyph for life, not unique to Atheism. The language of Akhnaton usually has a biblical ring; his comparison of himself with "whistling wind in the wilderness" recalls the "voice of John the Baptist screaming in the wilderness" (hence the title of this review). Sinuhe's discovery on the river resembles the Old Testament story about Moses. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film Sinuhe, who became the heir of the spirit of the dead Akhenaten, attains a moral greatness of his own. The message of the film is that while we may need practical men of action like Horemheb, we also need visionaries and thinkers who are prepared to ask the question "why?" For all its faults, "The Egyptian" is a film that is idealistic and humane in its approach to both religion and politics. 7/10
