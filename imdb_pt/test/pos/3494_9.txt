I love this movie!! maybe it's my generation, but I can really connect with what he's talking about and means doing. It kept me laughing for the duration. duration of the movie, the next day and beyond. I think this movie is not to be seen if you care mainly about the plot and the development of the character. this film is practically only for the generation that will understand it. There are many things that you simply know that were created in that generation that you would not do if you said 40. I think Sacha sterile Cohen was too much and I mean very good. he is a genius. and the reason he's so stupid is because he can make people believe he's a complete idiot, and make him funny at the same time !! Very good movie. strongly recommended!!!! (not so strongly if you are over 30)
