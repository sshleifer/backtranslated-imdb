This movie is worth it despite what you can hear. The performance of Marie Dressler (hopefully I'm spelling correctly) as an old drunk is reason enough to see this movie. It's an incredible performance. She's drunk in three scenes for a long time and never does the same thing twice. You can smell the alcohol when you're done. Amazing. And Greta, of course, speaks her first lines at the movies and she's great. The story of Eugene O'Neill is solid and like most of O'Neill's stories, very deep and intense. This is not light entertainment, but if you enjoy those great characters actors from the 30s and 40s you will enjoy it. Some of the films are technically confusing, but they're all worth it.
