I was not sure of the movie before renting and did so with the assurance that Hilary Swank always gave excellent performances in her films. She seems to rely on restraint to gain the emotional impact she does. And she did not prove that I was wrong in this movie. <br /> <br /> However, the film also had fantastic performances from all the other cast members, both speaking and not speaking. I have to highlight Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor - the two main protagonists - for their excellent acting skills and representation of true human feelings and failures. The whole movie ran almost like a documentary. <br /> <br /> I must applaud Tom Hooper as the director and Avril Beukes as the editor to keep a multi-story story unfolding smoothly, keeping dialogue and action moving in an understandable understanding. fashion. The opening sequence of the South African landscape was striking and I had to press the pause button to taste the photograph. <br /> <br /> Why can such a movie never be nominated for an international award? It seems to me to hit the high rank button in all respects. It was not just a movie that was a real life experience in a country that came out of apartheid. A life of poverty was everywhere, but it celebrated the dignity of the human spirit.
