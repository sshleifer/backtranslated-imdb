The last film by John Huston, the great American director of Irish descent, is an adaptation of the last tale of the first collection "Dubliners", of the greatest writer of all time in Ireland. The film is a family affair. The dying director did so based on the script adapted by his son Tony Huston from one of the most touching, beautiful and profound tales ever written in that language and considered by many the best tale of the English language. John directed his daughter Anjelica in what could be her best on-screen performance. The film is short, only 83 minutes. It has no action sequences, no plot, is almost non-agitated, and may seem slow. Guests, friends and relatives come to the party that takes place in Dublin during the week of the Epiphany in January 1904 at the home of two older sisters who hold an annual dinner with music and dance. What viewers see in the first hour is the piece of conversation together. The guests talk, listen to the music, discuss the latest opera premiere and make jokes, sometimes clumsy. Gradually the conversation turns to friends or relatives long dead whose memory has never disappeared. <br /> <br /> This is the movie you have to stay, let it in, listen to what and how the party guests say how they communicate. Pay attention to body languages, the looks of their faces as they move away from the light, laughter and music from the present to the past, but in fact never left precious memories where the title Dead are not dead but forever young and so alive . If you do, you will be rewarded with the ultimate scene of such emotional power and impact that will always remain with you. It will break your heart into pieces, join them and put you back paralyzed. The film, as well as the story of Joyce, is centered on Gabriel Conroy (Donal McCann as the alter ego of James Joyce gave a very moving, understated performance) as one of the party guests who arrives with his wife Gretta (Anjelica Huston). Gabriel is still in love, feels close bond and fascinates with her. It is after the party, he discovers that even after many years of closeness, he does not know everything about his past, his pains, his regrets and the unforgettable emotions and losses he lived when he was a girl, and he is not part of. For the first time, he looks at her and thinks of her not as the indelible part of her existence, but as another human being with her own inner world, her own loneliness and sadness, and for the first time "a strange and friendly pity." for it has entered into his soul. "It is he who chronicles the most powerful and deepest lines in history:" Snow is general throughout Ireland ... falling feebly across the universe and falling feebly, as the descent of the last end , about all living things and dead. "<br /> <br /> If you have not yet seen the film or read Joyce's story, please. <br /> <br /> They are truly works of art that leave the eternal impression and change something in you for the better.
