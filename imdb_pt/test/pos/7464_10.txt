My friends and I rented this movie simply to satisfy a friend who was very inclined to rent it, though he had no idea what it was about. We all thought it would be like "a Canadian American Pie", but when we watched it, we were completely suprised, we were silent throughout the movie and we loved it! It was nothing like American Pie and there was a storyline that the girls would definitely love (since the guy gets his damn crap at the end), after that night it became my favorite movie not just for the plot, but for the actors. and great writing. There was not a moment when I thought it was unbelievable. Everything is very realistic and relatable for anyone living in a small town with few prospects. I absolutely love this movie and I recommend you rent it the next time you have a chance, it's worth it.
