I do not know why this movie has such a low average of IMDb when it's absolutely everything you could want in a horror movie. This is the definition of being a horror movie. I consider myself a big fan of terror and I must say that this house delivers the goods. Wax House It is the story of a group of college students on their way to a football game that decides to camp at night and run with a weird spot. When they wake up the next morning, they make a horrible discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part. The city is scary and I'm going to stop there. Because that's when truly horrible chaos begins. Trust me when I say that if you are looking for a horror movie, go see this, you will love it. It's wonderfully diabolical and inventive with its murder scenes, the story is interesting and the characters are decently attracted to the actors, giving them a lot of personality. Paris Hilton included who does very well with her part. the film is a bit on the superficial side, but it's a lot of fun and who cares. This movie should swallow the box office and all horror fans should attend. Go see House of Wax, the film that features peeled skin, super glued lips, dead animal carcasses, hot wax sprayed on a person still alive, a finger being cut, a decapitation, a head post, and more. I was lucky enough to witness this movie at the Tribeca premiere and all the actors were on hand to promote the movie. And kid, they have something to boast of House of Wax is the scariest roller coater ride of the year! 9/10
