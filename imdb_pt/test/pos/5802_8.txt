I have to admit that when I saw Madonna singing Holiday on Top of the Pops many years ago, I told my wife "another marvel of American success, doing the whole thing wrong!" Well, she was wearing a scary wig and was horribly dressed. I never grew up to love her the way my daughter does, but I have to eat my words. I like some of her things and sometimes I like her filmed shows. This movie from the Confessions tour is great, even if the song is not (and it's not). I was impressed with the staging and concepts. Madonna's own performance was reinforced by the incredible dancers she chose to support her. My daughter was at the London shows and she was crazy about it. The lady (Madge) proved my initial evaluation of her very wrong !!
