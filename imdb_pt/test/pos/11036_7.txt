The FEELING of the need to have someone who plays the role of referee of public taste and political correctness always gets through our skin. It seems that these self-appointed, self-superior, and pseudo-intellectual types appear everywhere; whether in the family, in the church or in the bowling league. <br /> <br /> THESE are the guys who would have society completely disrespecting and ignoring everything that happened before us; unless, of course, whatever it is, it does not go against the "acceptable" language of today, the customs and general "standards" of "proper" behavior. <br /> <br /> So these days, high-tech book burners are targeting much of Hollywood's greatest achievement; that is, its participation in our own Allied Propaganda through its message and thematically designed altruistic films. <br /> <br /> brutal in its generation, the Forbidden Code and the Now Unacceptable List extend to the War Cartoons that do not meet the new and sensible socially engineered 'official' attitudes; that these "Thought Police" imposed on us. <br /> <br /> We were really surprised to see that there seem to be volumes of such animated short films. Most of what we are aware of is Warner Brothers' LOONEY TUNES and MELODIES MERRIE; with Bugs, Daffy, Elmer & Porky, all in conflict with Hitler, Goerring, 'Il Duce', Tojo and the like. Surprisingly, we found an ample supply of cartoons from MGM, Walt Disney, Lantz, Paramount-Famous Studios and the Brothers Fleischer. <br /> <br /> YOU ARE A MR. JAP (Famous Studios / Paramount Pictures, 1942) is an excellent example of what we are talking about. <br /> <br /> Being virtually indiscernible from the cartoons that were the output of Max and Dave Fleischer's studios before the 1941 coup that moved them out, bringing the new name of "Famous" Studios, YOU ARE A SR . The JAP did not give any of the plot elements that would reduce the last day of Popeye Cartoons to the level of the last short film of formula. <br /> <br /> We all remember how we would have Popeye and Olive Oyl together. Enter Bluto, usually the whistle-wolf exponent and an acceptable screen version of a masculine reaction to feminine neatness. Olive falls in love with less than Bluto's honorable attentions; until he gets a little physical and invariably lets out: "Hey, Babe, how about a kiss?" At this point, we hear "Socorro! Socorro, Popeye and the little sailor appear to save the day, full of the obligatory can of Spinach!" We exaggerate, Schultz? ONCE again this cartoon from JAP SAP is nothing like any of this .Oh course, follows the storyline of now having Popeye in the US Navy.The brothers Fleischer put the boy on the service in 1941 to settle for the mood in the country and as an open gesture of support for the men now being recruited in the first draft in time of peace in the history of the United States Max and Dave even put Popeye on duty aboard the legendary battleship, USS Pensyltucky. <br /> <br /> OUR point is just that.YOU ARE A SAP MR JAP and others as SPINACH FER Britain is not a comic book vehicle for comic relief on the Theater program but rather a sort of Editorial Cartoons grouping much like any Great Metropolitan Newspaper, yet a panel of illustrations, have charac that are highly symbolic and representative of nations, ideas and ideals, as a just and lasting peace. In most cases, the hero (Popeye, Bugs Bunny or whoever) is alone with the symbol of the Enemy. Both are highly exaggerated visual metaphors for abstract concepts and thoughts; even if they are wrapped in humorous armor for greater palatability. OUR liberal stupidity (the antithesis of intelligence) may not be seen like this; but for this kind of behavior, they are nothing more than burners of Neo-Nazi books. <br /> <br /> PLEASE let future generations see and appreciate a vision of past events that are both Historical and Humoristic. <br/> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
