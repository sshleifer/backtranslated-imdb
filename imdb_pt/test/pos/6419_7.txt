Footprints is a very interesting movie that is a bit difficult to categorize. "Psychological Thriller" is the most appropriate description I can imagine. The female protagonist, Alice Cespi, discovers that she does not remember anything from the last three days. The only clue she has is a ripped photo of a hotel. She is also haunted by a recurring and vivid dream about a sci-fi movie she believes she has seen many years ago. In her pursuit of the truth behind her amnesia, she does not trust anyone but it gradually becomes obvious that she has visited the city where the hotel is located before. This is an exciting movie whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how events will unfold and, particularly, how it will end. The unusual solitude of the main character and the lack of reliability of all others ensure that good old paranoid sentiment is present throughout the film, while beautiful colors and some spectacular sequences filmed make this film visually appealing as well. The important part of the unique and unique Nicoletta Elmi, the all-time children's star and favorite of the Italian horror, is an extra bonus.
