Anywhere But Here is not exactly anything new, but the outstanding performance of both leading actresses made it worth watching. Sarandon and Portman are a mother and daughter moving from rural Wisconsin to sunny Beverly Hills, California, in search of a better life. The main conflict comes from the fact that Natalie preferred to stay in Wisconsin with all her friends and family, and she felt that she was forced to go to California with her domineering mother. While it is true that the film as a whole is disappointingly predictable, Susan Sarandon and especially Natalie Portman present such good performances that they almost make the material look like new. Anywhere But Here does not cover any new fields but has the rare quality of being able to pick up the subject too much and make it quite interesting again. Also seen in this film is the most moving facial expression seen in years seen on the face of Natalie Portman when her mother leaves her on the side of the road and she watches the car disappear in the distance. Particularly noteworthy is the ironic subplot about Natalie's mother pressing her to become an actress as well as a very convincing performance from Shawn Hatosy as one of Natalie's closest cousins ​​back home. His death is a tragic cliché almost always seen in movies like this, but the rest of the film makes up for countless weaknesses like that. Not great, but anywhere, but here is definitely worth a look.
