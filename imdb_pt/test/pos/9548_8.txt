I saw the film in Izmir as the closing of the Izmir film festival. I knew nothing about it, but now I'm glad I did not turn down the chance to see Ding-a-ling-less! It's one of the funniest movies I've ever watched and I believe I've seen zillions of movies !! (I'm a film critic!) Smart Script and Dialogues ... Smart Details ... What more can I say? An indie masterpiece with a totally original style of humor ... You can not be amazed at what he's capable of right now. Ding-a-ling less was killed five years ago and I'm sure director Onur Tukel is more mature now. I've heard that your next feature will be a political satire and I can not wait to see it too with your previous work, like "House of Pancakes" ...
