A Brief History of Time. The cosmological content of this documentary is fascinating, the provocative thoughts and the man ... brilliant. However, I had a hard time enjoying this documentary. <br /> <br /> The way family members and teachers are interviewed seems unnatural. These members were interviewed in sets specifically constructed and were directed uncomfortably. Most of the time, their reports seemed to be very fierce and vigorously directed. A (deliberate) non-inclusion of questions asked manipulates the information given in a very hard and impersonal format. <br /> <br /> I do not know who is responsible for the interview, but they did a terrible job and it took the experience to watch. <br /> <br /> Overall, a fascinating documentary that is worth seeing, just for the interesting concepts presented.
