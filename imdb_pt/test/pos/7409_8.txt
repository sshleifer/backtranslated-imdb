This is one of my personal favorites, a rare gem that seems to be unfamiliar to the general population. Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson form the heart of the play in a well-chosen cast. Few films captured the real hostilities that sustained the Civil War, but this one seems to capture all the right tones and moods. If you're a fan of the book, Cold Mountain, try this movie and see if you do not think it's a good addition.
