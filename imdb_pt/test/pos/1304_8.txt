I just found the full set of 3 DVDs at Wal-Mart on the bargain for $ 5.50, so I thought I'd take another look. Total of 13 hours to watch everything (26 episodes). I was born in 1948 and saw most of them on TV in the sixties. Many independent stations have repeated them for many years. <br /> <br /> Better than I expected, time has been kind to the obvious sincerity of its creators, and with the obvious gratitude and respect they give to allied fighters. and women. More abstract and artistic than a direct documentary, but very true in its representation of the causes and final results of World War II. This war depended heavily on shipping, and the ultimate victory depended on whoever was the ultimate ruler of the world's oceans. The Allies were the ones who were able to do so. Interesting too, to see how they try to find a balance between the great events, and the individual soldiers and sailors who made them happen. The score is impressive, if a little too much by today's standards. I read somewhere that Robert Russell Bennett contributed as much as Richard Rodgers for the final score. I imagine Rodgers provided all the major themes, and Bennett was willing to fit them into the pictures. Great job! <br /> <br /> It should be seen by every ruler, or potential ruler. A warning to tyrants that wars end up being defeated by ideals, determination and supplies to support them. Logistics: its quality and delivery will determine the eventual winners. The Allies produced and surpassed the material quality of the Axis, attacked its own source in the process, and ensured its eventual defeat. <br /> <br /> I regret to see that the producer, Henry Salomon, lived a very short life. The facts of the IMDb were a bit miserable, I have to find out more about it. He made some more remarkable documentaries before his untimely death. It may have more to say at a later time <br /> <br /> Curiosities: I had all 3 LP records made with background music, very good overall. Unfortunately, the producers decided to add sound effects to the latter, relegating it immediately to novelty status, rather than listening to serious music. Too bad too, because it contained some interesting but smaller themes in the series. Silly things like 16-inch firing guns, torpedoes being fired, bulldozers, airplanes ... mostly for children. <br /> <br /> RSGRE
