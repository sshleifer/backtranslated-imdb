This movie is about a very delicate argument and if you are looking for something that makes you think here you are right. Tim Robbins has done a wonderful job and the result is a kind of docu-drama that must be shown in schools (for the strong issues addressed). What about the actors? Well, they're just great; Susan Sarandon is truly 'the face of love' and Sean Penn is unbelievable as almost always. It is absolutely a must see!
