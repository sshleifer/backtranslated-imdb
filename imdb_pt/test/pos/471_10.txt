This was a fantastic film about two people, a young teenager, and another, a middle-aged man, each looking for someone to help them fill a certain void left by their loved ones. <br /> <br /> Both actors give brilliant performances that various audiences can relate to. The script, though written by Gorman Bechard, seems to have been written from the point of view of a woman. And at the same time, men can relate to the male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the film. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected turnaround that leaves you speechless. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one. It is clear in this movie that you are not alone.
