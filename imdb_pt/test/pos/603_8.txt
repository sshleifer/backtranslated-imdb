You know, it's very interesting to see this ... half of the people involved with him are dead ... Anyway, I have not seen anything related to Muppet for a long time, but that stuff is pure gold. I'm a big fan of puns, and this movie puts them well-positioned, but one of the surprising aspects of this is the rhythm: it's not really the rhythm of high-speed kids where filmmakers randomly decide to move the story without giving depth to character, is just a kind of movements along with the characters, wherever they want to go. <br /> <br /> Kermit the Frog is just an incredible character. His voice and the expressions on his puppet face are fantastic. But most of all, he points out why he is popular - "he can sing and make jokes too!" - but more appropriately because he is so captivating - he, without any effort, inspires everyone to search for his dreams. Meanwhile, he also has to deal with himself, which is an uncommon theme in family films. <br /> <br /> It also contains a set of comedians making appearances here and there, some with great effect, some for a little less (I think Mel Brook's part was a little overdone, is not it?). Some parts of the movie are kinda weird. But it is highly imaginative and leads to the same fate in a very different direction. <br /> <br /> Continuing ... <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
