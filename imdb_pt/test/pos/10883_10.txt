This game requires stealth, smart and a steady hand. The gameplay is simply the best; In addition, the interesting extras - bullet holes are on the walls, enemies react to specific points where they have been hit by bullets, tons of animations captured by movements that make enemies seem very real (eg looking through a window to a guard that he will stand there striking, sneezing or scratching himself), the list goes on. This is the best licensed / movie conversion of all time and puts you in the place of the most super spy. This game is the best reason to own an N64.
