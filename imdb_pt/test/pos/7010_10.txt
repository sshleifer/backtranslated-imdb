I watched this movie at least 30 times, maybe more, and every time I watch, I'm drawn to the movie and I'm going back to 1963! The movie takes me on a nostalgic vacation every time I watch. <br /> <br /> I think the important thing to say here is that I was 15 years old in 1963 and I remember "before President Kennedy was shot and before the beetles came." I can feel myself saying something like "I carried a watermelon". and then realizing how stupid it was! Jennifer Gray plays Frances "Baby" Houseman in Dirty Dancing. The baby will start college in the fall. She goes to Kellerman's on vacation with her family (mother, father and sister Lisa). <br /> <br /> One of the dancers, Penny (played by Cynthia Rhodes) impregnates another person on the team (one of the boys' colleges played by Max Cantor) and has a chance to have an abortion, but it is one night that she and Johnny (Patrick Swayze) are scheduled to dance in a nearby hotel. <br /> <br /> So, the need for a penny dancer for Penny. Johnny is persuaded by Penny and his cousin Billy (Neal Jones) that he can teach Baby to do the dance in time for the show. The baby learning the dance steps with Penny and Johnny are wonderful scenes! <br /> <br /> The baby's father (Dr. Jake Houseman played by Jerry Orbach) comes to Penny's rescue when the abortion is done wrong. Dirty Dancing brought it back to me this time in history when the girls got pregnant and had miscarriages in the back rooms by butchers. Around that time (1963) many girls actually died from this type of abortion - but there were not many options for a girl at the time. <br /> Lonnie Price plays a great grandson (Neil Kellerman) for Jack Weston's Max. Kellerman Jane Brucker does a great job as Baby's annoying sister, Lisa Houseman. <br /> <br /> The music is great and the dance is wonderful! The "dirty dancers" are absolutely wonderful and very sexy - I can feel Baby's amazement when she sees them dancing and says, "Where did they learn to do that?" <br /> <br /> Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze are perfect together in their respective roles. Patrick's song "She's Like The Wind" brings tears to my eyes every time I hear / watch in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film ends on a note, but leaves you wondering what happens next in the lives of Baby and Johnny. Dirty Dancing gives something new every time it is watched - It hypnotizes the observer with nostalgia, a feeling of wanting it to be 1963 again.
