From today's point of view, it is quite ridiculous to rate this film 18 (or X in the US). The film has a sexual erotic story, albeit sublime, to tell, but the images are quite innocent. Throughout the film you feel and see the spirit of the late 60's and early 70's fashionable, dialogues and typical experimental filmmaking and lighting. And this is exactly the part that makes it worth seeing.
