I just want to say that the role of Chris Diamantopoulos as Williams for the whole show was worthy of Emmy. It was strange how well he did. And to be as fast, as random and creative as Robin Williams is ... WOW. There were scenes in which Diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 lines of fast fire and make 15 different characters while delivering these lines, everything sounds like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing these characters ... well, that my friends are awesome acting. It's one thing to do an imitation of Robin Williams for a few minutes. It's another to do this for a whole TV movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know how I felt about the whole show, and I do not know how much they played with the facts, but I know it was Chris Diamantopoulos who kept me watching. So for that, I give him 10.
