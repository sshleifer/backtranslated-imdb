Eager electronics creator Brian Foster (Wesley Eure's delightful performance of "Land of the Lost") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Ralph Norton (well played by Conrad Baain) whose domestic security company is struggling. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to put their dirty hands in C.H.O.M.P.S .; This task is easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey recounts the charismatic and dopey story at a steady pace, maintains a friendly, silly and cheerful tone, and plays the silly jokes with a handsome twist. In addition, the game has shaped everything with infectious ease: the lovely Valerie Bertinelli as Brian Casey Norton's sweet boyfriend, Chuck McCann as the Brooks gutter, Red Buttons as McCann Bracken's equally awkward partner Jim Backus as the evil CEO Mr. Gibbs, Hermoine Baddeley as good old biddy Mrs. Foster, and 60 years of regular AIP holding feature Larry Bishop as smarmy, dutiful suit Ken Sharp. Best of all, the titular dog is a cute treat: C.H.O.M.P.S. He jumps through fences, walls and windows with incredible agility, performs acts of exceptional strength, runs faster than a deer, and still does some cool martial arts moves. A subplot on a huge hunting dog called Monster provides some extra laughter in the belly (Monster is voiced by some uncredited guy with an appropriately deep pink voice). The groovy animated opening animation, the brilliant cinematography of Charles F. Wheeler and the vibrant and vibrant soundtrack of Hoyt Curtin are also solid. A cute little children's movie.
