I read about 10 reviews of this movie, but I did not take any of them "to the heart". Harrison Ford is being criticized for everything from his haircut to the earring and I really do not see what these things have to do with the film. As I recall, he had bad hair plus bad reviews on Blade Runner, but it's still a favorite among us videophiles. It's slower than most of his previous films, but it's not worth the dumps he got. <br /> <br /> I would be happy to pay $ 7.50 just to watch Harrison Ford bald cut his lawn.
