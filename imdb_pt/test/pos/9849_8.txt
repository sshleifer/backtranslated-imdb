Peak Practice was a British drama series about GP surgery at Cardale? a small fictional town in the Derbyshire Peak District? and the doctors who worked there. He worked at ITV from 1993 to 2002 and was one of his most successful series at the time. He originally starred Kevin Whately as Dr. Jack Kerruish, Amanda Burton as Dr. Beth Glover, and Simon Shepherd as Dr. Will Preston, although the list of doctors changed many times over the course of the series. <br /> <br /> The series was cut in 2002 and ended in a literal cliffhanger when two of the main characters of the series crashed off a cliff. Viewers wrote to ITV by the thousands and a petition for a final episode was created by Peak Practice Online. However, all requests were unsuccessful and ITV said they would not do more episodes. <br /> <br /> Peak Practice was replaced by Sweet Medicine, another medical series in Derbyshire. It lasted a few episodes before being taken off schedule. Cardale was based in the village of Crich in Derbyshire, and the series was filmed there and in other neighboring towns and villages of Derbyshire, most notably Matlock and Ashover. After completing this program, ITV attempted to launch a follow-up series called Sweet Medicine, which extended the stories of different characters from the original show.
