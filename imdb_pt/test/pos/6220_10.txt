Jäniksen vuosi is one of Jarva's most political films. It takes position strongly against the authority status of modern society in the life of the common man, and how it completely alienated men from nature. It challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare society. Vatanen (Antti Litja) - struggling to buy the concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations - tries to shake the chains of society, escaping everything into the desert of northern Finland - only to realize that the concept of a "free country" is not so unequivocal, in other words, society has the common man by the balls. <br /> <br /> Yet what makes Jäniksen vuosi so exceptional - beyond visual and humorous brilliance - is how it seems to illustrate the whole political atmosphere in Finland in the 1970s, as well as the whole identity of Finland as a nation . Vatanen is like an archetype of a classic Finnish in his solitude and social longevity. Since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of Finnish us, the whole idea that it is carried slowly by modern society makes Jäniksen emotionally exceptionally poignant.
