No, I did not see the original series and I will not compare the two if I had. This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well written in a different story every week. Some are little out there, but most of the time it is the quality of the narration. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a reptilian species of lizards. It's funny how lizards and reptiles are our favorite evil aliens like V, but anyway he has three days to program a man who is fully brainwashed to serve alien species on Earth. The stories are usually a bit out there but very fun to watch.
