A train that holds union soldiers is carrying $ 300,000 worth of gold along with a banker Clayton who is there to see he arrives at his destination but is suddenly stolen by the bandit Monetero. However, Bahunda grabs the gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get him out of it, he is killed by soldiers. The only clue is a medallion, but Monetero is captured and soon would be executed. A stranger dressed as a priest comes (who after Monetero's reward) and offers to save his life for half the gold. In exchange, Monetero gives him half of the medallion, but Clayton realizes and discovers that something is happening. Soon, the three are crossing the gold, but also the bank's insurance company and the Monetero gang are waiting for their chance to attack. <br /> <br /> Just watching the opening sequence, you will know of you. It takes a spaghetti western with an ironic style and a confidence to sprinkle many references (some well done) from other films (largely the Dollar trilogy) of its subgenre. The animated direction of director Enzo Castellari is sprawling and mostly lightweight, but there is potential in many of his large and showy parts and soft rhythmic rhythm. Largely there are a lot of fights, fist fights (and lots of acrobatics) going on compared to violent shootings. However, most of these acrobatics are very well done and very enjoyable, and when the guns are on fire, there is energy to burn. Traditional history is close to conventional details, but since there is so much connivance and carelessness, the spontaneous nature ensures that you are never sure how it will wind up unfolding between the three. This leads to many effective moments of suspense, clever twists and lots of winking, winking. The humor inside the starch script is pretty crafty. Worked favorably between the light and spicy style, is the dynamically stretched framing of Giovanni Bergamini and the impulsive score of Francesco De Masi. The performances are extremely well done and form a striking relationship. George Hilton's weird twist is solid as the ambiguous stranger. Gilbert Roland brings class and intelligence to his formidable Mexican bandit Monetero. Edd Byrnes gives a balanced performance like Clayton, who keeps well. Kareen O'Hara does not have much to do, but it's worth seeing. Gerard Herter, Pedro SÃ¡nchez and Ivano Staccioli provide capable support. <br /> <br /> A fun and dignified parody of spaghetti / homage that throws a curve-ball after another and many foul-mouthed 'n' dirty antics.
