I can be a sentimentalist. But I found this movie really moving. It was the first film that reduced me to tears. And it happened more than once !! I recommend to all gays and str8. Religious or not! Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with their liners. The nudity scenes were superbly crafted too, and all were tasteful. Most shocking was the portrait of the deprogramming of the reversal of the Mormon church's orientation toward the main character. I was shocked that this still happens in the world. However, I enjoyed this movie tremendously. This is definitely the best gay film since the Torch Song Trilogy. And much better than the offer of another gay movie that year - The Fluffer.
