This short film aims to focus on an issue sociologically known as cultural shock. the film presents the condition of average Romanian in democratic Romania who discovers that life and problems are no different from the communist period, and if you want something, you need to bribe to get it. <br /> <br /> Our main character is fired after a long time, he is about 50 years old and needs to get a similar job, but the only available job is an inferior one. He is forced to accept it because of the lack of money. <br /> <br /> My opinion is that you have to live in Romania so that this movie can be as real and tragic as it seems.
