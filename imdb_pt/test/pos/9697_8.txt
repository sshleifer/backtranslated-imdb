This movie was hilarious! Occasionally gone too far, but is not that what we expect from them? The theater roared with laughter and ooooooed at all the incredibly crazy acrobatics. It is rude, crude and occasionally frighteningly intense. The whole class is back and even more out of it, which, in turn, provides great entertainment. I do not want to give anything, but the little clips of clips around the net are nothing compared to what comes next. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie to go see with friends. Try to see it with a large crowd. You will not be disappointed. Just do not go with someone who can not take you (see above). It will not end well, you can be sure of that. But this is pretty obvious at first. If you liked the first, you will loooooove this.
