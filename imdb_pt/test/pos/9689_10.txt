seriously people need to light up and just accept that funny is funny, and this movie is fucking and hilarious. Better than the first and Knoxville actually grew a couple for this movie and did crazier stunts then the first. If Ebert and Roper (not saying I'm a big fan of them) can look beyond the sheer idiocy of this movie enough to give it two thumbs up, so I think other people can. I was not sure what to expect from this, but I was shocked and it's rare when a sequel is better than the original. This new self I believe exceeds the first great moment. so do what I did, just relax the kick back try not to vomit on some points and give a laugh.
