"Joe" is one of those movies in which, although you think it can go well, it ends up hitting you like ... I can not make an analogy. It showed not only that the idea of ​​America's long standing was debatable, but also the various aspects within our society. Melissa Compton (Susan Sarandon) is the best flower daughter, while her father, Bill (Dennis Patrick), is a flawless executive. One day, Bill accidentally kills Melissa's boyfriend. Immediately, Bill becomes familiar with Joe Curran (Peter Boyle), an ultra-rightist, radically racist. As a result, the two end up becoming more and more associated with the hippies, which Bill finds unpleasant and Joe hates. But in the end, everything has serious and serious consequences. It is true that some parts of the film are a bit dated, but it is a good juxtaposition of both sides of America during the Vietnam War. And rest easy, the residual effects of it all will probably never go away.
