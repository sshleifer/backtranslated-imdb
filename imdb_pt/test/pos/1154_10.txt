Ok, I'm a history buff, and alright, I'm an action movie addict, so, of course, this movie is in my top ten of all time. I really love the action scenes and unique weaponry of the period. I sort of doubt to fight the two-handed sword, and the Raisuli sword looks more like the katana than the scimitar, oh well I never fought on horseback either. <BR> <BR> I also love the attempts at philosophical proverbs. The typical member of the desert tribe probably could not read the Koran, so they accepted his word. Several writers criticized Connery's accent; youth, I met a family of South Africans in our west, Dinosaur National Monument, and although they spoke African to each other (yes, second generation Germans can hear the difference), they spoke English with a Scottish accent. It seems that anyone who teaches you affects your pronunciation.Scottish Missionary?
