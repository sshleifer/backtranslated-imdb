It's a shame that Asterix and his friend Obelix do not have the worldwide recognition that other comic cartoon characters have. <br /> <br /> This is another funny Asterix drawing that is full of entertainment. The animation is great and the Voice characterization is good, even if the synchronization is a bit different. The music and score fit well into the story and the introduction of some modern musical numbers is a nice touch. <br /> <br /> The running time seems short and is not the best story of Asterix or the most developed design, it's good clean fun. Modern animation (Disney type) will capture children, Asterix fans and newcomers ... Enjoy the Gaulish adventure!
