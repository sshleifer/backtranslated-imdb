This movie is probably the best new French movie I've seen in this century so far. There were some great ones, including Noe's Irreversible, Le Pont des Arts de Green and Hadzihalilovic's Innocent, but none of them came close to the timeless glory of Les Amants Reguliers. <br /> <br /> The film is a description of the events of May '68 and what followed after that and in addition it is an update and a tribute to the films Nouvelle Vague of the time. As for the depiction of the riots in Paris, the film is meticulously accurate (I'm only 19 and it was not there, but you know what I mean) and the almost real-time and very long riot scenes set the stage perfectly for the movie. the aftermath of events in the streets of Paris. The riots are not glorified or beautifully photographed like those of Bertolucci's The Dreamers (to which the film is comparable in many ways), instead they are filmed in dirty black and white photos, courtesy of the excellent William Lubtchansky. The love story that is the main concern of the film after the riots in '68 is filmed in stunning and much less blurred photos and can evoke true feelings of love and teenage confusion amid a politically concerned and seemingly cold environment. > <br /> This film is a beautiful love story and radiates through it that the director wants to describe his own experiences of those mythical late 60's, which makes the film even more appealing. But the film is also a tribute to the entire canon Nouvelle Vague. Much of the dialogue evokes Truffaut early, and the length and non-action and less structure plot is reminiscent of Eustache or Rivette. There are even Godard-like greenish effects with people looking directly at the camera and even approaching Bernardo Bertolucci directly. This film is undoubtedly a response song for Bertolucci's The Dreamers and is also a Nouvelle Vague tribute, but it still stands out as a beautiful and radiant love story. <br /> <br /> In short: This movie is incredible and if you love French cinema, you should not sleep in it. It may be the best French film since La Mamain et la Putain, by Eustache.
