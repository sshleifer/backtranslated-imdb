THE GREEN HUCKERS (Anders Thomas Jensen - Denmark, 2003). <br /> <br /> How do the Danes continue to create these films that are consistently funny, clearly written, filmed to perfection and full of great performances? THE GREEN BUTCHERS is a dark and maliciously funny comedy, in many ways the Danish counterpart of EATING RAOUL and DELICATESSEN, but it has more to offer than just laughter or parody. <br /> <br /> The film brings us the chronic marijuana double Bjarne (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) and the chronic sweat Svend (Mads Mikkelsen). Tired of their evil boss, the two friends decide to open their own butcher shop in a small Danish town, but initially the business is slow and customers stay away. When an electrician is accidentally locked and freezes in his meat cabinet, Svend decides to turn the man's thigh into fillets which he readily dubbed "chickie-wickies." This special dish suddenly has everyone in town gathered on their counter and Svend - unable to resist this sudden leap in popularity - turns into a serial killer with Bjarne acting as his reluctant accomplice. But soon, led by his former boss, many people in town are starting to wonder what special ingredients the two men are wearing. <br /> <br /> Without the extraordinary performances of Kaas and Mikkelsen, the film may not have risen above the level of the average black comedy. On paper, Svend's character may approach the caricature, but the portrait of Mads Mikkelsen is of a serious, insecure and deeply distorted man, but Mikkelsen manages to make it scary, funny and moving at the same time. Kaas actually plays a double role, also throwing his twin into a coma, Eigil. While watching the movie, I did not even realize it was the same actor. The other performances are so wonderful, with all the characters in town nicely off the hook, with some really wonderful vignettes. <br /> <br /> The subject is - of course - a bit morbid and the material may not be completely fresh. , considering some predecessors who dealt with the same type of material, but director Jensen gives him a twist and manages to build some real characters with the strange pair of Svend and Bjarne, with this wonderfully bizarre tale of two social mismatches. /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
