I admit, I had the opportunity in the past to watch this movie, and after 5 to 10 minutes, I felt like many. I was expecting a Monkey movie that looked like the television show, but instead I was given ... well, I did not know what I was given to be honest. <br /> <br /> However, after finally watching In this movie, I realized that not only did I have a closed mind for the brilliance it represents, I also saw myself watching over and over again. It's the only movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert as I try to decipher their meanings. And when I think I discovered something in the movie, the answer is destroyed when I watch the movie again. Brilliance, indeed. <br /> <br /> It seems like most people who did not like this movie are wanting to watch a movie with a clearly clear plot. They want everything explained and all the questions answered at the end. Well, sorry, if that's what you're after, this is not the movie for you. But if you like movies like The Matrix (and better yet, its sequels), I think you'll enjoy the thought-provoking and stimulating experience this movie will give you. <br /> <br /> Think of the movie as a dream. In our dreams, things do not make sense, the things we expect to happen do not, people, places and things do not speak, act or function in the same way as in reality. Complaining about "Head" is like complaining about a dream you had and you felt you could not understand. The mind is a complex system, and since a movie titled "Head" is so complex, is it so difficult to relate the two? <br /> <br /> The music (and the musical numbers) really stand out, especially Peter Tork's two compositions, which remain the best tracks in the film, "Can You Dig It?" and "Long title: Do I have to do all this again?" <br /> <br /> This film proves that The Monkees were much more than just four zanny in a pre-fab group (as critics called them) on a television show, but that they are actually a lot more intelligent and talented than the world would believe them. There are so many messages that can be drawn from the film, both in relation to The Monkees and the 'entertainment industry' in general, which stands out as a film masterpiece that was way ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> I feel, if this movie had been released as an independent piece at this time, it would really bring the respect and admiration it deserves. <br /> <br /> And a final note: We could compare this to the Beatles' movie "Magical Mystery Tour," since the Beatles movie looked so strange and bizarre. However, in my opinion, "Head" is far above anything the Beatles put on the celluloid.
