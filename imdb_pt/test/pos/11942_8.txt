I gave this 8 stars a possible 10. He had an excellent plot, and Peter Coyote and Michele Lee, as well as the rest of the cast, did their share well. <br /> <br /> Peter and Michele were too long in the tooth for the ages that their characters should be, and their children in the film would obviously have been better suited to be their grandchildren. <br /> <br /> I missed the first ten minutes of this movie, so I do not know exactly how this body appeared after 25 years and was traced back to Denny Traynor (Peter Coyote's character), but I had no trouble picking up the story. Barbara Traynor (Michele Lee) is shocked when her longtime husband, Denny, is arrested for a murder in Oregon about 25 years earlier, a state that Denny claims never entered. <br /> <br /> However, as evidence huddles Denny, his story changes. Then his story changes again and again, until Barbara does not know what to believe. <br /> <br /> Barbara decides, however, to get to the bottom of the mystery that revolves around the fateful time of Denny and a young girl named Sherry accepted a ride from a stranger named Wayne Kennedy, who ended up in murder. <br /> <br /> I found the film to be fun, well paced, and it made me guess what had really happened between those three people. <br /> <br /> From what I saw during the final credits, this seemed to be based on a true story.
