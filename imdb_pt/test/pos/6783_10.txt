This game is one of the best horror / sniper games I have ever played. The plot is a little hectic, but the game never fails to send you many shivers and excitement. Many people filed the game when they discovered that there are no codes for it and very little health and ammunition potion to be found. But in fact, once you have gone through the game once, you are more familiar with the monsters and different rooms then you can easily reach the second time. The puzzles are great, not too difficult, not too easy. There are tons of different monsters so you never get bored. And there are many play areas. You really feel like you're in a good Stephen King novel while you play. It's cool and scary. Choose this cheap game and enjoy yourself.
