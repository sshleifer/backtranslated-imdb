A murder thriller shaped like Day Of The Jackal in the line of fire has the twist that Eastwood veteran bodyguard Frank Horrigan is bothered by the failure of the past at work. Persecution becomes personal, as John Malkovich's reptilian killer, Leary, insults him about this neurosis - with the awkward exception of a good woman's love (Russo's Lilly Raines), nothing is going to leave Frank in peace, than to take Leary personally. Malkovich is a volatile presence - not simply fuel on the screen, but often a mutable actor as well. This is one of his good films, focused and playing the game of director Petersen. Eastwood is too old, but a) the public does not care, because it is him and b) his age is written in the script, not just in the narrative, but also as a recurring joke. Pretty much as you'd expect, but well managed. 7/10
