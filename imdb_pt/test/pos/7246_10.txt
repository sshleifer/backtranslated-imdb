I give 10 out of 10, not because the plot was hard to figure out because it was not ... but because it leaves a caring for the characters. The performance throughout the cast is superb, especially Joan Hickson, and it's a wonderful episode because of your heart. <br /> <br /> Miss Marple is invited by Jason Rafiel's death request to investigate and resolve a murder that happened some seven or eight years earlier, and she has to find out who, why, and when she goes along. Mr. Rafiel is the same Rafiel who was in A Mystery of the Caribbean and therefore there is a sense of connection here. <br /> <br /> Nemesis is definitely one of the amateur psychologists among us, and if you're one of those who just gets happy with a lot of blood, courage and action sequences, then you will not like it. But if you're like me, someone who loves to know about people and find out what motivates them, then the Nemesis is the one for you.
