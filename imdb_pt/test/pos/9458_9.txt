When I went to see this movie, I thought it would be just another fancy movie that I would have to bear with my sister. In addition, the last film by Amanda Baynes was not so hot, making me doubt the film because she is the main actress. However, within 5min I was laughing so much that I had tears in the eyes, the jokes were not " out there "then a second to understand, but very funny. The script was not so complex that I could not understand the love triangle, but it was very faithful to Shakepeare's original piece. I loved every minute so much that I kicked a two seater guy away from me in a fit of giggle lol !!! very embarrassing! I definitely advise people to watch this movie especially for girls, since the guys in this movie are really hot! (Lol) so much that I could just put it on DVD.
