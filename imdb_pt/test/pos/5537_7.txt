The only problem with Married to the Mob is that it's not funny. He dresses up exactly like a romantic comedy, but almost nothing that happens is funny. But if you can see it as a movie in which almost nothing funny happens, you will have a great time. It's a flash mob movie, too, according to the title. Extremely flashy. But the director, Jonathan Demme, is one of the few cult directors who completely and completely embraced the 1980s in his work of that decade, rather than pretending it was still the 1970s. initials combine Animation from the 1980s, Italian-Americanism and Mise-en-scene mingle upon each other at the same time. From there, despite 1980, it seems right. The lighting of Demme's frequent director of photography, Tak Fujimoto, and the pop-filled jukebox soundtrack and several alternative jams are eye-catching and in fact controlled and differentiated as part of the atmosphere. Demme is good at instantaneously colored characterizations in his visual composition and sometimes seemingly impetuous of a fun mix of styles, a plot that could have gone either way, where an FBI agent, played by a very tasteless Matthew Modine, trying to infiltrate a Mafia family sees a chance when a mule of arms, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, tries to leave the criminal lifestyle after her husband, in exactly what you would expect in a performance of Alec Baldwin, is surprised The way it works works by Demme seems to have a steady hand at the wheel. He knows the significance of showing us the very subjective and relatable scenes of home life with Pfeiffer, as well as his cares and yearnings as a morally conflicted mother, though his relationship with his son Joey is somewhat assured. The mobster's son is listening to the party-loving mother when Daddy's boss, joked with Dean Stockwell's trademark naturalness and by far the protagonist who steals the cast scene, is giving him incredible gifts? On the whole, Demme's stylizations are easily seen as a novel about a fun crime thriller. <br /> <br /> Ultimately though, we find that we are going the wrong way, because inevitably, Modine and Pfeiffer need to fall in love. This is not inherently bad, and everyone here and there seems really supportive, but as a romantic subplot, it is not treated in an interesting way, or almost not, because it skips into several diverse clich√©s, which fulfill the initial expectation of a 1980s tacky date film, and for this audience, I think it has the right impact. But for someone who is genuinely interested in history and the aesthetic approach, it is a disillusionment in a state of boredom. <br /> <br /> So it's a decent movie with big mistakes at certain points, but as a date film or a nostalgic piece for those who grew up in the 80s, they may have seen many date films in the 1980s , the entertainment value is not so likely to fluctuate, except for the said deficit in true laughter. There are perhaps some scoffers, and it's very largely ironic, but I would not leave the comedy hall with the high hopes with which I would have initially entered. Whatever the case, there are additional joys in small roles for great actors now beginning to disappear, such as Nancy Travis, Joan Cusack and Oliver Platt.
