Super original Really great movie! James Franco and Sienna Miller really go so well together onscreen. I hope you get out soon. I first saw this movie on a display. Because of my age and sex, I was asked to stay "talking". We were all able to comment on the movie and many people did not like it. I really loved it and I do not know why so many people did not think it was that good. Go see when to leave and decide for yourself! One thing you may want to do if you are going to see this movie is to get into it without knowing anything about it. I did not know anything when I went to the exhibit, not to be called "Camile." Really worth seeing.
