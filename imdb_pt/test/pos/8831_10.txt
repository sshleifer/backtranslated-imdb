Duck_of_Death needs to watch this movie again, as his main criticism is completely unfounded. The film never forgot the delay time, and was mentioned explicitly in some places. The crew was never shown having conversations with the control of the mission that did not obey the rules of delay. <br /> <br /> One thing I think was a little overdone was the amount of risk involved - would it be a crew on a planet where the pressure suits would last only two hours? I doubt it. Would a manned spacecraft enter the crown of a star? I doubt it. Would humans land on a moon being bombarded with massive amounts of radiation? I doubt it. In addition, the ship seemed overly robust. Would a ship so designed would risk atmospheric flight to slow it down? I doubt it. Would he survive being struck by comet debris? I doubt it. I think in both cases the stress on the structure would be too much. But overall, improbable scenarios have been offset by some well-made special effects, good editing and production, and some good performances, especially by the actors playing the ship's commander and the Russian cosmonaut.
