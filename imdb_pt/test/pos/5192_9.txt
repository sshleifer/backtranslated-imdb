I found the film very real as much as the Rescue of Private Ryan and gave an initial account of the German perspective. The graphic action and the individual characters gave a lot to this movie to keep me interested throughout the movie. Stalingrad was a very brutal battle and the scenes gave this film the harsh reality of this battle. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in military history. This was my second showing of this movie in a few years and was captivated by its realism again. The weapons, the uniforms and the German hearing during the reading of the legends gave him much credit for a good military film. In fact, being this a German perspective of the battle, I was rooting for the Germans, even if they were the aggressor and defeated in the war.
