OK ... The end of this may be something of a disappointment after what came before ... And Klaus Kinski should have his appearance of 10 seconds cut ... But there is no escape from the fact that this is a really wonderful thriller Atmospheric Euro ... I can not believe I've never seen this until now ... It's good to know that there are movies out there that are still worth tracking ... And that's really ... awesome visuals ... Haunting. .. And builds an incredible atmosphere ... Florinda Balkan is perfect as our heroine ... And the scene on the beach with Nicoletta Elmi is one of the most relaxing and perfect performances you can see ... Lila Kedrova is on site as a visitor of the city who may or may not be who she looks ... If you miss the hay days of the Euro cinema, then chase this ... There is a decent widescreen impression out there ... And please take it out on a restored DVD Someone ... They did this to the directors "Fifth Cord" ... And this is a much better movie
