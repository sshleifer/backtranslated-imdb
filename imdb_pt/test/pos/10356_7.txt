North American entry in the series "Blood Island" of Philippine horror films concerns Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley), ruler of a fictitious country. He dies of cancer but discovered how to bring it back: he placed his brain in a donor body. The crazy doctor in charge (Kent Taylor) puts it in a highly improbable body: the giant servant with facial scar named Gor (John Bloom). A doctor friend of the ruler tries to remedy matters and end the plans of the mad doctors. Partners Samuel M. Sherman (producer) and Al Adamson (director) stage a number of actors they've worked with before, including Taylor, the sexy wife of Adamsons, Regina Carrol, Angelo Rossitto, Zandor Vorkov and Vicki Volante. They tried to go to the feel of the previous "Blood Island" entrances, but you could say that this was done in the United States. While not necessarily a "good" movie, it has a lot of fun elements to turn into a fun whole. A malicious dwarf (Rossitto), bloody operations, unconvincing make-up work on Bloom, the subplot of political intrigue, caves full of cobwebs, etc. The narrative is actually quite coherent, with twists in the plot thrown here and there. I think it might have been cut a little; some scenes are dragged. But it has fun times and an ending that people may not expect. <br /> <br /> For this kind of thing, acting is not so bad. Both Taylor and Rossitto are fun; the latter seems to be enjoying himself in his role. Steering wheel is attractive enough, and Williams is O.K. in the heroic role. Anyway, it's good to see all those familiar faces in one of those movies. <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing special, but as a useless "horror" (I use the word freely, none of it is exactly scary), certainly amuses. <br /> <br /> 7/10
