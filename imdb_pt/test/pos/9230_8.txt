Bullets may not have jumped from his chest, but the Lone Ranger was the symbolic icon for me as my other childhood hero - Superman. He represented the truth, justice, and American way in a classic Western TV setting, living on the principle that he would never use his weapon to kill while scouring the American Southwest with his faithful Indian companion Tonto to bring all the outlaws to justice. The advent of TV provided the perfect opportunity for a post-war generation to discover that it is ideal in an enigmatic masked man who advocated law and order while offering unrivaled entertainment for five seasons spanning almost eight years. <br /> <br /> Today I had the opportunity to see for the first time that the full episodes of three parts begin to end without the standard opening and closing sequences to interrupt the continuity of the story. For Ranger fans, this is the great daddy of all the Western sagas, telling how Texas Ranger John Reid survived the ambush of the Butch Cavendish Gang and how he was nurtured back to health by an Indian friend from his childhood. Tonto (Jay Silverheels) declares his companion as a "faithful scout" and names him Kemo-Sabe. I read several interpretations of the origin of the term Kemo-sei, but I am satisfied with Tonto's explanation. Reading so much about it only lessens the story, as does the English translation of 'dizzy' from Spanish, which I will not reveal, because it's best not to know if you can help. <br /> <br /> I found it very clever as the story of the origin created the mystique of the Lone Ranger, as the sixth grave that created the illusion that all the Rangers died in the ambush of the canyon. You never see the face of the man who becomes the Loner, as he is always deflected or obscured to hide his true identity. Even the origin of silver is treated brilliantly; the storyteller's voice describing the excellent qualities of the wild stallion. Would that relate to, say, sterling ... silver? I got the biggest kick out of it. <br /> <br /> Of course, over time, watching the episodes of Lone Ranger today offers a vision of how unsophisticated the show went beyond its origin story. Some of them are almost embarrassingly silly, particularly when it comes to a Lone Ranger confrontation when he shoots in the middle of a mob of thugs to knock down a weapon from the owner's hand. And how about this little wave he gives Tonto whenever they're about to ambush the bad guys - it's always the same gesture, but Tonto always knows what that means in different circumstances. Then you have the episodes where Clayton Moore takes off the Ranger mask to wear a different disguise to represent another character in the service of the story. He came to be seen as an actor who represented President Abraham Lincoln to discover a villain, a top hat and all! Few fans I know know that actor John Hart replaced Clayton Moore for the 1952 film in a contract dispute that Moore had with the producers of the show. If you have seen the episode of "Happy Days" where Fonzie idolizes his childhood hero, you will notice that it was John Hart listed in the credits. In fact, it's hard to tell if you're watching an episode of Hart or not, the key is to listen to the voice; Moore's is so distinctive that it's a dead offer. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to try out some of the final season color episodes, you will have a surprise. The versions I saw on VHS are absolutely beautiful, although I do not know if commercial prints are available. Most black and white episodes have been re-packaged by any number of distributors in different settings, so putting their hands on them should not be a problem. What you should see of course is the origin of three parts, and if you do not watch anything else, this will give you all the flavor and excitement you need to capture the imagination of one of the most famous heroes of the West. Oi-Yo Silver, Awaaaay!
