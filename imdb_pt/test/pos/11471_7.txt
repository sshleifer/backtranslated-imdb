I received a Public Enemies DVD and hoped it was the 2009 version, but it was not - it was that! Of course, it was not the biggest movie I've ever seen - not by any means - but, guys, it was worth more than 2.8 out of 10! When I saw this bad rating on IMDb, I wondered what I was going to get, but as the disc was in the player, I settled to watch it. As other commentators have pointed out, Public Enemies is NOT a historical movie per se - and I noticed that, unlike the 2009 version (which I have not seen yet), IMDb does not categorize it as such. <br /> Come people! It's a story based on some real people - that's all! If I wanted a history lesson, I would sit on this computer and read Wikipedia or something. Ma Barker (real name Arizona - or Arrie - Barker) has NEVER been accused of any crime and, as other commentators have pointed out, she has probably never participated in her children 's activities. They sent her to the movies when they were "working"! (I hope she was not as critical as some of those who watched this movie!) Theresa Russell had the easy task of portraying a 17 year old woman to her. death at age 52 - from a young woman running from home to the hardened mother of four sons of vandals. I think she did it very well. The cheeky grin she used in more than one scene was classic! OK, I'll agree with some of the critics that the direction of this movie was below par and I sympathize with the actors about it. Theresa should have told the director to forget the topless shots - they did not contribute to the story. Maybe some big-name stars had been able to inject some of their own expertise into ignoring misdirection, while the sophomores were not so brave. Who knows? <br /> <br /> But although this was not a block-buster, it was worth more than 2.8 !! I have all my DVDs in a personal database where I sort them BEFORE looking at the IMDb soundtrack (although this sometimes influences small changes later). I understand what I gain on its own merits rather than keep a movie against others of the same genre and this one I think was fun enough to get 6.8. (Yes, I'll accept that such a practice tends to depend on my mood at the time, but then that's also not true for those who vote for IMDb?) However, you can imagine my surprise when I looked at IMDb. and saw the regrettable score that came here. <br /> <br /> Given the surprise, I decided to read some of the other comments hoping to understand the low rating and noticed that they are quite polarized. I agreed with those who said the film was worth watching and came to the conclusion that some people are hard to please. Well, since some were absolutely blunt, why do not they go out and make some better movies? I eagerly look forward to the precious stones they must be able to produce! On the other hand, if they can not do that, then why do not they just shut up?
