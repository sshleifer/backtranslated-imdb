I really chose this movie for my husband, who works in broadcasting. I thought it would be more of a movie he would enjoy and relate to, even though it was from the '80s - so it was kind of old-fashioned. This movie really appeals to you. Sometimes you just want to strangle the host, Barry. Sometimes you just want to send some fanatics who call a real concentration camp. Sometimes you really feel sorry for Barry because he really got too big for your jeans, if you know what I mean. It was on the Drama channel on Encore, so I'm thinking this is a true story. If you truly love dramas, you'll love this, even if you do not know all the ins and outs of the broadcasting business. If you are a fan of Alec Baldwin and are watching to see it, you should not. Your part is really part of this movie.
