I remember watching this as a kid as part of the Friday's Specials for Children movie specials at CBBC and recently happened upon a copy. <br /> <br /> In about twenty years since my last showing, this movie has not lost anything. <br /> <br /> This is an atmospheric tale that combines with the folklore of Cornwall and adds elements of the truly chilling imagery of the ghost of the young miner Billy. <br /> <br /> Filmed in the beautiful landscape In the Port Loe region of Cornwall, the film uses the mixture of rugged coastline and abandoned tin mines to make the setting truly dependable. <br /> <br /> There's a lot in this CFF drama, something long lost on children's television today and it's worth taking a look if you can track down a copy.
