Eliza (Elizabeth Moorman) is a country girl who comes to the city in search of love. She met a man who told her about an astrologer who will show her the stars. This is a journey of souls ... Eliza is put to the test, can she realize her true love when she sees him or not? Tommy (Tommy Lee Jones) is a construction worker trying to find himself in his native heritage. They show each other different ways of seeing things. All the while Eliza is still looking for love and Tommy is trying to protect the reservation her grandmother lives on. This is a distorted story of looking beyond the obvious and finding beauty in simple, everyday things. The style is artistic and full of symbolism. The psychedelic camera style can scare away the average viewer, but the deeper message and interesting pictures make this film worth seeing. It is a film that explores the underworld of strangers, wretches and devastated individuals. This one gets sidetracked, but certainly worth watching!
