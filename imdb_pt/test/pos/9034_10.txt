Hello; I just want to say how much I enjoyed your review and comments on this excellent film 'Intruder in the Powder'. I believe that the points you made were insightful, intelligent, and totally valid. It's also a shame that this movie is almost never on TV today and is not available in Region 2 of the DVD - I live in England. Again, thank you very much for your review. the actor juano hernandez was in another brilliant film, "young with horn", that also was starring kirk douglas and lauren bacall. was a very evocative and stylish film with superb music. I wish someone with influence could release movie catalogs like 'johnny belinda', 'i remember mama' and 'yearling' in the region of DVD 2, we love these movies in Britain. I'm not retirement age, I'm still fairly young and my family and I love classic movies !! movies like these were so beautifully made and they bring back wonderful memories. anyway...! Many thanks for your comments!
