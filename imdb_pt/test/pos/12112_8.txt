"The Buffalo" of Mario Western Bill's Western director Mario Costa, with Klaus Kinski, could only have been produced in Europe. Hollywood would never dare to do a western about a sexually prowling predator as the protagonist of a movie. No matter that Kinski is ideal for the role of 'Crazy' Johnny. He plays an entirely without sympathy individual, who is ironically dressed from head to toe in a white suit, pants and hat. This low-budget buffet is nothing to fancy. The typically stunning Spanish scenery around Almeria is nowhere in evidence. Instead, Costa and his director of photography Luciano Trasatti, who filmed another Western Kinski "And God said to Cain," approached this opera in a rather mundane setting around Tor Caldara, Lazio, Italy and Monte Gelato Falls, Treja River, Lazio, Italy. However, "The Beast" qualifies as a continental western because it deals with totally unscrupulous characters and the action can be classified as film noir because the hero and heroine are trapped by intolerable circumstances that force them to resort to criminal activities . Predictably, his well-defined plans backfire, due in large part to the character Kinski. In fact, Kinski's licentious character resembles a Wily E. Coyote character. Consistently, he struggles to have sex with several beautiful women, but both lawmakers and outlaws thwart every one of his efforts. Ultimately, "The Beast" amounts to a study of tragic character overflowing with irony. Stelvio Cipriani's orchestral score sounds as if it were raised by Tony Anthony's western "The Stranger Returns". Mario Costa's script takes place on the western border between San Diego and Mexico, which is being terrorized by a famous Mexican bandit named Machete (Giovanni Pallavicino from "We Still Kill the Old Way") and his gang. They attack diligence and no one is safe from their depredations. The first time we see Johnny Laster 'Crazy', he pauses to cool down in a stream and sees a beautiful woman washing clothes. He crawls behind her and attacks her, but a larger man armed with a rifle intervenes and he has to flee. He appears in a nearby town and a gunslinger smells snuff recruits him to help ambush a wealthy man, Mr. Powers, on the trail and steal it. They end up killing him and not getting money. Snufff sniffer accidentally leaves his snuff box at the scene and the sheriff is arrested on suspicion of murder. 'Crazy' shoots his accomplice from his hotel room so he does not have to worry about being implicated in the crime. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a young couple in love is having trouble making its way in the world. . Riccardo (Steven Tedd of "Requiem for a Bounty Killer") lives a Mexican couple on his ranch and helps them to create their real son, Juan. In the village, Riccardo's lovely girlfriend, Juanita (Gabriella Giorgelli from "Stranger in Sacramento") sings and dances in the canteen. Riccardo and Juanita plan to marry, but the last place Juanita wants to settle is on a dusty ranch. She dreams of living in the city, but life in the city requires more money than Riccardo or she has. They join Glen (Paolo Casella from "Shoot the Life and Pray for the Dead") and plan to kidnap Mr. Power's daughter, Nancy, when she comes to get her inheritance. Glen makes the fatal mistake of recruiting Johnny 'Crazy' to help them, because Glen knows that Johnny needs the money to get women. <br /> <br /> They kidnap Powers' daughter and keep her in a remote booth with Johnny on guard. Meanwhile, Juanita disguises herself as Powers 'daughter and appears in the city to get the money from Powers' lawyer, Gary Pinkerton (Giuliano Raffaelli of "Blood and Black Lace"), but he is suspicious because Juanita is not at all like Nancy . . Riccardo brandishes his six-piston weapon and tells Pinkerton that they have kidnapped Nancy. Unfortunately for Riccardo and Juanita, Pinkerton can only get his hands on $ 50,000 because Machete has struck so much fear in the hearts of all that the total inheritance of the Powers can not be sent across the territory by diligence. Meanwhile, back in the hut, the excited Johnny tries to rape Nancy, but she is smarter than him, knows him with a chair pretending to be alone while she undresses. After she leaves him unconscious, she steals a buggy and takes him back to town. Johnny recovers, pursues and kills her at the same time that Glen, Riccardo, Juanita and Pinkerton know him on the trail. They inform Johnny about the complications created by Machete's reign of terror and give him $ 12,000 as his share of the money. Pinkerton is amazed at the sight of Nancy's bloodstained corpse and threatens Johnny. Of course, Johnny shoots him in cold blood on the spot. <br /> <br /> Things really start to deteriorate when the law in San Diego proposes to capture Machete. Glen, Riccardo and Juanita return to Mexico, while Johnny attacks two women on a farm and narrowly escapes being caught. He rides to Mexico, meets a canteen prostitute, and is falling on her when a reward pulls a revolver at her face. Johnny confesses that he knows where they can find more money if they free him. Machete's men follow Johnny's tip and capture Juanita. The villagers join Riccardo to attack Machete and Johnny rescues Juanita, but she dies after a big shootout. Riccardo is left alone now. Machete and his men retaliated against their parents, not only by killing them, but also little John. All that Riccardo and Juanita dreamed up in clouds of gun smoke for an unhappy ending. Johnny "crazy" dies and can never placate his lust. If you think of Costa's intriguing sagebrusher, "The Beast" comes as an interesting character study and film noir exercise in a western setting where everyone is punished.
