I love this movie. It was done ONLY before the Los Angeles punk scene changed for the worse. It perfectly preserves the mood and attitude of that time and place. I feel very lucky to have been present at the filming of four of the bands at Fleetwood that night. The only part that does not fit very well are the sections with the Catholic Provision and their socio-political comments. I have not seen many people who were in all this. The rest of the film shows attitudes that I witnessed a lot; people dealing with difficult lives, or giving a turnaround in the music industry and / or bad hippies. I do not think I have seen a documentary that so authentically and personally captures the subject being addressed.
