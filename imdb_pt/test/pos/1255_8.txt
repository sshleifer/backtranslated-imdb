When the first trailer of this movie was seen by me, I was curious to know what angle the plot would take. After all, the plot of having one's own childhood self back to the present leaves many options open. Bruce Willis, however, does an excellent job in the role he was given. I was surprised to see how well he could act in that part. This is also a good career move, as many others have said, but after seeing it I agree now. This movie is mainly about remembering the kid you used to be, and coming to the conclusion that you are not the adult you planned to be. This is a wonderful story and an exciting tale that makes us think. Usually we despise "What if ..." movies. For example, Waterworld attempted to answer the question "What if the world were covered with water and ...?" But honestly, no one cared. This film, however, affects everyone in the theater. It is true that young children may not fully understand the idea of ​​growing up and having all their dreams weak, but this has a great impact on the adults and parents of these children. This movie is definitely worth seeing. Although, it will be better the second time because you will not be thinking so much (about how the boy got there, and why and all these things) just relax and have fun. And take something with you when you leave this movie. Take that piece of your childhood that you forgot and enjoy.
