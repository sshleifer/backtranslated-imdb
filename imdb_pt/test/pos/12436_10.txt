This movie was made thirteen years before I was born, but I still think it's the funniest, funniest and most inoffensive part of all time. It simply could not go wrong with the cast of excellent British actors he owns. <br /> <br /> Where to begin? Alastair Yes-unequaled; Margaret Rutherford-ditto, the wonderful and innocent Gossage, played perfectly for the imperious Joyce Grenfell. Caddish Victor Hyde-Brown (a Guy Middleton special) and the rest of the staff sum up post-war middle-class England. Humor is sometimes obvious, but it's that kind of thing. special "Ealing" variety and is never offensive. <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie more often than I remember reminding myself and still laughing like a drain on the antics every time. The invasion of girls' school-occupied dorms, the magnificently planned but ultimately doomed twin tours of the school, and the chaotic end of the arrival of a third school to augment anarchy are invaluable. <br /> <br /> It's an old cliche I know, but they really do not make it any more. How I wish they would. If you have not seen, please, you will not be disappointed.
