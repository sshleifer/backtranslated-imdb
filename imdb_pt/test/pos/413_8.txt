Legendary hammy and arrogant horror film star Conrad Radzoff (splendidly played with perverse sardonic confidence by Ferdy Mayne) dies of a heart attack. A group of students from theater schools steals the corpse of Radzoff from his crypt and takes him to a decaying mansion so they can feast with him. Radzoff comes back to life and catches the rude young people for desecrating his grave. Writer / director Norman Thaddeus Vane invents a new, original and even quite stylish style in the usual corpse counting premise, offers an elegant evocation of the flamboyant Hollywood atmosphere and does a vigorous job of maintaining a pleasantly misty ooga-booga atmosphere and scary. . The killing kits deliver the horrible goods, with a girl being set on fire, a succulent decapitation (the severed head rolls down the stairs to the lawn so a raven can peck at her!) And another poor girl being crushed. with a coffin sorting levitating as the horrible definite highlights. Kudos are also in order for the stellar cast of B-flick's familiar faces: Mayne has a delightful ball with his flamboyant role, Leon Askin contributes with an amusing appearance as the embittered director Wolfgang, Nita Talbot adds a bit of class as a weird medium psychic Ms. Rohmer, in addition, there are nice turns by Luca Bercovici as the head of the theater student Saint, Jennifer Starrett as the sweet Meg, Jeffrey Combs as the geek Stu, and Scott Thomson as the nerd Bobo. Appearing in cold parts are Chuck "Porky" Mitchell as a detective, Patrick Wright in one of his usual cops, and Tallie Cochrane as a corpse. The polished cinematography of Joel King gives the film an attractive and brilliant look. Jerry Mosely's grumpy score also hits the chill point. A fun scare movie.
