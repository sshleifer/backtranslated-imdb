I Sell the Dead is a great sloppy horror comedy that refuses to take itself too seriously. This has advantages and disadvantages. The 85 minutes of the movie go by and the movie is full of sometimes funny, sometimes scary, sometimes bloody, occasionally all three bits at once, but the individual bits are way better than the sum of the parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> The story, as it is, follows the professional tomb thief Arthur Blake (played by Dominic Monaghan). Arthur's crime partner, Willie Grimes (Larry Fessenden), has just had his head cut for murder and Arthur has one night before his own head is confiscated for the same crime. Arthur insists that he is innocent of murder, but there are many other crimes he is willing to confess when bribed with Irish Whiskey by a Catholic priest (played by Ron Perlman). Since the film is a series of tomb-robbing anecdotes confessed by Arthur, it becomes a kind of horror anthology - a series of disjointed tales, all linked by a similar cast (Arthur and Willie ) and a similar theme (grave robbery). Like most anthologies of terror, there is no consistent mythology, because all mythologies are true and happen simultaneously, even when they contradict each other. <br /> <br /> It probably did not help the fact that I saw this movie the same night as Trick. 'r Treat, an anthology of terror that avoids all the pitfalls in which I come to sell. In fact, Trick 'r Treat, conceived as an anthology, tells a more unified and consistent story than I Sell The Dead, which claims to be a united narrative. <br /> <br /> The other problem with the film (and I recognize that this is an insane insanity) is the way the film plays fast and loose with the story. Grimes is killed with a guillotine. We may be able to stretch a point and say that he is killed by a Scottish maiden, a forerunner of the French guillotine, but the Scottish maiden was abandoned in 1709 and this film is set one hundred years later, since Burke and Hare are mentioned and they were executed for murder in 1829. The robbery of graves as an industry became obsolete with the passage of the Law of Anatomy (1832), so the film must happen before that. <br /> <br /> I know bringing it up is the ultimate in historical nerdice and we are clearly dealing with a universe where all kinds of dead, undead and deadly legends are possible, but the easiest way to anchor a fantasy, to convince the public to suspend their disbelief is to use something real and authentic to return the fantasy of. And it's not like the history of tomb robbers, body robbers or resurrectionists (call it like you like) is a boring story. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating thing is the writer. Director Glenn McQuaid clearly knows the story. , especially the good bits. As an example, when Grimes considers Arthur as his apprentice, he correctly explains to Arthur that as resuscitators they do not steal the clothes of the dead, for stealing corpses is a contravention, punishable by a small fine, while stealing clothes is a crime, punishable by deportation or possibly even death. So you'd expect Wille and Arthur to take the corpse right now (and for the rest of the movie), but of course not. You could accuse the director of ignoring your scriptwriter's script, but not when the writer and director are the same person. <br /> <br /> My point is not that there should have been many naked corpses in the film, my point is that if you will bring this peculiarity of law and make it clear that Willie and Arthur will follow the law, it does not matter what how foolish she is, you will have to follow that thought to its logical conclusion. , even if it means that Willie and Arthur end up chasing a zombie through a graveyard trying to tear their clothes off and put them back in the empty casket, so they will not be deported for stealing the clothes from the walking corpse, otherwise do not expose question. <br /> <br /> The historical nerd aside, I sell the dead is worth a rent as a light but funny horror movie that could have been so much more.
