I enjoyed this program immensely. It is exceptionally well written, with well-judged performances and intelligent visuals. <br /> <br /> It is also very frank and honest, refreshing compared to the sanitized representation of drug use in movies and television. <br /> /> Must Do - one of the best television shows of recent years and triumph on all scales for Channel 4. <br /> <br /> 9/10
