AristoCats is a fantastic Disney classic that I loved as a kid. Even today I can not resist watching it, it's such a wonderful and charming film, with lots of animation and lovely songs. I really miss the animated films like AristoCats, they had perfect voices not to mention the hand-drawn animation that makes it perfect for the family. AristoCats is also very witty and intelligent, the story was so wonderful. This movie is a little beyond irresistible, I think the most memorable moment for me were the cats playing piano learning the lure, lol, it was so cute with the piano playing and painting. <br /> <br /> Douchess and her. The kittens are very spoiled in their huge mansion, mainly because their lady is very rich and treats them as if they were her children. But when the girl feels it's time to make her will, she leaves it all to the cats and not to the butler. The butler gets angry and catches the kittens on the road and loves them in the middle of nowhere. Douchess and the kittens wake up and with the help of a gentle street cat named Thomas O'Malley, they return home to their lady but learn the freshness of being a skat cat. <br /> <br /> The AristoCats is just a perfect Disney movie that I feel is a little overlooked. I always recommend this movie for kids or families, it could be enjoyed by anyone. The songs and story are memorable. I'm always going to participate in the best song in the movie "Everybody wants to be a cat", great music. I also love the dogs that kept the farm where the cats were abandoned, they were so cute. This is a great movie, please watch it, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
