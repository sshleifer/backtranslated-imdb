Think of it as an extreme form of detention without trial. Without commenting and taking part in US Foreign Policy, the Extraordinary Surrender process involves leading people suspected of terrorist activity to a foreign country, as opposed to an extradition, if you wish, to a place where torture is not a crime but a means of illegating information. Instead of smearing your soil with blood from potentially innocent people, you do so in foreign lands where such tactics are accepted interrogation techniques. <br /> <br /> Of course, given the severity of the tactics and attempts to overthrow a person, sometimes you would get what you want after going through the resistance, or get nothing, or worse of all, get a confession just because the mind has been broken to the point where the subject agrees with whatever you say. It's an ugly process, and what better way to do it when you're a human rights advocate, endorsing any means necessary to protect more lives in a time when information is critical to the battle against terror . and doing so in a country where registration of rights is likely to be questionable. <br /> <br /> Surrender is Syriana this year, although in the race for the new year we have a number of political suspense contenders to carry that crown. , with Rendition first, followed by Robert Redford's Lions for Lambs movie starring Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep (again, though now on the other side of the fence) and The Kingdom with Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner, though this one probably would become more action-driven. Directed by Gavin Hood, who made Tsotsi and will command the new spin on Wolverine, Rendition is a decent thriller with a high-level cast in a narrative that has proven quite popular these days - the division, which provides a wide differential . Perspectives to be presented through a cast. Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally), a chemical engineer, is sued on his way home under the orders of CIA chief Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep). In a detention center outside the US, JIA Gyllenhaal analyst Douglas Freeman (so prophetic) embarks on his first interrogation session, no doubt being placed in a position he did not sign. Back home, Reese Whitherspoon, pregnant and very pregnant, is frantically searching for answers to the disappearance of her husband and seeking the assistance of Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard), who worked for Senator Hawkins (Alan Arkin). Play in J.K. Sinmmons, an investigation of the terrorist plot and a forbidden love story between Fatima (Zineb Oukach) and Khalid (Moa Khouas), you have a good time in a busy frame. Given a number of castings, locations, timelines and the like, Rendition was not at all confusing, and it works with a skilful handling of the material, never quick to judge, presenting ideas and thoughts of both sides of the equation. Each character has its own agenda, and the unveiling of that agenda involves enough not to bore or confuse it. And the best part of it all is how, very sincerely, they bow to self-preservation in different ways and ultimately in various lose-lose situations, unfortunately. It also kept you from guessing - he or not, and constantly toyed with his mind about whether Anwar deserved what he was getting. He used an extremely clever trick that I did not see coming until it's too late (so there's credit), though he succumbed to the usual stereotypes of terrorist militants and did not spend much time in-depth to explore his motives. . <br /> <br /> It may not have been necessary, given so many movies out there that are already based on this issue (Paradise Now, Day Night Night, Syriana Day). Although it was one-dimensional (personal tragedy at bombing to become suicidal), I felt that Rendition was right in not providing a sweet and saccharine ending, that this struggle against negative and destructive ideology is not something that can be solved in a two-hour film, and I'm glad I avoided those implausibilities. <br /> <br /> What we have instead is a well-crafted tale that focuses on the question of Surrender, and probably capable enough to trigger arguments as soon as the lights come on, in which field you belong - you support inflicting severe pain on interrogation? Yes or no? This is the quintessential question of our time. Yes or no? (OK, I'm ready for the Lions for Lambs)!
