Faqrscape is really one of those shows that only has everything, great performance, great cast, great writing, sets, chemistry, muppets ... it has everything and then some except a house. This fantastic series seems to have everything except and ending. The TPTB seems to think that this is a series that is a series of consecutive single series, when anyone who watches it know is a story of continuous love, an epic that has an end that must be seen. If you have never seen Farscape do yourself a favor and watch it on DVD when the first season will be released in October ... and the second season is the best there is! Watch the reruns on the SciFi channel to follow, and then the new season begins in January through March, when most shows are going to hiatis and do not forget to watch. If all goes well, we'll have our end!
