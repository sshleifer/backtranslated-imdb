Since I am allowed to play Goldeneye once again, it has been impossible to take my mind off it. I'm surprised I could have gone without her. It is undoubtedly one of the greatest games of all time. I've never played any other shooting games, but I know this is the one that commands the most. Most people blame it for a lot of violence, but I find that ridiculous. There may be some graphic wiles, but there is much worse out there. <br /> <br /> The most important thing is that it's fun. With an incredible arsenal of weapons like the RC-P90 and the classic Golden Gun, you'll go through several challenging levels of the movie, completing crucial goals and moving away swarms of guards. There are tons of incredible scams to get and even two secret levels that you will only gain if you have the true ability. Goldeneye is also one of the best multiplayer games of all time. You can choose from several movie characters, classic villains from the old 007 movies (Baron Samedi, Oddjob, May Day and Jaws) and guards in the game. It is likely that you and your partner (s) are laughing so hard that you will look like Bart and Lisa Simpson watching an episode of Itchy and Scratchy. <br /> <br /> So if you do not have the game, do not rent it: just buy it. It's too good to be true. For cool Goldeneye stuff, check out Detstar.com's Goldeneye website. Every James Bond lover will enjoy this game a lot.
