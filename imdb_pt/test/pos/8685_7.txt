Algernon's comment4 that Ms Paget's "ultra lewd dance in" is the most erotic in movie history "is certainly a challenge of exaggeration. It's not even Debra Paget's most erotic dance. His almost nude twists in Fritz Lang's "The Indian Tomb," make that number seem decidedly tame. As for being the most erotic in dance history. Good! Where do I start? The performance of Salma Hayek as Santanico Pandemonium in "From Dusk to Dawn" (1996); Jamie Lee Curtis in "True Lies" (1994); Jessica Alba in "Sin City" (2005); Rose McGowan in "Terror Planet" (2007); Sheila Kelley in "Dancing at the Blue Iguana" (2000), blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. I love the sequel and include it in my series "Cheesecake Dance" on Youtube. I just think that making a claim like "most erotic in film history" is really coming out on a very fragile limb.
