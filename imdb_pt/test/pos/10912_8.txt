A beautifully constructed and brilliantly acted comedy. There is no one in the cast who does not have a hilarious distinction. However, the real star of the film is the unseen director, Frank Oz, who brings all the sensibility and insane intelligence to this farce he brought to Miss Meetings. Piggy with Kermit, the frog. This is a movie not to be missed.
