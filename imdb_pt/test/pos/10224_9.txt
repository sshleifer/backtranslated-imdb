I wish there was one category to put this in other than Horror. It just is not. Granted has its horrible moments, however I do not feel that this makes a horror movie. I'm going to say that this movie could have been better. A million small things could have been modified to improve. <br /> <br /> That being said, I love this movie. I am often sad because people misunderstand the whole point of it. It was always clear to me that the purpose of this movie was to say ... things are not always what they seem. Sometimes 'evil', it is not. <br /> <br /> Barker was in a Con I went and he made a little talk, then watch the movie thing. It was very interesting. Many things he wanted to put in the film could not be, and one piece was cut from the movie that he believed to be lost a long time ago. This was a snippet that helped to clarify Boone and his girlfriend, as well as some other details. <br /> <br /> I know some people are bothered by not having more information about all the 'races' in the background. However, I always felt that gave the film a more 'real' feel. I read the novel that was based off, as were many of the comics. Because of this, the film has always seemed to be a stage for the whole story. A much more involved story that, unfortunately, never had a chance to live. <br /> <br /> Despite all the flaws that this movie may have, I believe it has a lot to offer. The "monsters" are wonderful, very imaginative. While the acting is sometimes a little stiff, there are some very quoted lines. Whenever I see, I find something new. Keep an eye on Boones chest until the end. At one point, Decker stabs him and soon after Boone falls on a card table. He ends up with a card stuck to his chest. This letter stays there for a while even after Lori pulls the knife out. He stays there until Boone casually removes him. I love it. That was a lovely detail I thought. <br /> <br /> Basically, what I mean is that ... if you're looking for a horror movie, do not watch it. If you believe that sometimes men can be more evil than anything we have imagined. This is the movie for you. This is a movie about how men destroy what they do not understand or fear.
