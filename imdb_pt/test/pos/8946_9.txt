Two funeral directors in a Welsh village? English humor as opposed to other things on the other side of the Atlantic? How could I resist? My wife and I saw it on March 6 for our belated Valentine's Day celebration and we both enjoyed some good belly laughs. We were going to see another movie later, but we decided not to do it because we wanted the experience of that movie to stay with us through the night. <br /> <br /> The mortuary scene in the last 20 minutes of the movie is worth it. wait. He raises questions rarely discussed in the community, but I know three funeral directors, and humor is right in the money. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended and congratulations to the writers. Without you, all the actors, directors and others have no job on any Monday.
