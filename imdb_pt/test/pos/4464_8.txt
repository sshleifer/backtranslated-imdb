DO NOT TORTURE DUCKLING is one of Fulci's earlier films (and honestly, in terms of history, better ...) - and although it's not the typical "bloodbath" Fulci is known for - this is still a nice film. <br /> <br /> The story involves a small town where a series of murders of children is occurring. Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations - as suspects, or those who "help" the investigation (or in some cases both) - include the city police, a small reporter, a former handsome and wealthy drug addict, a young priest and his mother, an old man practicing witchcraft and his female protege, a mentally handicapped citizen and a deaf / mute little girl. All these people are entwined in the plot to create multiple twists, until the true killer is revealed ... DO NOT TORTURE A DUCKLING IS NOT A "CLASSIC" GIALO OR A TYPICAL FICULUS gore film. Although it contains elements of both - it's more of an old-fashioned murder mystery, with darker themes and some scenes of graphic violence (though not as strong as some of Fulci's later works). This is a well written movie with lots of twists that kept me guessing until the end. DO NOT TORTURE still has more than a fair share of violence and sleaze. It is recommended for fans of giallo / mystery-mystery, or for those who want to check out some of Fulci's non-splatter movies - but do not despair. Some may be disregarded by the subject of child murders, and a female lead character has the strange habit of beating up on very young boys, which is also a bit disconcerting - but if that kind of stuff does not bother you, then definitely give this one a look. 8.5 / 10
