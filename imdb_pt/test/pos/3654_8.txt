I saw this movie at the Seattle International Film Festival in a house full of avid fans of Indian movies and ex-pats. The film is incredibly beautiful and smooth flowing into a first movie. The management is self-assured, especially with sites that have been recruited on time for extras and small parts. While the plot and the plot are elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of observing the performances and the scenario compensate for the lack. The soundtrack to this movie is a great attraction for lovers of world music. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out Hari Om to get inspired. It was not released in Q & A, but I imagine that Hollywood could have a lesson in making budget movies by learning from that director.
