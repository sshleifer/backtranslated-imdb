Wow. this movie is the voice of a generation of climbing. Director Sam Keith takes us to the darkest depths of man's soul, where we find love, life and top-roping. Telly Tired of the World (Leo Fitzpatrick) follows his heart and his anchors through a brain journey to find sanity in a post-apocalyptic Colorado. Instead, Telly finds the confrontation in Don (Jason Bortz), the incarnation of machismo and a zeitgeist of humanities weaknesses. The epic movie comes to a trepa-lape in an exciting competition that will make even the strongest viewers tremble on dizzying heights. <br /> <br /> This movie has it all: top-roping out there, Top In the gym, cut breeches and sleeveless flannel shirts, incredible climbing footage (some so good, you see two or three times!) , bear and snake attacks. <br /> <br /> I gave the film 8 out of 10 because I wanted to see the novel develop a bit more. It seemed that the movie was leading to a spicy and intricate sex scene between Telly and her new lover, but unfortunately, it would not fit the hour already full of emotion and half emotion. <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger fans and Mission Impossible II will find this movie a rough diamond. Overall, if you're ready to challenge your worldview on humanity and rock climbing, this is the movie for you!
