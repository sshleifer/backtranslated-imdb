As I sat in the movies to see this, I was hoping to see some sort of action movie with style that had been implied in the trailers. However, it was very quickly apparent that this film was trying to be more. <br /> <br /> Normally, I do not approve movies that try to entertain in as many ways as possible. For example, this movie tries to blend action with comedy, romance, lightness and seriousness at the same time. Most of the time this type of approach does not work on movies (just look at Batman Forever), but I was pleasantly surprised to see that in that case they did it. <br /> <br /> The end result is a highly entertaining movie that should appeal to most mature film buffs. (However, the stomach weak should actually be warned of one or two scenes.) Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller pull on a brilliant double act and Ken Stott makes an excellent villain. This mixed with superb costumes and some decent action scenes makes for a very nice watch. <br /> <br /> However, the big disappointment here for me is that by having 'The Gentleman Highwayman', there was a real Opportunity for some good dialogue, but the script was definitely lacking in punchiness and there were few laughs of belly. Ok, so the lines were not terrible, but to me that highlights a problem with recent British films; Ignoring some notable exceptions, the scripts being written today are still relatively mediocre when compared to some of Hollywood's efforts.
