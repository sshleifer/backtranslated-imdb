In some scenes from Rain People, the forerunner of Francis Ford Coppola for its seventies heyday, there is the mark of a situation similar to the Easy Rider of 1969, but not exactly in the same frame. Here we have a drama about people disconnected from society, somehow alienated by the choices or boundaries imposed by one medium or another. It's one of those rare original dramas where some scenes stand alone as total knockouts. Even with such a low budget and a very spontaneous attitude, so to speak, about filming the film, Coppola is able to capture everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters and a character's curved and unexpected degrees versus the helplessness of the character. other, or vice versa, or both. And, as one might be inclined to see how much it is about the cuts of suburban life of the 1960s, there is this escapism from the previously mentioned film, but of a more concrete, timeless quality with the drama and underlying issues. . In a way, if Bergman were on his way to an almost 20-year-old filmmaker, to get the strange truths of outsiders out, that might be it. <br /> <br /> But along with all the direct and direct. Sometimes self-conscious photography (though also with a more documentary approach, sometimes with its indeterminable characters), all actors fit in place. Shirley Knight, an actress with whom I'm not very familiar, has a complex and divergent role as a pregnant woman rushing into a kind of existentialist riddle of what life has to offer. There are moments of inspiring acting for her, and one of my favorite (if not my favorite) is when she's on the phone calling her husband for the first time. A scene so tense at both ends, and in every little gesture and inflection of such a word upon it, is spoken with so little. It's extraordinary in ways that mirror other people in Coppola's films. Then comes the 'killer' character played by James Caan. This is also a dangerous character as it is a mixture of childlike perplexity and fun with marked memories. Think of Forrest Gump if he failed to outplay football and wit. He's one of his best, actually, for being the most minimalist - for a guy who usually plays tough guys in movies, here's one that's also at the heart of the story and the character of Knight. Also very good in a supporting role is Robert Duvall as a policeman with a rough side and a rather hectic past; kind of an initial sample of other defected characters that he would play later in his career. <br /> <br /> So the characters, and what Coppola risks in having a discomfort in them, are really what make up the film, whatever the story, is definitely not solved in the usual way you can think or wait. The last ten minutes or so are like the others in Coppola's work, where the specific tragedies on all sides are undermined by the emotional and psychological implications this will leave in the amplified principles for the sublime and the sad. This, in turn, is courageous on the part of the one who is trying to be represented (both in freedom and in flaws and ambiguities) in the subject. And the style of the image adds a kind of fragmented vision to all of this with fast flashbacks that are graphic and independent in contrast to the longer takes in some crucial scenes. It is a road movie of its time, but also has much more work than with another filmmaker with less chances of assuming the nature of these personages. One of the best films of 1969.
