I just saw "Checking Out" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. What a fantastic combination of a comforting plot and a great cast. Director Jeff Hare did a great job of inviting audiences to the rambling and hilarious world of Morris Applebaum and his family. Family life is presented in such a way that we enjoy the crazy antics, but we feel the real pain and worry they have for each other. <br /> <br /> Normally I'm not a fan of Peter Falk, but he's Morris Applebaum. and plays the role with great humor and humanity. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone can see this wonderful movie and enjoy it as I did. <br /> <br /> We take the hat to the director, cast and crew for a job well done!
