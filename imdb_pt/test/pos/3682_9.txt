Dude, I had my doubts. I love Kathy Bates, but I thought, how good this could be, I had never heard of it ...! You know, it was one of those things, we gave it "20 minutes and we're going to turn it off if it sucks" and we got stuck from the start. This is a very fun and fun movie. It's peculiar, you know? I mean, you have a lounge singer, a killer (and a believer), you have farce, then Kathy Bates in all its splendor, Rupert Everett finally acting with your real potential, Dan Ackroyd, and a dwarf who will make you laugh out loud. I tell you, you'll laugh / you'll cry. <br /> <br /> Maybe I had a weird week, but I think this movie is at the Fried Green Tomatoes level. If you do not like this movie, you might not like it, but I think it was a great movie. I went out and bought the DVD.
