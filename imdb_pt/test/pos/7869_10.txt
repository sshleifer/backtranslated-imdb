"The Beguiled" is one of my favorite Clint Eastwood films, and a departure from their typical early roles. Directed by Don Siegel, with whom Eastwood collaborated on several films, it was made a year before Eastwood's premiere with "Play Misty For Me." An alternative title considered for the movie was "Pussy-Footing Down in the Old Plantation," which fortunately was not used, otherwise I have obscene jokes about the fact that it occurs in a girls' school would be hard to avoid. I saw this movie for the first time in one of my college film classes in the mid 70's, and was immediately taken with it. I only had an old VHS tape until I recently purchased the widescreen DVD, which also includes the ugly and hilarious trailer that makes the movie look like a soap opera "Peyton Place", and does not convey any of the movie shakes. <br /> <br /> Interesting notes: Eastwood and Siegel had to fight Universal Pictures to keep the original ending, and they won; and, the movie was advertised as an Eastwood western standard, which it certainly is not. It is a gothic tale of deception and horror set in the time of the Civil War, with an underlying tone of eroticism and sexual tension running everywhere. <br /> <br /> I'm not putting any spoilers in this review, and if you want to see the movie as it should have been, then be careful when looking for it on the internet, as abounding reviews about spoilers abound. <br /> Clint Eastwood plays John McBurney, a Union soldier who is filmed on confederate soil and discovered by a young girl from a girls' school nearby. She rescues him and takes him back to school, but instead of notifying the local patrol of his presence to be taken to jail, the principal, Martha (Geraldine Page), his assistant Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman), servant Hallie (Mae Mercer), and most teenagers welcome him, heal and fall under his spell. The film sets its tone of creepy and gothic horror from the titles, as it shows real shots from the battlefield of war, while Eastwood's voice is heard silently singing a funeral song of the time. <br /> <br /> The opening scene of his encounter with the little girl who saves him gives the tone of his character and the tone of the whole film. To say more would spoil the surprises in that first scene. Saying a lot more about the movie itself can ruin it for those who have not seen it ... if you're into gothic and creepy tales, find it and rent it. Eastwood is excellent in the film, and it is interesting to see him in an early role, or in any role, where he plays a character who is mostly very unfriendly. Geraldine Page had a plum. role in the film as the director, and I can not imagine another actress of the moment being so good on paper; A chance could have been Piper Laurie, but I do not think Laurie could embody the role in the same way as Geraldine Page. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Hartman (whose wonderful performance in the film "A Patch of Blue" as a blind girl who falls in love with Sidney Poiter's character is another highlight in her short career) is at its peak here, delicate and masterful at the same time. Unfortunately, his delicacy in the film was also part of his real life; she committed suicide at age 45. <br /> <br /> I close this review with this remark: a yankee man manipulative and liar is no match for a house full of deceptive and libidinous Southern bells.
