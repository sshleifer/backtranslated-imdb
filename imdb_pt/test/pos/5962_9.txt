One of Starevich's earliest films made in France is possibly his only political satire. The story of the frogs they wanted A king mirrors his title as a group of high "coaxers" who feel that democracy has become flat, so they require a king of Jupiter to rule their lands. When he sends a stump, the frogs ask for another king, saying that the stump is just "political wood." Jupiter sends a hungry stork this time, whose fierce eyes of frog devour the inhabitants of the city. As the original "croaker" is about to slide down the beak of the stork, he speaks his morals: "leave well enough alone." This movie features some beautiful scenes from crowds of dozens of puppets. Starewicz tricks the public into believing that everyone is moving at the same time, keeping the background in constant motion and animating only about six frogs at the same time. Slightly tacky dialogue and problems with lighting in some places diminish the quality of repeated visualizations; however, their historical significance in Starewicz's life makes it important to observe it. His feelings about the government immediately after his flight from Russia are probably expressed in this film. In addition, the technical achievements of animating so many characters at once in a stop motion movie are staggering.
