This is the best movie I've ever seen. And I saw a lot. I'm not even Troma fan. I've never heard of Troma before seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> I had already given up watching a big movie until I saw "Tromeo and Juliet". This movie is a dream come true. Shakespeare would probably be proud of this modern adaptation of his classic. There is sex, violence, humor and satire. This breaks many taboos. <br /> <br /> This movie is neither disgusting nor stupid. It's hard to describe in words how clever, funny, exciting and witty this movie is. The music is great and fits perfectly into every scene. The characters are very believable and the acting is great. I really cared about the characters. <br /> <br /> Certainly not just for Troma fans. It is for all people who have a sense of humor and enjoy clever and compelling entertainment as opposed to totally stupid and unbelievable mainstream movies that do not dare to do what this movie does. <br /> <br /> Bad reviews only prove that this movie is great and something exceptional. You love or hate. Like all true works of art, it is not understood and appreciated by all people.
