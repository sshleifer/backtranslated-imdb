For those curious, this episode is based on a theme about Pirandello's "Six Characters in Search of an Author" and Jean-Paul Sartre's play, "No Exit" (as most obviously indicated by the title), but of course, with a sterling twist. <br /> <br /> Five very different individuals meet in a round room with no idea who they are, in addition to the indication of their costume. A bell rings intermittently (perhaps also an allusion to Hemmingway?), Increasing the agony of his incarceration. The newcomer to the group, a major, is determined to flee while the others resign themselves to their fate. <br /> <br /> Unlike Pirandello, these characters do not even have a story. They have nothing beyond the experience of the room in their consciousness, and no one to author their nonexistent story, so their position is even more desperate than the characters in Pirandello's play. Unlike Pirandello and Sartre, there is no relationship between the characters and therefore no real conflict between them, although the issue of personal responsibility versus apathy is prominent in this story. <br /> <br /> Although this diverges significantly from the plot of the authors mentioned in the title, the themes of Sartre and Pirandello (and many other authors of the twentieth century) appear with absolute clarity. This is obviously a piece that addresses the postmodernist perspective in the context of the Cold War era. There is also an emphasis on matters of personal insignificance. <br /> <br /> This is easily one of the best episodes I have ever seen, and still exceptionally relevant to the current experience (such as Sartre and Pirandello). Exactly what does a good part of writing in a classic.
