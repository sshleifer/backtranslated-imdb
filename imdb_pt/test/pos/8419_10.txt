Shwaas is incredible! considering that the producers had a scarce budget, they did an excellent job. It's a watch. The little boy did a great job with many emotions flowing through his eyes. Grandfather is at his best. The photograph is superb. Technically correct and very creative. This helps add many emotions to the main content. The movie will keep you busy and do not be surprised if you are shaken after the movie and the story remain in your mind for a few days. I sincerely hope they get the final Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and do not miss again
