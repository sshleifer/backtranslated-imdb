I am Egyptian. I have a green card. I have lived in the USA since 1991. I have a very common Arab name. I am married (wife not American, but not Egyptian, not Arab). I have children who are born in the USA. I have a PhD in Cellular Biology from USA and I travel for conferences. I make 6 figure income and I own a home in the Washington, DC area. I pay my taxes and out of 1 or 2 parking tickets. I have no defect in my record since I arrived in this country in 1991. I look more Egyptian than the Ibrahimi character, but my English spoken is as good as his. a couple of months ago I was returning from a conference / company company in Spain through Munich, Germany to Washington, DC (Home). I was picked up at the Munich airport by a German officer as I got off the plane in Madrid. He was waiting for me. He was about to start questioning me until I simply told him "I have no business in Germany, I'm just passing by." He let me go with the greatest disappointment. This was nothing compared to what happened in Washington at Dulles airport (which was not as bad as what happened to Ibrahimi in the movie). The customs officer asked me a few questions about the duration and purpose of my trip. He then wrote a letter C on my custom declaration form and let me go. After I picked up my checked bag, I stopped at the last exit point (some crap from Homeland Security). I sat there for 3 hours along with many different people from many different nationalities. I was not told the reason for my arrest. I was not allowed to use my phone or ANY other phone. I was grumpy at first asking to be informed of the reason or let me go but decided to suck it up and just wait and see. I asked if I could call my wife to tell her that I'll be late, but I was told no. When I tried to use my phone and as soon as my wife said hello, an officer took the phone from my hand and threatened to confiscate it. When I asked about the need to call home because my family is waiting, they said "Three hours is nothing, let's make contact after 5 hours". When I asked to use the bathroom, an officer accompanied me there. The bathroom was funny; I think it was a prison style bathroom that is all metal with no toilet seat. Finally they called my name and gave me my passport / green card and said you can go. I asked what the problem was, they said "nothing" !! I know it was only 3 hours, but I was dead tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and children. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it was very well done. Unlike most films involving Arabs and using non-Arab actors who only speak nonsense, this Arabic movie was 100% correct. I assume the country is Morocco (North Africa).
