I stumbled across this site while looking for a video or DVD of the 1959 Porgy and Bess version with Sammy Davis as Sportin 'Life. If someone finds this in a home movie format, please let me know. I talk to my daughters all the time about things that they think are new, actually made. We went to see a live version theater a couple of years ago and all I could talk about was this movie. Unfortunately, my daughters do not remember seeing Sammy Davis Jr. in any production, although they have heard of it. Needless to say, they are not familiar with the other great actors in the movie. It is a big oversight not to have this classic movie (because of the cast) in a home movie format for collectors and for future generations. Anyway, in my opinion this version was the best!
