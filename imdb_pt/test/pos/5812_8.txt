This was my first look at this short-lived British TV horror series, but I had seen some horror films Hammer (Horror of Dracula, Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter) and I thought enough of them to take a look. This first episode was a shock - not out of horror, but out of all nudity. This "regular" TV in England in 1980? If so, it showed a lot more skin than we see in North America. There were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts, a scene where a guy put his hand in one, and another scene with the man on top of a woman pretending to have sex. Hey, I'm not complaining. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: a witch who disappeared in the 17th century returns to her former home and makes life difficult for the married man. The latter, Jon Finch as "David Winter", was not much of an actor, but his wife was not bad and was really a beauty. She was Prunella Gee as "Mary." Her husband rightly suspected her of having a case and that is part of this story. <br /> <br /> Patricia Quinn was entertaining as the witch laughing "Lucinda Jessup", who comes back with a she and has a good time tormenting the couple until things go wrong in the end. As a man, I would say it was particularly fun to see the two women doing it! This starts slowly, but once "Lucinda" starts shaking things up, it's a lot of fun.
