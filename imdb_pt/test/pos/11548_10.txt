Oh my gosh ! I can really say that Maya Angelou is one of the most intriguing and important people in the world, especially from my culture. She is incredibly inspiring and her story is the story of a great woman! When I first got this movie, I thought to myself that the cast was beautifully assembled now, let's see them in action! Maya Angelou is already my favorite PoetEss and now one of my favorite actresses and speakers. I believe she's the greatest ever. This movie left me at the tip of my seat and reached Kleenex, while at the same time I remembered that no matter where you come from if you decide it will be great then you will be great! And Ester Rolle played a wonderful supporting role ...... 100% AWESOME ... and right now "I know why the bird cage sings".
