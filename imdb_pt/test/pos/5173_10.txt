My Choir Santa Lucia was chosen to be in this film. All 100 plus. When it came time to film the movie, I was asked to choose only 10. Oh my God. We had a little girl who was early to have her tonsils out because she wanted to be in the movie. The choices were hard to make. The people of Georgetown are adorable like the people they show in the movie. Funny, kind, believing. The city sponsors an annual Christmas Market on the first two weekends of December each year. I've been there this year and it was wonderful. The town is lovely and people work hard to make it magical. The city appears today as when the film was made. Much credit goes to the Historical Society that works hard to maintain historical value. The school principal who was transformed into a charter school was given a prize by Colorado Governor for Volunteers.
