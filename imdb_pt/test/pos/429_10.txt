It seems like Hack was described as unrealistic ... but that's what the TV is. The TV is intended to provide an escape from everyday life and I feel that Hack does a great job in that regard. Add to this the slow process of revealing your past and engaging / interesting frames; you simply can not get enough. Also, with great actors like David Morse, Andre Braugher and even little Mathew Borish, what more can you ask for? So if you're looking for an engaging experience and have a liking for "unlucky" characters, I suggest giving Hack a chance, especially now that he's finally recovering.
