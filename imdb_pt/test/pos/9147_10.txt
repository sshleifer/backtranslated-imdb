No matter how many times Wile Ethelbert "Famishius Famishius" Coyote tries to get the Road Runner "Burnius Roadibus", we always know what will happen, although our sympathy will always remain with the WEC. The highlight in "Hook, Line and Stinker" is a scheme in the style of Rube Goldberg that the WEC hopes to end the RR; but of course you know what happens. <br /> <br /> So, Wile E. continues hilariously engaging in fanaticism (defined by George Santayana as redoubling his effort after having forgotten his aim) while Road Runner virtually never becomes aware of the potential danger - or lack of him - that he might meet. A real classic. <br /> <br /> And yes, the middle name of the coyote is Ethelbert. I learned this from "Jeopardy!"
