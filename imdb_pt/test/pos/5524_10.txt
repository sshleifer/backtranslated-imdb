The tentative title was: "Do not Spank Baby". Wayne Crawford has become a successful producer, films like "Valley Girl", "Night of the Comet" and others, although he is not so fantastic in this little gem. And the little-known Abe Zwick should have gotten tons of work with this movie but failed. Filmed at Moberly Studios in Hollywood, Florida, in the same lot, the first Tarzan films were filmed. This movie is definitely for those who appreciate the summary. The film was originally filmed with some nudity and a lot more graphic slasher scenes. For reasons known only to Tom Casey, the director, the bloody scenes of the slasher received an LSD flap and the nudity was removed. Even though this version is worthy of a look at those so inclined, in my opinion, the original version would have packed the punch needed to make it complete in the Slasher 70 Classic Cult.
