"Steamboat Willie (1928)" is often erroneously presented as the first Mickey Mouse movie, although this title actually goes to "Crazy Plane" (1928). The source that feeds this common misconception is probably an episode of "The Simpsons," which puts the origin of Itchy the Mouse in a 1928 short called "Steamboat Itchy," obviously a parody of this cartoon. Curiously, 'Steamboat Willie' was itself a parody, faking Buster Keaton's latest release, 'Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928)', although the connection extends little beyond the title and general story. In this short film by Walt Disney, Mickey Mouse takes control of a steamboat in the river, much to the annoyance of Captain Pete's cat, who rejects him. But Mickey is not to be overcome in spite. Far from the nice, healthy Mickey the latest generations have enjoyed, this little mouse only cares about the number one, inflicting pain and displeasure on a host of farm animals in order to provide music for their own enjoyment. <br /> First, there is the parrot laughing, throwing a bucket and a big potato on the head. Then a goat is triggered by the tail to provide music ("Turkey in the Straw") of a guitar she swallowed. A cat is swayed by its tail, a goose is strangled in the throat and a cruelly kicked pig. For a cartoon for children, 'Steamboat Willie', directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, certainly has some petty humor, although I have also noticed similar (though not so much) elements in some Disney short films, such as 'Gulliver Mickey' (1934) ). Let's not forget Minnie Mouse, of course, who suffers treatment for which she could sue today for sexual harassment! The jokes can be rude, and the animation maybe even more, but this cartoon offers a lot of laughs, and it's easy to understand why this little rodent has become one of the most beloved characters in movie history. If you are a fan of Mickey Mouse or Disney in general, this is a steamboat you should not miss.
