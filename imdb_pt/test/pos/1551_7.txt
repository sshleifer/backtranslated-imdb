After being turned off for a while, Columbo returned with some new TV-made mysteries that, while not as good as the original series, are better than the shows that were made in the late 1990's. > "Murder can be dangerous to your health" used the then (and I think now, if you think about it) the true crime shows how the situation of a murder. The murder is committed by a presenter of a true crime, egomanomaniacal and successful, George Hamilton (in a beautiful cast). His rival, who lost his job to him, played by Peter Haskell, tries to blackmail Hamilton when he discovers a porn video that Hamilton did with a minor actress in his salad days. Hamilton uses Haskell's cigarettes to deliver the death blow through poison, giving himself an alibi as well. <br /> <br /> Columbus is brought in to find out what happened. You know the rest. Highly fun.
