GLORIFYING NOT GLAMORATING WORLD WAR II. <br /> <br /> We had some series of documentaries on World War II in regular television programming. Without looking for any information in any encyclopedia or movie book, it seems that this old memory can remember most of the names entirely on their own. There was CRUSADE IN EUROPE, which was the title of the war memoirs of an army general and then the 33rd President of the United States of America, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He told the story of the conflict in Europe, seen by the Supreme Allied Commander. <br /> <br /> Then there was a CRUSADE IN THE PACIFIC (self-explanatory subject), of which I do not remember much. Journalist / Author, Jim Bishop was the host / navigator of BATTLELINE. <br /> <br /> And there was the excellent WINSTON CHURCHILL, THE VALUING YEARS. * The series was a co-production of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the American Broadcasting Company. It aired for the first time in the 1960-61 season here in the United States and is proud to have Richard Burton speaking the words of Sir Winston. <br /> <br /> It's the 1952 NBC Television Network production of our subject today, this VICTORY AT SEA that wins the cigar, hands down. For starters, this should have taken production to several years of carefully and literally separating thousands of hours of film. The film mentioned here was the official filmed record made by members of the United States Armed Forces, independent film, Motion Picture Record of our other allied partner nations, as well as captured photos of the Axis of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan. <br /> <br /> After that, the various matching films had to be cut and edited in a series of half-hourly installments. This was done with great skill, and there were so many changes of scene, either abruptly or as dissolution. The appearance of each episode seems as smooth as if it had been a single film project. <br /> <br /> Spoken Word's writing to accompany the best real-life movie was no less surprising and unique. Highly polite and meaningful eloquence does not miss a word, and sometimes underestimates the description of the action, rather than exaggerating it. The narration goes to Mr. Ralph Graves, who was a talented stage actor, film, radio and television. He certainly gained a measure of immortality through his golden voice from the descriptions of the written episodes. <br /> <br /> Finally, VICTORY AT SEA enjoys the luxury of having an original soundtrack, both opening theme and incidental music, written by Richard Rodgers of Broadway fame (Rodgers & Hart, Rodgers & Hammerstein ) His compositions are complex, complete, variable and even "classic" in the true sense. <br /> <br /> The classic arrangement was played by the NBC Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Robert Russell Bennett and as a soundtrack / cassette / compact disc, has been continuously available and in demand since its first release, 55 years ago! And, really, a little wonder, because it is this musical track that is so fascinating for the viewer / listener. He really puts the cover on this cake. <br /> <br /> * SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL, THE VALUING YEARS also had a great and memorable original soundtrack. This was also composed by Mr. Rodgers. <br /> ** We had in "Ace in the Hole" additional in our house in the person of our father, the late Clement J. Ryan (1914-74). Dad was in the US Navy during the war, being introduced in 1943 or 1944. Our Pop was always on hand to explain and further elucidate any of the situations that were portrayed in the series. <br /> <br /> He and our mother, the now 90-year-old Bertha (nee Fuerst) Ryan already had my older sister Joanne (1942-90) as a dependent.
