Forget all the spy movies you've ever seen - that's how life was in the USSR, and it's still in many places in Russia and in former Soviet countries. Vera dreams of leisure life, as the West imagines; its reality is very different, with a bitter mother, a violent father and the eternal alcohol. And their prospects for the future are not much better. She meets a man and they try to fix a life together, but he is afflicted by the same environment, both socially and physically - the setting in this movie is brilliant, sitting comfortably in the company of post-apocalyptic films, but obviously done with no special effects; They just walked in and filmed what happened in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Forget your stereotyped and cold Russian spy movies. This is the Real Deal: People are passionate, vibrant and present in a way you will never see in a Western drama.
