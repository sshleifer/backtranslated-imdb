I liked House of Dracula better than Frankenstein's. Carradine is much more reasonable and his acting is not as ridiculous and exaggerated as in HOF. The actors perform well enough. Subplots (for example, monster, village mafiosi, village idiot, hunchback nurse, etc.) are well mixed, so that none becomes a strange splinter as in HOF. Better to run than the stitched HOF. The hunchback nurse is as nice as the hunchback at HOF. The doctor is very good. In addition, Lon Chaney adds an elegant touch to his werewolf. Worth watching twice. A classic universal horror with that typical style of the 1940s, long lost. Especially good is the doctor's performance before / after his blood has been contaminated with Dracula.
