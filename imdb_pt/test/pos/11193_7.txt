"Distant" is a film of a Turkish slice of life that follows the mundane activities of two adult cousins; one a photographer and the other a failed unemployed. There is little doubt that author Nuri Bilge Ceylan is a work in progress with considerable talent. However, this small minimalist artistic drama abroad is so full of empty fill and so devoid of history or anything engaging or provocative that it will likely appeal only to avid movie devotees and the mainstream audience should look elsewhere. I personally was quickly bored with the slow pace of the film and found myself moving quickly through the empty spaces - and there are many - between dialogue, plot development and outcome. "Distant" is great esotericism. (B-)
