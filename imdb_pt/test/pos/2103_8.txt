With its release by ADV Films, I got a chance to watch "The Giant Majin" for the first time without the deep cuts and rude words from a late night Horror Chiller Theaters. Guess what? It's a very good movie! <br /> <br /> The scenarios are authentic, the acting is moderate and believable, and the giant Majin is imposing, powerful and impossible to be stopped. I loved the subtle fancy touches (the enchanted wood, the lucky amulet, etc.), and God's betrayal as a little less than 'good'. <br /> <br /> This movie is begging for a remake in the new movie. century!
