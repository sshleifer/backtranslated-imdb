This movie is not a comedy, it's an exhibition. I've always hated dog shows, considering the ridiculous ideas people put their dogs and the idiot names they give them. Hence the reason for my uncontrolled guffaw while watching this movie. I get a kick out of something being taken so seriously, even if the gains are small and insignificant. It's like mini-golf, or jumping championships or the need to set some obscure world record. The acting was much more refined in this film than Waiting for Guffman, and it is mainly due to the fluidity of the characters, who seem more comfortable with their specific acting partners in this film than in the previous one. Eugene Levy was great, as was Michael McKean and Fred Willard. However, it was the dogs that eventually stole the show. But again, who wants to see a lot of humans in a movie about dogs anyway.
