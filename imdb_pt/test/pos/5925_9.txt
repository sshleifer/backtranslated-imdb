Every year there is a must-see big budget title with the right combination of star, director and subject that fails miserably at the box office. This year was Superman Returns. In 1982, it was Blade Runner. In 1957, it was Billy Wilder's The Spirit of St Louis, a movie that had everything - top director, big star, best-seller of real-life story about an American hero - with the exception of a hearing enough to cover its costs. Perhaps the public still remembered Lucky Lindy's anti-Semitism and his admiration for Nazi Germany's pre-war conquests (not covered in the film, which ends with his arrival in Paris before the legend became too tainted). Maybe because they thought they knew the story or that it was just a guy trapped in the cockpit for two hours. Indeed, Wilder and co-writer Wendell Mayes are aware of the dramatic traps of Lindbergh's relatively monotonous flight, alternating between a well-executed flashback structure for key points in his life and the construction of his own flight. Once the film is on the air, it is both surprising and full of suspense, finding genuine drama in its attempts to stay awake and navigate without the proper instruments. <br /> <br /> He also builds a sense of dread that is unlike anything else. in the filmography of Wilder, allied to a true sense of the epic: photos like the sinister storm clouds on the hanger, the dark dawn before the flight carry a true cold of bad omen for them. Even the WarnerColor, usually with the weak and problematic appearance, contributes to the film instead of harming it. Along with the excellent use of CinemaScope, there is a remarkable note by Franz Waxman: majestic, growing, but full of subtle threats, and cleverly used as part of the film's fabric, rather than mere musical accompaniment. The film loses points by implicating, though never saying straight away, that this was a race to be the first to fly in the Atlantic - in fact, Lindbergh was the third man to cross the Atlantic after almost completely forgotten Brits Alcock and Brown is surprising flight eight years earlier - but it is still an extremely tense and captivating adventure story that deserved the success it has never encountered.
