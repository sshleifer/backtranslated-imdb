The plot is an underworld exposition of American politics. Although the theme seems common, what "makes" the film is the unconventional way in which the story is told. <br /> <br /> The characters are touched with conviction. You feel the innocence of lead and your lost innocence. The politician is the prince of small talk, a true snake. <br /> <br /> The camera work is impressive. It affirms the nuances of acting and dialogue. The same goes for music. <br /> <br /> The story uses a parable style with vingettes, where the message is filled with duplicates. A very shrewd writer / director strategy. The tension in the story is taken up to the last scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie was like a good mystery book. Something was "standing"; you knew it was bad; you did not know exactly what it might be - you had your suspicions; and when the evil was revealed, you let out the air you had not noticed you were holding. Sad, shaking his head. <br /> <br /> A story well written and well told. 3 cheers for a young writer / director.
