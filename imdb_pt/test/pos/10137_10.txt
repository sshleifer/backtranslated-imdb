EXCUSE!!! HellOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!! CUBA GOODING, Jr. Must have won an Oscar for his performance in this movie !!! It was the movie! While the film may be lacking in some areas, Cuba was incredible ... and for me, this is the best role he has ever played! The scene in the movie where he discovers his mother died made me break and cry IN THEATER !! I think I could relate to this movie because I saw the same treatment of people like that in my own school while growing up ... what a tragedy! Getting to see the "real" radio and trainer at the end of the movie was really special too! If you can watch this movie and not be brought to tears, you need a heart check! If you liked "Simon Birch" and "The Mighty", you'll love "Radio" too! I wish they would make more movies like this ... Radio is the Real Deal!
