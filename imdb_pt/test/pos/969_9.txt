BIG FAT LIAR, in my opinion, is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it. When Jason (Frankie Muniz - "MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE") and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes - "ALL THAT") played those tricks on Marty (Paul Giamatti - DOCTOR DOLITTLE), I actually smiled and felt good. This is what I liked the most about this movie. In fact, everything that happened after Jason's trial mistakenly ended up in Marty's hands was hilarious. I particularly loved Jaleel White's cameo. When I first saw him, I was not sure, but when I asked my mother if it was him, she said, "Of course!" Before ending, I would like to say, "As I said before, there is a moral in this story, and that morality is, always tell the truth." Now in conclusion, if you are a fan of Frankie Muniz, Amanda Bynes or Paul Giamatti, I highly recommend this absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it.
