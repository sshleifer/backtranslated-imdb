I almost did not see 'Hi-De-Hi!'. I think it must have been the title that put me off. In those days, the Welsh editions of 'The Radio Times' only used to print titles from certain shows without giving a piece of information about what they really were. 'Hi-De-Hi!' suggested a question-and-answer program led by Leslie Crowther or, worse still, an innate US import. But I managed to catch a later episode, and I was surprised to find out that it was written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft. <br /> <br /> As was the case with 'Dad's Army' and 'It's Not Half Hot Mum' Perry was based on personal experiences, in this case his time at a Butlins holiday camp. Before cheap air travel began in the 1960s, these camps sprang up along the British shores, providing entertainment for working-class families and earning millions for their owners. <br /> <br /> (As a matter of interest, I worked in one of those fields in the 1980s as a chef - Barry Island, South Wales - known to everyone as 'Shag Land' for reasons I will not enter! ) Define at the end 'In the 1950s, it began with college academic Jeffrey Fairbrother (Simon Cadell) taking over the post of entertainment manager for Maplin, a job for which he was poorly equipped. His team included resident comedian Ted Bovis (Paul Shane), his helper Spike (Jeffrey Holland), the miserable Punch and Judy Mr.Partridge (Leslie Dwyer), the snobbish dancers Barry (Barry Howard) and Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves) Diane Holland ) and the unforgettable Gladys Pugh (Ruth Madoc), who coveted Fairbrother at every opportunity. Bubbly Su Pollard stole the show though as Peggy Ollerenshaw cleaner, whose ambition to drive was to be a "Yellowcoat" (all important members of the team wore). A number of sexy girls also wore these coats, most notably Nikki Kelly's 'Sylvia' and Rikki Howard's 'Betty' sculptural. We never saw Joe Maplin, the owner. He communicated with his team in the form of non-grammatical missives, which poor Jeffrey was forced to read aloud. "Hi-De-Hi!" was the campers' salute, usually came across the equally monotonous' Ho-De-Ho! '. <br /> <br /> One of the fans was the late Sir Fred Pontin, who told Perry and Croft that he recognized most of the characters in real life. <br /> <br /> I've always found Bovis the most convincing of them. as well as the most tragic, like Archie Rice, he was the comedian, whose great opportunity never came, reduced to cracking fun jokes from drunken nightly audiences. He took advantage of his position to indulge in some perks and, in one memorable episode, Fairbrother's patience snapped and he said, "Lies, Ted! All the lies!" <br /> <br /> Like all the other Perry / Crofts, the cast was excellent, particularly Cadell and Shane. Ruth Madoc's gracious' Gladys' got me on my nerves (no wonder Anne Robinson detested the Welsh!), But misanthropic jockey 'Fred Qulley' by Leslie Dwyer 'Mr.Partridge' and Felix Bowness' more than made up for it. <br /> <br /> The visual gag that everyone remembers is Mr.Partridge, drunk, seeing a pantomime horse riding a real one on the beach. Looking at the bottle of whiskey in his hand, he decides to stick with it and instead throws away the banana he was eating! With its thorny blend of 50's nostalgia and spicy jokes, 'Hi-De'Hi' was a big hit for BBC-1 in the 1980's, resulting in a massive increase in reservations for Butlins and Pontins. He came down when Cadell left to go back to the theater. I never took him to his replacement, leader of the squad Clive Dempster (David Griffin). Worse, the death of Leslie Dwyer stole the show from one of his best characters. Kenneth Connor was brought in to replace him as "Uncle Sammy". <br /> <br /> The period that arose occasionally caused problems; In one episode, Sylvia and Betty had to dive into the pool to rescue Peggy, who for some reason was dressed as a shark. The revealing costumes they wore were wrong at the time. Still they looked good on them, so who's complaining? In another, Ted sang the Tom Jones hit 'Delilah' for the campers. It was not composed (by Les Reed and Barry Mason, incidentally) until 1968. Maplins closed its doors in 1988, and the last shot was that of Peggy (now a Yellowcoat) alone in the camp, jumping to the air and screaming (what else?) 'Hi-De-Hi!'. <br /> <br /> I do not rate it as well as other Perry and Croft programs, but their popularity is undeniable. It was probably one of the last British sitcoms to generate tremendous public affection, mainly because it featured friendly characters in a recognizable setting. Good night campers!
