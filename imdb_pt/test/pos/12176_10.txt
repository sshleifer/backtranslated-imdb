I was looking in the TV Guide for movies that came from Germany and I found one called The Bunnyguards, so I watched and I made a fool of myself! I wanted the DVD, but it is not available here (I could order it from Germany, but it has no subtitles) It was played again, so I recorded it and watched it from time to time. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I looked up information on him and found that his real name is Erkan & Stefan, but I know that for his Australian title: The Bunnyguards. Some people I know from Germany do not like Erkan & Stefan because of their accents, but not being myself German, I did not notice anything. The jokes are good, but some Germans may find that their accents are not good. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is funny and if the DVD had English subtitles on all the extras (having a 2 disc edition with only feature with subtitles would be bad) I would buy it in a heartbeat! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh and a very good story.
