I have been a fan of Mario since I remember, I have fond memories of playing Super Mario World as a kid, this game brought back many of those memories while adding something new. Super Mario Galaxy is the latest release of the incredible Mario franchise. There is much very different about this game from any other Mario before him, while still keeping intact the greatest elements of Mario, the first notable difference is that the story takes place in space. <br /> <br /> The story begins much like any other Mario game, Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a celebration at his castle in the Kingdom of Mushrooms. Upon arriving at Peach's castle, Mario finds Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) attacking the castle with their airships. Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then raises the castle into space. In the middle of the castle being erected in space, Mario falls and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is met by a star named Luma and is taken back to the home of Luma, a floating space station, here Mario meets many other Lumas and also knows his leader, a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser took the Power Stars from the space station and spread them across the universe. It's up to Mario to help the Lumas find them and save Peach, so the adventure begins. <br /> <br /> The way you play the game is flying from the space station to other galaxies, each galaxy is made up of several planets that Mario travels through levels of these shooting stars to retrieve the stars of power. Mario can often walk around planets without losing gravity, some planets are small and others are large, many planets are similar to Mario's classic environments. The best thing about the game are the controls, all things like skipping and such is still the same, but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. You shake the remote control. Mario will execute a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game, and will also activate the shooting stars. You can also point the remote control to the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment. Then there are the graphics, these are by far the best graphics on the Wii, it's so hard to describe how great this game looks, you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 ​​games. <br /> <br /> My only minor complaints is that the upside-down effect takes some time to get used to, and also the story is very weak. The worst part is that you lose all your lives when you turn off the game no matter how many you have when you gave up the last time you restarted in 4 lives. Still these small side issues is an excellent game that is a lot of fun and is very challenging. This is the kind of game we expected on Wii. <br /> <br /> A perfect 10 out of 10!
