<br /> <br /> Fourteen of the funniest minutes on celluloid. This short parody is at least part of the Star Wars saga as Phantom Menace, and much more fun if you ask me. Hardware Wars was the first in a long line of SW spoofs that form their own subgenre these days. I hate to describe it too much - it's so short that the premise is just about the whole thing. Suffice it to say that many of the most popular and familiar aspects of Star Wars have fun with them. Appliances like toasters and vacuum cleaners portray spacecraft and robots, Princess Anne-Droid's character uses buns on her head instead of the famous rolls of braided hair, and the Fluke Starbucker is even dumber than the original, if at all possible. Ernie Fosselius is a crazy son-of-a-buck, he is also the source of Porklips Now, the parody Apocalypse Now.
