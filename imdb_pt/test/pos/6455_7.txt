Clearly modeled after the first gangster movies that Warner produced in the same year, Little Caesar (1931) and The Public Enemy (1931), this gangster film is one of the best efforts I've ever seen. Although not at the same level as the classics mentioned earlier, she has a powerful performance of the young Sylvia Sidney. She is magnificent and offers her more natural lines than perhaps anyone else at the time. Gary Cooper is better than normal at this stage of his career. career and shows signs of what would follow in the years to come, when he rose to the top. The film has some fascinating villains in Paul Lukas (I've never seen him so obnoxious) and Guy Kibbee (what a shock to see him acting the villain). The direction of Rouben Mamoulian is very inventive, probably the first voice to show a person thoughts appear in this film. If you get the chance to see this little gangster movie, do not let the chance pass.
