This is a weird quirk, directed by the guy who edited "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". Chuck Conners performs a hilarious and exaggerated performance as the owner of a roadside "wax" museum that our doomed teenagers have accidentally collapsed around. The wax figures look "so real," points out one teenager. Heh, heh, heh ... It's not so much a horror movie as a strange mix of psychological horror and the old-fashioned style of "House of Wax." I can think of many, many horror movies that are worse than this.
