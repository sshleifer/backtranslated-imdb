I liked the movie, and the fact that it pointed quite high in dealing with some sophisticated material. I saw the movie in a preview preview, and it was not ruined by any silly video box that spoiled the ending. The performances were very good, especially Andrew McCarthy in a more mature role. I also liked the look of the film that gave it a mysterious and intimidating air. I also enjoyed some of the "twists" in the plot, and I do not want to give too much in case video boxes from other countries do not give away everything for free! The script was a bit overdone at times, but I appreciated the fact that the filmmakers were not afraid to challenge the audience with interesting and cryptic questions about the role of faith in our world. And while some might find the ending a little too open, I appreciated the fact that the film refused to tie everything orderly with a bow. This is not how life works.
