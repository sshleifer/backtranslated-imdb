This is one of Stan Laurel's best solo comedies, prior to the union of 1927 with Oliver Hardy. Laurel is a very good actor in the film and offers good comedy. The best scene of the film is when Stan dances with Mae Laurel (his wife of real life), in the Cafe Espanol. Stan does silly dances that are funny, without you listening to the song. I will recommend this to any Stan Laurel fan.
