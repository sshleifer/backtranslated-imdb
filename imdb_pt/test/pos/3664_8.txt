Have you ever wondered what it feels like to feel free? I am sure that each of us knows the meaning of freedom and never thinks seriously about using it to our advantage. HARI OM shows the public what freedom really means. In this film, freedom is described in the form of style represented by Isa's discovery of India. Isa discovers her true inner love when she is on a Rickshake journey with Mr. HARI OM. She looks at life differently and portrays the freedom that every woman restricts in herself when she is in a relationship. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely "deserving of a watch," and I first saw this at the Dubai International Film. Festival (DIFF), and I left the theater with total satisfaction. <br /> <br /> "Watch out!"
