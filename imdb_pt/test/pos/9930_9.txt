Horror-genius Dario Argento is one of my favorite directors, and his films "Suspiria", "Phenomena" and "Profondo Rosso" are at the top of my all-time favorite list. "Opera" of 1987 is yet another tempting and brilliant film that no Horror lover can afford to lose, and that will keep him on the tip of his chair from beginning to end. This dazzling and ultra-violent Giallo could very well be described as the master's worst film, which is one thing both considering that the films of Argento are not exactly known for the mildness of his violence. The violence is extreme and very stylized in a brilliant way that makes opera a nightmare for cinema. <br /> <br /> - Attention! SPOILERS AHEAD! Just when Betty (Christina Marsillach), a young opera singer, is becoming successful, a murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath begins to chase her ... The murders are really brutal and particularly sadistic in nature. The killer holds needles on Betty's eyelids tied, so she has to keep them open and watch as he brutally kills people next to her in disgusting ways. When the killing is over, the killer releases Betty and leaves, only to return to her other friends ... As usual for the Argento films, violence is extremely graphic and stylized. "Opera" is really a brutal movie, and what a stylish and atmospheric movie it is. This movie is absolutely tempting and pure suspense from beginning to end. The performances are entirely very good, especially Christina Marsillach is brilliant at leading. A gorgeous beauty and great actress, Marsillach fits perfectly into her role as a talented singer whose fear and horrible experiences are driving her crazy. Other great performances include Ian Charleston as director of Horror who is directing an opera, and Argento's real life girlfriend, Daria Nicolodi, who has a role in many of his films. The camera work is excellent as in all Argento films and the huge Opera House is a great setting that adds a lot to the beauty of the film and its permanently scary atmosphere. The track, which is partly classical and partly heavy metal, is also great, even though I've lost a bit of Goblin's Progressive Rock soundtrack, which is such a feature of most other Argento movies. "Opera" is truly a terrifying and absolutely dazzling experience of Giallo. This is an absolute must-see for any horror lover, and I recommend it to any other movie fan who is not very sensitive when it comes to extreme violence. Excellent and absolutely tempting!
