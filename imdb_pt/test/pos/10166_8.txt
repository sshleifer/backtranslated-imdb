"The Man Who Knew Too Much" (1955) is the remake of his 1934 Alfred Hitchcock thriller about a couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) on vacation in Morocco, where they were caught in a nightmare that includes murder, espionage, murder and worst of all, abduction of his 10-year-old son. The film that Hitchcock himself considered superior to the original is a lot of fun. Stewart and Day have good chemistry together. The film is filled with the wonderful comedy scenes and dialogues, as well as the chilling suspense scenes. The inclusion of "Que Sera, Sera" proved to be a stroke of genius because rarely does the song fit the content and play such an important role in the movie as "Que Sera, Sera" did in "O man who knew too much. " Hitchcock also treats us the live music of Arthur Benjamin's "Storm Cloud Cantata" for almost ten minutes while the scene at the Royal Albert Hall in London where the murder of a very important politician was tried and both, the scene and the cantata are simply marvelous.
