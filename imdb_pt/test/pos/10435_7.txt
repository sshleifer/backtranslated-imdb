I see there are great reviews of this movie, I have some points to comment on, why I thought there was something special about this movie ... First of all, the film is realistic. may not seem realistic to an adult who has forgotten what it was like to be a teenager, but that's really the kind of super-drama that happens between teenagers all the time. second, the good boy, the guy who treats women with respect, does not catch the girls. It's just the same, in real life the same way! he is too good for his own good. people are just selfish. Third, it was nice to see a fat guy who had some self-confidence. I mean, this role already takes the actor's confidence, I'm not just talking about the character. Overall, I found the film to be a positive surprise that secretly lurks among the crazy teen sex comedies at the party. do not misunderstand me, not everything is sad, it's a good laugh too.
