Dude, I can not believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie. Okay, it sure is not a sophisticated work of cinematic art. But it's a good dose of fun fun. For starters, the supernatural, pumpkin-headed killer guy has to be one of the most ridiculously silly and uncertain things to stumble across in front of a camera; it looks like something you would see in a fourth-rate carnival spook room. Secondly, moderate gore is ridiculously false and unconvincing, with the definite highlight occurring when this irritating and ultraconservative woman is electrocuted by a toaster. Then there is always the welcome presence of the always lovely Linnea Quigley, who presents herself in a memorable way taking a good, long and totally free bath that lasts for two minutes. Surprisingly, we also have appearances by John Carradine as an evil wizard and Cameron Mitchell as a horror TV host. In addition, berating queens Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith have fleeting appearances. Actor-son Ryan Latshaw projects all the charm and acting ability of an old moldy tree trunk. Beautiful brunette Rachel Carter appears on her top and discovers her cute little tits. Raw special effects are decidedly less than special. Punctuation is adequately exhausted. However, this film in general has a certain grimace appeal to him, which in turn makes this honey a real joke delectable to see.
