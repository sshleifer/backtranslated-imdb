As I write this article (January 25, 2006), I am saddened to learn of the passage in the last hours of Chris Penn. In addition to Footloose, The Wild Life is the movie I most remember Chris. <br /> <br /> I still remember in the movie, with slight affection, the wrestling character of Chris and teammates sitting at his favorite restaurant with a huge plate of chips in front of them, drowned in a bottle whole ketchup. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my comment is about the title track sung by Bananarama. After so many years, I still remember the rumor (Canadian spelling - lol) that Bananarama was called at the VERY LAST moment to compose the track for the movie and that they wrote the song on the plane connected to the recording studio to record the song and shortly after they recorded the song, they were filming the low-cost video for the title track. I heard that this entire process (from start to finish) took 4 hours to do! If this is true, then they really are worthy of being the most successful female band of all time. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is just a rumor I had heard back in the day and I still remember a generation later. Maybe those who read this can comment and clarify. Thank you.
