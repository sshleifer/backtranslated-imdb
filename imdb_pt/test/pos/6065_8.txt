First of all, I am an American - I have not yet seen comments about the series about this series in an American viewer. Secondly, I work in the developing television business. So I swallow a lot of the mud coming out of the American broadcast schedule. "Unit One" is an example of television that is a setback to what I call a 1970s-style roadmap in terms of resources. That is, those films made by young auturesurs who had free rein to make the dramas feel more realistic and allow the development of the organic character. It follows more of the lines of British stellar dramas like "Cracker" and "Prime Suspect", as well as the brilliant "Underbelly" of Australia. "Unit One" presents stand-alone cases that are confirmed and resolved each week. The mysteries are not extraordinary or particularly Byzantine. They usually focus around a single twist, usually with the 40-minute mark, and the resolution is well wrapped up in the next 15 minutes. What makes this series a breath of fresh air is that it features the main characters that you are addicted to and can be found by Episode 2. These are real, breathing and living characters that have personal luggage but it is not a baggage type that American wreckage like "Gray's Anatomy" or "Desperate Housewives" spread. These are realistic individuals whose background stories unfold slowly throughout the series, as if you worked with them daily. After the careless decade of "CSI's", "NCIS's" and "Criminal Minds," along with their subsequent spawns, it's great to sit down to watch the friends you want to spend time with, such as "Unit One ". "The banter, the foolish dialogue of wood, and the exaggerated danger that the American series I have mentioned attack us each week are absurd compared to the nuance and quiet resonance you have with this remarkable Danish series.I am in episode 7 of the first season, but I've already bought all four seasons and I'm ready for the long run.If you need explosions and funereal testosterone along with music from The Who and paralyzed camera action with neon and nerve lights with key characters coded as your main diet of television drama show, I suggest you stay away from this series.If you are an adult with a hunger for dramas of subtle, moving, thoughtful, and sometimes straightforward procedural crimes, I ask you to take a look at this program.
