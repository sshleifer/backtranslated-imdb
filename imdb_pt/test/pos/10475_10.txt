Some have commented that captions are not a problem in this movie - I beg to differ - disruptions in facial expressions and subtle interactions between the characters is such that you can not afford to look away for a fraction of a second. I tried to watch, on DVD, in English to overcome this problem (do not make this mistake, the result is a farce). The only way to get the full benefit is to watch it two or three times in quick succession so you know and ignore the captions. A master class of performance - not in dialogue, but in body language. <br /> <br /> It's the little things - the postmaster / shopkeeper jumps his chest and goes in to get the cap before handing a letter from France! ! The confused expression of the General as his delight in a handful of perfect grapes provokes a biblical reference with a depth worthy of 'Being There'. The cinematography is incredible and the shadowy minimalist village with its faded color only accentuates the sumptuousness of the party when it comes. I have a friend who claims to be a descendant of the Borgias and who is the motto of the family: 'If it's worth doing, it's worth doing the excess' - Amen. <br /> <br /> I laugh loudly and cry every time I watch this movie
