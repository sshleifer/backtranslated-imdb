This TV adaptation was a wonderful vehicle for Bill Irwin to show his ability to perform physical humor. Against the backdrop of a fight between an actor and his writer / director, Bill uses his antics to showcase a variety of abilities, including hat tricks, pantomime, dance, and various physical devices. <br /> <br /> Although it takes a major theft in the entertainment industry and its craft, it is captivating for people of all spheres and ages. <br /> <br /> This work was televised as a PBS special. Bill performed a part of it on the Tonight Show, but out of context, it did not go well.
