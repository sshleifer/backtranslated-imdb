bright script .. <br /> <br /> the script is very tight ..that you will be gel in the bank .. <br /> <br /> this movie is an example of film can only survive with script and no -History required .. <br /> <br /> History is very simple that you can write in a line. but the script was amazing .. <br /> <br /> brilliant performance by Vijay and Prakashraj .. <br /> <br /> although the plot is similar to the okkadu .. director adapted only the plot. The Tamil version is very fast than Telugu. <br /> <br /> The movie travels straight, without any chance of detour, although you can understand each of the characters. <br /> <br />
