I was immensely impressed by this movie, if for nothing more than for the comedy. It may not be the most daring and witty humor at all times, but I thought it was appropriate for every scene. <br /> <br /> The flow of the film is certainly a bit confusing, sometimes confusing, but that's how the characters feel. Sometimes we're watching a bit of slapstick and other scenes revolve around a decisive discourse about relationships. This can be a bit frustrating for some viewers, but it has brought me closer to the dilemmas of the characters' uneven chaos. <br /> <br /> The performance is great for everyone. I'm a big fan of Andy Richter, but I was not upside down on his part like everyone else seems to be. He did very well, but Julianne Nicholson and Lauren Graham stole the show for me, both in their respective ways. Jay Mohr performs as expected if you've seen him in other movies. I always liked him. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is very funny and offers some good foundations for some types of relationships. When it comes to relationship issues and problems, some movies try to surprise. There is nothing surprising about the conclusions offered here, but it is fun to see them being revealed throughout the film.
