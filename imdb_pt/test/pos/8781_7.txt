Cummings is falsely accused of sabotage and runs off, searching for the real culprit. The familiar Hitchcock theme of a man mistakenly charged with a crime is well interpreted in this entertainment program that features elements of "The Thirty Nine Steps" and "North by the Northwest," though not as good as any of these classics. There are some impressive pieces, including the end of the Statue of Liberty. The plot is implausible and unconvincing and, after a fantastic start, seems to run out. Cummings is nice if he's a little tough on leadership. Lane is the blonde, but not the cool variety of the director's later films. Supporting roles are usually well played.
