2:37 is an intense and fascinating drama that has some similarities in tone and subject with films like Bully, Elephant and Kids (although, from my point of view, 2:37 is a film superior to these three). film, my expectations were neutral, but I ended up having a very good impression thanks to the clever script, the perfect direction of Murali K. Thalluri and the excellent performances of a group of young actors. <br /> <br /> Sporadic instances of school violence around the world have inspired many films, TV shows and books that seek to find and predict the external or internal reasons for these unbridled expressions of rebellion, discontentment ... and especially madness . Some people may say that 2:37 comes too late for this artistic movement; however, I do not think so, because this delay allowed the film to make a more artistic analysis, focusing the situation with more subtlety and intelligence, instead of the obvious reaction of cruelty and anguish that pervaded other films with similar stories. In the characters of 2:37, we can find clich√©s of juvenile cinema (from director and screenwriter John Hughes - RIP films - for teen horror movies): the beautiful "princess", the clumsy "nerd" , unfriendly athletes, etc. It would have been very easy to make them become hollow caricatures defined by their role in the script; but it's something admirable that the script transcends the stereotypes to make them real people with believable problems that to a greater or lesser degree, anyone can find on their way to maturity. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is an excellent film, whose only flaw is that the end looks a bit affected, but that makes up for it with many positive elements. It will be very interesting to see the next projects of Thalluri, since he had a great debut with this film.
