I finally found a version of the persuasion that I like! Anne does not look like a maid in this version, just a very thin, aged and beautiful woman, as she is described in the book. Captain Wentworth does not seem to be 50 years old, nor does he seem perpetually annoyed, but, as he described it in the book, he has not aged as much as Anne and is quite handsome. And they play their parts with such conviction and realism ... that's what acting is. They were believable. They created real characters and it was as if the characters in the book came to life. If you have not yet seen this version, I ask you to find it, order it or request it from a bookstore or a library, if necessary. Well worth the price and worth the wait. <br /> <br /> I watched the 1995 version, and the 2007 version and this one on the other two. Why is not rated higher is beyond my comprehension. The book conveys the tenderness of their relationship and this movie makes the book come to life.
