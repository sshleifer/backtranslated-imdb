Sleeper Cell is what it should have been. 24 is a cartoon. (I watch 24, but I feel cheated with every stupid episode, all four or five seasons so far.) Jack gets in trouble, Jack gets out of trouble and then immediately back to trouble. so ...) Sleeper Cell is very well done and is far superior. Unfortunately they blew it all away with the end of season two. I can think of half a dozen better endings from the top of my head that would have worked best for the writer's obvious goals and were not as planned. Shame on the screenwriters for destroying what was happening until the end of a really good series.
