Surface is one of the biggest TV series I've seen. The acting is great and the plot is fascinating. Each episode left me barely able to wait to watch the next. I particularly thought Carter Jenkins, who played Miles Bennett, did a great job ... he's a very talented actor and I look forward to seeing more of his work. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that Surface has only made one season ... again the audience disappointed me. It's hard to imagine that such big shows would be canceled, while reality shows continue year after year. Who made the decision to cancel this show really fell the ball on this.
