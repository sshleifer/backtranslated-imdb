After being expelled from their last job and finding scarce employment in the UK, the six members of Wonder Boys, better known as The Crazy Gang, see a job advertisement in the Red Strike City of Red Gulch in Yukon Territory. It's from a newspaper clipping and on the back there's a story about Chamberlain saying the country is better prepared for war. Out there, they go to the Yukon and The Frozen Limits. <br /> <br /> By the way, it is the case of the Chamberlains in mischief. The cut is forty years old and refers to Joe Chamberlain and the Boer War instead of Neville in the current crisis. But this is typical of how things go for this team. I can see Stan Laurel making the same mistake. <br /> <br /> Of course when they get there it is a ghost town inhabited only by the young Jean Kent and his grandfather Moore Marriott. He has been making progress for years and is a little touched in the head. The Marriott has a gold mine it's missing somewhere it's going to sleep, that's when you're sleepwalking. The better class will help you discover that my beautiful Kent or not will not marry Anthony Hulme, but rather with Bernard Lee, a fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> This was my first exposure The Crazy Gang and I can see both why they were so acclaimed in the UK and why they never made any impact on the lake. The jokes come fast and furious, and then a number of things that the US Code simply would not allow. The jokes are also strictly topical British and many of them would not be seen here. <br /> <br /> Visual jokes are universal, the final scene of persecution is worthy of anything that the Marx Brothers did in America. My suggestion is that if you watch The Frozen Limits, record it if you are familiar with British history and run it two or three times just to make sure you got it all. It will be worth it.
