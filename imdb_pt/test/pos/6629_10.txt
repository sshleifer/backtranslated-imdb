Being a big fan of Bergman I had to literally search for years to find this movie (at a price under $ 60, I mean) and finally bought it a few weeks ago. The basic premise of Bergman's films is the relationships between the characters and how they deal with difficult situations. This film, therefore, is the same, but it is different because the setting is very different than most of the Bergman movies I have seen. <br /> <br /> It is set in time of war and the heroes are caught in the middle. It's fascinating from beginning to end and once again proves that Liv Ullman is one of the greatest actresses of the twentieth century. A must see.
