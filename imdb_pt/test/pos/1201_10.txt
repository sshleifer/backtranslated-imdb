I'm not a big musical fan, but this is one of the few that I really love. Unlike many other musicals, like "The Sound of Music," none of the songs is about free stuff. Each song is social commentary, insight into war, sexuality, recalcitrance, spirituality, and freedom. Especially incredible songs are "Easy To Be Hard", "Age of Aquarius", "Hair", "Flesh Failures / 3-5-0-0", "Walking In Space" and "Hare Krishna". Totally revolutionary and wonderful. I can not wait to someday see this live!
