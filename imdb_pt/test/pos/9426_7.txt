Since the others have complained about putting Sherlock Holmes in a contemporary setting, I will not do that. Basil Rathbone could fit in any season with that voice, that savoir faire. This is a well-crafted mystery loosely based on "The Dancing Men," one of Conan-Doyle's best stories. Instead of the original plot, it makes the men part of a Nazi conspiracy. Holmes becomes a spokesman for the British war effort. His opponent is Moriarity, who seems to die often enough to rival the central figure in Friday's 13th films. He's certainly creative, but the Rathbone Holmes is undisturbed. Watson is just for the ride on this one. He does not have much stupidity to spit on this movie and that's a real advantage. The plot is complex enough to maintain interest. There is a final speech that is almost a parody of itself. But then I can not be critical of a time and nation that was under great pressure. If they needed to call Holmes, so be it.
