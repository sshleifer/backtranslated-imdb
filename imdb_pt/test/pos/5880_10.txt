I was impressed when I saw "The best years of our lives". The performance, script and direction of master William Wyler (winner of Best Director in 1946) is Brilliant. <br /> <br /> This movie is about three World War II veterans who return home from war and reunite with their loved ones, but have to deal with the difficulties of returning home from war. The first man Al Stephenson (played by Fredric March in his Oscar-winning role) comes home to meet his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy)) and the children Peggy and Rob (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall) are more grown up and different than before they left for the war. <br /> <br /> Second man Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews) has to find a good job and return home to a wife with whom he had married just 20 days before leaving for the war. He begins to discover that she is not the same. Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his Oscar-winning role) lost his hand in the war and must deal with Wilma's family and fianc√© (played by Cathy O'Donnell) reactions to the hooks which he has instead of his hands. <br /> <br /> All these men and their families are gathered in the film in different scenes. The stories of these men are all beautifully intertwined. <br /> <br /> This movie truly defines the meaning of a "classic". This unforgettable drama (winner of best film in 1946) is a movie that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If you asked me to choose a favorite movie, that would be it! <br /> <br /> From 10 I would give "The Best Years of Our Lives" An 10. <br /> <br /> So the next time you go to your local rental store to rent this movie, you will not regret! <br /> <br /> NO objectionable material, a good family movie.
