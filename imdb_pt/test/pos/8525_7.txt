I always liked Sean Connery, but like James Bond I always favored Roger Moore. Still, it was Connery who set the Bond standard and, while in 1983 establishing himself as something other than James Bond, the money must have been irresistible for him to make yet another appearance like 007 and save the world from Specter's evil designs. <br /> <br /> And what projects they are in Never Say Never Again. SPECTER with the help of a young Air Force officer who happened to be Kim Bassinger's brother stole two nuclear missiles during a war exercise and now the SPECTER headed by Blofeld, represented here by Max Von Sydow, threatens the world's blackmail. > <br /> The face of Von Sydow's operations is Klaus Maria Brandauer, who is also courting Bassinger and is a little crazy. And he has a murderer working for him in Barbara Carrera who makes Angelina Jolie as Nora Croft resembles Mrs. Butterworth. <br /> <br /> But before Sean Connery can even begin, he has to deal with a new 'M' running things through British intelligence. Edward Fox thinks Connery is old-fashioned in his methods and costs British taxpayers a lot of money in his violent ways. I really enjoyed Fox's performance, he's like Colonel Blimp's great-grandson. <br /> <br /> I also liked Carrera, she is something to see and quite ingenious in her methods. When she's diving with Connery in the Bahamas, watch how she puts Shark in 007's case. Will Connery make James Bond again? He was widely quoted as saying who they would put him at this time, the father of Roger Moore? But I think Connery would still be formidable in a wheelchair.
