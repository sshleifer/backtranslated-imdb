There are pictures in this film that could be Renoir paintings with vivid colors against soft backgrounds. The humorous combination of sexual honesty and innocence is refreshing in this movie of the fifties and makes palatable the old story of the naive who becomes a star. The number of can-can at the end seems realistic and exciting, but not exaggerated as in an American dance sequence.
