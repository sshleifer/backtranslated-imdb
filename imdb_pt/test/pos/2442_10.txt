This is the Australian TV series. It's a classic. The stories and actors are great. Who can forget Picker and his gramophone or Chet being ambushed? This is cult TV. The Australian actors in the series were the best of their day and have immortality in The Outsiders. What can I say timeless adventure? The music and the music are fantastic. The closing credits starting with the close-up of the wheel, so Keir sleeping n being pushed around and then the shot can not get much better than that. All 13 episodes are equally solid in the portrait of the Australian myth and I think that's what this series has. No matter that the two main characters were from outside, I think that's the key to the series and why it's so good.
