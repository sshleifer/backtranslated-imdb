If you are familiar with the work of author Johnny To and his group of film producers on Milky Way, you know what to expect with this latest production. All the familiar elements are in place: the strong camaraderie between two characters: usually a policeman and a villain, the coincidences and the chances that turn into a penny and pay generously in the end, and the humor that arises even in the most terrible Andy Lau plays a man who has 72 hours of life and decides to rob an insurance company. Lau Ching-Wan (also brilliant at other Milky Way movies like "Longest Nite," "A Hero Never Dies" and "Where a Good Man Goes") portrays a hostage negotiator / cop who is at the thief's tail, thief creates a number of tricks and tips that he must follow to get his man. <br /> <br /> Funny, poignant and cool while subtle, "Running" is actually one of the most fun Milky Way. movies to date. Do not miss the performances of the two tracks, esp. Andy Lau, generally considered a middle-aged actor who has rarely been so natural and fun to watch. This movie is one to go out of your way to see.
