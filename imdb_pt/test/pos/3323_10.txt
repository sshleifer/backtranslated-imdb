I saw this movie for the first time in 1959 at Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when I was fifteen years old. I loved it and still love it. The cast is great - in those days the actors acted "naturally" and you "felt" for them in their respective roles. A "brilliant" film of the period - relationships in it are still relevant to the world today, but now the sexes are on the same level, women should not or should not allow the kind of treatment exhibited in the past. The soundtrack is wonderful and it is a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January 2005. Feather scenes were cut before the release - even at two o'clock you want more! I registered on Amazon for the DVD (they now have a special page). To see this movie in CinemaScope, after forty-six years of pan and scan will be great. Twentieth Century Fox, please look more at your catalogers of fifty cinematographic productions for DVD - there is a big market out there. I look forward to the March 2004 US arrival of the Vanity Fair Special article on the film, which is said to be fifteen pages with many photos on set. Cheers.
