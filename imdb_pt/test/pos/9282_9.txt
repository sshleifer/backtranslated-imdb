This is the first movie I've seen in Singapore and it's great. If you do not know much about Asia, its languages ​​and its culture, then this movie can be a bit confusing for uninformed people. As an Asian-American who has dual training in two Asian languages ​​(one of them is Mandarin) and did some Asian American Studies classes, this film was easier to understand, but even without this kind of knowledge, I believe this film is still accessible to your foreign audience as long as you keep in mind that it is a type of maturing film. The film is definitely worth seeing just so you have the chance to see what kind of problems the young teenagers from Singapore are struggling and having to deal with. This is an incredible film of maturing, but filmed and exhibited in a more artistic and original way. The actors are excellent.
