This movie was beautiful and exciting. He touched a place inside me and I'm not sure why. I am a happy woman and have never had lesbian tendencies, but my, this movie almost did something that I desire. The choreography, the plot, the dialogue ... the film was a work of art. <br /> <br /> The no-spoiler synopsis is that a woman gymnast is unsatisfied with her life and looking for something, anything. She has a man who does not want a baby, but she wants it. He's not mean to her, but he does not treat her the way a woman should be treated ... I do not think he likes her very much. All these years she got in shape and decides to go back to the gym. She meets another woman during her acrobatic training and an intimate and beautiful relationship unfolds. Throughout the film she has another friend she trained in her younger years, and they remained close friends. <br /> <br /> The relationship that unfolds is .. I do not know the word well, but very understanding, comfortable, intimate, but sexy ... something that could only exist between two women. The kind of relationship that could really bring meaning back into your life. Someone who makes you feel special, exciting, beautiful, really confused. <br /> <br /> The relationship with your close friend is beautiful in an equally different way. They have a close and intimate relationship. Your friend showed me what a true friend really is. Someone who is understanding, easy, REAL, fun to be, someone who is there for you, no matter what. Someone who is supportive, and you can snuggle and tell your deepest secrets. Someone who shares his past but does not share his secrets. <br /> <br /> The story is simple in that it was not exaggerated, but not underutilized at all. Leaves a lot of sexy images to capture your moments. The dance and the choreography were impressive. I could watch more and more. The way the artist captured the feelings and emotions of the main character was. The dancing and the pictures were so dazzling and mesmerizing to watch. What a wonderful and cozy story! I fell in love with this movie. If you have a chance, rent and watch !!
