It was in one day in 1891, when the Scottish inventor William K.L. Dickson surprised his boss, Thomas Alva Edison, with his remarkable work in film development. After many experiments, Dickson was now able to capture real-life scenes with his camera, and reproduce them through his invention, the Kinetoscope, as if a fragment of time were preserved in the celluloid. Soon, Dickson's Kinetoscope would become a huge hit as a new form of entertainment, with many people eager to pay for nickel that was charged to watch people dance, or acrobats performing stunts through the Kinetoscope peepshow. However, the invention was not complete so that it could capture real-life film as we know it, sound was needed in the movies. So Dickson continued experimenting and this short experience, the first Kinetophone movie, was the result. <br /> <br /> In this experiment, codenamed simply as "Dickson Experimental Sound Film", director William K.L. Dickson is in front of a recording cone for a wax drum (first method of recording sound), with his violin in his hands, playing a song called "Song of the Cabin Boy." The idea was to record the song in the drum at the same time the camera recorded its movements. To show that it was a movie, two of Edison's "Black Maria" lab decided to do a little dance in front of the camera. Contrary to what author Vito Russo claimed in his book, "The Celluloid Closet," this little dance had nothing to do with homosexuality, as it obviously is a reference to the solitary environment of the laboratory, similar to the lonely sailors of the Cabin Boy "was dedicated to (the title suggests Russian," The Gay Brothers, "is actually anachronistic as" gay "had no homosexual connotation in the late 1890s). Unfortunately, Dickson was unable to get the desired effect, and the Kinetophone could never really produce the audio synchronized with images.While it had the drum with the sound and the celluloid with the images, the synchronization of the two elements was not exactly effective, and the sudden appearance of Auguste and Cinématographe de Louis Lumière led the Edison team to focus on designing systems, and finally Dickson left the company.Fortunately, in 1998 Dickson's drum with the sound of the film was rebuilt and the editor of and movies Walter Murch did a restoration of the experiment as he intended. Finally, "Dickson Experimental Sound Film" could be heard with synchronized sound, just as its inventor intended creator. Although not a successful attempt, this excellent film is a testament to the enormous genius of Kinetoscope's father. 8/10
