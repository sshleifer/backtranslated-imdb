I was one of the lucky people to be invited to see this movie in New York. It's a compelling story of how a group of extremely tense friends dealt with the tragedy of September 11. This movie made me laugh and cry and showed me how the human spirit through love and friendship can last and create wonderful things in one of our darkest days. Filmmakers truly captured the emotions of the individuals involved. It was amazing to see how the same story was told in the eyes of so many different people. I left the theater that day wanting to call all my friends just to say hello. I would recommend everyone to see this documentary. I would rate this movie with an A ++++++++++. See if you have a chance.
