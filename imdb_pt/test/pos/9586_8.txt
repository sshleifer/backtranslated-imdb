I always enjoy watching this cartoon, with Sylvester trying to get Tweety on a train instead of at Grandma's. In fact, it's a standard fare, but fun, especially when the Tweety pulls the emergency stop cord. One of my complaints about this is how sloppy the animators were with the train. When you watch it over and over, as my little boy did (who loves trains, and that's why he liked it so much), you start to notice a few things. <br /> <br /> In all this time, the position of the luggage car changes on the train, whether on 3rd, 4th or 5th, and on long flights not at all. The engine has the number 651 or 814 or none. The coal auction has the number 99 or the letters "S.P. & Q.R." in it, or no number or letters. Coaches carry the "S.P.Q.R." without the "&" in long planes, and then in close it has the words "Southeast and West". <br /> <br /> All this does not interfere with the story, but the details of the production were obviously not seen. very carefully. <br /> <br /> Yet this cartoon is among my favorites with Sylvester and Tweety.
