If you like Cagney, you'll like this movie. It has the pretense of American integrity at any cost, personal or social. Cagney plays head of weights and measures in New York. Cagney faces dishonest politicians, clandestine criminals, a prominent philanthropist and simple grocers who add a few ounces to the price of a chicken. The chicken scene is hilarious where Cagney finds a weight placed in the bird cavity by an unsuspecting butcher. The chicken is thrown around the store in a hilarious scene about who controls the "evidence". If you like old phones, there are interesting scenes of dials, phones and even bizarre phone lines. Compared to a lot of movies made today, this is pure entertainment and includes mystery with comedy and a message that honesty above all else should be the guiding principle of humanity. Done in simpler times, it reflects a world we can not find today. Fashion (especially hats) outwear and automobiles play a prominent visual role in the definition of this little film.
