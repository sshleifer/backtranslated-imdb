The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful musical film of all time. The 1973 musical remake of James Hilton's novel about the mythical SHANGRI-LA! it is a real special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange blend of drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction of being the ONLY anti-war musical fantasy ever filmed. <br /> <br /> This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but it made a lot of money overseas. Only in America did it fail. Highly different and unique in its approach as a musical film, it deserves much better credit than it is given. As a story, LOST HORIZON is an incredible adventure and both Frank Capra's 1937 film and this 1973 musical are faithful adaptations of James Hilton's novel. What I like about the 1973 version is the freedom in which musical numbers are presented. The film has a prestigious cast and a talented director and cinematographer. This is a BURAR BACHARACH Shangri-La and it is a wonderful place. Songs like THE WORLD IS A CIRCLE, SHARING JOY AND LIVING TOGETHER, GROWING TOGETHER, evoke a happiness that Hilton wrote in her novel. Why should not Shangri-la be a little silly place? The two love songs, I MIGHT FRIGHTEN HER AWAY and the deleted I COME TO YOU are the touch points in the photo. There is a tranquility and a soft speaking quality in these two songs, which is very consistent with the philosophy of history. Also, the things I will not miss is a good duet with a strong melody. Is it a good exchange of different kinds of perspective and who can criticize Olivia Hussey and Sally Kellerman, singing and dancing at the tables? They are a wonderful team and the number is well staged. <br /> <br /> I've always found it interesting in this story as the High Lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to take their place in Shangri-La. The character of the High Lama is a gentle but somewhat radical soul in his view of mankind as a whole. He has no hope for the world outside the Shangri-La. If this movie were redone today, it would be interesting to see more emphasis on the main character, RICHARD ONWAY's conflict with what he left in the outside world as opposed to what he found in Shangri-La. <br /> <br /> Of course, for the film to be believable, RICHARD CONWAY's character should be presented as suffering from amnesia in the end as he was in the book. Not even the cinematic versions of LOST HORIZON were true to the novel in this regard. Conway found Shangri-La or was it imagined? Did they all die in the plane crash? Every man has his own idea of ​​what his Shangri-La would be. The conflict with Conway wanting to believe in Shangri-La and returning to his former life in the outside world is powerful. I like the melancholy on the faces of Kellerman, Kennedy and Van as they watch their friends come out of the mystic valley. Interesting as Conway does not want to leave paradise, but is being pressured by his brother. Both versions of LOST HORIZON work in different ways, but both are successful in plumbing James Hilton's ideas about a hidden valley where money is worthless and moderation is the rule. So in a sense it is anti-capitalism in its subject where money and materialism are not the motivation. Human goodness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette, and living harmoniously with each other is the rule. <br /> <br /> LOST HORIZON has a much stronger story than most musicals. He tries to answer the fundamental basic questions of life and can hardly blame him for not having succeeded. It must be remembered that the HORIZON LOST in 1973 was post CABARET. It was no longer fashionable for the characters to break into music in a musical, much less to be dubbed by other singers. LOST HORIZON was an easy target for tired critics. Expectations were high, almost irrational. There were two targets to hit, the producer, ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH and the critics were out to get them both. Ross Hunter enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and LOST HORIZON was his follow-up to his 1970 box office hit, AIRPORT. This film was Universals' biggest money maker up to that point and the success of that image unleashed a decade of disaster films. For years AIRPORT was the most watched movie of all time on television. He was nominated for 11 Oscars, including Best Picture. At the time, Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the country's most successful songwriters. The shameless sentimentality of LOST HORIZON hardly had a chance in the wake of the collapse of censorship in films like EASY RIDER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and THE GODFATHER. Sex and violence were a new frontier in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The audience was gathering in movies with content they were not used to seeing on screen. Luxurious musicals were no longer welcomed, no matter how well they were done. Today LOST HORIZON can be enjoyed and enjoyed on several levels. It's the ultimate escapist movie with a strong story, wonderful music, an expensive budget and some quirky humor. It is not conventional in the sense that music is not introduced up to 45 minutes into the movie. It changes course in the middle of the road when the mystical valley is introduced and why not? LOST HORIZON '73 is a heavenly movie that deserves to be rediscovered. A lost and legendary treasure that deserves far better than its reputation.
