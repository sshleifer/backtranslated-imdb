This is one of L & H's most cited short films as the first "real" L & H and perhaps one of its best silent features. J. Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who came to the docks to greet his nephew Philip, whom he never saw. At first Ollie is laughing at everyone when this strange little man gives up and draws much attention to himself by the way he is behaving during his medical examination, but he is rather humiliated when it is seen that this is the subject to whom he should be greeting . He was told that Philip is a good boy, but he has a weakness - women. Mumblethunder and Philip leave to go home, but their journey is continually interrupted by Philip, who begins to dance a little every time he sees a woman, then running after the woman. Crowds gather every time this happens, not so much because he is chasing skirts, but because Philip himself is also wearing a skirt (a kilt). Finally Mumblethunder manages to drag Philip into a tailoring to be measured by a good pair of pants, but Philip escapes from there also to pursue more skirts. There are lots of laughs everywhere. It's also cool to see a short so because the kids are not exactly the characters we know and love. Ollie is pretty much his usual character, but it's a joy to see Stan acting so differently from the usual man-child character. It shows that he was not a pony of a trick and excelled in other types of roles when he had the chance. With a run time of 19 minutes it is short and sweet, providing a classic lining that still holds me in stitches.
