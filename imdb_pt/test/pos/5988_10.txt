This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time! The director did a wonderful job of showing the contrasts between social classes, a situation that is very pertinent in France today. All the characters are adorable, especially Juliette and her family. The development of the novel is, though not entirely realistic, at least plausible, and does a wonderful job showing how much people will change for love. I found this to be a heartwarming Cinderella story - but one in which Cinderella is a powerful woman in herself. I laughed all over this movie and I loved it. I recommend Romuald et Juliette for anyone who likes unique characters, comedy and non-traditional romance.
