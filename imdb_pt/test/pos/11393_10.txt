Everything you need to know about pornography from the late 70's and early 80's is all wrapped up in BOOGIE NIGHTS by Paul Thomas Anderson. Although the film is completely fictional, it is actually supposed to be based on the story of porn star John Holmes. <br /> <br /> In Southern California in 1977, Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) is working as a waiter's helper in a nightclub. One of the regular clients is pornographer Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) and two of his stars, Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham). Jack and Eddie meet and Jack realizes that Eddie is okay ... a bit ... talented. <br /> <br /> So Eddie stars Jack's films under the pseudonym "Dirk Diggler." He becomes a "big" porn star (no pun intended) and seems to be at the top of everything. Then comes the 1980s when the video replaces the film and Jack's porn empire begins to collapse, along with Dirk Diggler and everyone else working in the field. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights is a beautifully filmed drama. There is a bit of violence, but the P.T. Anderson makes it more stylized. And it's kind of a blunt approach to the degradation of pornography, especially when HSV has become the standard way to make porn. <br /> <br /> Many bizarre and unique characters are introduced. William H. Macy has an interesting role as someone who works in movies, whose wife keeps having sex with everyone. I especially liked the role of Don Cheadle as Buck, the stereo salesman. The best performance is BOOGIE NIGHTS was definitely Burt Reynolds. A classic of the 90's!
