This is an exceptional film. It includes comedy, part drama, suspense part. The dialogue is excellent. Most of the actors and actresses were very famous in their time and for good reasons. You will probably recognize someone, even if you do not watch older movies. Each of them also plays a role that is particularly suited to their talents. <br /> <br /> One correction to be made in another user comment is that two people, not one, are announced to die in the accident. Perhaps the unlucky ones are a reflection of what the writer considers important in life. The film is too engrossing to worry about who it is until that happens. <br /> <br /> The story is ahead of its time, but does not lose the quality of an old movie. Time and effort were spent perfecting the camera's vision and soundtrack, something modern filmmakers tended to forget.
