Calling all D-sciples! Take your friends, go to the theater and see the hell out of this movie. From the opening sequence until after the credits you will be laughing at yourself out of breath. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wild ride through the history of D, not just a list of the things they did, but an account of their rise to power. I'm a big fan of Rage Kage (Kyle Gass) and Jables (Jack Black) so naturally I loved the movie. <br /> <br /> This helps to know about the show they had, and their first CD, but it's so funny if you do not. From the hilarious and vulgar lyrics, rocking rhythms, the massive amount of smoking marijuana and the apparitions, to the absolute madness that is the story line, this is a movie for D-sciples and novices alike. Many of their songs are referenced, such as Two Kings, Tribute and Kielbasa for their many audio tracks like Cock Push-ups, every fan in the audience will say that I remember this as well as new comers saying "This is F'ing hilarious !." I highly recommend this movie to any body that has already been eliminated. This film is certainly in high competition for being the next "This is Spinal Tap". One of the best.
