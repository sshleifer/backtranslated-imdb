I really liked this movie. The actors were great, particularly Powerful, who is different in every role; FÃ¼rmann, who is also capable of interpreting anyone; and Loos, who spices things up (she's also a talented singer - she sings the song "My Truth," heard when a character raises the sound in the lab). <br /> <br /> Anatomie is a good horror flick, which pays attention to its characters. It is also very bloody at times, and the design of the setting is groundbreaking. It's a shame they have to do a sequel, which is not even close to the original. <br /> <br /> On a side note, two other things are definitely worth mentioning. The DVD is not dubbed, which contributes to a better movie experience. Also, continue watching after the final credits begin to run.
