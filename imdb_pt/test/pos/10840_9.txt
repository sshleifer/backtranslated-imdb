So far only the first episode has been shown, and a lot of noise has been made about the scenes of lesbian sex. But for those who bother to look back, they will find an incredibly beautiful love story and one that has this episode ended in a disturbing climax. I found the story so powerful that I was inspired to read the novel on which this fantastic series was based.
