Charlie Wilson (two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks) is a relaxed congressman ... who loves to party, enjoys the company of women, and especially drinking alcohol. When Charlie's old friend and ex-girlfriend Joanne Herring (Oscar winner Julia Roberts) wants Charlie to visit Afghanistan, that country certainly needs help. Charlie is shocked by what he saw, especially of all the different ages that are dead or injured from this war with the Russians. He decides to help the people and the rebels to fight against the Russians, who started the war. Charlie, Joanne and a renegade CIA agent named Gust Avrakotos (Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman) will begin a good fight to bring the greatest secret operation ever. <br /> <br /> Directed by the Oscar winner. Mike Nichols (The Birdcage, Regarding Henry and Wolf) made a lively and entertaining satire comedy based on a true story. Hanks, Roberts, Hoffman in an Oscar-nominated performance and Amy Adams as Charlie's loyal assistant are very good at their roles. Despite the great premise of real life, "Charlie Wilson's War" never catches fire and is not as perversely funny as you'd like. Nichols Director and Screenwriter: A Few Good Men Aaron Sorkin keeps things moving and the characters are very much appreciated everywhere. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a crisp Pan & Scan (1.33: 1) transfer and a good Dolby Digital. 5.1 Surround Sound. The only special features of the DVD are the backstage presentation with the cast and crew and an actual video with Charlie Wilson and others. "Charlie Wilson's War" is a good movie that could have been great, but it's not. But this movie is clever enough to please those who liked well written or well played adult comedies. (*** 1/2 out of *****).
