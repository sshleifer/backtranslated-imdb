I liked the movie and the story immensely! I saw the original (1939 I believe) and enjoyed both. To truly appreciate history, one must be familiar with English culture and customs. The teacher (Peter O'Toole) was dedicated to his school and the "boys" of that school. It was an English "public" school, which we in the US call private school (E.G. Andover). He is a very ascetic person, and on the surface he appears to be rigid, muffled, indifferent, and weak to the point of being effeminate. He is strict in his educational standards because he takes care of "his boys," meaning he does not want them to have a cheap or weak education. He knows (through the introduction) a "dance hall girl" (Petula Clark) and is totally in love. In England at the time, the reference to "dance hall" carried the connotation of extreme sexual promiscuity and was definitely "lower class." We think that Prof. is in fact a very resilient and courageous person as well as loyal to the people and institutions he loves and / or respects. Clark becomes more than a lover and a wife ... she "enlightens" his personality and allows him to grow as a man and a person, for the sake of his beloved school and his own happiness. The first film was set BEFORE THE SECOND WORLD WAR, this one goes through World War II, too, it's 1969 (we had the "British Invasion" ... Beetles, etc. Clark had hits and was very popular then ... still is for me), the music is great, color and photography excellent. I think O'Toole played the character perfectly! There are dedicated people like "Chips" ... around us, but many do not get recognition. Very nice movie and story!
