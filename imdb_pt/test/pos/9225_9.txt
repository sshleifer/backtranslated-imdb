RAINBOW BRITE AND STAR STEALER, in my opinion, is an excellent work of art. I felt all hot and tingling when Rainbow Brite (voice of Bettina) and Krys (voice of David Mendenhall) set out to take revenge on the princess (voice of Rhonad Aldrich). If you ask me, the princess was absolutely evil and devilish. For me, she deserved Rainbow Brite and Krys to take revenge on him. However, I enjoyed your castle as well as the rest of the scenery. In addition, I thought Lurky (Pat Fraley voiec) and Murky (Peter Cullen voiec) were diabolical. Before finishing, I would like to say that everyone was perfectly chosen, the direction was impeccable and Disney achieved a great success. In conclusion, I recommend this excellent work of art to all who have not seen it, especially the diehard fans of the TV series. I guarantee you will like it.
