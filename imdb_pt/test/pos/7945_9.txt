I saw this movie in the early '70s and got mesmerized by Judy Geeson. To me, it captured the clandestine nature of Rod Steigers' irrepressible obsession with the young and extremely sexy hitch hiker, played by Geeson. <br /> <br /> You can not help feeling a little sorry for the wife, played brilliantly by Claire Flor. I was very disappointed to see that the original cut may have been lost and there is little chance of being released on DVD. <br /> <br /> I challenge anyone who has seen the movie, and it is a strong message not to be equally absorbed by the three performances of the main character, and I would have loved to have seen it again, if nothing else for a purely nostalgic <br /> <br /> Going back in time, about 35 years. <br /> A true classic.
