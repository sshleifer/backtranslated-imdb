Very funny parody with great attention to detail: the look of the 1960s spy movies and the way the action was staged at that time. The sequence of fights in the hotel room was a joke and the cast was perfect, with a Peter Lorre lookalike added to the mix of villains. One great advantage: Jean Dujardin is hot and the scene in which he is tied up without a shirt was a highlight. Also, your eyebrows deserve some kind of recognition for doing a great job. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the funny: the people behind me at the movies continued panting after every turn in history, as if they were watching a "real" espionage thriller. Before the movie began, "Get Smart" trailer was displayed. The preview made the film look embarrassingly bad with bad attempts to incorporate the jokes and jokes of the TV series. It looks like a bomb and a stark contrast to the comparatively sublime jokes and jokes of OSS 117, although of course the OSS has its share of misfires. The general tone of the OSS, however, was not an insult to the public's intelligence, and the material did not seem "dumb". I had the distinct impression that if I understood the language, I would have picked up the jokes more, and one in particular (the gag of the pistol) was misunderstood in the interpretation of the captions.
