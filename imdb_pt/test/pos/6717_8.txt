The LIFEFORCE was one of the biggest failures of Cannon Films. He received bad reviews and did not help the career of director Tobe Hooper after the controversial Spielberg / POLTERGEIST. All this is unfortunate because LIFEFORCE is really a great movie. It's extremely entertaining, fast-paced, and features some of the most outrageously exaggerated directions, productions, performances, and special effects exploding across the screen! It must have looked bizarre on paper: DELTA FORCE producers, ALIEN writer, director of THE THE CHAINSAW MASSACRE, BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S composer, STAR WARS special effects wizards ... The audience was not prepared for this demented exercise in strangeness. <br /> <br /> What else do you want? We have an alien ship full of giant bats! We have a sexy naked vampire, sucking people's souls! We have explosive bodies! We have zombies! We have possession! We have an S & M interrogation! We have the whole city of London on fire! It is Dracula meets the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, QUARTERMASS AND THE WELL meets the EARTHQUAKE. It's possibly the most outrageous epic of horror / science fiction / comedy / action / disaster / erotic / apocalyptic ever released, that is, if there's any other out there. <br /> <br /> Try to watch this movie while chemically altered. Maybe then you'll understand. A genuinely fucking experience and one of director Tobe Hooper's most underrated films. Maybe one day you'll meet your audience.
