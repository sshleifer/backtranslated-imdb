Easily one of my three or four favorite movies. Definitely one for the desert island. There is nothing "bright" about this movie. On the contrary, it shines warm and welcoming. The public is invited to a party and, like any good party, joy comes from the interaction of the guests and what you learn as you move from one to the other. With apologies to Joyce, the title of the film evokes a number of ideas that crowd out the audience. The movie is not horrible. It is not depressing. It's a beautiful look at a time gone by, in which people are growing and others are dwindling. Some are frustrated and others are serene. And everywhere, always present throughout the night, are the people and the parts of the people who have been left to rest. The words that these exquisite actors get to speak are perfect and, adapted to the Irishman's music, they are an audible feast, particularly for us flat-tone Americans. Of the lack of brightness to which I have referred above, I withdraw it. There is no other word to describe the final scene between Anjelica Huston and Donal McCann. Speak quiet volumes about ?? all well. A beautiful snowy night, rent this movie and let it happen before you. No shootings, no car chases, no dinosaurs? just film at its most sublime.
