I just saw Jean Renoir's wonderful film, French Can Can. It's a visual delight and great entertainment. The recently produced Moulin Rouge pales in comparison. I did not get all the compliments that the recent movie received. Now I am convinced more than ever that my assessment was correct after seeing a filmmaker as Jean Renoir's version of the same story. He got great performances from the entire cast, and the great French actor Jean Gabin was in a weird form. The dance sequence near the end was one of the most exciting I have ever seen. It was long, but I did not want it to end. This film deserves to receive more recognition than it has achieved.
