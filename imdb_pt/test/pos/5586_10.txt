This movie seems to have been neglected by everyone. Someone should bring it out on VHS and DVD. It is an excellent film and far superior to Brooke Shields, which was terrible. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons deserves more credit than she is getting nowadays. It would be cool if all of your movies were offered on VHS or DVD. Jean Simmons was, and still is, a very good actress. She certainly was a beauty. In fact, she's still a beauty. She also did very well on TV. She is much better than many of today's actors.
