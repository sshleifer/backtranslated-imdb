... as valuable as the tomb of King Tut! (OK, maybe not as valuable, but worth hunting if you can). I realize that no one has commented on this movie for a few years, and I hope a new post sparks new comments. This is a movie I remembered only from childhood, and I only saw it recently when I got tired of waiting for Fox to honor his own past, and to hunt down the Korean DVD, but with Korean subtitles immovable. I will not go through another long description of the plot - suffice it to say that upon seeing it for the first time in its proper widescreen format, it left me gaping at the sights and scope of the film. The matte paintings still resist and the settings of the palace are truly breathtaking. But it's the smaller-scale details that give this film depth and richness, providing a glimpse into the lifestyles of Egypt's poor and elite. The bazaars, huts, docks, embalming houses and taverns are as fascinating as the pharaoh's throne room. While errors abound on a large scale (most notably dynastic succession), the details are more meticulously researched than the vast majority of Hollywood films. Visually, it is not without its faults - the interiors are often too bright and colorful to blend in perfectly with the exteriors. However, this is a movie that should be credited for being as audacious in small as in big. Tedious? In parts, absolutely. Exactly? Elapsed? Yes, both - although "underestimated" may be a more appropriate description. Too long? Absolutely not. I wish they had spent more time with Sinuhe's experiences in the House of Death, and among the Hittites, and less with his 'romance' with Nefer, however. Historically inaccurate? Yes, that too, but Shakespeare too. Nobody punishes him for it. I appreciate historical accuracy as much as the next, but ultimately, we must remember that cinema is theater, not a history class.
