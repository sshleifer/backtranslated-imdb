What a great movie that was. Is this paradise? hell? or something in between? I disagree with many comments in this movie saying that this is a representation of hell. It's not clear if the opening scene starts the movie or if it's a flashback at the end. Also, it is not clear that the main character goes to hell, but maybe somewhere in the middle. The review I read on IMDb says that's a hell of a thing, but I disagree wholeheartedly. Take into consideration that maybe good people who commit suicide can not be condemned to hell ... this is just a religious belief. This is really a thinker, and I have / recommend it to anyone who likes this kind of movie. Definitely worth it!
