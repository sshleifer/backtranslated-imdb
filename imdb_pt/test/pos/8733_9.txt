I've been playing this movie incessantly this month, and I love it. I was around the 60's (oh dear), so it's nostalgic in a sense. However, it's the funny premise, the moody dialogue and the great performances that keep me watching. <br /> <br /> Dr. Winston's reactions to Stephanie at the end of the film are invaluable. (I would be more specific, but I do not want to ruin this for anyone.) Who, besides Matthau, can interpret a man not wholly connected and still make us continue to love him? As for Bergman's dress, I think she looks as sloppy as she should. I think "she was stolen" the only time she shows up in an evening dress. It does not suit her, which is very bad. I never liked it when I first saw it and I still have not. <br /> <br /> Goldie won an Oscar for her role. People thought it was an innovative performance at the time, and yet it's the performance that I do not love as much as the others. She has the right amount of sweetness and sympathy, however, which is important for this role. <br /> <br /> And I agree - I thought Rick Lenz was great at it and it's a shame that his film career was not good. after that. <br /> <br /> I hope more people watch this movie ... they will love it!
