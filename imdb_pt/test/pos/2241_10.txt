This is one of the best episodes of Doctor Who EVER. We have the conversion units Cybermen, The Cyber ​​(can scare little kids) and of coarse the Doctor doing one of his best acts. Bravo David Tennant. Good scenes like a movie, with exciting scenes on some streets, an invasion at the base of Cyberman, and leaving the world different from ours, basically a 45-minute film. Being Part 2 of the Cybermen's Ascension, this would never disappoint. With him having a great build until the end. <br /> <br /> The Doctor plus an evil enemy (Daleks, Cybermen, Master, Sontarans, Davros, Autons, or even Macra) is a battle to the death, just be careful with the little kids watching it.
