the film touches the soul of the audience a lot, some scene in the movie is final and the tears come out automatically, I am surprised to see this movie that any director can direct this type of movie in the year 1925. as a film student I can say that this film helps a lot to understand the use of montage. The first time when our teacher told us about this movie means genre of this movie, we thought that nothing could be there in this movie to understand, but finally when you explained then we came to know how this I can say that it helps a lot to understand movies. And being a film student, I can see the viewers that they can see this movie.
