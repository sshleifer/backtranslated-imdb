The photography and editing of the film is exceptional for the time period. Eisenstein is based on each scene of the film that leads to the sailor's revolt and the massacre in the city. As much as the movie is a high point in the cinema, it is also an example of Shotokan realism. in 1925, the Soviet government actively used the arts, including film, as a means of spreading the message of revolution. Eisensteins portrait of the revolt on the warship Potempkin offers the viewer an insight into the message of the Soviet elite. Marxist theory and the perspectives of the class struggle are demonstrated as the sailors representing the oppressed workers and the officers who represent the elite of society. Much of the film demonstrates the communist party's message and how the film was used as a propaganda tool.
