For anyone interested, I managed to do this on Ebay DVD (I have not received any day yet). <br /> <br /> I've been desperate to achieve this, even if it's a VHS. quality put on a DVD I do not care. So for anyone interested contact me and maybe I can help you. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it's ridiculous that I have to wait almost 7 years to see it again, but it will be worth it <br /> <br /> All my co-workers are desperate to See also. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'll post about quality later. <br /> <br /> A search on Ebay, if you want, folks. is there to buy
