This is a wonderful old-fashioned Christmas favorite, which I try to catch on TV every year if I can. It revolves around a Martha Stewart as a journalist named Elizabeth Lane, portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck. However, in contrast to Martha, this lady is a fake without domestic skills. The other cast members effectively complete the story, and include Dennis Morgan (Jefferson Jones), Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan) and Sydney Greenstreet (Alexander Yardley). <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes articles on food. , portraying herself as a housewife and happy housewife with children. In reality, she is a single woman living in an apartment in New York and can not boil an egg. His recipes are borrowed from his Hungarian friend chef, Felix. Elizabeth escapes with her decoy until the editor of his magazine, Alexander Yardley, decides that he wants a good Christmas country, and invites himself to visit her, bringing with him a war hero, Jefferson Jones, a sailor who had been shipwrecked . Yardley demands total honesty from his employees. To get out of her predicament and save her career based on disappointments, Elizabeth borrows the Connecticut cottage from her former aspiring architect, John Sloan, a boring, demanding guy who has long sought marriage. She also borrows the baby from a neighbor (actually, several) to pass herself and her "husband" of Sloan. <br /> <br /> Of course, this scene makes a lot of fun. It's a crazy comedy and a charming novel, with the added attraction of a Christmas atmosphere. Whenever I think of this movie, I imagine the snowflakes falling, the beautifully decorated tree, the roaring fire in the fireplace, the turkey roasting and roasting Christmas cookies. <br /> <br /> Why did Hollywood feel compelled to do a redo? I understand there is a 1992 version, directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger and starring Dyan Cannon, Kris Kristofferson and Tony Curtis. I have not seen this modern adaptation nor desire. This old favorite is perfect the way it is and a holiday 'must see' along with it's a wonderful life, White Christmas, Miracle on 34th Street and of course all versions of A Christmas Carol.
