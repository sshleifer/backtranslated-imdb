I had to call my mom (a WASP) to ask her about it. Was it really that bad in the 1940s in New York? Surprised, she could not remember. So I told her to watch the movie. Arthur Miller, not a play, but a NOVEL for a change, was 30 when he wrote it in 1945. It is a painful representation of anti-Semitism. However, incredible as it may seem, there is a tender history of human relations (Finkelstein, the Jew, with Newman, the non-Jew, mainly) underlying the cruel history. The acting is competent and the cinematography is very good. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can think this does not become great in theater is that it is >> aaagh << controversial. I really gave ten out of ten. Maybe a bit loud, but worth seeing.
