Imagine the scene: a bored student with an empty day ahead, a video store with a special offer of 5 videos for a week's rent. This former student has usually just picked up a stack of dubious videos for the most arbitrary reasons (the Turning Anybody?). Occasionally the weird unknown jewel came into your VCR - which is the case with this movie. Everything about the film is good, but much more than that, every part is mixed to offer something too rare - a great movie. Why this never had a UK movie release is beyond me, especially when we consider the crap we have to go through multiplex week in the week. Although I gladly accept that this is not Oscar material (but it also was not the same as the Titanic - schmaltzy cgi-tinged bollocks) is an extremely nice film. I was trying to think of a way to describe how the film should be enjoyed / accepted - The perfect movie to watch while joining your father after a trip back home on vacation after a big Sunday lunch.
