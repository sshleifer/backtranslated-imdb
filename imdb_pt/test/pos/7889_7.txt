WARNING: Reading this entry after watching the movie! Like 'Easy Rider' released a year earlier, 'Joe' tries to illustrate what happens when the counterculture and mainstream (though right) meet: a violent ending ensues. While this film is for the most part a slow showing of the traditional American morality of the "old days" versus the "do what feels good" lifestyle of the 1960s, it is also a commentary on the upper-middle-low class. class and their inability to find it in the middle, as illustrated when the Comptons meet the Currans. Joe de Boyle represents a generation trapped in the 1940s and '50s, where Kill a Commie is Mommy (or Jap or hippie) is good as long as he helps and saves America. Joe and his wife Mary Jo are clearly the archetypes of Archie Bunker and Dingbat's wife, Edith. This film - which will forever be known to be violent (but not bloody - not seen blood), however, the end is uneven. Joe explodes (verbally) the hippie generation so (literally) down with them to infiltrate their numbers to locate Compton's daughter - when clearly he should have revulsion for the idea, but renounces the breakaway idea because of sex. When he is betrayed through theft (read: trust from the older generation to the younger generation), he attacks through a relentless chain of murders. It may be due to the Hollywood Tarantinos that the observer expects a bloody death in the final scene, but the bloodless shots crave for any kind of impact or realism. 'Joe' is not a great movie, but it is an interesting display of alienation from class and culture and the underlying animalistic extremes to generation gap.
