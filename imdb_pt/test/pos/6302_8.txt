The initial scene of the Consequences of Love perfectly configures this intriguing and absorbing film. A traveler slowly takes a figure out of focus to the camera, dragging a huge suitcase behind him. As the central character in the film, we know nothing of him and our initial interpretation of him, his profession, the contents of the suitcase could be well away from the mark. <br /> <br /> Consequences of love is that kind of movie. From the title, you can expect a dissection of Bergmanesq from a relationship. What we have instead is a leading character, Titta, living life in emotional exile, seemingly choosing to isolate himself from those around him. If the film can be classified in any way, I would call it a mystery, as we are determined to find out who Titta is and what he is. What we know from the beginning is that he's 50 years old, cool, composed, and wearably dressed. He has lived in the last eight years in a luxury Swiss hotel, always paying the room rate on time, but rarely showing interest in staff or other guests. <br /> <br /> Your only real mates are a couple that he plays casual card games with. The couple, it is known, used to own the hotel, but now they have thrown everything away and only have the room in which they live. His love for money, antiquities, and each other was his downfall, and Titta seems to identify with his suffering. He's had it all, but now he's living as a virtual prisoner in the hotel. His brother, a long-haired surfing instructor, comes in to see him occasionally, but he sees his visits more as an intrusion than a pleasure. They talk about the person that Titta considers her best friend, even if he has not seen him for 25 years. This long lost friend is now a telephone engineer, repairing the communication network that unites so many. Meanwhile, Tittas' phone calls to his wife and children end quickly when they refuse to talk to him. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the movie, Titta makes an uncharacteristic move and begins to open for a young hotel waitress. With his judgment obscured by emotion, he puts himself in a course of action that will eventually seal his destiny for good. <br /> <br /> The slow roll of Tittas falls into disgrace and is beautifully scripted, filmed and punctuated. The techno soundtrack does much to increase tension, as more and more secrets are revealed, the final half hour turning into a taught thriller as Titta lets his mask slip and must once again face the consequences of his actions . The finale, with a visual nod to Felini, is dramatic but ambiguous and lets the public once again question their motives. <br /> <br /> Patrick Bliss, 06/01/06
