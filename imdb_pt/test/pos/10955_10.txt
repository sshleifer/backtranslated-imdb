Improvisation was used to an innovative degree in this film, but it only works as a novelty. No greater truth about the situation is obtained by asking the actors to improvise. The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much concern: not only are they delivering the line well, but the line itself is good. That's why the performances in many Robert Altman movies are often really stinging - because the actors are not really confident in saying the lines they invented and therefore are not sure they are good. <br /> <br /> And honestly, it's often not very good. Often the dialogue does not really follow from one line to another, or it fits into the environment. <br /> <br /> He crackles with young, unpredictable energy - but honestly, I found it hard to follow and focus on it. so bad. <br /> <br /> However, a fascinating piece of film, and commendable 100% for bringing power over the green light to the street. <br /> <br /> There are some generally good things about it. This joke, for example: <br /> <br /> I'm a dancer. What kind of dancer, like a dancer? Oh no ... exotic. <br /> <br /> And the whole party scene is his, the next trip to the park, and the scene where the boys are going to look at the statues. <br /> <br /> 2 / 5. I would not say that they are worth 2 hours of your time, though.
