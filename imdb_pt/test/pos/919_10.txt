I use IMDB a lot. Mainly reading other people's comments about movies I've seen or not seen. I thought it was time to write a few words about this movie that changed my life and the way I look like a movie. I think I've seen it at least a dozen times since the fall of '94, when I first saw it in the theater. <br /> <br /> I feel that Kieslowski is one of the best directors ever. And I think that's the best of it. It was his last. I was very sad the day I heard he died, because we certainly missed the chance to get something out of him. <br /> <br /> RED is just the best performance of Kieslowski + incredibile from Trintignant & Jacob + Sobocinski Cinematography. If you have not seen it yet, search !!! If you have, just go back to it! <br /> <br /> Red: just a masterpiece. Please forgive my poor English!
