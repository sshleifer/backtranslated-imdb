I classify OPERA as one of the best Argento movies. Make holes and inconsistencies? Of course, but I do not think they spoil this movie as much as many other reviewers seem. A lot of elements that are in many of Argento's movies are kind of "off the wall", but that's part of the attraction of his films ... <br /> <br /> Short story: psychopath chases the new leader of the opera lady. The twists and turns typical of Argento happen, leading to a decent payment of a climax. Not the best of Argento, but I still do it from time to time. Definitely worth a look if you like your other stuff - just do not mix with the abysmal remake PHANTOM OF THE OPERA that Argento did, which is really awful ... 8/10
