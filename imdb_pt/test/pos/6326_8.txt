This is a kind of very noir episode. It begins with Jim returning from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend, the newly divorced Karen Mills (Pat Delaney - daughter of John Huston, who knew some things about the movie noir) and his daughter. When they arrive, Karen enters the house while Jim takes the daughter in the back and takes her to her room. He then discovers that Karen has disappeared without a trace. Of course he calls Dennis and when the police arrive, they see no sign of Karen, but find their neighbor murdered in the bushes. So, of course, this makes Jim an immediate suspect. <br /> <br /> This is a little mystery and the first half of the story is shown by Rocky asking Jim to go over the story one more time. Rocky suggests that by telling him the story, Jim might remember a small detail that he thought was not important at the time, but which could now lead to a clue as to what happened. It's a very well written scene and completes the transition from the character Rocky from a grifter to a worried parent. It also goes a long way toward showing that Rocky is not just an old man with no concept either. As he says, "You come to me because I am your father. And I am smarter than you!" This is one of those moments when we see where Jim got his intelligence. This episode also features an appearance by the sexy Lara Parker, who played Angelique in the series "Dark Shadows" and went on to play Bruce Banner's wife on the "Incredible Hulk" series a few years later. She looks great here. <br /> <br /> This episode also marks the first mention of the Minette crime family, a name that would continue to appear in the Rockford Archives almost every time they needed a mafia family. This time, his Vincent Minette, whom Rockford helps to seize. <br /> <br /> Diehl (Tom Atkins) makes his first appearance in the series and Dennis is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant he was in the previous season, an episode to a police Sargent. I think they thought it would be better to have Dennis less powerful and add some conflict between Jim and the police. Frankly, they were right, though I prefer Lieutenant Chapman to Lieutenant Diehl. <br /> <br /> Not much of the typical "Rockford" humor in this episode, but a good mystery with a lot of heart.
