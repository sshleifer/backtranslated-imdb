When I watched the movie, I said to myself, "So a movie can be made that way." The beautiful poetic love story of Wong Kar Wai captured me all over and even after the movie. I must admit that this is one of the best love movies, maybe the best of them all, I've already watched. Content and form overlap perfectly. While we watch the secret love, we see the characters in limited frames that limit their movements, as well as their feelings. Beautiful camera angles and lighting make the feelings and blues still palpable. I want to congratulate Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee for their fantastic cinematography that creates the mood of love. Also music defines the sadness of love that touches along the pictures of beautiful slow motion and shows the characters in desperate moods. And, of course, the performances of the actors who make love so real. Eventually, all elements of the film combined perfectly under the direction of WKW and gave the audience the feeling called love.
