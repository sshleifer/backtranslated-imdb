Leland follows the story of Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling), a disgruntled teenager who apparently murdered a very retarded colleague, the brother of a girl he was dating. The question is not whether he did it or not? Leland admits, immediately? but because. Curiously, instead of a criminal drama, Leland becomes a character story, examining why people do what they do? not necessarily the easiest terrain to grow. <br /> <br /> And Leland presents the necessary indie group of injured people. In addition to the title character, there is also Pearl (Don Cheadle), who is his teacher at the juvenile correctional institution and who sees directly that Leland is different. We met with Leland's distant and selfish father (Kevin Spacey in an extensive participation), who never seems emotionally agitated by what his son did. But the real scents appear as we plunge into the Pollards, the retarded child's family. First, there is Leland's girlfriend, Becky (Jena Malone), a drug addict who can not keep herself clean; his sister Julie (Michelle Williams), perhaps the most normal person in the film, who seeks only to get away from it all; and Allen Harris (Chris Klein), a young man who lives with the Pollards and is Julie's boyfriend. Lastly, there is Ryan (Michael Welch), whom everyone else calls a fool, who can not communicate and seems ill-aware of his surroundings. <br /> <br /> Leland focuses mainly on his protagonist, but the film slowly? occasionally very slow ?? penetrates the lives of all, asking the main question, why do people do what they do? While Leland openly discusses in a newspaper that Pearl allows him to keep, examining notions of good and bad responsibility and personal responsibility, all the characters at some point in the movie are faced with a time when they must make the fundamental choice of their own happiness or another, perhaps the most basic choice any human can make. And the film takes a good look at what happens in these choices and the consequences of them. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, you are impressed by the depth of the cast. Spacey Cheadle Gosling. Michelle Williams. Even Chris Klein? are people who, most of the time, tend to elevate any movie they are in, and putting them together creates a heady drink. For a space in the middle, the movie seems to stop, spitting as it unfolds; seems for some time to be content to ask questions and not provide answers. But when we get to the initial stretch and the film begins to hit and bond, Leland becomes a quietly powerful piece of filmmaking. Leland's explanation of the world and his actions in the end bring all the stories into focus, and all the investment you've made in the movie pays off. <br /> <br /> To say that Ryan Gosling is excellent is like saying sunshine is good. At this point in your career is redundant? This is one of the best young actors working today, and it's a pleasure to see him create what could have been an enviable character in a thought-provoking protagonist. Gosling employs here a subtlety that hardly seems to act; he has to face most of the film alongside Don Cheadle, whom we know he has the goods, and he not only has his own, he raises Cheadle's game as well. Is Cheadle himself in the best shape, impregnating Pearl with a completely complete humanity? for good and for evil. Spacey is a kind of unique note, but this is the character, and he deals with it in an excellent way. I was surprised by Chris Klein; With that level of acting, I thought he would be buried in the mix, but he probably gave the turn of his career so far. Great job around. <br /> <br /> Leland is a bit depressing, and again, he is dragged on a few spots. But it ends strongly and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer (in this case, anyway). There is also a subtle comment about racism in the film (on Leland's first day in youth hall class, he is the only white person in the room) who, like much of the film, is very well treated. Would not I go so far as to call this the necessary visualization? some may find it too slow or too weird? but I thought it was one of the best movies I've seen in a while, much stronger and more satisfying than most things out there. Would I recommend ?? with the above caveats ?? if for no other reason, to watch Gosling further refine his craft.
