I saw this movie a few years ago and it was literally dragged by it. So charming and so romantic. David Duchovny and Mrs. Driver have chemistry that is so hot that you need to remove a layer of clothing. The support cast is 100% top quality. Just watching Caroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia play outside is pure poetry. Bonnie Hunt and Jim Bellushi and a wonderful staff and some of the most charming moments of the movies are when they are on screen. Like Jim Belushi yelling at his kids to go to sleep "ALWAYS!" or he dancing in the kitchen. This movie made we wish to meet such people in my own life. Not to mention, what woman does not want David Duchovny for a boyfriend?
