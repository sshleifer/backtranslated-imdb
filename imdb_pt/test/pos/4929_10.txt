This was one of my favorite childhood movies. I watched so many times, eventually my tape got worn out. I was a big fan of this show and I still am. What I love the most about this movie is that it attracts so many people, young and old. I watch this movie now and laugh the same way I did the first time I saw it. Now I can appreciate all the adult jokes I've never had as a child. My favorite characters are Elmyra and Foulmouth. Almost fifteen years later, my father (a big fan of the film too) and I'm still quoting phrases from that movie. I love the part where Foulmouth and Shirley go to the movies. "You save the seats, Shirl, and I'll get Dad's snacks." I also loved the plot of Plucky and Hampton and his family going to Happy World Land. Wade Pig reminded me a lot about my father. I love the part when they finally get to Happy World Land and all they do is ride the monorail. This movie is hilarious and attracts children and children. The animation, jokes and all about it are top notch. If you have not yet, rent it. You will not regret.
