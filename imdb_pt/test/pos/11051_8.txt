For the first photo of Greta Garbo, MGM wisely chose the piece ANNA Christie, winner of the Pulzezer Prize of Eugene O'Neill in 1921. Also wisely, the producers supported Garbo with not one, but two members of The Original Broadway Cast (George Marion as Anna's father, Chris and James T. Mack as Johnny the Priest - transmuted to "Johnny the Harp" for non-offending movies). <br /> <br /> This little change is interesting. Like many films accused of being "little more than theatrical plays," the problem is not the play, but the filmmakers who would no longer be loyal to the property . . By diluting a great work on the film stage so that it does not offend anyone, or open it up because it COULD, many lose the same qualities that made the work worth filming in the first place. Fortunately, the studio's respect for both O'Neill and Garbo allowed ANNA Christie to survive admirably the normally destructive process of Frances Marion's generally sensitive film adaptation. Marion still allows the SPOT of the scene in which Anna de Garbo reveals her past in the "farm" to the man she wants to marry and the father who sent her there to touch! What the Decency League must have thought of! The main problem with the source piece has always been that Chris's friend, Marthy, tends to go out with the first act and then disappears from the last two so Anna can take the stage - both sides of the genuinely good woman men do not always recognize. The perfectly stylish Marie Dressler (who had already ruined her teeth on the Broadway stage before going to Hollywood) is the perfect balance for Anna de Garbo in this area and the fast-moving movie with only 90 minutes, does not allow us much time to miss her - one of the few benefits of the atmosphere being shown rather than eloquently described in the original - and the screenwriter Marion is wise enough to stray from O'Neill to bring Dressler back for a Touch. scene two thirds of the way through the movie that will remind many of Julie Laverne's second appearance on SHOWBOAT. The opening scene of Anna and Marthy together on the screen (16 minutes in the film) taking the measure of each other and setting all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most shocking scenes in the whole play. To not lose. <br /> <br /> ANNA Christie is a great tragic piece and a good cinematic drama. It's hard to imagine that a recent remake, which would almost certainly lose the courage and atmosphere of this 1930s remake (it was first filmed without sound in 1923 - also with George Marion's original Broadway Chris) could improve on this excellent footage. <br /> <br /> The inner scenes are closer to the piece, but the outside should not be overlooked by anyone with an eye on the atmosphere. While the background work is not for modern technical standards, the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most movies of the current world era in which the screen game is fixed (especially in New York Harbor). Almost all of Garbo's naturalistic performances of the sound age have remained superbly (only the death scene often parodied by CAMILLE, 7 years later, will occasionally draw snickers because of heavy direction and parodies), but this ANNA Christie, along with the variety of his 1932 films, MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL, and the sublime touch of Lubitsch in his 1939 comedy, NINOTCHKA ("Garbo ri!"), is certainly the best of them all. <br /> <br /> Neill fans who are taken with this piece to the brink of their praised "sea parts" must trace the beautiful World War II movie released the year before the US entry into the conflict , THE LONG VOYAGE HOME (1940). It's almost as cleverly drawn from those pieces of the sea as this is from ANNA Christie, and features a young John Wayne in one of his rare non-Westerns supporting a good cast of veteran actors showing him the way.
