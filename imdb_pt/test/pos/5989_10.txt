I love foreign films and this is among the best. I usually do not see this as a comedy as it is listed and find a comment on how we see others around us. Firmine lead in the film is not considered must as she is a domestic in a large company and people say and do things around her all the time that otherwise would not say in front of others. <br /> <br /> Leave it with a bunch of information that can make or break the mere mortal. :) This actress is wonderful as this character and is a poignant tale. There is an underlying tale and almost many stories within the history of this film. I just hope that if someone decides to make an American / English version of this movie, it's not the vein of Three Men and a Baby that would definitely do a disservice to this MOVIE, A must see .....
