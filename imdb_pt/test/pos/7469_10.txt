Very well written, pictured and filmed. Violent, but not much. Who edited this knew exactly what he wanted to portray. There is not a scene lost in this movie. "The Usual Suspects" was excellent performance of the ensemble; This is a collection of excellent individual performances. I rarely buy movies, but this one is worth it.
