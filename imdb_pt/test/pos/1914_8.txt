Dolelemite (1975) is a cult classic. Starring Rudy Ray Moore as the pimp superhero with wrong rights, challenging the MAN along the way. He has two enemies, who are not good Willie Green and the despicable mayor. Watch Dolemite kick, punch, slap and pimp your way through the screen. What's the man's name? DOLEMITE! <br /> <br /> Interesting movie that has paved the way for a generation of rappers and performers. To sell more of his party albums, Rudy Ray Moore made several cheap movies during the seventies. Self produced and marketed, it catered to a specific audience. Some people call blacksploitation others call it junk, I call it fun. Dolemite was followed by the semi-sequel The Human Tornado and a direct to the video Return of Dolemite 25 years later. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, a definitive cult classic! Footnotes, if the movie was well embedded in the video, you would not see the boom microphones. The Dolemite was cut to receive a R.
