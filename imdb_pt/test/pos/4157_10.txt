This film is an impressionistic and poetic vision of the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear that may be associated with emigration. These are aspects not considered in films about emigration to America in particular and to any country in general and the film vividly and convincingly portrays the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorant, that poor and illiterate immigrants of Sicily have in anticipation of their emigration to the parents. U.S. <br /> <br /> They have some fantastic and unrealistic notions about the United States that are widespread on the trip. One is that the rivers run with milk, an image that is portrayed in the film with poetic and impressionistic effect. The film is devoid of sound and the silence seems to reflect the discomfort of the ignorance that locals have about life in America, or, if not ignorance, a significantly colored view of superstition and fantasy. That said, the film portrays with bumpy realism, the boat ride to the United States and the catchment process that the arrivals on Ellis Island had to go through. The boat ride is imagined as rather boring which surely was way too much of the time. The rooms in which arriving residents sleep are portrayed as extremely full of beds spaced four or five inches apart and without much light, which was certainly the case below the deck. <br /> <br /> Once again, the film is not complemented by undue music or overly bright lighting and the effect is to create a very realistic picture of what it really was for people who emigrate to the United States. The villagers may not be worldly but they are quite reasonable, and the interaction with the eldest of the emigrants, Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) with the immigration officer who insists on particular results, is rather bittersweet in that they are not diluted or softened the benefit of a mellow conclusion and one sees the fusion of Sicilian realism with the extensive regulations that guide life in the United States. <br /> <br /> Immigrants and their history are very interesting and the combination of The Realism of the Eyes and the magical fantasy of people's imagination contributes to a persuasive view of the Sicilian beliefs or of any people with little education formal move to the United States. The acting is similarly barebones; is by no means demonstrative or showy, but seems more realistic to him. That said, all the major artists, in particular Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato), the clear leader of the group, are excellent. Although she never smiles, her character's actions speak louder and it is clear that (fortunately) the other members of the group, her two children and the aforementioned Fortunata, the boys' grandmother, have faith in their leadership skills and respect their clear leadership. Amato imbues his character with great decency and frankness and it is a testament to his abilities that his character seems so capable and confident while his character betrays very little emotion. <br /> <br /> A curiosity of the film is a chance encounter with a mysterious Englishwoman (the excellent and appropriately mysterious Charlotte Gainsbourg) who speaks Italian and throughout the film we wonder why she is going to the United States . or what connection he has with the Sicilian immigrant group. In the end, this is finally revealed and the revelation is typically made realistically and does not seem particularly melodramatic or showy. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Emmanuel Crialese, who has a firm grasp of the realistic, if sometimes superstitious, view of the world that his characters inhabit and present with competence and confidence. It is indeed fantastically confident, given how awkwardly realism and superstition may have combined in the film. It's an exam worthy of the immigrant's experience.
