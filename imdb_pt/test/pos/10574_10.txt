It is always difficult to bring a 450-page book to a three-hour movie. I read the book before and found the BBC production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible. The qualities of the book were not lost: the dense and vivid representation of a patchwork family in London in 1860, the obscene and cold cruelty in which Maud is created, the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking, unexpected twists, and the way the film makes viewers look different in the same scenes when they are first told from Sue's point of view and then Maud's. The main actors do very well, and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed, with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and do to each other, because they still love each other. <br /> <br /> For each of her books, the author, Sarah Waters, thoroughly investigated what life was like in the nineteenth century. While in Tipping the Velvet was the world of vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements, in Affinity the terrible reality of penitentiary women and the elegant evocation of spirits, in Fingersmith it portrays the public ceremony of hanging people in London and the inhumane. treatment of alleged or disrupted persons in nursing homes based on reading sources and scientific research. This is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high degree of historical truth. I highly recommend this film production as it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere, thrilling emotions and suspense.
