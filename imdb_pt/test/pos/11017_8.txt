Niagra Niagra certainly was not the best movie I saw. However, I can not describe the way the film made me feel while watching and how I felt at the end and also how I feel about it now. Very few movies have that effect on me. I like them or not. I see Niagra Niagra as a work of art. We all see something in it and it can remind us of something or it can instill fear or fun, etc ... This movie did not leave me with the best mood. In fact, it left me empty somehow. I think the lives these two people took were so empty in many ways. They had no direction. His only direction was to have no direction. They had many problems to deal with and I think I needed to stay away from what could not have been a happy life. But on the way things just got worse. A steady decline from where it began. It was sad as it was so well represented and I think we have all probably seen someone in some situation that may somehow resemble the situation in which these people were. They could have had a good life if they had any idea how. But of course they did not know what to do. Then they kind of rambled to somewhere they had heard. No real purpose. They had no idea how to have a goal. They had no idea how to overcome the life that lay before them. I felt bad, but I could not stop watching the movie. Only good actors can make me feel a lot about a movie that I do not like if only someone touched the parts. These two did a great job to the point that you just did not see the acting. I'm very impressed and want to buy the movie when it's available on DVD. Do you know. It made me feel a bit like Leaving Los Vegas did. But again, it's in a class of its own. It's not a great movie, but it's worth an hour or two on the right day. If you are a person who has problems, I would not suggest that you attend. That could depress you. It depressed me and I do not have the conditions these people had. JimmyJoeJetter
