I live here on croc territory and I remember well the true events that inspired this film. Our bowels fall every time we hear of a croc attack. BLACK WATER is simply the best crocodile film I have ever seen. While I loved ROGUE last year for all its flashy effects and scenes, it was the local scenes that conquered our audience. We laughed at ROGUE more than anything. BLACK WATER, however, really resonated with the strangeness and fear you may experience when you are alone in the mangroves (you call them marshes or bays - but they are mangroves). Every tourist should see this movie before going to the Northern Territory. The ending was a bit disappointing after the rest of the movie, but I'll add this to my DVD collection when it's available.
