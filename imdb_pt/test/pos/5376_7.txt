I was interested in this movie a long time ago, especially after reading some online reviews of the DVD edition; however, I continued to delay the purchase because of the excessive price and the total lack of relevant supplements. When it came out of the air earlier this year, I finally gave in - but the whole order (which included several other highly desirable titles) got lost in transit; Luckily, the DVD was reprinted at a banana price - and I'm sure I got it! <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a strange movie, and a genuine sleeper: an occult tale, initially confusing but impressive, that can hit the target in relation to the forbidding atmosphere of a small town and the inherent eeriness of sinister events. -in. A small cast responds perfectly to a concise, absorbing, and clever script: leader Strother Martin in particular, makes the dialogue sound better than it really is with his nuanced performance as the city doctor / witch's coven chief; L.Q. Jones and Alvy Moore (both of whom also produced the film!) Provide solid support as the sheriff and his comic book assistant. <br /> <br /> The plot merges elements of several previous films that deal with witchcraft. and the supernatural, and not just the obvious titles: the fact that the city is kept under a spell that can not be identified, for example, instantly brings to mind the similar affliction of a specific bourgeois family in sublime and surreal of Luis Bunuel . THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962)! the angle of "possessed children" was borrowed, perhaps, from VILA DOS MORTOS (1960); there have been many films - especially from a recent crop - where the satanic rites of a witch's coven are shown: from the CITY OF THE DEAD (1960) to THE DEVIL DIVIS (1968), but as the process takes place in modern America in a remote environment) and revolve around old witches (in search of a 'rebirth'), the film that most remember is ROSEMARY BABY (1968). The hidden scenes (accentuated as much by cloudy exteriors as by the somber decoration of the gaudily decorated house where the diabolical events happen) are presented in a completely trivial way, in order to make them unsettling and extremely effective - particularly the opening sequence involving an army tank. crushing a car (!), the fury of a devil-doll (a concept that has been made to death over the years but here raises an undeniable frisson), a surreal sequence of dreams (placed inside the ice chamber where all the victims are kept since they can not be buried!), a sequence where the witches attack a dubious member of the coven, a beheading by a medieval knight (!) and the long end of the "black mass" (witches , accompanied by their son, they will be "taking care", all dressed in red - except for a black-clad Martin who presides over the ceremony - culminating in mass ritual suicide! <br /> <br /> The film also has the courage to create a pessimistic 'curtain', it is so refreshing to find a title (albeit a low-budget production) from a major Hollywood studio, Columbia, which tries to go so completely against the current (as I said, very strange - extending also to the and the score)! It is strange, too, that such an elegant - and cinematic - horror offer should come from a TV director often associated with West and other families! By the way, the same theme was treated almost contemporaneously in the umpteenth collaboration of Christopher Lee / Peter Cushing NOTHING BUT THE NIGHT (1972; that Lee produced himself!) - a film that I foolishly lost about 20 years ago when it was shown on local TV , and that has been MIA ever since !! <br /> <br /> Q. This review of THE SATAN'S BROTHERHOOD will certainly contain spoilers, but then the synopsis and the art on display on the DVD cover can handle everything anyway!
