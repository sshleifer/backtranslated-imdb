The 1978 adaptation had all the ingredients of a potentially wonderful film. It is based on an absolutely charming book by Charles Kingsley. It has a truly talented cast of people like James Mason, Bernard Cribbons and David Tomblinson, not to mention the vocal talents of David Jason and Jon Pertwee. There is also Lionel Jeffries, director of wonderful classics like The Railway Children and Amazing Mr Blunden, and although the film is mostly good, it was also a little disappointing. I had no problem with the performances, particularly those of Mason and Tomblinson like Grimes and Sir John Harriet, respectively, and Tommy Pender and Samantha Gates are credible as Tom and Ellie. The voice cast is also laudable, especially Jon Pertwee, expressing charming characters by themselves. I also enjoyed incidental music that is so astonishing and beautiful, and the script was reasonably faithful and generally well written, particularly in the beginning. The characters, especially the Water Babies are very charming, and the villains are sinister and funny at the same time, I loved the role when Tom and his friends help the Water Babies escape, seeing the shark chasing the electric eel with a very funny ax . However, I will say that the film looks dated, especially the animation sequences, the live action parts were not so bad, if you forgive the camera work rather dark. The character's animation was fairly flat, and the scenery was sometimes a bit boring, although there were some nice moments, like the scene with Krakon and of course the first encounter with the Water Babies. I also had mixed feelings about the songs, the Water Babies song was beautiful but I found the first song forgettable when Tom ended up underwater. Hi-Cockallorum is an example of music, it's like marmite, you love or hate it. I personally do not know what to do with this song, it was fun to hear it at first, but once in the head, maybe it's annoying. As much as I enjoy Lionel Jeffries and his films, his direction simply did not have the wonder and magic it usually does. All in all, it certainly is not a terrible movie, but it could have been better artistically. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
