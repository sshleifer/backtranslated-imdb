Chucky is back ... and it's time! This time with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little Voodoo For Dummies spell. Well, at least with this plot, the camp is back. This was the most horrible of this series so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. <br /> <br /> This has been by far the most entertaining of the series, and successfully, if not intentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It's going to be a joke! <br /> <br /> "Jesus, the musical scene has gone since death!" Chucky <br /> <br /> We needed the lightness, since the doll thing is getting old. The comic element added, and the best action scenes bring back this to match the quality of the first, when the idea was new and fresh. <br /> <br /> 6.8 / 10 of ... <br /> the devil.
