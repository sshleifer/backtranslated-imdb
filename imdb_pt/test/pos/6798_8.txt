Mickey Rooney (as Mi Taylor) is a young man adrift on the figurative road to ruin, where he meets 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor (as Velvet Brown) - she loves horses, but he has a sad history with animals. Taylor is in love with Mr. Rooney's sense of riding; she takes him home and takes him home and food with his family. They are very well supported by Anne Revere and Donald Crisp (as Mr. and Mrs. Brown). Butch Jenkins and Angela Lansbury are Taylor's tense brothers. <br /> <br /> The plot of "National Velvet" is implausible to a flaw; for example, the circumstances that led to Taylor's ride in the "Great Race" are quite strenuous (but would probably be more convincing on paper). Still, the characters' connection to Revere's horses and character is well-designed. Rooney and Taylor are excellent in the lead roles; there is a balance between Rooney's "child star" and Taylor's exuberant "infant star", which adds depth to his characterizations. <br /> <br /> Rooney and Taylor's excellent performances are further enhanced by direction, photography and editing by Clarence Brown, Leonard Smith and Robert Kern. A sentimental classic. <br /> <br /> ******** National Velvet (14/12/44) Clarence Brown ~ Mickey Rooney, Elizabeth Taylor, Anne Revere
