I love this movie. focuses on both issues: reality and fantasy. reality because hey, we all wanted a date with this popular guy, Billy. and some of us have not been kissed yet, right? be honest! <br /> <br /> Another real issue is because of the pain that people make provoking. and whoa, life in high school. remember if? the fantasy is to find your true love when you are 25 and still in high school. not really fancy, but close enough! <br /> <br /> Although some parts are unbelievable, it was a great movie. there are no other words to describe such incredible work. and the story was wonderful. Drew Barrymore did a wonderfully wonderful job, the same as the hilarious David Arquette. the people who worked on the film are wonderful. Did I just repeat that? <br /> <br /> Never been kissed is one of the movies that later generations should watch. shows reality and some problems for people like you and me.
