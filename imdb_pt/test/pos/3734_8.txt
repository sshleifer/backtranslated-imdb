Look, you do not watch this movie to change your life! But if you are a woman especially and always had a small thing by Richard Gere; This movie is on your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere have in the chemistry of the screen a way back. 'Nights on Rodanthe' is not an Oscar-winning movie and will probably be forgotten sooner or later, but if you want a beautiful love story between good-looking people MIDDLE AGED (they do not make your stomach flip and even when Gere is 'on top' it does not look very jowly) then this is the movie for you. I loved the theme of the story and it was quite relevant in many ways. Of course, the whole thing was presented superficially, covertly and untreated ... I mean, I would like to know more about the father / son relationship between Gere and James Franco, but the story was really about the idea that one Great love can change you for the better; whether it be a lover, a child, a friend, etc. The theme of the film is about love and its mysterious ways. I was surprised that James Franco has participated in such a small part in this film, but he is always good, even if it is for a few minutes on screen. I really liked this movie because it was touching and sweet.
