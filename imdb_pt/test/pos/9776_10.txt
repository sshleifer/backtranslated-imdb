Once I saw the "Changi" ad on the History Channel, I knew I would love it. Captured the spirit of ANZAC fantastically - you would die if you did not have companions around you. The characters in "Changi" were strong and each brought something different in the story, and Japanese soldiers were not criticized, but they were portrayed as normal soldiers doing what they thought was right, just as the Australians were doing. Direction, script, acting and ambiance were all done wonderfully, with a clear and easy to follow plot. Humor was the soldiers key to survival, and it was great to see a miniseries about war actually having some kind of humor, which is usually hard to do without offending people. From what I read about the soldiers at the Changi PoW camp, this story is a very realistic approach to the three and a half years that Australians, British, New Zealanders, Americans and Dutch have been there. I would recommend this series to anyone, whether you are interested in war or not. 10/10.
