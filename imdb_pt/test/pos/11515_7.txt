This is an important historical film since it was the first feature film. <br /> <br /> The film was made for a mere $ 23,000. <br /> <br /> He raised more than a million dollars when it was released. <br /> <br /> This film helped define the gangster melodramas that would become the buttery bread of Warner's studio in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this film ended more the silent era than his most famous part-talkie predecessor, the Jazz Singer. The film deserves its place in history and not as a mere footnote. <br /> <br /> The only actor who can remember today who is in him was Eugene Palette.
