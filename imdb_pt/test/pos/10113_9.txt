This movie was a great acting, great directed and overall had a great story. I had real experience with a kid like 'Radio'. On the soccer program in my town, we had a mentally ill boy every year training, traveling and having fun with the football team. This movie is really true and I can identify with it 100%. A boy like 'Radio' just needs to feel like he belongs to something; they need to feel that their life is worth living. That's how 'Radio' feels and that's why this kind of program is set up at my school. This is a very moving film that I'm happy to have been brought to the big screen. My father and I love it and I will always remember this because it is a movie that tells a fascinating story about the goodness and kindness of the man!
