Eros and Thanatos, Love and Death command the dialectic of Life. At the end of the 19th century, in a remote Japanese village, a young man and a married woman, older than him, fall in love and decide to kill their husband to be free to enjoy their love. But they never enjoy this freedom since Remorse begins to haunt them, beginning as usual at the time by the weakest member of the couple, the woman, of course. Henceforth, in an atmosphere in which the dream (nightmare) mingles with reality, the ghost of the murdered husband first appears to the woman, but also to the man. It also haunts the dreams of the other villagers creating a climate of suspicion and gossip around the couple, which is aggravated by the arrival of a police officer who comes to investigate the disappearance of the murdered husband. But what makes this film more interesting, apart from this almost common story of adultery, is the evolution of the couple's feelings in a deep psychological and dramatic development of remorse, anguish, and fear that turns their love relationship into a nightmare to the final destination . Expressionism so dear to Japanese theater or cinema is also present in the performances of the players, but not exaggeratedly. Only to the extent necessary to show more effectively the deeper feelings of the characters portrayed. This is actually a good solid film.
