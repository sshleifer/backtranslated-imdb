I personally love this movie in the middle of the Halloween series. I discovered, after watching it with many friends, that you appreciate it completely or find it absolutely unbearable. Personally, I've watched dozens of times and never gets old. There's a great story in the movie itself, and a lot of different things are finally explained. It's a short movie, with just under 90 minutes, but it's definitely an exciting ride. <br /> <br /> The format seems to be pretty brutal in this movie, but the acting is still there with the way it walks, stems and kills. There are many small screen shots with Michael appearing in the background, which adds yet another scary element to the movie.
