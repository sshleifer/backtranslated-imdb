"What Alice Found" is the biggest movie no one has ever heard of! I underestimated him when I heard of him, and I thought it was all sex, no plot and just stupidity, but in fact it was very good. They say all indie movies are bad, but this one, and "Napoleon Dynamite," was not good at all. I asked my friend, who had seen it before, and she said that Alice has all three of these ways, and you see all that nudity, but no, there are not three ways I remember, and little nudity. The movie had a point and taught me to never rely on hitchhikers. I liked that in the end, they caught Alice a little dolphin. At the end, on the way to Flordia. I totally suggest watching this movie.
