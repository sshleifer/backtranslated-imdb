Has the proliferation of relatively high quality programs on proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce, direct, finance and / or star in their own films that they might not have been able to produce? This is a good thing? <br /> <br /> This film does not answer this last question anyway, but it seems that without Kerb, Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make me want someone to eat cheese. <br /> <br /> Like most new producers / directors, Jeff Garlin's independent play takes up a much more sensitive sigh than the vehicle by which he is known primarily (Curb). And yet, is it a sensitive movie? He's not really a sensitive guy. Simpatico, of course. Relative, in fact. <br /> <br /> What this movie really is about is a little hard to say, I can only relate what I got out of it. <br /> <br /> I rented the movie because of the trailers, particularly the scene of a counselor played by Amy Sedaris informing James Aaron (Garlin) that a particular woman is interested in him mainly because she is a "chubby chaser ". "I almost fell out of my place, based on just that scene, I rushed to my computer to write a note for myself to rent this movie." The reason - I thought the school counselor (Sedaris) was talking about Beth, played I did not think the story would be something original, but that the dialogue would be grumpy and the scenes would move at a satisfactory pace. that it would be a comedy. It was intriguing that the movie started that way, but then it took a much more realistic course when Beth gave James a scare because "I've never been with a fat guy before." so we brutally lived the life and it was completely realistic.I applaud the decision.It just meant that Beth now left the building and with her, the only smart person in the movie. James's relationship with his mother It was also interesting. and made me wonder if the whole concept did not start out as a game. She had that intricate feeling. (The entire movie "Marty" inside a movie thing was totally lost on me, as I've never seen this movie.) <br /> <br /> There were serious doubts I had about the character of James Aaron, however . Is it really possible that at 39 he had not had a serious relationship? And he's an actor? That did not really fit me. For me, his persona was less tormented and more corporate. I could not buy his simplicity either. No doubt he was extremely disappointed that things with Beth did not work out. We feel it. But then, did he really care? <br /> <br /> Another thing - how in the world can he and his mother move at the same time? Did not he just lose his job? The last one he had? That was one of the reasons he did not look ordinary to me. Where does the funding come from for his life? <br /> <br /> And yet, I've read reviews that talk about the realistic portrayal of urban solitude, so that's it. Yes, it is very realistic, the way we should be satisfied with what we have because it is all we have. The way we vanish from ourselves and each other in interactions (James and Stella), some kind of self-deletion that occurs only to move on to the next moment. This, in contrast to the possibility of defining ourselves through our moments, our thoughts the way James had with Beth, is really overwhelming. Very well done.
