Of course, in a film whose main themes are mortality, nostalgia, and loss of innocence, it is perhaps not surprising that it is rated more often by older viewers than by young people. However, there is a craft and integrity to the movie that anyone can enjoy. The pace is steady and constant, the characters full and engaging, relationships and natural interactions showing that you do not need floods of tears to show emotion, screams to show fear, screaming to show quarrel or violence to show anger. Of course, Joyce's tale lends the film a ready structure, as perfect as a polished diamond, but the small changes that Huston makes, such as the inclusion of the poem, fit in perfectly. It truly is a masterpiece of tact, subtlety and overwhelming beauty.
