<br /> <br /> What else can you ask for? A great screenplay based on one of the best parts of the second half of the 20th century, two excellent emotional performances of Courtney and Finney, a realistic view of the London war, a great supporting cast. This movie takes you on an exciting roller coaster through humor, sadness, loss and achievement. if you're in the theater, it's even more effective. This is a real 10 on the rating scale!
