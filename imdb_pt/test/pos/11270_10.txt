Thank God for the Internet Movie Database !!! When I started this movie I watched it every night before bed and was getting something different every time. But no matter how much I cut him off, it seemed disturbing. The black and white and all the contractions really scared me. You look at the screen without knowing what you're looking at, and when you think you have it, it's clear and it's something completely different. The images are VERY disturbing, spasms and razors do not look good on me in any movie. Still, every time I watched it, I was interpreting it a bit differently (there is no dialogue, you know), so I decided to check the IMdB for the plot summary. Boy who throws me by a loop, I had no idea it should be God. Now I will watch with that in mind and see what happens ....
