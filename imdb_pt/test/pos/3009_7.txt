I could not believe the candy in my eyes from start to finish. Be a fan of movies driven by music video mentors. I am happy to report that the photograph in this film is a splendor for the eye to contemplate. There are so many rich and full images that are presented to me that every time I see this movie, I find something new that I had not seen before. As in previous films I've seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also from former directors of video clips, the use of color to attract attention is very well used. Although the characters could have been better developed, the action and costumes were worth the price of admission. I recommend you buy this for your DVD collection. Even if you have not seen it on the big screen, you will not be disappointed. I know I was not.
