If you like your sports movies to be about dignity and the best values ​​then this will work for you great time. Oversentimental in places? Of course, of course it is - and proud of it. It is the biggest and best ride in the Carnival and should be enjoyed as well. <br /> <br /> Great values ​​of production, simple revelation, with creative photos: it is not complex, it is a very good and remarkably sweet film. It really sounds like a love affair to Bill Paxton; and I bet your son understands that. <br /> <br /> The buildup is slow enough to be enjoyed, the brutal conflicts and the British x Americans treated with a degree of Vaudevillian villain, but the dignity between the two main transatlantic protagonists are always ahead. I have minor complaints: the score wants to be James Horner, but it's very exaggerated, and there are lots of close-ups, and panned for 2005, but if you want a simple, decent and good-looking sports movie, then it's <br /> <br /> So here's the thing, and I feel like I know my movie, but I really enjoyed it more than Seabiscuit: it's a better movie, but Greatest Story is simply Disney at its core and immensely enjoyable! Thank you, Bill.
