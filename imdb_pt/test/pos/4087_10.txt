Like some people here, I love / loved Stingers! In Norway, it aired much later. That also means we're in the 176th episode. (yes, that's right) I have to say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day we get to number 192. The Stingers may be the series (except Gray's Anatomy) that I actually watch! The actors are incredible! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personally, I think it's one of the best hits we have! I know he's not like the SUPER-known, but she's really a great actress! Stingers makes me want to be a cop! I love it! <br /> <br /> Q. Do you know if you can buy the episodes?
