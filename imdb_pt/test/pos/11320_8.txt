This is very good made for the TV movie of the 'what if' variety. As if terrorists exploded a 'dirty bomb' in a big city, in this case, London. Many pokes people who say "we're all in the case of an emergency", which reveal that they are not exactly telling the full story. And is anyone prepared for something like that? You can bet no. It shows the material for the bombs to be smuggled into the country, the making of the bombs, the secret and the double life that the people behind it lead, etc. It also shows civil servants (ie firefighters) giving everything to save people when they are not getting help, when the government does not want to send anyone else to the affected area. It also shows how utterly inadequate "preparations" are for any occurrence, as the government speaks of everything, but stands with its mouth open as the tragedy unfolds. And could this happen here in good old America? Well, unless you have lived in caves for the past 20 years, something has already to some extent, and do not bet anyone would be prepared for something of that nature. This is quite realistic and yes, even scary. Worth seeing, but I just hope nothing like this actually happens. 8 out of 10.
