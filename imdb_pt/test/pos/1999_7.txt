This movie comes from Turkey, where you can not find any tradition of horror movies. First I was afraid to watch only one adaptation, but after seeing that I changed my mind. It has original scenery. A love movie using the horror theme. Most players are not famous youngsters, but their performance is proof that a new generation is coming. Maybe this is a sign that Turkish cinema is coming back after 20 years.
