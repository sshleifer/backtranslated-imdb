I can not praise this movie enough. He had a bunch of portable cameras in the first person I love (and some hate it because it makes them sick) like REC, Cloverfield and Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> Long movie for your type, but I did not even realize why the movie was very interesting. By showing the work footage of a paranormal reporter, the movie keeps pace, making it a real-time experience for the viewer. <br /> <br /> While I would never call this movie "the scariest terror of all time," I have to say it is certainly one of the best I have ever seen. The fear factor here is built by details in the images, camera failures, events connected to each other that give a very mysterious and astonishing tone to the film. The horror is more in what is not shown, but left to our imagination. The ending is perfect, and be warned that you may have nightmares afterwards. A second display is highly recommended, though. <br /> <br /> Watch this song alone in the dark, expect nothing and you will have fun.
