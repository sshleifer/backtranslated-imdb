Inside I'm Dance (Rory O'Shea Was Here) is the story of two disabled young people, Rory O'Shea, who is almost completely immobilized and confined to a wheelchair, and Michael Connelly, who is debilitated by MS and also confined to a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> Set in Ireland, the film opens with Rory arriving in an assisted living facility. He eventually becomes friends with Michael, but only after a few tense scenes where Rory rebels against the team and other patients in the usual "movie mode", playing loud metal music, using swearing and general obnoxiousness. His friendship with Michael is cemented by the fact that Rory seems to be the only one who understands Michael, or at least is willing to try. <br /> <br /> Eventually, through some ordeal and tribulation, the couple petitions, and are granted, the right to live in a specially adapted apartment. The apartment is paid for by Michael's father, who essentially abandoned him for his disability. The two also hire an attractive assistant named Siobhan (played by Romola Garai) to help them on a day-to-day basis. This is essentially where the crucial point of the film develops as both develop feelings for it. Michael is particularly hit. Unfortunately for both, but especially Michael, Siobhan does not feel the same and this results in her having to leave. As Michael temporarily regresses and wants to return to the Asst. Living Center, Rory convinces him to continue to live on his own. The film ends on a sad note that many viewers may have seen coming, but in the end, we get the feeling that Michael really became independent and the future is his, as Rory pointed to him at the end of the film. <BR> You know, I can not say that I've seen many "disabled films" and I do not know if they could be considered a specific genre. But there is a kind of formula for them. A person is not willing to live beyond his illness until some liberating force forces him to do so and Inside I'm Dance is really different. What works however, is probably more subtle about the peaks and valleys that the two men go through, so what would you expect. There are no intentionally gratuitous moments or manipulations of "stand up and applaud". The sad parts are sad and the funny parts are funny. Some viewers may back off a bit that Rory is the punk-haired guy with the nose-studded nosepiece as the "perfect" cliché cliché, but the actor, James McAvoy, somehow makes it real. The same can be said of Steven Robertson, who plays Michael. When Michael's heart is broken, he does not seem to be invoked by a poor script trying to make the audience agitated, but rather a genuinely young man with pain for unrequited love. The kind of pain that many can relate to any physical condition. Again, these are the kinds of things that make the movie work and make it poignant without being arrogant and enjoyable on many levels. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
