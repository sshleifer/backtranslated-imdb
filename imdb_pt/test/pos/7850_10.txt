This movie has some rather shocking scenes and subject matter considering it was made in 1971. Clint Eastwood, Geraldine Page and Elizabeth Hartman do a great job on the film as well as all the cast members. Set during the Civil War, the film begins when a wounded Yankee soldier, Johnny, played by Clint Eastwood, receives refuge and help at a girls' academy located in the south. The school principal, Farnsworth (Geraldine Page), the only teacher Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman) and a small group of grown girls left without a man in the middle maybe for a little too much. While their loyalties lay with the Confederacy, their emotions and physical needs definitely lead them in the opposite direction. Johnny immediately uses his masculine charms to try to win women over to his side - and prevent them from turning him in on patrols. <br /> <br /> However, feelings once fed by incestuous behavior, an adulterous father, a brutal rape, and an adolescent inexperience combined with jealousy-turned things upside down with some unexpected consequences for Johnny and the residents of school. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
