The first time I saw the poster, I was shocked by its tranquility and beauty. So the city of Istanbul has plagued me ever since. <br /> <br /> Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was filmed as elaborately and aesthetically as a sculpture. It is in itself a landscape. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are a lot of things going on in the movie, but the director deliberately omitted the most dramatic parts and left them in our imagination, thus creating a truly flat life. ** (light spoiler) You can see the Mahmut girl crying in the bathroom and then leaving without a word, but not with the fight; one can see Mahmut accompanying his mother in the hospital, but not his fight against the disease. The most dramatic scene in the movie for me is Yusuf laughing loudly at the toy soldier he bought for his niece, and it was when it almost broke my heart to see this boring, lonely life explode in such a way. With all the trivialities of life eliminated, history presents us with the pure inner world of all the characters, their sadness, anxiety, loneliness, regrets ... And as the story unfolded, I kind of finally understood desperate situation in which his emotions really had no way out if no outside thing interfered, which is exactly all solitary that tries to keep at all costs, especially for an irresponsible artist like Mahmut. <br /> <br /> I just finished my second watching. Last night, I crouched on my bedspread, drank some Vodka by my bed, and spent the whole movie in a trance. I felt two real lives happening, one off screen, one inside the screen. I felt free from all that loneliness and anxiety because the people inside were experiencing it. I just got away from all those things. <br /> <br /> We can not deny the universal problem of communication, and solitude even puts us far from it, and becomes a vicious spiral. I bet Mahmut has not figured out a way to live in the end yet. That's why he left his room to try to find the answers of the outside world, the coldness and the landscape.
