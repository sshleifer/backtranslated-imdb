eXistenZ was a good movie, at first I was wondering what's going on, organic "pods" made of mutant reptiles that connected you and other players to a surreal virtual reality game via an umbilical cord, well, it seems a bit weird . <br /> <br /> But since it all starts, it's a really good movie, with some twists and turns with a great open ending and the good looks of weridness throughout the movie is fun as well, since you do not know the that is to come. The security personnel throw away the metal detectors; they have bone guns!
