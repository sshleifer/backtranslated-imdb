This movie has everything missing from typical horror movies. Although some things are very unlikely, we are dealing with quality engineers in snowmaking. The only caveat I can reveal is that I can not wait for Jackzilla. I dare say Oscar winner. This is a perfect date movie. I advise all men to a nice romantic surprise to see this movie with that special person.
