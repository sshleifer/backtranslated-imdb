It really is not difficult to understand this movie! I watched without expectations and without knowledge of the history of the games. I was completely delighted! <br /> <br /> Initially, I wondered how most characters have some kind of superpowers, but it's called "FANTASY FINAL ...". I also wondered about Cloud's past, but this was easy enough to look up to. By no means did these questions mar the film's enjoyment, however. Just the opposite; It shows that I was thinking about the story for a long time after seeing the movie. <br /> <br /> It's one of the most beautiful movies my eyes have ever seen. Music supports the movie completely. The characters are incredible. <br /> <br /> I want more!
