Most people watching this movie have no idea of ​​Arthur Miller's great novel that is the basis of it. It is a novel that must be read by more people to see how prejudice affects and alters people's lives. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Lawrence Newman is an ordinary man. The glasses his boss makes for him to change everything he has worked and his whole world collapses around him, little by little. He could not have been a better actor to bring this clever performance to the screen than William H. Macy. Not only is he a talented theater and screen actor, but he projects honesty behind every character he plays. He is an ordinary man, stuck in his own insecurities. His anxiety intensifies as he gets up and leaves his job. Suddenly he has to face the problems he has tried to avoid throughout his middle-class existence in the forties of Brooklyn. He is a Jew, is not he? The cinematography in this brilliant and atmospheric film, directed with certainty by Neil Slavin, kept reminding me of some Edward Hopper paintings, especially a sequel at the beginning of the film, when Newman leaves a building and the night shoots when he and his wife are being followed with long black shadows behind the couple, threatening and anticipating the confrontation with the bullies. Laura Dern, David Paymer, and especially Meat Loaf, who infuses incredible depth to the bully-next-door, are excellent, but all pale in comparison to William H. Macy's stellar turn (H must be honest.) If you do not read the book, I would sincerely recommend it, because no one wrote more truthfully and convincingly than Arthur Miller.
