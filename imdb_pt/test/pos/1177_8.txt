Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, both sad, proved once again that they were a team dedicated to their craft of bringing hilarious moments to the screen. This movie is just another example of this. <br /> <br /> This time they play with two brothers-in-law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board. <br /> <br /> Of course, your boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named Gil Godwin who only likes to harass these boys. It's hilarious how Lemmon gives a quick lesson in dancing to Matthau and how he dances an uncontrolled rumba with the boat owner, Rue McLanahan. <br /> <br /> Pity the other dance instructors Hal Linden and Donald O'Connor received so little to do, but their parts require it. Matthau falls in love with Dyan Cannon, on board with his golden mother colleague, the usual Elaine Stritch. Unknown to them, Matthau has no money either. The widower Lemmon falls in love with Gloria De Haven, looking kinder than ever. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Matthau and Lemmon and will serve as another tribute to his illustrious careers.
