This is an excellent criminal thriller, and with a great cast as well. The best and most popular Spanish-language film actors of the last few decades, Victoria Abril and Federico Luppi, are joining one of the best Spanish police thrillers of 2004-5. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the focus Ernesto Alterio, an elegant, attractive and clever thief who learned from his childhood friend Gypsy and, more recently, Manco, an experienced old con man. Manco introduces Ernesto to Federico (Federico Luppi), a methodical thief also elegant, but more cunning and experienced - the best of his class. <br /> <br /> Federico's only weakness is Pilar (Victoria Abril), his former lover. and partner. Suddenly, she appears and proposes a fabulous scheme for her former lover, a large-scale crime, which will eventually require the help of Ernesto, Manco and Gitano, among others. <br /> <br /> The script is full of amazing twists and reversals, particularly at the end of the movie. One criticism about the film I've heard so much is that there are many twists in the end, but I disagree. The film captivates both the public that all unexpected events are not much to follow. In fact, that's what makes the movie exceptional. I recommend.
