This is one of the most satisfying of the book for TV adaptations. The actress who makes us believe that a borg can be sexy makes us believe that a spy and a traitor may have some redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> The TV plot does not exactly follow Cornwell's story, but it is both exciting and rewarding. like a retelling of a good damn yarn. If you have a yen for romance in the uniform, there is a lot of sexual energy going on between our man Sharpe and the lying asshole. It made me wish his paper was closer to the books. But no matter how much the hero is wronged, hero rescued, hero in fury, hero in flight and hero in battle to keep him informed about his game on DVD.
