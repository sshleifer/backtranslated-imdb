This has one of the most unusual plots I've ever seen in a horror movie, but it's based on solid, solid programs from Universal Studios: many monsters, beautiful heroines, villagers who carry the torch. But my favorite part is Larry Talbot (The Man of the Wolves) in search of the cure for his lycanthropy. After dying in the original "Wolf Man", he is resurrected and wanders through "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man" and "House of Frankenstein" in search of a way to end his affliction. I think beginning viewers will find your research in this movie very interesting. <br /> <br />
