It's a movie with a theatrical message mixed with some clever moments. Films like these are the elongation fields of great actors, they like to play the ball in open pieces like these. The Angel who was not what we see in ancient books and churches is a very good change. It is repeated in Kevin Smith's play, Dogma, almost in the same vein of clowning. <br /> <br /> - = 0) Watch this movie for a good day after you suck it all. Are so many movies trying to be complicated that we forget the simple moves of movies like this? Possibly one of the funniest pieces I've seen in a while, I found this on VHS in a trash can because someone's basement was flooded this summer, and I grabbed a handful of tapes. <br /> <br /> In a garbage can, or on the silver screen, light comedies like that are fun, you do not have to tell everyone at a nightclub you like, or an elegant political party. Just keep by yourself, and I bet a lot of people will borrow from time to time.
