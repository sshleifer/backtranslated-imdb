Based on his current rating in IMDb as well as in several plot summaries, he did not expect much from "Two Hands". But how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, you are deeply involved in a genre that has been continually unoriginal for a long time. Even in terms of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director stands out and creates a movie that consists of great imagination. If you are looking for a movie that is not only fun, but also provocative, attractive and genuinely extraordinary, make this the next movie you watch. <br /> <br /> I hope the tragic death of Heath Ledger has led more people to take this film. He was an incredible talent, and his performance in it is not to be missed. Do not make the mistake of judging and discarding this amazing movie before you see it.
