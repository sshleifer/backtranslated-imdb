From producer / writer / director to Golden Globe nominee James L. Brooks (Endearment, As Good As It Gets) this is a very good satirical comedy film that shows the backstage of the life of a reporter / anchor / journalist / producer to be like. Basically, Oscar-nominated and Golden Globe-nominated Jane Craig falls in love with new Oscar and Golden Globe-nominated reporter Tom Grunick, but correspondent Aaron Altman (Oscar-nominated Albert Brooks) also has strong feelings for her . The network prepares for major changes and the sparks fly with all members of the studio. Also starring Jack Nicholson as anchor Bill Rorich, Lois Chiles of Moonraker as Jennifer Mack, Robert Prosky of Mrs. Doubtfire as Ernie Merriman, School of Rock by Joan Cusack as Blair Litton, Peter Hackes as Paul Moore, Christian Clemenson as Bobby, Robert Katims as Martin Klein, Ed Wheeler as George Wein and Stephen Mendillo as Gerald Grunick. The comedy is subtle but strong, the novel has moments, and is certainly a plausible situation film. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Screenplay, Screenplay and Best Picture, and was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Picture - Comedy / Musical and Best Screenplay - Film. It was number 64 in 100 years, 100 laughs. Very good!
