Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with endless sarcasm, wit and charm. At age 16, Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. She left her parents' house and got a job. Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends. Girls have a broad knowledge of movies and TV shows, and are constantly quoting them. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton (a very well-ranked school), so she reluctantly has to go to her parents. They are happy to give them the money, but in return, Rory has to go to dinner with them every Friday night. I highly recommend this show. I love it!
