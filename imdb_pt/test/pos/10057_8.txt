Nikki Finn is the kind of girl I would marry. Never boring, always thinking positively, good with animals. Okay, as one critic wrote, a little too much of peroxide, lipstick and eyebrows (Only Madonna could get away with that). But that's why I love Nikki Finn, she's not your average girl. She makes things happen, it's always exciting to be around and always honest. Of course, she steals, but she does not steal or kill (unless you're out to get her in). It knows which rules can be broken and which rules should be obeyed. She knows what to take and what can not be stolen. If you need a favor from her, she's at 100%. In short, she knows how to enjoy life. Nikki is always in love (and that's why she has a way with wild animals), and completely dedicated to those who love and love her. <br /> <br /> Who is this girl? She's the girl for me.
