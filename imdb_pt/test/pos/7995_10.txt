Why is this better? Because it is true for the dark vision of comics. Because the imaginary is inventive and, unlike the former, there are real moments of fear and ducks in this. The first had a lot of Jack Nicholson's talk, a lot of Prince's music and a weird "romance". Here, instead of a villain, there are three. Not Robert Wuhl and the protagonist are more than just a cute little face. In fact, Pfeiffer is the number 1 attraction in this movie. Its transformation is what drives the theme of the race, oscillating on the brink of sanity and insanity, good and evil. It becomes truly fearful. The costumes and makeup are excellent. Danny DeVito's Penguin is inspired and distressed, not just crazy. His circus gang is the only element of comic relief (besides that giant duck). Max Shrek is the only character I would have toned down, Walken is a good man as the ruthless impresario. Danny Elfman's score is perfect as usual, and Siouxie and the Banshees music ("Face to Face") is easily the best of all songs from any of the movies, a perfect combination of musical artist and movie soundtrack . The least exaggerated of the films, is macabre, does not yield and requires a second and a third view as an amusement park. Bravo Tim Burton and cast!
