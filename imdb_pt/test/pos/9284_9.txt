Hunters war on everything. 5 words that I love to watch. The hunters' war on everything is an excellent Australian comedy. As the name suggests, they make war on everything. They seem to love to beat politics above all else. <br /> <br /> The Chaser is one of the best comedies I have seen and is the top of the line in Australia. It's in the Australian Broadcasting Corparation (ABC), which is where some of the best comedies are. <br /> <br /> Won the awards of the Australian Film Industry (AFI), but did not win the best comedy in the logies. <br /> <br /> Last year (2006), the hunter was aired on ABC on Friday nights when everyone was out so no one could watch him. Well they were moved to Wednesday nights at 9 pm (a better time) and the best thing is if I miss an episode or just want to see it again, I can download it at www.ABC.net .au / chaser.
