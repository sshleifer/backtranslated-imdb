These guys are great and anything they bring out to the public is first class. The musicality of this band is incredible and we should all be very grateful to live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it completely !! I recently saw these incredible musicians playing in Houston, Texas, and I was impressed. I have not missed a show since the windows and I have to say they are better than ever. Everyone should embrace these guys and teach others what real musicality is! There will never be a trio so tight and well set up again in our life. Let's just wait and pray they do not retire so soon!
