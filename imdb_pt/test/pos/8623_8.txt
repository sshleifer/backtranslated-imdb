While I thought this was a good movie about JFK Jr, it was a bit difficult to follow the timeline. He jumped a lot without ever mentioning what year they were. Otherwise it would not be great acting, and it would not really be a great movie, but it was nice to know a little bit more about who JFK Jr. was.
