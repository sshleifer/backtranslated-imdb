When Wallace and Gromit stepped into the scene in their short season, "A Grand Day Out," they created a new look in claymation. After two more shorts, Aardman's dynamic duo returned to this thoroughly entertaining and entertaining film. He has an excellent cast of voice, humorous jokes and good animation like only Aardman could do! In this film, Wallace and Gromit see "Anti-Pesto", a rabbit removal company. When the news is about a "Were-Rabbit" eating all the vegetables in town, a frenzy happens. Of course, Victor Quartermaine, the city's handsome mole hunter, wants to get his hands on the rabbit to impress the lovely Lady Tottington ... but can our favorite Aardman couple save a day before the chaos? <br /> <br /> The jokes, I must say, were hilarious. One point, Victor Quartermaine's villain-troupe was showing, prompting a character to shout, "BEWARE ... THE MOON !!!" Vintage Aardman! <br /> <br /> The characters are sharp and hilarious. Our favorite Aardman team, Man and Dog, entertains us as only they could do, winning their second Oscar (remember "A Grand Day Out?"). Helena Bonham Carter was great as the lovely Lady Tottington, Wallace's love interest. Ralph Fiennes was especially funny and perceived as the clever one, using the hunter Victor Quartermaine. But who really stole the show was the priest, whose antics proved to be a hilarious comic relief. Let's take the hat off to Aardman for creating another Wallace and Gromit masterpiece!
