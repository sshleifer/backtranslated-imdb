This thing works on all levels - it's intense as a thriller, full of Lars von Trier's homage, but also a lot of its own film - and it has a message: happiness comes from within, better embodied in the wounded soldier than practically , believe it or not, humorously) disintegrates member by member throughout the film, all the time apologizing to others for imposing on them. You laugh at him, but you envy him. The central character is a well-intentioned but awkward writer who spends the whole film trying to help those he befriends on a train from Stockholm to Berlin shortly after World War II. It connects the parallel stories and really gets in the way of people in the process. To say that things go wrong is a euphemism - and, structurally, the characters are all in perfect opposition to each other. It's as if each of them has an opposite - as tight as watching the anti-matter collide. You will not believe the sick things that will end up laughing. To say the least, I would qualify as a spoiler - all I can say is that it's a shame that this movie has not been released in the US, not even on DVD. Some idiot probably told them the Americans would not understand - what a crap, because we did not just "get" but produced things like South Park ... If this movie is marketed in the US, it should be sold as a movie conventional. comedy, because that's right. Over-the-top, sick and twisted, but fuuuuunnnnnyyyy!
