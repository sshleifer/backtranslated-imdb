If you have seen Telugu's version of Gilli "Okkadu", you will see that this is very similar in the plot, but Gilli has different songs and it happens in Tamil Nadu, not in Andra Pradesh. Although this is a remake of "Okkadu" you will find that Vijay and Trisha make this a unique movie, Vijay and Trisha make a great pair. Some negatives were when the character Vijays hit the character Trishas to buy a gift for him, he never apologizes and she still gets it in the end. Good actions and songs make this a great movie that I recommend. <br /> <br /> I give it a 10/10, one of the best I've ever seen.
