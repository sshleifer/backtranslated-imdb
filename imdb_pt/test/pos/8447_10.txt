I work at a nuclear power plant, so I'm getting a kick out of those answers. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I do. Go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisades_Nuclear_Generating_Station and you can see where I work. <br /> <br /> I could not think of a safer industry to work with. We are required by procedures to report events as small as paper cuts. Any issue identified as being of potential concern to nuclear, radiological or industrial safety is immediately reported in the corrective action process. <br /> <br /> The result is that US nuclear power plants operate safely up front. of your mind.
