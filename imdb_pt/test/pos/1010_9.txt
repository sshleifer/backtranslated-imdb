Hehehe. This was one of the best funny road movies ever! I laughed and fell off the chair. With many Norwegian and foreign celebrities playing. Harald Zwart is the producer, known for films such as the banks of Agent Cody and, of course, One Night at McCool's. <br /> <br /> It's about crazy Norwegian fans going to the soccer world cup in Germany in 2006. And all kinds of crazy fun that comes with it. It was hilarious. I could not stop laughing. I have not had so much fun in ages. Rumors say a number two will come, but I do not know. It will be hard to beat this one. <br /> <br /> recommended to all! It's a must-see movie. I should see it at the movies, but I worked at the times it was shown. And he was trying to rent it for a month, but all the time he rented it. I understood today on DVD. Worth it.
