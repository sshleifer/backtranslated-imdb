I could watch this movie EVERY DAY! I love it. Probably my favorite movies of all time. But by the way, "badger1970" there are some parts with incorrect language, not too bad but not exactly G rated. Great movie!!!!! I recommend it to everyone. Anyway, it's making me type 10 lines of text, so I'll keep typing until you let me post this comment. Ok ... Still typing ... This is getting annoying. Ugh I still have four more to go. Anyway, WATCH THIS MOVIE! Even if you've seen it. I dont care! Were there already 10 lines? No. Just another 2 rows left. I do not even know why you want me to do it. I think I'm done. Wait a minute, I'm not done, sorry, people. I know it's torture listening to me. We, I suppose you do not have to read this comment ... But you should because I wrote. I've probably finished it now. Finally, bye.
