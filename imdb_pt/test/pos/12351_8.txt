Multiplied and oddly named, "One Dark Night", also known as "Mausoleum", is one of the best rentals of horror video. Original and pretty raw, we find Adam West briefly in this movie about telecinesis and teenage games. Meg Tilly dares to spend the night in a crypt of "The Sisters," a gang of hairdressers in blue satin vests. The initiation is interrupted by the recently buried body of a mass murdering psychic magician named "Raymar". Amazingly amazing makeup and scare effects paint this chiller movie with style and provide a breathtaking climax.
