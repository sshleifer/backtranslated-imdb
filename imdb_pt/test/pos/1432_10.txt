The director of "The Moon Is Blue," Otto Preminger, tackled even more taboo themes in his controversial 1955 album "The Golden Arm Man." Considering that he had incensed the Motion Picture Association of America with the use of the words "virgin" and "lover" in his mild 1953 comedy "The Moon is Blue," Preminger went far beyond what any movie had attempted with "Man with the Golden Arm "since Dick Powell made his law and epic order" To the ends of the earth "(1946) on the impediment of international narcotics trafficking. Based on the novel by Nelson Algren, who won the 1950 National Book Award, this hard and uncompromising 119-minute black and white melodrama deals with heroin addiction. Initially, when the Preminger film came out, the Motion Picture Association of America did not issue its seal of approval because the filmmakers showed narcotics addiction. This breakthrough film has qualified as the first great narcotics-dealing film from the drug addict's point of view and actually showed the paraphernalia that addicts used to shoot heroin. The Production Code stipulated that filmmakers should refrain from showing characters using illicit narcotics. However, United Artists released this original photo of Frank Sinatra and raised more than $ 4 million dollars. <br /> <br /> The critical and commercial success of "The Man with the Golden Arm" eviscerated the Production Code. As a result, the MPAA amended the Code so that filmmakers could delve into other taboo subjects such as drug abuse, abduction, abortion, and prostitution. The film received three Oscar nominations. Oscar nominations went to Sinatra for Best Actor, Joseph C. Wright and Darrell Silvera for Best Direction of Set Designing Art, Black and White and Elmer Bernstein for Best Music, Scoring for a Dramatic Picture or Comedy. In fact, Elmer Bernstein made a name for himself with his jazz score. The producers thought about climbing Marlon Brando in the lead role, but Sinatra defeated Brando. Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang, Darren McGavin and Robert Strauss co-starred with Ole Blue Eyes. McGavin was particularly memorable as a despicable heroin dealer, while Eleanor Parker played the protagonist's wife with a deep secret of her which is a shock. <br /> <br /> "The Golden Arm Man" refers to the ability of the protagonist Frankie Machine to manipulate a deck of cards. Frankie offers cards to Zero Schwiefka (Robert Strauss of "Stalag 17"), but he has been out of Chicago for the past six months at a federal narcotics hospital that is recovering from heroin addiction. Not only has Frankie licked the habit, but he also learned to play drums and plans to embark on a musical career. Optimistic as Frank is about his future, he finds himself before his past once again when he returns to his former heights. Schwiefka wants him to deal with him again, and Nifty Louie Fomorowski (Darren McGavin of "Counter-Attack") tries to induce him to resume his use of heroin. Meanwhile, Frankie arrives home with his invalid wife, Zosh (Eleanor Parker from "Escape from Fort Bravo"), who manipulates him with guilt. Frankie was drunk when he had a car accident and Zosh ended up in a wheelchair. Frankie appears with high hopes and a battery, but Zosh sees no future for him as a musician and asks to return to work for Schwiefka. Frankie plans to visit a music promoter and one of her friends, Sparrow (Arnold Stang, of "My Sister Eileen"), buys a suit from a department store for Frankie. After Frankie refuses to work for Schwiefka because he will see musical agent Harry Lane (Will Wright of "The Wild One"), Schwiefka turns Frank and Sparrow into police. Meanwhile, Schwiefka hosts the Brach department store to withdraw allegations of theft. The suit cost us $ 37.00. Frankie agrees to re-negotiate with Schweifka and the cheater expels him. Not long afterwards, despite his resolve to avoid using heroin, Frankie breaks and pays Louie the $ 2.00 for a correction. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Frankie finds Harry Lane and Lane warns him that he is capturing Frankie who will have nothing to do with him. What Frankie does not know is that Zosh regained his ability to walk, but she uses her guilt for the accident to hold him. Zosh is also envious of his down-neigh neighbor, Molly Novotny (Kim Novak of "Picnic"), Frankie's ex-girlfriend who rush drinks at a nearby bar called the Safari Club. When Zosh complains of headaches that Frankie gives her by practicing on her drums, Frankie takes them to Molly's apartment. Schwiefka and Louie are planning a big poker game with Sam Markette (George E. Stone of "Guys and Dolls") and Williams (George Mathews of "Gunfight in OK Corral"), two great punters who have heard of Frank and his legendary "arm of gold". Schwiefka and Louie convince Frankie reluctantly to negotiate $ 250. After a series of early wins, Frankie starts to lose and he can not reverse his bad luck. In fact, Frankie spends about two days trading. Exhausted, his nerves fired and desperate for a repair, he collapses on the second day and Markette and Williams pick him up. Louie refuses to give Frankie a correction, so Frankie knocks him down and steals his apartment for the heroine. <br /> <br /> Preminger does not punch in "The Man with the Golden Arm", and the film is very disappointing. None of the characters here are remotely friendly. Essentially they are either hustlers or rushed. Sinatra gives another dynamite performance like McGavin and Parker. Sure enough, "The Golden Arm Man" has lost much of its impact in 50 years or more, but it's still a landmark film.
