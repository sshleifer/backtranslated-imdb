I did not know what to expect. I just watched on a rainy Sunday afternoon on pay TV. From the beginning, it attracted me. The music, settings and characters were great. I had not heard of any of the actors, but they were all excellent. A wonderful thriller. <br /> <br /> Now that I've read other reviews about this movie, referring to the previous versions and the book, I'll be keen to find out more about this great movie.
