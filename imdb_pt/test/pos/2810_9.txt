Surprisingly good made for T.V. Thriller. I was not expecting much from this, but I'm happy to say that this is one of the best of the kind. It is fast and features solid performances and interesting events. <br /> <br /> The story gets you hooked from the beginning and with many successes, you can not help but find the film very interesting. <br /> <br /> The background story of Thiessen's character is difficult but it turns into a nightmare when the husband is something much worse than the stepfather of his childhood friend. <br /> <br /> The concept of "stranger" and his actions are disturbing if you consider it to be a common disease in society. A serial rapist does not respect the society nor his own family and this film exhibits the disease and the crime in a perfect way. <br /> <br /> My flesh with the film was the pointless situation when the character of Thiessen returns home with her husband maddened after being released on bail. At that moment, she knew what he was doing with his young relative (played by the fluffy Allyson Hannigan). But this is just the typical Hollywood scene that causes more problems. <br /> <br /> The climax scene shows Thiessen following her husband when he is about to commit another rape, so she calls the cops who arrive just in time to capture him. The ending tells us that her husband was sentenced to 99 years in prison in real life. <br /> <br /> The acting is also very good, and Tiffany is great and beautiful as ever. The direction is also very good.
