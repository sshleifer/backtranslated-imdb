Many people remember the Waco standoff that occurred a long time ago. What most people probably got into their minds is "worship leader" David Koresh and pictures of the compound burning on the floor after a long stalemate. Many people believe that Koresh was some kind of madman who thought he was God. He was accused of being a child molester and was credited with the collapse and death of his followers. In addition, many people feel that the cult committed mass suicide when the FBI invaded Mount Carmel Center and when the building was on fire. Most people think the cult was guilty of not agreeing with the FBI on reasonable terms. Most people think the cult was brainwashed by Koresh and followed along with everything he said. Nothing could be further from the truth, because of strong evidence after the nightmare is over, and this unique documentary proves it! <br /> <br /> This documentary is one of the most balanced exams of the situation that has occurred. It is much more complete and highly detailed than anything most people have received in the mainstream media. To the shock of many people, this documentary will reveal that the ATF, the FBI and the top echelons of the United States government were the ones who were unfair, cruel and deceptive, not David Koresh and his followers. What Korseh and Davidians were doing was merely protecting their constitutional rights, and the higher powers completely violated and raped those rights. The AFT had no reason to invade the compound; it was the AFT that fired first and fired from the helicopters from above for unarmed men, women and children !! What's even more shocking are the FBI's actions when they entered Mount Carmel. See for yourself and you will develop a new perspective on the US government. There are infrared images that clearly show that the FBI was firing machine guns at men, women and children in the burning compound. It will make your blood boil. This will make you very angry. This will make you wonder about what kind of people run this country. Finally, you will wonder what you are being told about the news every night is the whole truth and nothing but the truth. This video is scary and I recommend it if you can find it. This documentary does not need to be purchased; can be seen for free in google video!
