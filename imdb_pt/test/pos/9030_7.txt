If it were not for To Kill A Mockingbird, this movie would be much more famous. If it were not for Gregory Peck as Addicus Fitch, the performance here would be much more praised. If not for William Faulkner, maybe To Kill a Mockingbird may never have been written in his shadow. <br /> <br /> I found this movie sadly familiar because it showed me that one of my favorite movies, Kill a Mockingbird, may not have been as original as I always thought it was. Maybe it was inspired by this very similar film. Oh, the "whodunnit" is different, but the underlying story, a solitary "white" lawyer right against a white southern city defending a black man is very familiar. And, written by a woman, Mockingbird focuses on rape, the ultimate betrayal of a woman while this movie focuses on the brother against his brother's hatred, the rape a man feels for fraternal betrayal. <br /> There is not the depth of Mockingbird here. Not the comfort that Addicus brings with his presence. So you're just saddened that if she intended to lift the plot of this movie or not, Harper Lee's Mockingbird reflects. Nothing has changed in those 10 years or more since the time she read Faulkner's book and watched her film in college in Alabama, and unconsciously or not, it took up most of the time as if it were her own in recent years. Nothing has changed in race relations and some may say that nothing has changed so far, many years later. <br /> <br /> It's all very sad and familiar, and someone wishes there was a Addicus of our day to do everything right. Where Mockingbird leaves you with the hope that, swaying in the arms of Addicus and waiting for a morning of better times, this film leaves only sad that the pride of the blacks can equal or better the pride of the whites. But the pride of any of them is no answer at all. <br /> <br /> Instead, it is the response of Addicus that we need, consolation that we are all flawed and that in our fragility we must have mercy, not pride, when we face each one of them. another in our differences.
