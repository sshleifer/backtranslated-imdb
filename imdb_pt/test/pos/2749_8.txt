The central airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess), who has a bad flight in over 4,000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flights. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two begin an act involving flying and stunts. The two begin a relationship, but when Jim is injured, his brother (Tom Brown) takes the act for a while and falls in love with his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly sad. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pre-code for several reasons. First, Jim and Jill consummated their relationship without being married and not intending to have a marriage. Secondly, Eilers is shown in his underwear and absolutely restricted scene when the Production Code came into effect. <br /> <br /> This movie does not skimp on the dramatic love triangle and as a result ends up bittersweet.
