The heiress of society Susan Fletcher (Hopkins) and her wealthy father Simon Fletcher (Henry Stephenson) are upset because their young nieces Joan (Betty Philson) and Katie (Marianna Strelby) are living a bohemian lifestyle in Greenwich Village with their uncles artist John (Milland) after the death of his parents (sister of Susan and brother of John). Simon gave up trying to persuade John to allow him and Susan to take care of their children and resorted to the use of private detectives to get him into inappropriate or unemployed behavior and thus unable to look after their children properly. Susan finally decides to solve the problem with her own hands and goes to Greenwich Village herself, posing as an actress, to try to get information and / or persuade him to see the reason. What she discovers, however, is that she not only enjoys the free and artistic lifestyle that John and his friends are living in and that the girls are being well educated but that she is quickly falling in love with John. Inevitably, her true identity is discovered and she is faced with the task of convincing everyone on both sides of the custody debate who should belong to whom. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie and found it to be very short. the running time (70 minutes) was the perfect length to turn this simple yet captivating story. Miriam Hopkins, one of the great actresses of the 30s and 1940s, is wonderful in this film. Her energy, style and healthy beauty really lend themselves to creating a captivating character even though you know she's pulling a fast one in the people she quickly befriends. This is the first movie I ever saw Ray Milland, and he was really young and not patrician. (And apparently three years younger than her colleague) His energy and carefree manner in "Wise Girl" were a refreshing change to the behavior he affects in his old movies. Honestly, although I'm not usually a fan of child actors, I really enjoyed the two girls who played Susan's nieces. They were affectionately precocious and were really the jewels of the movie. Unfortunately, I can not unearth any other films that any of them subsequently have after this, which is a pity as they both exhibited a great deal of natural talent. "Wise Girl" was a movie that was made three years after the Hollywood Code was installed, and to some extent, it became very clear with the quick and happy ending, and with the pie in the sky and the ease with which the characters lived. The supposed bohemian cooperative was actually a beautiful dead end, where artists lived for free or for trade, and everything is tied up well everywhere. Fortunately, this was a light enough film and the characters were charming enough to make concessions for their softness and weaknesses and I was able to just get "Wise Girl" for what it was; a good old love story that was as much fun as it was charming. Unfortunately, the films of today's comedy / romantic genre are considerably less intelligent and fun, or I would not find myself continually returning to the classics. 7/10
