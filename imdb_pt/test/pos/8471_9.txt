I'm not saying anything new when I say "Ray" was magnificent. As I continue to praise this film, I have to mention something that sets it apart from other films. Very rarely is a film made entirely by the actor (s). "Ray" was simply done by Jamie Foxx. Without Jamie Foxx's wonderful performance, "Ray" would just be another interesting and informative biopic. I always thought Foxx was funny, from his days with "In Livin 'Color" and "The Jamie Foxx Show", and I also knew he was talented as he used his own show ("The Jamie Foxx Show") to show your musical talents. But I never imagined he could play such a role. I do not know much about acting and what they go through to get into the character or other things like that, but what I saw of Jamie Foxx was extremely impressive. He became involved in this role and made us see Ray Charles instead of an actor playing Ray Charles. The story of "Ray" was great, yes, but it came to life for Jamie Foxx.
