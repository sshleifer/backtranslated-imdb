This movie is one of the most memorable movies I have ever seen. I was reluctantly with a Turkish friend who recommended it. I am not an enthusiastic proponent of musical documentaries, but when Aynur Dogan, a Kurdish woman banned for years of singing in Turkey, sings her play, the theater was in awe. I would give everything to hear a CD recording of this wonderful and amazing song. And she is just one of the many artists interviewed and recorded, talking about her experiences of performing in Istanbul. Even now, a month later, I remember filming Aynur singing in an acoustic auditorium, and I try to remember the music that echoed in the movies. Well done to Faith Akin, the director of this movie, and his great idea to capture the many splendid sounds of such a cosmopolitan city. I would certainly be encouraged to visit Istanbul.
