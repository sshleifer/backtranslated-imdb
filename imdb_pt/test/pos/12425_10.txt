I first saw this on demand. Or on TV. I'm not sure. But this has to be my favorite movie of all time! I mean, this movie has blood, blood, laughs and shivers in the movie. I recently asked "Monster Man" from Amazon and I've been watching "Monster Man" since I got it. Trust me, you're going to love this movie. <br /> <br /> Q. The comment about the DVD is funny. They also said something about "Monster Man 2" during the comment. Let's hope they make "Monster Man 2"! If you have the chance, rent the movie or buy it. You will love! This is the best film that came out in 2003. <br /> <br /> 10/10
