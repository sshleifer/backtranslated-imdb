I have not seen this movie in which the creators put so much blood of heart into their work and paid attention to the finer details for a very long time. <br /> <br /> Everything was well thought out and perfectly put into reality. Camera work, editing and composition worked so well together that it was amazing. The titles were so fun and so perfectly choreographed. <br /> <br /> This movie just amazed me. <br /> <br /> "Showdown" could have been reduced in 10 or 15 minutes. It is an almost perfect tribute to the history of the first silent noir films, acting, scenery and costumes that were perfectly adequate and believable to have with silent movie times.
