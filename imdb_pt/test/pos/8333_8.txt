In World War II, America developed a new HUGE bomber plane. Lois Lane and Clark Kent will cover the story when the plane is on its first mission. Lois walks away on the plane before taking off. There are also some Japanese saboteurs on board who have every intention of flying the bomber to Tokyo. Will Lois be able to warn Superman? What do you think? <br /> <br /> Colorful and swift cartoons. The animation is a bit bumpy but much better than anything we see today. The color and sound were beautifully restored. Only two problems - the bad soundtrack and the racism (especially in the title). That aside is very good. An 8.
