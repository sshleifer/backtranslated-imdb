Honestly ... this show warms my heart, I watch it every day in the Fox family and now that the new season has begun I'm even more addicted than before .. the characters are so well developed and their relationships are so real .. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter .. the Lorelei is super fast talking witty girls who will truly inspire you and the show is hysterical sometimes and never too too serious but serious enough to be completely addictive. It's an hour long which is a BIG plus because you can not get enough Gilmore! even in an hour .. Emily and Richard Gilmore are Kicks (parents of loralie, Rory's grandparents) they are rich middle parents .. Emily president of DAR and Richard a well known lawyer and alumnus of Yale .. Rory is following in the Her grandparents' footsteps and this could not make them happier, of course, Rory's mother is very proud of her, but her whole life has been working on challenging her parents and Rory going to Yale has not helped her on this journey, but believe me in me, every episode she approaches;)
