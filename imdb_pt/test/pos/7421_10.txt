When the long and happy "Happy Ever After" came to an end, its characters "Terry & June Fletcher" were revived by the longest and most popular sequence - "Terry & June", though their surnames changed from Fletcher to Medford. <br /> <br /> Terry has been given a new job and as a result he and June move to Purley where they end up in all sorts of unwanted guests who come to visit at an inconvenient time, the boss inviting . for dinner and Terry trying to risk his arm in DIY, but increasing all the time. A fellow IMDb user tagged this show as 'not smart' and 'never well written'. Right, he was not smart, but that was the main point. As for 'never well written' - some of the episodes were far below standard, I'll admit, but overall I found it extremely well written, very entertaining and very well rendered. <br /> <br /> It was warm. slapstick, not unlike the BBC's "Keeping Up Appearances." Eight different writers contributed to the nine series, giving plenty of room to the show. Terry Scott was a comic genius, as he has proven in productions like 'Hugh & I', the 'Carry On' movies and of course, here! June Whitfield was also a comedy legend on its own. <br /> <br /> I like some modern shows like 'Still Game', 'The Catherine Tate Show', 'Legit' and 'Empty'. I even liked the 'alternative comedy' - 'Naked Video', 'The Young Ones' and 'The Comic Strip Presents', but I'm more inclined to enjoy vintage comedies like this one. Humor you do not need to think about is great for when you are feeling down and want to get up. For the record, 'Terry & June' was wonderful. Special note should be made of the captivating theme song that caught the show's mood tremendously well!
