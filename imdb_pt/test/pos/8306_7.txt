Due to the fact that in 1976 there was no CGI I felt that the film was quite watchable. The studio productions were very good and very elaborate. The background effects were very believable and always appeared as if they were part of the whole set. The actors agreed to consider the premise of the film being set in a kind of atmosphere of Jules Vern, where the imagination and the possibilities of future explorations were in the majority of times improbabilities. If he had watched this movie in 1976, he would probably have been impressed by the man's ability to build a machine that could travel to the center of the Earth. I still wonder why we are not all flying in our cars, but I disagree. McClure and Cushing have their funny moments, mostly from their facial expressions towards each other, which, of course, makes the movie a little overdone that I love. The 'monsters' left something to be desired, but the story had a good premise, though I think some other 'thing' might have been more convincing in those circumstances. All in all very watchable for your time and fun now.
