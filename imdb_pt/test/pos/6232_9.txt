Perhaps one of the first horror films that came out after Halloween (though made from Irwin Yabalans of Halloween), I must say that I honestly found the Tourist Trap more frightening and fun. "Tourist Trap" is one of those remarkable things you encounter from time to time, and you get the most pleasurable sense of surprise. It was fate I say, but one night I was at my local Blockbuster (a month or two before going out of business), and had nothing to get. So I came across this movie, I think it sounds like a laughable B-Movie, I rented it and took it home, boy was a good scare. "Tourist Trap" comes out as a bad movie, it definitely has extravagant moments, but in the end you're enjoying it a lot to really care. <br /> <br /> The things that impressed me the absolute most, and the things that made this movie one of the scariest I've ever seen, is the number one scenario. A horror movie without a good scenario is not much fun, not here. I just love love, love the location, it seems we can relate to it, it almost seems like we've been there before. Which makes it more scary. Then the characters are not really stereotyped, and they all have a real personality. For example, they are not drug addicts, alcoholics or even people obsessed with sex, they feel like normal young adults. Plus, they look pretty realistic, and so Chuck Connors is them. Who gives a great performance like Mr. Slausen, who we all like instantly too, because once again he is so real, he feels like that cool guy and grandfather we love. The last and probably most important thing that makes this movie scary is how they make us (the audience) jump out of our seats and activate the rights, for the right reasons. For example, most of the time in horror movies we just skipped because of a sudden change in the music field but in Tourist Trap get ready, that's not the case. With the perfect use of lighting, mannequins and strangeness, you feel completely frightened. Also, I love it because although they might be a little overdone with some things, you still think that this could happen. What exactly is a horror movie that carries this ridiculous premise to do, and this makes us (the public) feel insecure and terrified. <br /> <br /> In general, for any major problems, I do not have any, but the strangeness can get a bit strange at times. However, in the end, "Tourist Trap" occupies a near and dear place to my heart, for being one of the few horror movies that makes me turn on the lights and feel insecure about traveling.
