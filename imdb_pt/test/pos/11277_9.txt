I absolutely love this movie. Not a lot of fun, but it's a party of bizarre and awesome pictures! There is no dialogue, just some background sounds and noises. If you are into something completely different and unique, and enjoy the obscure and bizarre ... then you may like this work of art. Ik looks like a movie made with the first camera of all time, in a time where strange humans live and perform their bizarre habits. God killed himself with a razor and gave birth to Mother Earth. Mother Earth impregnated herself with the semen of God after an act of fellatio and gave birth to a son "Flesh of Bone". What follow are inhuman acts of ritual torture, rape, and murder for purposes we do not know ... or us?
