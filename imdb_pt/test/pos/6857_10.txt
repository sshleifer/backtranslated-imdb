With "Anatomy," the German filmmakers tried to create something entirely new. Usually there are only drama or comedy movies - in the horror genre it is (or was) totally new at the time. <br /> <br /> The story is also new and shocking. Franka Potente plays her brilliant role and I bet you will not find out who the killer is. It is possible, but difficult. A great movie with many talented actors.
