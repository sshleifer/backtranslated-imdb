The Women is a cute movie about women of all ages (but mostly 30+) and their problems in life. Not just men and infidelity, but also relationships with friends and family, time to connect with others, problems with image, commitment of your values, achievements in life and finding what will really make you happy. <br /> <br /> It's also about being true to yourself. People often give advice but do not follow them. Sometimes they have created an illusion for themselves, and should you really follow the same path or react based on your feelings now? I really liked this movie. Granted, I was trying to be a bit like Sex & the City at times, but that probably helped me like it. The difference here is that it is like the discoveries after the stage in life when the Sex and the City stars were - here, most are married or gone from the point of trying to find a man. Now, they are trying to find happiness in their marriages and lives. <br /> <br /> Obviously not an Oscar nominee, but it's fun and serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> And for the men out there, there was an equal share of men and women in the movies (most of them were with their wives / girlfriends), and the men were actually laughing. :)
