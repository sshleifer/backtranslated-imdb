Another fantastic offer from the Monkey Island team and despite having been a long time coming and had to survive the departure of Ron Gilbert is another decent installment. My only complaint is that it was a bit short compared to the previous two, although this may be because of a glorious lack of disk swapping. Roll on MI4.
