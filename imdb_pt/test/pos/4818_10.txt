Taking advantage of the success of "Rebel Without a Cause", a wave of "adolescent" films appeared. Undoubtedly this is one of the best. A young McArthur stands out as the not-too-troublesome teenager. The story focuses more on perceptions of delinquency than on any traumatic occurrence. The support cast is memorable, Frankenheimer drives like an old pro. Just a story of a young man who thinks others take their actions very seriously.
