I have to say that I did not expect this movie to be that good. Normally, the Eastern cinema presents the communist past in 90% of the films. However, this film outweighs the Romanian cinema, being worthy of a few more ads. <br /> <br /> The acting is true and not exaggerated, the plot is simple but complex, because it presents life in the Romanian suburb, the sound surprised me, the direction was good and what more can I say ... <br /> <br /> This "accident" of Eastern Europe attracted me to the film living every moment of it. I even felt a desire coming out of me, a desire for adventure after seeing it. <br /> Watch! You will definitely have fun! <br /> <br /> 7/10
