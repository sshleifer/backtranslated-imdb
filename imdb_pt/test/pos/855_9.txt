This movie is a mystery. It's not scary, it's scary. You'll probably jump on some spots and for some you'll be scratching your head to find out. She unfolds her mystery through the main character Eve and her psychotic college project in a hospice, Don. He needs her to look for some clues to defend herself from her mother's murder, and once Eve agrees to help him, she opens completely the Pandora's box and releases some very strange things, including Malachi. I'm not going to get into Malachi, but I thought the way it went was a complete genius. I know movie fans are not going to face this movie with the same prestige as other classics because it has no one very famous in it (Angelina Jolie's brother was excellent but maybe he should have asked his sister to show his movie face could get some recognition), but I think the way the end of Malachi works is something to talk about. I recommended this to my friends, definitely worth the purchase or the price of the rent.
