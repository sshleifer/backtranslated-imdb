I am a 58 year old man. On a rainy afternoon my wife suggested that we will see the women. After reading the reviews, I thought I might take a nap in the afternoon. Wrong - this movie interested me from start to finish. It was great to finally see Meg Ryan looking super again. Let's face it Meg looks much better with long hair. Annette Benning looked different to me in every scene she was in. Candice Bergen is showing her age as Carrie Fisher. His daughter, Molly, was exceptionally represented by young India. I was able to understand the dialogue that is difficult in many current films due to the rapid speech. Cloris Leachman and the Finnish woman were great as maids who extended their regular duties. The scenes of NYC were good to see. Oh, and Bette Midler played a short role, but as usual it was great. So I gave this girl a flick. 9. Guys - Go see that even for the sweet eyes like Eva Mendes. Will not disappoint.
