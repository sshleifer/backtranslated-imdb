Its initial premise is based on the American Civil War, but ultimately it's a love story. We started at the beginning of the war, where the main characters (Kidman & Law) are obviously aware of each other and there is an obvious attraction, they have a passionate kiss the day he leaves for war. The main objective of this film is for Law's character to return to Kidman and his fights to achieve this and his struggles to survive until he returns. The reason he can not convince us is that we do not see enough of this relationship before Law's character comes out to battle - it's hard to believe the premise that 2 people yearn for each other so much because they had so little contact. Everything else is fine, Renee Zellweger and her father and their entourage are adorable additions, as well as the threat of the gang pursuing deserters. Of course it's a long movie, but it keeps the interest and the cinematography is great. An honorable attempt that does not come to worth a watch, however.
