Having been raised in Phenix City as a child, I recognize many of the local people in the movie, so to me, it's like a journey down memory road to see "The Phenix City Story" again. In fact, my great-uncle is in one of the first scenes. Uncle Drew is the one in the Hawaiian shirt that pulls the chair up to see the singer / stripper better. <br /> <br /> Unless you're there, like Mr. Page and I two, you can possibly understand the story that counts. The reviewer from New York calls John Patterson a racist, probably without ever meeting with Mr. Patterson or his father. And what is your goal in bringing Mr. Patterson's job now? It has nothing to do with the movie you're supposed to review. How in the world can you sit and judge them or this movie when you probably have not gone any further than the southern Bronx? It has been my experience that the people who do this are simply trying to feel morally superior to the people portrayed in the film. According to most reports of the time, the two pattersons were basically good and decent men. Their families were respectable people, as were most of the people who lived in the city of Phenix. <br /> <br /> By the way, why is it so difficult for those living outside the South to believe that there are good and decent ones? people, even in small towns in Alabama? And why do they suppose that everyone living in a small southern town is racist? My parents lived there, and yet they did not tolerate it in our house. Others also did not tolerate it, but the myth that everyone in the south is racist survives the intentional ignorance of others. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is simple and straightforward. It's not the whole story --- Hollywood added some sensationalism when the movie was made. Parts of him were absolutely on target. Other parts of it bordered fairy tales. And if it's the source that someone uses to decide how the people in the small southern cities are, they need to control themselves and understand what most of us do - it's just a movie.
