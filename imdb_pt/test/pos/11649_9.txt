If you think about it, it is almost unbelievable that a movie can be made about the death penalty (one of the most controversial topics in the world) that does not offend either those against or in favor. It is a testament to Tim Robbins' extraordinary intelligence and sensitivity, characteristics that can be seen in his acting roles (Shawshank Redemption, Jacob's Ladder). <br /> <br /> This film actually suggests a subtle compromise between "for" and "against" camps ... so subtle that they can not be put into words, subtle to the point of disappearing, but one notices, after see the picture, what a compromise is possible, that somehow can be worked out if we just look deep enough ...
