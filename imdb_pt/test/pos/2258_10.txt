This movie was one, if not the best movie I've seen in the past year, I recommend it starts out as a very funny movie but as the progress of the movie turns into much more. do yourself a favor and watch this movie. I've seen a screener of this movie but I'll buy it not only for myself but for several true movie fans I have the unfortunate feeling that this great movie will be largely ignored as is the case with so many other non-commercial films. Comedy yet heart wrenching movie will make you laugh it will make you cry it will make you think and yes you will think about it when yours is over and that is not what a good movie is!
