One of the best! As a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the trilogy north and south. Patrick Swayze gives an extraordinary performance, as do James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. Seeing this fabulous story unfold in a time never forgotten, the affairs of love, passion, sadness, shame, harmony and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in eighth grade. Being a boy, you'd think I would not be interested in this civil war soap. To be honest, this story stole the hearts of everyone in my class, and this is just the first book. I bought the novel and studied the tastes and differences and it was amazing. I am 17 years old now and still like the story, characters, subject and I remember the times of the civil war. As film director of the future, I will always enjoy the North and South: Book One.
