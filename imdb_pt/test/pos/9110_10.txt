This movie rocks ... so hard ... <br /> <br /> The cameos ... the references to drugs ... the sharing ... the love ... THE BALANCE !!! When Jack and Kyle met for the first time in Tim Robbins 'theater company, "Actors' Gang" years ago, who knew that such an incredible and hilarious legacy of music would happen? All that door-to-door swing was worth it ... <br /> <br /> Although anyone who likes classic rock has a big kick in this movie, I would definitely recommend renting the 6 original HBO episodes in their store. local video. before going to see the movie in the movies. They are on the Tenacious D Masterworks DVD, which is available for rent in virtually every video store. There are some inner jokes in the movie that refer to those earlier episodes that will add something more pleasing to the overall viewing experience ...
