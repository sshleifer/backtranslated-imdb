I think this is one of the best Tamil movies I've seen in a while. I love the fact that it does not revolve around a guy and a girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly. The cast did a great job and I congratulate the girl especially. She was brilliant and really brought the feeling of a foster child looking for her true mother. Best of all are the songs, beautiful songs and moving lyrics. There are some great songs in this movement! especially 'Kannathil Mutthamittal' and 'Velai Pookal'. Great music, both. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good cry and some great acting (and great music!). Congratulations Simran.
