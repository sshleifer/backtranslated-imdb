Watching John Cassavetes' debut movie is a bizarre experience, even if you've seen some impromptu movies before. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is your roughness. So it's obvious that some of the characters are missing their lines. But then you walk away from the situation as you sink into the intimate exchanges of these people and ask yourself, "Do I ever stumble in My words?" The answer, of course, is right, we all do. It's unfortunate that most of the gafes in this regard come early in the scene because in about twenty minutes you sank so deep you would not know if a bomb exploded behind you. <br /> <br /> The next thing you notice ... or maybe you realize hours or days after the movie ends, is that you have never seen any substantial plot, but the themes and poetry of the dialogue and the characters never leave you. In fact, the treatment of the role that race plays in the daily lives of these characters is always present, but it is so ephemeral that neither they realize how they are informing their opinions about themselves, their self-awareness, their perceived status, or the fate of their relationships. <br /> <br /> The title is appropriate because you have a full spectrum of blacks, whites and ashes ... and not just the pigmentation of the characters' skin. Leila Goldoni (truly remarkable here) is African American / Caucasian, her two brothers are black and white African-Americans. The irony is that they exist in what is undoubtedly the most "hippest" atmosphere of time ... Manhatten upper east-west beat ... and there are still conflicts in and around itself. <br /> <br> I think I've never seen a movie with such a subtle delivery or technique. It is very much like absorbing a large piece of gallery and then just doze off when you think of the images you evoked days later. <br /> <br /> Great mastering and extras on the Criterion disc. Arguably the first truly experimental independent film ever made.
