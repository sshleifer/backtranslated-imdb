Films seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing social values ​​and beliefs and those that challenge them. This film is a 180-degree change from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in such offers as "The Longest Day" and "The Green Berets," which look more like Disney costumes in comparison. The "Apocalypse Now!" project, production and resulting film, is "Heart of Darkness" updated in a psychological horror story of the postmodernist variety of the late twentieth century. The cast and crew who worked on it could probably relate to the terrifying places the human mind can reach. This is the situation of the original Joseph Conrad character, Kurtz, who became literary in 1901 and subsequently referenced in TS Eliot's The Hollow Men (1923). Although neither a direct account of "Heart of Darkness "by Conrad (1901), nor a first-hand account of the Vietnam experience," Apocalypse Now! " remains as a masterpiece that pushed the envelope of cinematic potential. "Apocalypse" is not only about the "horrors" of war per se, such as "Platoon" and "The Deer Hunter," but the darker sensibilities of human nature revealed through the unprecedented and humiliating confrontations of violent conflict on a grand scale. Revelation now! is not as experienced. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is the journey of a trained secret assassin, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen on a power-driven tour performance), aboard a US Army. boat crossing an unnamed river into the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia, where few Westerners would ever tread. His mission is to do away with Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), an Army Special Forces Division officer who was the US Army sweetheart until he left AWOL and reneged on the unexplored depths between Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The official secret report is that the colonel has gone mad, but as events unfold, something else has happened to him that is far more terrifying than simply insanity. Sheen's mission is to wipe out the colonel with the American public, not the wiser. <br /> <br /> The film is quite episodic. The journey along the river is made up of several vignettes while Sheen and her crew encounter different, autonomous "aspects" of ground-level warfare. The American public of the 70s had probably never seen this kind of film before, with the possible exception of "The Deer Hunter," which was released the previous year. The first, and one of the most notable, is a battalion of helicopters led by Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall in an Oscar-nominated performance) which is a cross between General Robert E Lee and Richard Wagner. He likes to play Wagner's "The Ride of the Valkyries," as he bombs defenseless villages. His line "I love the smell of Napalm in the morning" is one of those lines often quoted from the annals of cinema. Other gatherings include an amphitheater where private soldiers will have fun with the likes of Hugh Heffner and Playboy Bunnies. <br /> <br /> Despite all the production catastrophes that prevented these images from coming into the can, the remarkable aspect of this film is its pace. The original release (not the latest version of Redux) does a good job of building until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climatic clash between Willard and Kurtz. The strange speech between Willard and Kurtz is worth the price of admission alone. And some of the scenes of Sheen and Brando in certain places are some of the most terrible and terrible images ever produced in the movies. Not even the likes of Clive Barker, Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have anything in Coppola in terms of horrible images. Kurtz de Brando in a particular scene is so terrifying that it makes most horror movies look tasteless by comparison, which comes from the recognition that the horror is not from the outside, but from within. Coppola's solution for the culminating moment is one of the most innovative cinematic revelations. According to the documentary "Hearts of Darkness," Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would fall into melodrama, and that the atmosphere of the darker shades of the film would be compromised. He was not sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox practiced by the native peoples with whom Coppola was using as extras in the scenes with Kurtz in "his" village. After the screening, Coppola had its finale, and is one of the most disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of American cinema. Love or hate, no western viewer will be the same after seeing this scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone, just like Conrad's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes. . It is not just the violence and uselessness of violence that are hard to absorb by most American viewers. It is the naked stripping of aspects of the human condition that seem so far removed from suburban American life that make this movie difficult for the average movie goer, which is how it should be. Coppola did not take a family photo. However, if the viewer can understand their point, there is much to be gained from Apocalypse Now!. If you are looking for a cinematic experience to reaffirm pre-existing attitudes about American sensitivity and heroism, it is best to stay with John Wayne. But if you're willing to be taken to places you've never been, even beyond the rhetoric of "war evils," "Apocalypse Now" will take you to a world you've never thought of before, and the disturbing part is that you can recognize it, it.
