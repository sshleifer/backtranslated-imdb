The plot of "Sally of the sawdust" is the usual melodramatic material - an orphan, rags to riches - but the film rises above most silences thanks to three people: <br /> <br /> This is not, it is of course, the masterpiece of DW Griffith, but shows his knowledge in film production in full maturity. It uses all of its innovations, which are techniques we take for granted now: close-ups, cross-cutting, a mobile camera and the ability to modify the performance from theatrical exaggeration to cinematic subtlety. <br /> <br /> W. C. Fields also shows off his skills - not his rude signature delivery, but his remarkable prowess as a physical comedian. He does some inventive juggling acts, very short to be fully appreciated, and some very clever walleye pickpockets, but it seems that every prop that is within reach is manipulated for comic effect - hat, cane, car roof, dog, money. He is a joy to behold. <br /> <br /> Finally there is Carol Dempster. Much has been said against this actress, but her performance here is also richly comic. She was 22 at the time, playing a teenager, and her approach to the role is a combination of grace and embarrassment that may not be totally convincing, but she really does draw attention when she's on the screen - especially when she's dancing. She is not a beauty - although she is positively luminous in the only scene in which she is arrogant as a sister Talmadge - but her clarity only contributes to Sally's character, especially in the many moments in which she shows an obvious affection for Fields as your guardian / "father." Few, if any, Hollywood performers could compete with Fields when it came to comedy, but Griffith gives his protagonist every chance to match his co-star, and Dempster absolutely stands by.
