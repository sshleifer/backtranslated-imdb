Yes, it seems, and mostly plays as an "after school special", for a slightly more adult audience, perhaps a teen audience. But add Bill Murray (already showing some dramatic drama as well as his usual comedy talent), a good cast of support and an unexpected sweetness to grow, remembering those great days, or not so good, in the summer camp. Commotive, funny, dormant hit. <br /> <br /> It gets a little too boring for your own good, but that too is one of its charms. When you hear the title "meatballs," and watch the poster, you expect a teenage sex prank, but what you get is a sentential, if sometimes sexy, look at those formative years at summer camp. The fundamentality and rituals of the simpler times remind me of "A Christmas Story", which I also love. The memories of summer camp were never so well stated. The only movie I've seen that comes close is "Indian Summer", which I like almost as much as "Meatballs", and is also starring Matt Craven. Let's hope he completes the trilogy. Maybe he could go back to "Return of the Meatballs", and bring some dignity back to the franchise (Meatballs 2 to 4 with no resemblance to the original classic). <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" is easily in my Top 10 guilty pleasures of all time (not really guilty too). It's a wonderful little movie that always makes me smile.
