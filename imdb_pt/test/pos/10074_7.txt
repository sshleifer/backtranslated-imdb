I saw this movie the day it opened in New York at Ziegfield. At the time, Madonna was not exactly the cultural icon she is now. She had a few hits, was very good at "Desparately Seeking Susan" and I had tickets to see her in concert at Giants Stadium. <br /> <br /> "Who is this girl?" gives Madonna a real role to play, which is not just a variation of her own personality. She does the crazy / heroine routine better than you think. Griffin Dunne is very well scaled as the man around to witness all the pranks. <br /> <br /> The story involves a huge cat named Murray, a bride who slept with all the taxi drivers in New York, an average father-in-law and a key. There are many car chases and cops going their way. All elements of a crazy comedy intact. <br /> <br /> Sir John Mills is seen briefly. It shares a glass of champagne with the directions and has the largest apartment on the Upper West Side, complete with a rainforest and everything. <br /> <br /> Compared to most of Madonna's films (the ones I could tolerate anyway), this is fantastic. On its own, it's not that bad. 6/10. <br /> <br /> PS The show was lousy.
