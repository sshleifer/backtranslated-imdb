My two daughters (11 and 13 years old) and I were lucky enough to attend a screening of the movie last night. We were all pleasantly surprised to see how this movie was fun and fun. David Duchovny was very attractive, as the male protagonist and Minnie Driver gave her a normally competent performance. Some of the scenes are funny - especially a scene Minnie Driver has with a transplant partner. I liked the fact that it was a movie that I could watch with my kids and I was not embarrassed by any scene. Everyone at the movies was laughing and having fun. Thumbs up Bonnie Hunt!
