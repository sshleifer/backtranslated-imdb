I've been an avid consumer of new technologies and I'm running out of powerboards - so I know even the energy crisis associated with Peak Oil will change my life considerably. <br /> <br /> The end of the suburbs shows, in a rational and fun way, how much the lifestyle of my whole family will have to change in my life. I am particularly concerned about future generations who will have to accept excesses, but filmmakers offer a glimmer of hope, for they recognize the human resourcefulness and determination - and the sense of community that tends to be engendered. by shared difficulties. <br /> <br /> There's no sense in trying to pretend that Oil Peak is unfounded propaganda - or treating it as the radioactive cloud approaching "On The Beach." ). Even with our best efforts, the times will become increasingly difficult, and I hope there is enough compassion and humanity to go around.
