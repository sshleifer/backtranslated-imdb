Better than the original, "The Gamers: Dorkness Rising" manages to make a funny comedy with good acting, good special effects and comedy that transcends the "gamer" knowledge base and does it on a low budget. I have seen many low budget films that were terrible and almost none that have been as good as the high budget ones. This movie does away with most major movies! The parties are a bit weak (part with pirates and ninjas - while funny - remains a bit unexplained and takes you out of the movie for a while), but overall, this is a very strong movie. <br /> <br /> I am very happy to say that I bought this movie as soon as I saw it and brought it home. <br /> <br /> Any chance we can wait for another long. Gamers movie from these guys? :)
