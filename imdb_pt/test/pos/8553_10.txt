This movie ... I saw it 15 years ago and in recent years could not remember, name or anything else, except it was about a Romanian countryside man played superbly by Anthony Quinn. The impression I have received of this drama will be eternal. I finally found the name of the movie, I hope I can buy it. And honestly this movie is worth 10 Oscars. Ten times BRAVO. I was very young when I saw the movie for the first time. I asked my friends if they heard about this story, but nobody would know anything about Anthony Quinn playing the role of a Romanian peasant. I remember when a German officer came and saw Anthony and said he was a good "race", but in fact the German was cheating on him. For a few dollars you will not get rich in case you buy the movie but you will be rich if you have it.
