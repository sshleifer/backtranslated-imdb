I was - unlike most reviewers - not born in the 1980s. I was born on May 14, 1994. Despite this, my life was very much in the style of the 80's. When other kids had playstations, I was playing Zelda on my NES etc. Now, this movie has a special place in my heart, even though I'm only 15 at the time I wrote this review. I, because of my early 80s, watched a lot of TV shows and watched a lot of movies that other kids did not watch, and that movie was one of those, and one of the biggest ones too. <br /> <br /> Begins at the home of Alvin Seville, Simon Seville, Theodore Sevilla and David Sevilla in Los Angeles. David, Chipmunk's adoptive father, is in a hurry to get to the airport while on a business trip to Europe. His taxi is almost there and the Squirrels help him pack. While they are talking, Alvin expresses his willingness to come with Dave and see the world (although, technically, Dave is only going to Europe, then to Alvin, apparently only America and Europe qualify as "The World"). David is leaving the Squirrels in the care of Miss. Miller, much to the chagrin of the boys. Soon Dave goes to the airport and the Chipmunks are left at home with Miss Miller. Later, at a local Caf√©, the Chipmunks are playing a game of "Around the World in 30 Days" against Chipettes (Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanore). After losing the game to Brittany after having his Hot Air Balloon out of the sky for a crocodile, Alvin discusses with Brittany who would actually win a race around the world. Two diamond smugglers seated at a nearby table, Klaus and Claudia Furschtien listen to their arguments and, in need of a safe way to transport their diamonds around the world, decide to trick the children into giving them to them. They set up a race around the world, where each team will have to deposit a doll in its own image (secretly filled with diamonds) around the world and receive a doll in the likeness of the opposing team (secretly filled with payment for the diamonds) to '' vari that they were there ''. The winning team would receive a $ 100,000 reward. They do this because they believe that Jamal (an Interpol agent who is already on his heels for awhile now) would never suspect them because they are just kids (however, this seems to be redundant because in their travel, children do not have which go through no security check and is never questioned about the dolls, I suspect either Klaus or Claudia if they took the diamonds there personally.) And so begins a great adventure. This movie is a classic and I see no reason why anyone should not like it. He has great animation and high-level dubbing, not to mention the Kick-ass (Pardon my French: P). My favorite song is without a shadow of a doubt '' The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll '' An incredible rock music that can not be surpassed. It's also my favorite moment in the movie. Other notable songs include '' Getting Lucky '' (kind of suggestive for a child's eh movie?) And '' My Mother '' as well as' 'Wooly Bully' 'and' 'Off to See the World' 'Not to mention the main theme of the film heard during the opening credits held by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with "My Mother" still brings a tear to my eyes. Regarding the song 'Getting Lucky', I did not think anything about it, but when I grew up and learned about life, it was clear that the song was a bit suggestive. This song, along with the fact that the animators insist that the audience know the color of the Chipettes panties. This is especially apparent in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are being chased by the Arabian's men as Eleanor leans to the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. While doing nothing to get out of the overall quality of the movie, it's one of those inexplicable things like why no one in the world seems to care that there are 4-foot-high Squirrels walking around and talking in incredibly high voices and treat them like they with any human child. Anyway, shortly after that scene, the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to find the Chipmunks and get home. Janice Karman's direction perfects this film as she and her husband, Ross Bagdasarian Jr., know the characters better than anyone else. They even do the voices of Chipmunks and Chipettes. Ross making the voices for Alvin and Simon (as well as Dave) and Janice making the voices of All the Chipettes and Theodore. Speaking of male characters who are dubbed by female voice actresses, Nancy Cartwright (The Voice of Bart Simpson) makes an appearance in this film. She plays the role of the Arab Prince, a very small but important role. The end is clear, happy. The bandits got caught, the loose ends tied and the movie ends when the kids, Dave and Miss Miller are driving into the sunset, Alvin complaining about not having received his $ 100,000 reward for winning the race, which annoys Dave until he finally shouts '' ALVIN! '' And the screen goes black. Classic ending, by the way. I hope you've found my review of this movie useful, and if you have not seen this movie, give it a watch, it's worth it. This nostalgic classic of the 80s gets a solid 10 out of 10. <br /> '' Headin 'to the top, you do not know! we never stop believing now
