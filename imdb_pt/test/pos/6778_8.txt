De Gr√∏nne slagtere or The Green Butchers, as it is called in English, is a very somber comedy about two losers working for a popular butcher. They are fed up with criticism from their bosses and decide to start a business on their own. Your store is expensive and does not even have electricity all over the place. And to make things worse, they have no clients (as their former boss predicted). When the man visits them in his shop, he challenges them to supply the meat for a dinner he organizes. <br /> <br /> What a tragic accident happens. One of the butchers holds the electrician in the freezing chamber when he closes the shop. The man dies and the neurotic of the two butchers decides to cut the thigh fillets of the electrician and serves dinner instead of calling the police. It's an incredible success. Suddenly, every person in the village wants to taste this incredible "chicken." Overwhelmed by his sudden success, the butcher sees no option but to kill more people, which he can sell like chicken. <br /> <br /> I think the subject cannibalism may not be appreciated by everyone, especially not because it is shown with much humor. Personally I really enjoyed it. It shows perfectly to what extent some people opt for some social acceptance and come out of isolation. It may sound a bit exaggerated, but I'm sure you'd be surprised to see how people in real life sometimes act. <br /> <br /> Beside the original subject, I was also pleased with the role of the actors. performances and humor. There is no overcoming, as you might expect in this type of films, it's all very sober and realistic (I think it's typical of the Scandinavian and Scandinavian films). The same for the mood. I'm sure I would not have liked it as much as I do now if the mood had been exaggerated, or with lots of farting, vomiting ... as you see so often in American movies. I loved this movie and I give it 8/10.
