Everyone who has ever wondered how to make a movie without a budget should see this documentary. The determination of everyone portrayed in this project was very touching to me, and should connect with those of us who have already ventured into any part of show business, be it film, music or writing. I think the filmmakers could have done a better job, foreshadowing the events that led this film to become a documentary, perhaps by means of a narrator; In addition, the film comes out as a real example of how show business is not about "the show" but rather "the business". <br /> <br /> I hope the intended project, "Repo Man II", comes to see the light of day. I think the filmmakers did a great job of how little they had to work and what they had to do to complete it.
