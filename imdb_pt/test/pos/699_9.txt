Glenn Ford is hired by a crooked bank owner and cunning landlord Edger Buchanan to stage a fake steal while the banker hides the real serve. With the Ford no-show, the two go with a happy second-choice trigger, leaving Ford on the hook for the killings he did not commit. <br /> <br /> Columbia Pictures' first color feature, The Desperadoes looks fantastic with sets and costumes made to take full advantage of the Technicolor process, accentuating tons of well-assembled western shows. <br /> <br /> This has the irresistible team of a young Glenn Ford (third-billed but essentially the star) and a primordial Randolph Scott leading an incredible supporting cast of great actors in colorful roles including the thief Edger Buchanan as a good-humored but lightly villainous, who is not as dumb as he looks and who has some memorable lines. A very complex script effectively blends incredible action sequences, melodrama and comedy, well directed by Charles Vidor. This is one of the great westerns of the forties and highly recommended.
