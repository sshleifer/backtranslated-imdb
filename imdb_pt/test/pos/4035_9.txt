"D.O.A" is a small, engaging, fun image from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his best caustic; and Quaid is, unfortunately, one of the most underutilized talents in Hollywood. His then boyfriend Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as is usually the case, does not cause much impact. <br /> <br /> The film is directed with style, with various influences to capture. its seamy feeling. Would you believe it's actually run by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is superbly slippery, from ground-breaking camera work to the blatant use of black-and-white photography. All these elements help keep the procedures up to date. <br /> <br /> Really, the biggest emotion here is to have dialogue, it's agile but intricate, it does not miss a word and yet it can be fun. The script for this is like a pocket work of art. <br /> <br /> It went unnoticed by me for years before I finally catch it late at night. If this is the first time you've heard about it, do not leave it like I did! Catch it soon, it's really top-notch ...! <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a solid genre film that succeeds every turn, it really fits the bill. <Br /> <br />
