Quite decent for your initial job and do not Kokaku Kidotai without it, and get an extra 2 points for the Easter eggs. For Shirow definitely a rung on the ladder. I'm biased as a fan of Shirow, but this was a big step of dirty pair that was what I knew about it. Violent fun with a porn soundtrack! You can not miss it. I know people appreciate him for Ghost in the Shell ... but all the deep spiritual implications were dealt with in Appleseed. ESWAT killing terrorists, fighting for humans to remain viable while the biorhroids eliminated them, and Deunan remaining slim despite his junk food intake. Definitely like the characters, even the traitor ... and I do not know why.
