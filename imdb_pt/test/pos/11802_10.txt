The Cure is one of the few films I rated 10 out of 10. I mean, everything is perfect for me in this movie. I've seen this for almost a year, and I still remember many of the scenes, especially the final touching scene that comes with the credits. <br /> <br /> The two boy actors clearly gave everything they could and this contributes a lot to the excellent storyline, making the movie perfect. <br /> <br /> The message is clear - friendship, and is displayed throughout the whole thing. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say here. Simplicity is one of the things I love most about this movie. And of course, it is fun and at the same time fun, suiting people of any age. <br /> <br /> 10/10, well done!
