The best boy fan movie I've ever seen save "Free Enterprise". <br /> <br /> In a way, it reminded me of a Kevin Smith movie. <br /> <br /> If you do some kind of RPG, this movie will probably make you laugh often with your insatiable fun. Do not expect a big budget here, acting is also questionable at times, but this really enhances the fun of the atmosphere they create. The script is really humorous, with many witty moments that are worth experiencing. <br /> <br /> The bard who is always dead made me roll. The sexually confused player also made me smile a little. But in the end ... It was just a great movie showing some better moments in the life of some geeks having a lot of fun with the RPG. <br /> <br /> If you are bored, and have already entered the role playing, this will do well for a distraction. An unexpected treat.
