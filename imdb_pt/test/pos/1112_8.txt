We see a man moving out of town to "out-back" and changing dramatically - his family asks questions, but he goes crazy. <br /> <br /> Strange and brilliant film to display here in Israel. Wonderful locations, great actors, a film that disguises itself as a "thriller", but which is more a case study of madness in the protagonist. <br /> <br /> The film was far above the other films shown as part of the film. the AICE festival here in Israel. Good luck to the team that arrived in this movie. It's a Grand Guignol, a little noir masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My only criticism that prevents a "10" is that sound and music are overwhelming at times. It tends to stand in the way of images, which speak for themselves.
