I saw Ray when he first left. Because? Partly because of the publicity hype, secondly because I simply loved the music of Ray Charles. But not being around when his greatest things in music and his life happened, I wanted to learn more about the life of man. And in that movie I did. His drug addiction was something I did not know, and the movie let us know. <br /> <br /> But here's the thing, while this was a decent autobiographical film ... I can not say it was a "great." "I saw" Malcolm X "and was impressed, even with" What Love Has to Do With It "and" Bird. "The performances of each of these films were excellent.I was not drawn to just the main characters of these films - which have done amazing works - but for those around you too. This helps to make a photo for me. <br /> <br /> I felt that in some parts of this film was superficial and heavy for the and the film left out several "other" important details of Ray Charles's life that would have made the film flow better. The film seemed to end up with a moan, not a bang - parts, including the ending, played like a cable network movie "Lifetime." I expect more than one cinema. <br /> <br /> So - where does my ambivalence come in? With the performance of Jamie Foxx. al, he did - okay. Not the spectacular of Denzel Washington, Malcolm X, or Angela Bassett, Tina Turner, but ... alright. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but for me, there were several points in the movie where I saw Jamie Foxx's interpretation of Ray Charles. and in others - thanks to the wonderful camera angles and lighting - he "looked" with Ray Charles. But I paid attention to ... acting. An actor has to make you believe that he is the character he is playing. Do not caricature the character. Did I believe that Jamie Foxx was Ray on the screen? Sometimes yes sometimes no. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx Deserved a Golden Globe? You bet. He deserves an Oscar ...? It depends on who he is facing. He has some important competitors there, and he may just end them. But then again ... maybe not. If Jamie Foxx does not win, I will not get up and say "he was robbed". I particularly do not feel like it has been. <br /> <br /> This was a decent movie with decent performances and a decent story. A "great" autobiographical film by the late Ray Charles? No. Somewhere out there, I feel like there's a great movie about Ray Charles just waiting to be done, and an actor who will completely surprise him while doing it.
