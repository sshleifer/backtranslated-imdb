I wonder if anyone knows how I can get a copy of the movie, "This is the way the world is". It's been 30 years since I've seen this movie, and I would like to see it again. Earth Wind & Fire transcends the nation globally with its music and inspiring themes. It was a shame that this group did not take off like its counterparts in the early 1970s, but as previously stated, there was racial tension in the United States that prohibited equalized exposure for African-American musical groups. It's good to see that Earth Wind & Fire continues its success. I would like to add this movie to my collection. Someone please help me if possible. Thank you for your attention. Milton Shaw
