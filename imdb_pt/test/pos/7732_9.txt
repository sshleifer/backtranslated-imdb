Just lovely. This is over. No climax. Do not expect anything to happen. Great for a rainy day. About a man in a middle-aged crisis who takes his family to an isolated area of ​​the Greek islands. I saw this in my teens and still love it more than 20 years later. I have been unable to find it in video stores however. Molly Ringwald is a cute teenager who basically wants to go home and then settles down. There are no phones, no TV, no boredom, that when struck with tranquility, the human condition is to be bored and then reflect. And every character does that. Susan Sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to get sexually involved with the character of John Cassavetes, but he is unable to, well, you know. Gina Rowlands, is the wife who loves him, but is about to give up on her marriage. It is picky and frustrating for everyone. There's another character in the movie, a Greek who talks to Molly Ringwald about sex inappropriately, but things she's curious about. But he is annoying and excited and I did not like this character. The location of the movie is what makes this movie so good. It would not work if it were filmed anywhere else. I recommend this movie and give 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.
