I think the costumes were excellent, and the hairdressers did well too. It has the very authentic feeling for that period of time. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it was the magic of the computer or if it was real. Some of the big scenes have hundreds of extras in the background. I was especially impressed by the scene of that bridge. <br /> <br /> The main character that the actress also presented well, she showed us a nervous and witty woman who knows how to use to seduce men to get what she wants <br /> <br /> some of the scenes were hilarious. Even though it was about 2 hours long, it was never annoying. very good entertainment movie.
