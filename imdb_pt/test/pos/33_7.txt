Lackawanna Blues is an end-to-end drama. He details the life of a strong woman by the name of Rachel Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson). Rachel is known as a nanny by everyone who knows her, but she could easily have been called Wonder Woman. She summed up strength, willpower, confidence, and determination. She owned a home that used to house almost every kind of person society would reject. Her tenants consisted of a lesbian, a psychotic war veteran, an amputee, and a host of other vagabonds that made the miles far from ordinary. Each successive event of Rachel took in the wide step and held perfectly. She was not a compassionate dictator, but in fact she was the exact opposite. She showed compassion almost to the point of giving shelter and refuge to so many people that she seemed to stretch too far. <br /> <br /> Merkerson did a good job, but I believe that role was his alley anyway. The film had a keel never moving away from Rachel. There were, of course, dramatic moments, but they were expected. Nothing was ever shocking or profound beyond Rachel herself.
