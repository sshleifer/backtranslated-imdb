Funny movie! The script is horrible, but the quality of the actors saves the day. John Hurt is perfect, as is Jane Alexander. Beau Bridges is fair and the actress who plays his wife is very weak. History is the true star. Based on a true story, the pace moves well and the whole concept of escaping from East Germany attracts you. Happy ending provides enough joy to make up for the script. Do not expect the quality of the Oscars, but it's a great tour for the whole family.
