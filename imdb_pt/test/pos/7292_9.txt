I do not understand why critics would criticize this movie. It's a teen movie that's really serious, which is a rarity. I admit that there are moments that are extremely sentimental, but come on, young love, you have to be sentimental to be valid. My biggest complaint is Chris Klein. While he was funny at American Pie, he is apparently not ready for the change for yet more dramatic, he is very uncomfortable looking at some of his "Mommy stuff". Hartnett and Sobieski, on the other hand, demonstrate a remarkable amount of depth and credibility, as well as that of parents. Although the script is strongly clich√©d with lovers doing poetry, the actor makes it work. The direction displays some powerful images on the screen. Beautiful cinematography, good music, great young actors, I was impressed and I am a tiresome critic when it comes to teen films.
