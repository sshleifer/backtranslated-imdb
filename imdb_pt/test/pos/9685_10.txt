This movie was bordering on raw humor .... I can not believe these people can get away with it. Johnny Knoxville did not cross the line ... he was stepping on him! That was better than the first ... ALL THA WAY! The thing I found about the first movie was that the pranks were a bit like it was at the t.v. exhibition. NOT THIS TIME!!! they made a 180 degree flip ... the whole cast is so remarkable in what they do and they were not crazy stunts ... but the music basically fits in every situation ... GOOD JOB !!!! When you will see this, make sure to use the bathroom before going to the theater, keep a strong stomach and remember not to let your drink spray your nose ....
