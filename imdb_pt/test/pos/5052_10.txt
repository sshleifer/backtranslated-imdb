As a Czech, I am very pleased when I read these comments here. I'm pretty sure this movie is great. And what you may not know is that this story was specially written for Mr. Brodsky. The man you can see is him and his typical attitude - living and resisting death. He was one of the great actors and we are very lucky to have made so many beautiful films during his life. You're lucky you can see at least one of them. Appreciate.
