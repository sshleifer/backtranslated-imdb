Co-scripted by William H. Macy of undoubtedly best and harder to find novel by Donald E. Westlake, "The Travesty." * Very * true to the story, the film shows Macy as an unfortunate man who gets too far from his head after trying to cover up an accidental death. Costars Adam Arkin and James Cromwell in good supporting roles. The strength of the film lies in the intricate twist-after-twist story and acting, particularly by Macy who routinely and delightfully breaks the fourth wall here and runs off with it every time. A good plot with a lot of dark humor, this one got me enough to watch it three times a week since it came out. Prepare to shelve your critical faculties and issue a loud and bipartisan "wheeeeee".
