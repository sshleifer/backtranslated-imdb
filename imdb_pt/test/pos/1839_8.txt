This movie has no claim to be a great art, which is good. But it's a well-written script with well-developed characters and solid acting. I think if I wrote, I could do without the drama around the wife, but not distracting enough to lessen the main story about the character of Minnie Driver. I often think Hollywood abandons an attempt to write in real-world quality to try to inject more visual drama when, with an adult film like this, the emotional kind of drama is all that's really needed - and probably more believable as well. Overall, it is very well done offering and worth seeing.
