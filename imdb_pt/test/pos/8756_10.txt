Traffik is a 6-hour drama very well done about drugs (circa 1987). He tells three stories in parallel about how opium is grown in northeastern Pakistan, how drugs are smuggled from Pakistan to Europe, and finally how people addicted to drugs get out of control. All three stories are told realistically and with empathy. You see enough characters to understand how ordinary people can be sucked into a life that is truly immoral. <br /> <br /> These are not cardboard clippings, opium is trying to feed your family a dry area full of guns and other opium producers. The drug smuggler is a rich, heartless German, but his wife (one of the three main characters) is just an ordinary woman who has to choose between taking her life "the old way" or giving up. Finally, the main character, the government minister, has the most difficult role as he must deal with the emotional devastation caused by his own daughter. She slides into the world of drug addiction and starts stealing, suffering from health problems, emotionally attacking her parents, all so she can continue to satisfy her craving for the drug (heroin) that is destroying her life. <br /> <br /> Traffik is one of the best dramas I've ever seen on TV. The scenes of this show will stay with you for a long, long time. Highly recommended. - Colin Glassey
