This is a difficult movie to review, as several factors need to be taken into account. Let's filter out the most critical ... Okay, are you interested in the facts about Jeffrey Dahmer's serial killer? Can you afford an independent, low-budget movie? Are you objective enough not to like a movie just because of its lack of stars or professional appearance? Well, if you said yes then you should have an open mind enough to deal with that. This film is an almost 100% accurate dramatization of Dahmer's adult life and subsequent homicide, and is termed as an autobiography. It is not a fascinating and unrealistic report that sadly the theatrical film "Dahmer" (2001) was. The film begins with Dahmer, played convincingly by Carl Crew, sitting in the police car while they attack his apartment. His thoughts on what led him there are presented in a narrative style in the past that accurately explains many of Dahmer's psychoses and motives that led him to commit murder almost 20 times. We know the character, both the dishonest side and the side who came close to living a normal life. It is not anyone's fault but Dahmer's 17 people died, but being a student of criminal psychology, I was content for more than just his animalistic side truly represented in this film. You see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find companionship, but of course we witness the side of him that everyone remembers. It should be noted that there is little actual violence on the screen, with much of it suggestive in photos like blood splatters or a body being struck by a blurred curtain. You see two deaths I remember, one being a very bloodless throat and the other being a man pushed alive into a barrel of acid. While you see nothing graphic, this cruelty and the compelling acting of Crew and his victim make it a disturbing scene. And while the actual mutilation on the screen is kept low, you will see the results. There is a supporting hand and head or two, but it seems that this would disturb the viewer and does not seem to be explorer. In addition, these fake anatomical pieces are where budget constraints are visible. Although acceptable, they look a lot like fakes so they will not be too disturbing. The film actually ends before Dahmer's death in 1994 due to the fact that it was released a year or two earlier. That is the only major difference in real history, and the information that remains is, as I said, very true to the facts. The quality of the film may be better, the dialogue often seems a little too quiet, and the acting of several characters is a bit complicated, but it's not exaggerated. In my opinion, this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look at one of America's most remembered serial killers. I think it's safe to say that the movie is memorable too, and I respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story convincingly, aided by an excellent Carl Crew like Dahmer.
