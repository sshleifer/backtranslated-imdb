Turns out I caught it on community TV a few years ago and was pleasantly surprised at how nice a movie was. <br /> <br /> Although a bit cheesy in certain respects, as its main function of being a mystery thriller, it works superbly, thanks to a script that invents an ingenious plot; It kept me guessing and the resolution is inspired. <br /> <br /> The cast is full of stars, containing a mix of those at the end of their careers (actually Richard Long died the same year it was done.), or those who were on the verge of stardom in the hit TV series (Kate Jackson, Tom Bosley). They all do a good job, with the exception of Cesare Danova, who dreams of her role. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
