The net is a great movie! It's about Angela Bennett (in a great performance by Sandra Bullock) who is a computer expert who works for the Cathedral Company, cleaning up viruses and testing games for customers. Angela is a typical nerd who has no friends outside of cyberspace, barely takes a vacation and leaves, and stays almost all the time connected. One day his friend Dale Hessman (Ray McKinnon) asks her to help him by sending Angela an album with a strange show that has a lot of confidential information. That night, when Dale was going to meet her, he was killed in a plane crash. Going to Mexico on vacation, Angela meets a handsome guy named Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam) who proves to be a cold-blooded killer bastard. and one of the guys behind all the secrets of the Diskette. <br /> <br /> Her life turns into a nightmare: all her records are erased and she receives the new identity of Ruth Marx, a woman with serious problems. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it shows how we, humans, depend heavily on computers and machines (sometimes more than we should) and how vulnerable we are if someone ever decides to control and change our personal records , without giving us the chance to prove the error.
