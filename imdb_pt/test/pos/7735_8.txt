Paul Mazursky's storm - interesting, strange and strange film about a middle-aged crisis. Situated in New York and a remote Greek island with John Cassavettes as world-renowned architect who decides to abandon. He is accompanied by his daughter (Molly Ringwald) and a lounge singer (Susan Sarandon). A beautiful transfer of this 25-year film on the DVD - but without extras - not even the theatrical trailer. Tons of great landscapes and sharp dialogues make this 2 1/2 hour movie an interesting trip. Raul Julia and Gena Rowlands complete a strong cast. A good drama mixed with comedy and tension and almost insanity. This recent DVD release is worth being rented B +
