When it was launched in the early 1980s, Pixote brings to Brazilian society the problems of young offenders and its impact on Brazilian society. I can not watch the movie back then, because I was very young, but now I have a chance and watched it a few days ago. It's a very brutal movie, but everything is absolutely true and sad. pixote is the name of a 12-year-old boy who lives on the streets and survives with misdemeanors; he stays for a time in a detention house, and when he leaves, he continues to plan thefts with other loaves and a prostitute, played by Marilia Pera. the boy is still addicted to marijuana and sniffs glue with other teenagers, to forget his sad reality. the quality of the images is not the best, but the film is totally realistic about Brazilian problems and must be seen and admired.
