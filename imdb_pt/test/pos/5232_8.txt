The fact that I give this film a score of 8 is relative to other feature films of the 1930s. By the standards of films made a few years later, this film can receive only 6 or 7 - mainly because the sound quality was very high poor. Now it is possible that the film sounded better and Fox Movie Channel showed a degraded impression (it had many lines and scratches), but I assume that the sound problem has always been a problem. That's because the sound in the movies was still new in the 1930's and many of the 1930s Hollywood images sounded terrible - with background characters often drowning out leads, characters crowding to make sure they were picked up by microphones or inconsistent quality which was seen in CASE OF THE ASSASSIN OF THE BISHOP, ANGELS OF HELL and other films of the day). All of this got much worse in THE BIG TRAIL because most of the film was filmed from the outside - something unheard of at the time. An innovation, but also something that really amplified the talents of sound technicians! So while the film was very difficult to hear, I realized they had to start from somewhere, so I can forgive this - especially since the outside scenes are breathtaking - a great innovation for 1930. <br /> < The plot is quite similar to CIMARRON - a western that came out the following year and it captured the Oscar for Best Picture. Unfortunately, CIMARRON is not a great movie and I really like THE BIG TRAIL more because of the scope of the film. While some may refuse to the slow pace of THE BIG TRAIL, I have seen it as a great history lesson about the difficulties faced by those traveling west on wagon trains. Also, the whole thing looked so beautiful, as director Raoul Walsh went to the trouble of filming on location and THE BIG TRAIL looks almost like a movie version of some of Ansel Adams's prints. <br /> <br /> As for the acting was very good. This was a great opportunity for the young John Wayne - since his previous appearances were, at best, insignificant and unimportant. Here he received the lead and did a great job - although he was obviously young and a little less "John Wayne-ish" than in later films, since his persona on the screen was not yet firmly established. Another interesting part was interpreted by Tyrone Power II (father of Tyrone Power). He looked nothing like his extremely handsome son and looked and sounded almost exactly like Bluto from the Popeye drawings! He made very few sound films - dying just a year after making this film - so it's a rare opportunity to see and hear this once famous actor. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is worth seeing, despite some sound problems and some overly long scenes here and there. By 1930, it was a remarkable achievement - more than the much more famous and award-winning CIMARRON did the following year. Much of the reason why THE BIG TRAIL did not win an Oscar was probably because ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT came out the same year and is truly one of the great movies.
