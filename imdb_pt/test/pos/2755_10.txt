In my opinion, Flatley ruined the first show with his ridiculous ego. He was disrespectful to his dance partner, tried to outshine everyone and was not aware of Riverdance's spirit. It's good that he left the show. Colin Dunne, the new male leader, is superb, and when he and Jean Butler dance together, magic happens! The touch of Eileen Ivers is amazing (as well as Noel Eccles 'percussion) and Maria Pages' "Fire Dance" is worth the price of admission! When Pages and Ivers get together near the end of the show for a musical duet, well, it's a real treasure. I agree, the edition is not free, but no technical flaw can end this extraordinary tour de force. This is the only one to get it. There was never anything like Riverdance! This is the real one!
