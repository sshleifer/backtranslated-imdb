Mr Bean was great fun, I loved it, every episode was very funny, Rowan Atkinson was perfect for this role, he is a funny guy and his facial expressions were hilarious !!! <br /> <br /> The series was so successful that even made a film of Mr. Bean in 1997, which was also very funny! <br /> <br /> It's funny to see all the adventures and situations he gets into, this series was a classic for sure, and I still watch an episode from time to time. <br /> <br /> Mr Bean is well worth a 10/10 in my book, infrequent comedy fans should check this out.
