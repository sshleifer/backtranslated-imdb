I may be a good old man from Virginia in the Confederate States of America, but this man does it for me. This mustache makes me angry. I remember when I first saw a video of him. That girl he hit was amazing. The depth of their acting when they cut their worn facade was a new level of masculinity. This reminds me of the granite sculptures of our Mt. Rushmore If I could ask a question, it would be: "If you were a hot dog, would you eat it?" Will Orhan go on a reunion tour? Take note of the greats like Gordon Lightfoot, the true music of the heart never disappears. Live The John Denver. Thank you my friend, O.F.F.L. (Fan of Orhan for life)
