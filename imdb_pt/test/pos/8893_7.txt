Billy Crystal is Larry, a writer who did not write and is suspected of murder in "Throw Momma from the Train", co-starring Danny Devito and Anne Ramsey. The phrase "black comedy" was invented for this insanity, which is a takeoff from Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train." In fact, Owen (Devito) has the idea of ​​having Larry killing his mother in exchange for Owen killing Larry's ex for watching that famous movie. "I saw the movie. Criss-cross," Owen tells Larry. Not that Larry knows what he's talking about until it seems like it's too late - just like "Strangers." Larry, a writing teacher, claims that his ex-wife, played by Kate Mulgrew, stole his book and put his name on it. She became a big celebrity, appearing in "Oprah," where she refers to Larry as "a beast". Owen's in Larry's class. He lives with an abusive Neanderthal mother (Ramsey) and has visions of poisoning her, shoving a pair of scissors into her head - her name. It is not long after seeing "Strangers on a Train" that he is in Honolulu, chasing after Larry's wife. While she is leaning over a boat railing trying to catch an earring, Owen is behind her and crawls ... Soon the police are looking for Larry to question him, but he is in Owen where he is being encouraged to live by At the end of a bargain he had no idea what he did. You know, "crossed". There are several scenes copied from Strangers, which are hilarious. I particularly loved Larry's confession to Mrs. Dorm asleep, Owen's mother, similar to when Guy thinks he is talking to Bruno's stepfather. <br /> <br /> Crystal and DeVito are masters of dialogue and comic timing and will make you laugh, often out loud. Ramsey is repulsively funny - a totally "out there" performance. Kim Griest and Rob Reiner also have roles - Griest is Crystal's girlfriend, and Reiner has a special turnout. <br /> <br /> The ending is very clever, and the whole movie will make you laugh.
