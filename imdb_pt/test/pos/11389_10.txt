Altman and Scorsese have twisted sex together in one of the greatest American films of the last 20 years. Boogie Nights was not a great initial success, and I still do not think he got the credit he deserves. The immediate clamor surrounding the film ("Some Porn Movie with Marky Mark") was totally without merit. What Paul Thomas Anderson created is no less than an impressive representation of the pursuit and subsequent loss of the American Dream (if that still exists). <br /> <br /> For those of you who have been living in a box (or a confessional) for the past 8 years, Boogie Nights tells the literal tale of the rise and fall of young Eddie Adams (Wahlberg). Eddie is just a dope boy from Torrance, California, who wants something more out of life. Your room is drenched in a naive and muscular American culture. Your dreams are far greater than your potential, but not as big as your ... special gift. His bald southern gentleman quickly raises the attention and eyebrows of the expanding and ubiquitous adult film industry. Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds as the Playful Dad of the movie) learns of Eddie's hidden talent and decides to put it in a movie. <br /> <br /> Before you can say "deep throat," Eddie changed his name to Dirk Diggler and exposed his massive limb to a wide-eyed audience. Fame and fortune make the contact of Dirk, as well as a bunch of local porn celebrities. His friends and co-workers become his makeshift family, but soon he reveals himself a Sunday picnic like no other. As the 1970s prepare for the 1980s filled with video, Dirk & Co. begin a dangerous setback. <br /> <br /> Anderson put everything he had into this glorious and thrilling epic. It squeaks and never fails. Nary a picture of this monumental photo is wasted, and the characters and their dialogues live with us for a long time after ELO disappears from the soundtrack. See this one right away. And then look again. <br /> <br /> And again.
