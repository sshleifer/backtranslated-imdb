Uzumaki (which is Japanese for "spiral" or "vortex") is one of the most absurd films I have ever seen. A city becomes obsessed and then consumed by the vortex pattern in very grotesque ways. The fingertips are cut off, people commit suicide in washing machines ... just a wild and crazy Japanese horror. Possibly as psychologically damaging as "The Ring". It's usually not as scary as "The Eye", but the image of it is more disgusting than most things in "The Eye". And not as bloody as "The Untold Story" ... but that does not mean that there is not a fair amount of blood and dismemberment. Seriously, if you like horror movies and especially Asian horror - you should add this movie to your list. Some parts are a little strange with the sound effects (the story is adapted from a manga and it shows), but it really fits. Unlike some movies that try hard to capture the original source ("House of the Dead"), this one does it perfectly. The most original movie you'll see ... not just this year, but probably never. Recommended!
