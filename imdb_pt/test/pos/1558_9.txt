Fantastic movie! Wow - this is really a pleasure. I can not believe I discovered a gem of a movie. <br /> <br /> A very young girl traveling south to Florida meets an older couple friendly with an RV after she has an apartment at a rest stop. However, she finds out that things are not as they seem and the couple gets a bit scary after she spends some time on the road with them. <br /> <br /> Everyone was so perfect for their parts that you almost believe you're seeing it happen in real life in front of you. <br /> <br /> Newcomer Emily Grace did a fantastic job as Alice, really kind of shy and still a little shy. Emily gives you the feeling that you can understand what she is experiencing and you can see how she got into the situation that develops in the movie. I'm sure we'll see Emily in more movies in the future. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what others have said, lighting and photography have been perfect. The editing was well done as well - just the right way to ride highway images to give the feeling that you're traveling with the cast on your trip. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this on the big screen, but I can only ask everyone to go out and see. More movies like this are * exactly * what we need. <br /> <br /> SF
