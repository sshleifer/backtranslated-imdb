This film tells the story of nine ambitious young people trying to follow their dreams at the infamous New York Performing Arts School: Coco, singer, Bruno, modern Mozart, Lisa, Leroy and Hilary, dancers fighting, Ralph, comedian, and Doris and Montgomery, the actors. While everyone thinks they have what it takes to really achieve their goals, they will need more than just their talent. They will have to deal with rejection, disgust, education, pain and love to achieve their fame. <br /> <br /> "Fame" is one of the most entertaining, classic and inspiring films of all time. It has everything a teen drama / musical should have: extremely captivating, entertaining, Oscar winning songs performed by the incredible Irene Cara, stunning dance numbers, a very attractive cast that makes you believe in the characters, and a great story including the scene touching when Coco finds the video camera. <br /> <br /> Like I said, the cast is incredible. Irene Cara can really act, and it's not just her singing that makes her shine here like Coco. Lee Curreri is very good as Bruno. Barry Miller brings a lot of humor to Ralph. Maureen Teefy is great as the fearless Doris, and look closely, and you'll see Paul McCrane of "ER" like Montgomery. <br /> <br /> This is really an amazing movie. "Fame" really touched me and inspired me to continue following my dreams as an actor and singer. Any movie that excites me so much is a winner in my book. Unmissable! The film really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer.
