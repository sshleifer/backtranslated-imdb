The plot gets interesting, however, in the end many die in a very short time, turning the thriller-mystery aspect of the story into a slaughter. <br /> <br /> The only true highlights were Adam Beach and JÃ¼rgen. Prochnow, which again were excellent. Nice attempt with an inadequate last third, despite a good ending.
