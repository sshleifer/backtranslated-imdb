Surely this movie is not for everyone - but for anyone with a sense of humor and love of vintage movies - buy this right away! Where else can you have a trendy 1970s slump, a period vocabulary primer, trained karate prostitutes, crime, a rap about the Titanic wreck, shootings, and a co-star named Queen Bee? in the guards' office!) With a filming style that's a cross between a porn movie / Dawn of the Dead / and Car Wash, you can not go wrong. This is one to watch over and over after putting the kids to bed.
