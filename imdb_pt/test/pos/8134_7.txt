This was the last silent film of Laurel and Hardy for Roach Studios. However, since the audience had a real thirst for "talkies", this same short was remade by the team only a few years later, with only a few minor changes in the plot. LAUGHING GRAVY was essentially the same plot, except that Stan and Ollie were trying to hide a fluffy little puppy from their rancid landlord - not a goat as in ANGORA LOVE. This whole angle is the worst part of the movie. While you could understand the boys who want to keep a cute little dog (after all, it's snowy outside), why exactly do they bring a goat house just is artificial and meaningless. According to the plot, the goat followed them home, and then they tired of shaking it off and putting it away. There is?! It just does not make sense - if it was a giraffe or a cow, would they have done the same thing? In addition to being a little convincing plot, the film itself is pure Laurel and Hardy, with a familiar plot and familiar roles for the comedians. This film lays out some laughter but unfortunately it is not one of their best films to end their silent careers. This aspect of their careers seems to have ended with a groan.
