This movie is not as bad as some say it's really think it's nicer than the original. maybe that's why some people hate it so much because they do not want to admit it's a good movie (not great). <br /> <br /> Most, if not all, were made by CGI, what I did not care for at all cos was a nice movie. Phil Buckman - (Chris) was in my opinion the best guy in the movie Julie Delpy was quite attractive, she brought the sensuality to the film. <br /> <br /> There were lots of jokes in the movie that I thought were good. This movie is in my collection, but the original is not because I do not like it as much as this. I was not bored when I watched this movie that kept me watching unlike some horror movies that I could mention as oh say = driller killer & suspiria (dario argento film), to name just two. <br /> <br /> It's a werewolf movie that should be in the collection of people if they like werewolf movies, maybe I have the original at some point, maybe. I have only one complaint and this is Phil Buckman - (Chris) should have been more than he was, but other than that, the movie was good. Rating for this movie 8/10 an ok werewolf movie is not the worst out there. <br /> <br />
