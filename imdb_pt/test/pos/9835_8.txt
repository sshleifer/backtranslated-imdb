As a fan of the story, mythology and fantasy "Mystic Knights" attracted me from the beginning. It has semi-decent scripts, the costumes are fantastic (there are exceptions), it has a very good performance, and the heroes and villains perform well. SCRIPTS - Half a script is very good, the other half falls, but everything is mixed, which means that many episodes end up being so. Also, some of the top players are repeatedly getting deadlines (King Conchobar and Angus, for example), they need to get something ... more. I'm not sure what, but writers should be able to come up with something. ACTING - In addition to some acting for locals (horrible lines that end up putting a lot of effort), the cast did very well in choosing their leads and so on. Everyone, good and bad, work well together! CUSTOMS / WEAPONS - Everyday wear that everyone wears is spectacular! Mystic knight armor that falls short are Deirdre and Garrett. A knitted bikini would probably have better protection in her case ... and it would not look like plastic; looks like a bunch of pieces of brown plastic when it should look like bronze. Ivar's trident seems to have been bought at a discount store and while Garrett's guns look cool, they also look like plastic. <br /> <br /> Recently, "Mystic Knights" has taken on many traits of "Power Rangers", if you watch the show, you will know what I mean. As the series progresses, however, it must find its niche and perfect its style. Overall, it's a wonderful show that all ages should enjoy (most of my friends and I watch and we're all 20+). The plot thickens and twists, although it gets a little juvenile in some places, and everything gets more and more interesting. It may be of some interest to fans of the movie "Willow" or the series "The Adventures of Sinbad". A lot of adventure, a bit of mystery, a hint of romance, a pinch of strength in nature ... Check it out! (My score: 7/10)
