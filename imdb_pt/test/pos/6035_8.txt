This episode of Columbus is one of the best and perhaps one of my personal favorites. The cast includes Rosemary's Baby John Cassavetes as maestro, his wife played by Blythe Danner (mother of Gwyneth Paltrow) and his mother-in-law, played by Myrna Loy (one of the greatest American actresses of cinema of our time). Anyway I do not agree with anyone who criticizes this movie. This episode is one of my favorites, because you have an excellent cast that does a great job in performance. I love watching Columbus with his beloved dog that he never names in the series. This time, the episode focuses on classical music at the Hollywood Bowl, one of Los Angeles' attractions. Of course, Columbus is as interested in classical music as in anything else involving a crime.
