This is really a funny movie. Her dance scene with the tape is one of the funniest scenes I can remember. I thought the scene "I'm gay" at the high school graduation ceremony was a little surreal, although it was funny. While watching for the third time, I began to pick up small segments that I had lost. One was when Matt Dillon's girlfriend, a classic ditz, tried using a dial-up phone she had never used before. Kevin Klein made this hit movie along with Tom Selleck. This was also the first time I could appreciate Debbie Reynolds; she proved that she can be funny. She confirmed this in the TV series "Will and Grace." One discovery I found after the third screening is Lauren Ambrose, of the '6 Feet Under' fame. She stands out with her red fringe, but it's obvious that this is one of her first films. Bob Newhart is also very funny in early high school.
