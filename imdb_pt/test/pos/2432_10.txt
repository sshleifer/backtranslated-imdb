This film is a very nice homage to Bogart and other old detective films. Robert Sacchi blinds as Bogie and Michelle Phillips is a truly timeless beauty as Gena Anastas. <br /> <br /> However, the most notable part of this film involves the longest belly dance scene ever produced in a Hollywood movie. A well-known professional instructor commented that nothing else in the cinema comes close to the excitement of the dance. <br /> <br /> The scene, which ends up being an important part of the plot, takes place in a lush Middle Eastern nightclub and is mesmerizing. Pulsing music, swirling veils and ringing cymbals, free-flowing ripples and beautiful costumes - and a surprise involving the seductive Sybil Danning - build tension and excitement to the end. <br /> <br /> The three talented and beautiful professional nightclub dancers are led by the exotic brunette beauty Kamala Almanzar, one of the United States' belly dancers since the mid-1970s. She was hand-picked by the notorious Armenian musician Guy Chookoorian to travel with his orchestra on the road. Guy's group is the live band that the dancers play on the scene. If you watch the trailer on this site, you will see a glimpse of Kamala (touching the finger plates behind Sybil Danning). <br /> <br /> If you are not yet a fan of belly dancing, you will be after watching this movie, and if you are an amateur, it holds up very well after repeated viewing.
