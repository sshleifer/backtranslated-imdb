Honestly, I really do not understand why there has been much controversy over this show. It covers the elements of the original as it expands over them. The storytelling has been updated and while some of the episodes seem to be a little "fast", that's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is perfect on paper. Easily as good as Tom Baker. <br /> <br /> Rose is one of the best companions, similar to Sarah Jane Smith or Leela. <br /> <br /> I like the concept that timelords have been destroyed. - No more politicking with the Doctor acting as president emeritus. And add something to the character to be the only one left. <br /> <br /> The SFX is excellent - especially compared to the original. <br /> <br /> Take it from me (And I was a huge Dr Who geek - I actually took notes while watching the show all the way from Dr Number 1 to Dr. Number 8. I played the horrible movie cannon, personally) this is the best science fiction show on TV now, possibly ever. Watch and buy the DVD.
