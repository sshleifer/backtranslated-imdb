Rooms and hallways is the kind of movie that makes you realize that the drama of life is hidden in the details. And this drama can also be a lot of fun! Even though his own love life and his own friends may not be as unique as the characters in this film, each one is bound to recognize himself and others in the colorful protagonists of this film. And that's the great strength of dorms and corridors, that the irony of life is that the most confusing things that happen to you can be the most interesting / hilarious / funny / sexy / ... things too! I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I do!
