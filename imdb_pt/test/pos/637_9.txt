It is always a known and important steering device to set the mood of a movie within the first 5 minutes. In the crucial opening scenes, the film must assert itself and make viewers aware of and interested in the rest of the film. Here, in "Mute Witness", we find an excellent example of this. In the first 5-10 minutes, the movie opens for a hitchcock scene of a beautiful blonde in her apartment with the radio on. She is wandering, applying lipstick, regrouping and ignoring the report of a serial killer on the loose. Of course the serial killer is in your house and monitors your movements, knife in hand. She hears a noise, looks in a room and there is her partner in a pool of blood. At the very moment of her screams, she turns to face the maniac who wields the knife, who stabs her repeatedly in a brutal and horrifying act ... <br /> <br /> ... then something strange happens. As the woman convulses in her agony, the killer sits down and takes out a cigarette to watch her victim die. Before you find the lighter, the cigarette is lit ... from someone else in the room! The camera goes out, and we realize that there are more and more people in the room, some taking notes, filming, some recording death, and that the lady is taking too long to die, and doing a very hard job. also. When the audience realizes what's going on, and the whole scene is part of a movie, the suspense and horror scene takes on an element of humor. <br /> <br /> * * * </> I highlighted this opening scene for several reasons. Firstly, it portrays the atmosphere of the entire movie perfectly. A thriller in the style of Hitchcock or De Palma, with some moments of disorientation and even black humor. - Conveys a central theme (the difference between a "death on the movie screen" and a "death of the movie", an issue that is elaborated later in the film) and finally introduces the viewer to the characters, of Mute Witness revolves around Billy Hughes, an American special effects makeup artist who is working on the set of the film, being shot in a large warehouse in Moscow. . Billy can not speak, but she communicates in sign language through her sister. After the end of filming one night, Billy inadvertently finds himself locked in the warehouse by accident and, in his attempt to escape, witnesses two crew members do what looks like a pornographic film, but ends up being a snuff. movie. Suddenly, your escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and death. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the first half of the film is powerful and absolutely thrilling. The saving grace of Billy and his disadvantage is the fact that she is not able to make a sound. (Actually, in my opinion, one of the best aspects of the movie is that it's not full of screaming women.) There are some extremely disturbing moments, and some superb scenarios of real suspense (the corridoor and elevator shaft are perfect examples). Time is fluid, and the whole first half is an incredibly satisfying experience in and of itself. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film introduces new concepts. Although there are still several moments of suspense, the focus is on the plot twists. New characters are introduced, and it is ambiguous as to which side they are on. While there is nothing wrong with the second half of the movie, it does not compare to the first half. There are some moments of dark humor that juxtapose perfectly and punctuate some very dramatic scenes, but there are also some moments of very lame comedy (coming specifically from Billy's sister and his fiancee, who is the director of the film Billy is working on). ), which almost spoil the film, only because they are poorly displaced and / or confused and spoil the rhythm. - In the end, the twists continue to come at a rapid speed, and the climax of the film is aptly as tense as the first half. <br /> <br /> There are several things that really make the film work. The communication barriers that Billy must face, both as a mute as an American in Moscow, mean that even a call for emergency help becomes a dangerous situation. The actress who plays Billy, Natasha Zudina, does a wonderful job in the film, with an engaging presence on screen, and a brilliant performance, and ultimately the direction as a whole, but more particularly in the first half of the film, what it really is a study of the suspense / suspense techniques of Alfred Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> As I've already said though, the disappointments in the movie are of some terrible moments of comic relief that really do not need to be added. There is already a consistent and effective black humor trend that appears in the film without the need for the characters of Karen Hughes and Andy Clarke (The Sister and the Filmmaker) to turn their scenes into an uncommon sitcom. However, despite these shortcomings, the film is a very nice thriller, and ideal for a group view on Halloween. (Certainly better than the usual slasher horror movie ...!)
