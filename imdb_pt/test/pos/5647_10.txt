Kon Ichikawa lived the Second World War and saw its effects on the people in Japan. But so did the novelist Shohei Ooka, whose book was the inspiration for Ichikawa's Fires on the Plain. It is a film about men in this war, or perhaps more universally in wars in general, who lose their humanity. The soldiers walking through these fields and jungles of the Philippenes in this story are almost completely hopeless, if not just that. It makes Stone's platoon look like a picnic: at least they had certain things, like food, after all. <br /> They have little or no reserves or supplies or ammunition, no support, no sense of anything. following their way in this fight in which they were pushed. They can not even receive proper hospital treatment unless they can no longer walk or lose limbs (for example, if you have tuberculosis, you are on the way). But it is really through the prism of a soldier, a private Tamura, that we have a complete notion of the futility of war, both in its shadowy scenes of nothingness, boredom and decadence, and in those flashes of intense and brutal violence. > <br /> In the movie Tamura just wants to get medical care. This is early on, and his said by his superior officer - he already has eyes that look out and an expression that has been drained by years of battle - that he will die if he does not find a hospital. In fact, he does not appear, but ends up with some soldiers: at first with a platoon that seems to have what to do together but is actually led by a power-hungry brute who only wants the Tamura salt stock, and then with two other missing soldiers belonging to a group that had previously been ambushed when crossing a road at night. <br /> <br /> History is not entirely straight, but it does not have to be. Tamura's path in Fires on the Plain is told in vignettes, little stories like when he comes across a seemingly deserted enemy village. Two of the more populous return to pick up some supplies and Tamura flees to them. It's an excruciating scene, since until now with Tamura we did not see him do something completely wrong, but he does it in this scene, not even from evil, but out of fear and despair (that too, without spoiling, how he gets a stock of salt). Small scenes are built so brilliantly and devastatingly, as a simple task of finding a pair of comfortable shoes, which seems to be none. Or when Tamura, later in the film, discovers that his teeth are tearing and falling for lack of total hygiene. So much for food, so will it. It should also be mentioned that this is a hauntingly accomplished film of Ichikawa, filmed in a stark black and white view of the fields and woods, cinematography filling everything we see in black-white and hot-black white . Ichikawa also ensures that everything is authentic from its actors, not just emotionally, but with its own slim appearance and looks of despair about them. It's as if Ichikawa had to survive all the movies, as well as the characters surviving in nature; by the wild, by the way, I mean also cannibalism. The shock of this is twofold; the first is the way a soldier jokingly says at first about eating other soldiers for Tamaura, who asks if it was true and only in response getting a word of caution "do not ask," and the second with the representation of cannibalism itself, of the crazy, starving man on the hill who pulls his guts out of his lap and says with a serious face to our hero that "You can eat me when I die." <br /> <br /> This makes it especially brutal when it comes to the director filming the brief 'action' scenes. These are, I would say, more brutal than the "Private Ryan" in their depictions of violence in battle, the carnage that is completely random. One scene that I would point out, and which contains only one shot that is excruciating to watch, is when, from a high angle, we see a group of about twenty soldiers walking slowly, a blast of artillery that kills only four or five, but it happens so fast, and the soldiers keep walking on the same trail. This is not the only scene of horrible carnage that is shown - when the need to be bloody is there but sneezed on the screen as something completely of the macabre - but that takes the question completely. <br /> <br /> The acting is disconcerting (especially Funakoshi, who seems to be more at peace and more horrified at what he sees in the subtlest of looks most of the time), all the major pieces provide something else for the horrible experience, and all this amounts to the last question with an anti-war film: how can or why do people fight in such wars? It's almost too depressing to put into words, and so Ichikawa pushes our noses into the dirt and dirt and blood and demands that we take it, then maybe, someday, it will never happen again. Or we can expect this, until the end of a film as dark and grandiose as this.
