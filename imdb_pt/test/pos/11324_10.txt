I just wanted to say that when I was young, my favorite TV show was the heat of the night. I loved the characters and the plot of the show. I thought it was a great show and it still does today. I like to watch the reruns and I'm a big fan. I love the way the characters played. I always stayed up late to watch my favorite show with my mom, who was also a huge fan. Now I can watch my show again and listen to the theme song. Which I thought was a cool song for the show. My favorite characters were Scott Hylands and Jeff Wincott. I enjoyed watching these cute guys knock down the bad boys.
