OK. Here's the thing. I read through the comments of other viewers --- some destroying the movie and some saying it is the funniest, darkest and darkest comedy ever made. The smell of Tarantino, etc. Well, not exactly. But guess what? It's still a fun and ultimately funny movie. It's not brilliant, it's not rubbish. Liv Tyler gives a great performance and you can not take your eyes off her. She is a woman with very strong decorating ideas ... Matt Dillon, a very underrated and underused actor, is wonderful, as always. He can always get past that delicate line between scruff and soul, and he takes the comedy beautifully. The same goes for John Goodman (though the religious implications, probably funny in the script, do not really work). Paul Reiser is very good --- definitely better than he was on TV. <br /> <br /> The normally unbearable Michael Douglas is really great in this role. As for your coif, well, watch the movie. Between this and "Wonder Boys," you really do remember the fact that Douglas can take action. The movie will make you laugh in parts. Ok, not exactly laughing in the belly, but definitely in the category I'm entertaining, I'm really fun. If you are renting this one expecting to see another "Pulp Fiction", forget it. But if you want something cool and fun, that's a good choice.
