This broadcast of the classic musical "Sweeney Todd" does not do justice to the production, but still is quite captivating. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the most pleasing aspect of this version is the production design, from the multi-wheeling set to the amazing trapdoor. So the staging is excellent until the cut. <br /> <br /> The main flaw here is in the performances that people give. Oh, they're believable, that's fine - but it's pretty frustrating when no one seems to be hitting their tracks right away in such fast-paced music as, say, "Kiss Me." In fact, the actress who plays Johanna is not just off the beat, but also a little out of tune. And Angela Lansbury's slightly exaggerated cockney accent is a bit annoying. One more thing, too - what, exactly, is so bad about Judge Turpin's Johanna's performance that is banned from American theater, but not the cannibal anthem "A Little Priest"? <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is an excellent production. It's a thrill to see people doing what they love - and I'm not even peripherally talking about "meat pies with a twist."
