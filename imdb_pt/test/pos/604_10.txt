The Muppet Movie by Jim Henson is a charming, funny, and brilliant film that can be seen and enjoyed by adults and children alike. I feel like this is my favorite childhood film because it combines great characters, great story and great wit that is irresistible. The plot involves Caco, the frog (manipulated by puppets and voiced by Henson) on his odyssey for America to follow his dream in Hollywood. Along the way, he meets Fozzie Bear, The Great Gonzo (my favorite), Miss Piggy, Rolf and DR. Teeth and electric chaos. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many good things that I can not even say. But it's memorable and every time I think of a puppet or muppet, I'll think about this movie. Look for appearances by Mel Brooks, DeLouise, Paul Williams, Madeline Kahn, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor, Edgar Bergen (and Charlie McCarthey), Elliot Gould, Carol Kane and the great Orson Welles. Excellent and spectacular, one of the best films of the 70's. A ++
