Dogtown and Z-Boys Summary: Dogtown and Z-boys is a documentary about a group of revolutionary teenagers who changed the world of surfing and skateboarding in Venice (Dogtown), California, as we know it today. With a low pivotal style, they embarked on a journey influenced by Larry Bertlemen that would lead to countless successes and a few failures. After Dogtown's articles were featured in a reworked skateboarding magazine, the sport was renewed and Zephyr skateboarding members forgot about Jeff Ho and appeared to be on a summer vacation for the rest of their lives joining other teams of skateboard that they could afford to pay them as movie stars. The original Zephyr Skateboard team, including Jeff Ho (Zephyr Surfshop Owner) and Craig Stecyk (photographer), included Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta, Bob Biniak, Chris Cahill, Shogo Kubo, Paul Constantineau, Jim Muir and Peggy Oki. . single woman), Nathan Pratt, Wentzle Ruml IV, Allen Sarlo and David Ray Perry. All original members, except Jay Adams and Chris Cahill, are still fine and surf / skid. Jay Adams, at the time of the documentary, was serving time on drug charges. Chris Cahill, at the time of the documentary, was last seen in Mexico. <br /> <br /> Themes: The themes of this documentary are of the type that reads between the lines, but if there was a clear theme would be that even children can trigger revolutions. Other topics would include extensive parties in the past someone might lead to an unsatisfying future, and planning and taking care of the assets, a very rewarding future could be at hand. Other Works: Stacy Peralta (Writer and Director) has a wide variety of documentaries that he wrote, produced or directed. Most have a common surfing or skateboarding theme, such as the Riding Giants, Sk8 TV, The Bones Brigades and the Lords of Dogtown. He also made films with the theme of growing up in teenage America, movies like: Influences: From Yesterday to Today, Crips and Bloods: Made in America, and the 70s: The decade that changed television. <br /> <br /> Subjects: Dogtown and Z-boys themes are the original members of the Zephyr Skate Team except Chris Cahill. Peralta included Jeff Ho and Craig Stecyk in interviews. Other subjects were people who grew up during the 70's who read the Dogtown Articles as well as skateboarding enthusiasts. Skaters from the Dogtown area, but not the team, were interviewed. <br /> <br /> Editing: The editing of this movie was phenomenal in my opinion. There were scenes of the subjects talking so the audience could see who was speaking and have a sense of the character but would immediately cut off the filming that would explain what the speaker was saying. When a song could better explain the subjects 'emotions, such as when Jay Adams' unhappy life was a subject of conversation, Neil Young's Old Man music was played, which evokes many emotions. Sean Penn was the narrator of the film and explained the transitions throughout the film. The film was presented chronologically from the time the Zephyr surfing team was set up until the skate team was set up to all Z-boys leaving the team to join other skateboarding companies or set up their own company. <br /> <br /> Photography: The film was shot in an interesting way. The film of the talking guys was all in black and white and all the archival footage of the Z-Boys surfing or skating was in color. Of course the filming of the 70's was grainy, but that only improved the film. The interviewees were filmed in the same area where they appear, but all were outside. All of the footage was very well controlled even in the archive footage which I found very surprising. <br /> <br /> Music: "Seasons of Wither" - by Aerosmith "Toys in the Attic" - performed by Aerosmith "Generation Landslide" - Alice Cooper "One Way Out" - played by The Allman Brothers "Lollipops and Roses "and" Whipped Cream "- performed by Herb Alpert" Into the Void "and" Paranoid "- played by Black Sabbath" Godzilla "- Blue Oyster Cult" Aladdin Sane "and" Rebel Rebel "- David Bowie" Fastcars "- The Buzzcocks "Gut Feeling" - I'll give you money - Peter Frampton "Funk 49" - James Gang "Ezy Rider" and "Foxy Lady" and "Freedom" and "Bold as Love" - ​​Jimi Hendrix "Sidewalk Surf "- Jan and Dean" Achilles Last Stand "and" Hot on for Nowhere "- Led Zeppelin" Six Underground "- The Sneaker Pimps" Surfrider "- The Animated" Cat Scratch Fever "and" Motor City Madhouse "and" Wang Dang Sweet Poontang- Ted Nugent "We and They" - Pink Floyd "Bad Boys" - The Pretenders "Maggie May" - Rod Stewart "I Want to Be Your Dog" and "Gimme Danger" - The Stooges "Sons of the Revolution" R "Bad Reputation" - Thin Lizzy "Disco Inferno" - The Vagabonds "Hannah" - Rob Trower "Rocky Mountain Way" - Joe Walsh "Old Man" - Neil Young "La Grange" - ZZ Top /> The music in the movie makes the movie. Each of these songs contributes to what the subjects are saying and evoke emotions that would not be remembered otherwise.
