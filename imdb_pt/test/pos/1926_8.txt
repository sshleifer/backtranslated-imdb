"Ideas are dangerous." Comment by an interviewee. <br /> <br /> DVD rating: B + / 4 out of 5/8 out of 10 / Worth the time. <br /> <br /> A great story for adult / teenage sailors, but not for children. None of the stupid violent crimes so often confused by Hollywood these days as "quality work." And, it can be used as a film instructor on what is the proper preparation of a boat, or not, before "navigating the seven seas". The film begins a bit slowly to develop the story, as most documentaries do, but as it draws the viewer to the saga, emotions begin to infiltrate the head! Emotions include anger, sadness and disbelief. The era: late 1960s. <br /> <br /> That individual sailing around the world is dangerous is not surprising. What is surprising is all the kinks that viewers would not expect. Not your average group of guys in a sailing race! Each boat was different, as allowed by race rules. Each solo sailor had different skill levels, as allowed by race rules. There were well-known sailors among them and some not so well known. One of them was considered a mysterious man, for no one seemed to have any knowledge of his ability. Each boat was authorized at will, provided that all were in progress until a certain date. And this, of course, before modern electronics, which allows navigators to communicate with the coast about violent storms, etc. <br /> <br /> Video and audio recordings are interspersed with interviews with family members and others involved. The mood of the interviewees is always gloomy despite the years that have passed. <br /> <br /> The main character, Don, is the focus of attention and how his journey relates to those he not only wanted to win, but due to circumstances of his own creation, had to beat. He had to win. The story was about what that circumstance did with his life as he moved from the southwest to the Atlantic Ocean over a period of years alone in the water. <br /> <br /> DO NOT miss the "special features" section of the DVD as soon as the movie is finished. The entire saga is not fully understood without seeing things 'bonus'. <br /> <br /> In the end, once you've watched it all on the DVD, you'll probably just nod and exclaim, 'Wow.' And remember, that's why the story has remained alive for the past 40 years. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: Be sure to check the "special features" section of the DVD when the movie is ready. A sailor who was returning to England after circumnavigating the world decided that, no, he was going for another round and the film records his wife's opinions on that decision. The opposite story unfolds when another sailor wants the race to allow two on board to take his wife and his photos to demonstrate a very warm union between them. The interview with a former parachute burley who had actually paddled a boat across the Atlantic with a friend before the solo sailing race was incredibly funny as he described it without knowing how to navigate and who thought that the bad things going on with him were " normal ". 'Many people think sailing offshore can be a romantic adventure without setbacks. Do not be one!
