For those who liked the books and movies of Asterix, you will love this movie! Yes, I admit that he mixes some of the books and movies, but the characters are brilliant and it's not just people showing their CGI left, right and center. I've seen it several times and I laugh my way. <br /> <br /> Of course it contains the main heroes Asterix (Asterix), Obelix (Obelix) and Dogmatix (Id√©fix), but this time they have someone new to ... deal. <br /> <br /> With such a sense of humor, the Gauls will continue and continue. Bless them.
