This is a very good movie. I give note 10. <br /> <br /> It's very different because it's a long stalking scene. The fact that the main character is mute is used throughout history in a very believable way. <br /> <br /> She sees a murder (for a funeral film) and decides to flee, but is persecuted (this takes a lot of Time). I will not reveal the rest of the film, as this would ruin the experience, but rest assured: it is very convincing, well played, very intense and has good surprises, plus a great ending. <br /> Do not miss this movie.
