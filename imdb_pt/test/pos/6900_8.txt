IT'S OK. Finally, a horror movie that was well done. As soon as I heard the song, I learned that some effort had been made in the creation of what I consider to be almost a masterpiece of good old terror. Zombies, prostitutes, drunks, thieves and more. A great cast, well represented, well directed, well written - there was hardly a flaw. Even American actors with an Irish / English accent really succeeded. I thought actor Larry Fessenden looked familiar to me. It was that lost tooth. Finally I realized that this guy was the protagonist of "Habit", a vampire movie in New York. I thought he was excellent at this role. Now I'm wondering if he's American or not. His accent was so compelling in "I See," that I thought he had to have grown up on the Emerald Isle, not the USA. Well, apparently he's a born and raised New Yorker. A great actor - really played the part of him in this movie. Nothing beats a horror film set in the early 19th century in Europe (like the old Hammer films). I encourage anyone who wants to have a great time to watch this well-crafted movie.
