This movie is simply one of the best movies I have the privilege of owning. It took me years to create this movie and it was worth it. The film is meant to be anti-drug propaganda, but it turns into the opposite, though not even in the middle of the movie. The appreciated look on the faces of the players when they receive their reward of drugs is pleasing to all those who observe. Until the final phase of their drug-induced lives, the heroine comes to meet him. YIKES! This is the anti-drug message that was so sought after. The soundtrack to this movie kicks ass! By far, it's one of the best Pink Floyd albums ever! If ever the chance, take a look, listen and moment to witness a spectacularly made movie.
