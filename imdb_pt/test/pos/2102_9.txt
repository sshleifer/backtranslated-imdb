The ruthless warlord Samanosuke (superbly played by the hateful fist of Yutaro Gomi) cruelly mistreats the peaceful inhabitants of a small village. The gigantic Majin stone statue eventually comes to life to destroy Samanosuke and his evil minions. Director Kimiyoshi Yasudo and screenwriter Tetsuro Yoshida give the story convincingly all the power and simplicity of an ancient legendary folktale: there is a very strong sense of an ancient time and a distant remote place (it is specifically defined in feudal Japan), the good are noble and attractive while villains are really nasty and obnoxious, occasional sword fights are staged with considerable skill and enthusiasm, the special effects are good and impressive, the serious, steady tone never falters for a minute, and the last Majin's bang of savage destruction is extremely lively, exciting and more than a little scary. In addition, the fantastic elements of the narrative receive substantial credibility by steadfastly steadfastly adhering to a dark, rough, and daring world. This movie earns bonus points for representing Majin as another brutal and frightening force of furious revenge instead of a pure spirit of absolute good. Veteran composer Akira Ifukube provides a typically rich, robust, and exhilarating score. Fujio Morita's sharp and somber cinematography also hits the target. The cast able to all give admirably sound and sincere performances, with work particularly praiseworthy by Jun Fujimaki as the brave, protective Kogenta and Tatsuo Endo as Gunjuro's middle henchman. Highly recommended.
