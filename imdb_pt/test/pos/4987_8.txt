"The Violent Men" marked Rudolph Maté's best collaboration with Glenn Ford in an intensely satisfying drama of primitive, robust justice? <br /> <br /> Ford is John Parrish, a former cavalry captain who is eager to marry and start a new life? His fiancée Caroline Vail (May Wynn) is desperate to move east, and sees him selling his spread to Lee Wilkison (Edward G. Robinson). <br /> <br /> Parrish is not even a rancher ?? but does he understand that there is something big piling up in the valley? In the Army, they used to call it 'enemy pressure'. First, Cole Wilkison (Brian Keith) returns from Texas to help his brother manage Anchor ?? So a tough guy with a fancy gun (Richard Jaeckel) appears on Wilkison's payroll? So all the small farmers are forced out, getting the same kind of offers? Did Parrish find himself running like them, or standing up and fighting? <br /> <br /> But can he easily deal with a man who sends six murderers to shoot a man in the back? Can he easily argue with a man who started off with a few acres of land and now has pretty much the entire valley? <br /> <br /> All that grass and sand meant to the former Confederate Army officer in the last three years? Was it a place to regain your health? By habit of taking advice, Parrish says, "What happens in this valley is none of my business." And to the disappointment of the remaining farmers and farmers, who are pressing him to stay, does he decide to accept Wilkison's offer to fulfill the promise he made to his fiancee? When Lee's younger brother, Cole, made the wrong move, trying to force Parrish to decide to lynch one of his hands from the ranch, Parrish went mad and warns the two brothers that he will stay and will you fight them for the privilege of being left alone ?? <br /> <br /> Brian Keith plays the traitorous brother behind the murder ... He dreams of having position and respect in the anchor day race? <br /> <br /> Lee's ambitious wife, Martha (Barbara Stanwyck), secretly hates herself and her husband? Does Stanwyck play the role of a loving wife who can not stand the touch of her husband's hands? Edward G. Robinson is good enough as the crippled Anchor owner who promised the whole valley to his wife without knowing that she is having an affair with her younger brother ?? <br /> <br /> Dianne Foster is very sensitive as the antisocial adult daughter well aware of her mother's burdens? <br /> <br /> "The Violent Men" uses wide-screen technology to emphasize the scope and power of this harrowing action drama, making it a perfect example of the most enduring classics of the genre?
