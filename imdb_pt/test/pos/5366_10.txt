A wonderfully thoughtful and engaging film that leaves an impression far beyond its initial takeoff. Based on a true story, one of the many "small" pre-World War II stories that comprise the mentalities of most cultures of ordinary men, impacted by others perceived as former enemies and perhaps future enemies, with darkening clouds of war on the horizon. Seen at the Stony Brook Film Festival, the film was greeted with enthusiasm. Well written and cleverly released. The characters were more believable and attracted one to experience their trials and tribulations.
