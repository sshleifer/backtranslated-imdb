It's not really about wine. No, the real targets of Nossiter are those that simplify and assimilate the peculiarities of local production (wine) for commercial purposes. To this end, he made an excellent film goal. Independent, witty, emotional, and imperfect wine producers are juxtaposed with Amerindian, anodyne, and European mediated media: the art of winemaking versus the production of laboratory-based, market-oriented products. It is an open program that does not lead to conclusion. <br /> <br /> Nossiter's film is sometimes infuriating to watch - cameras are not hidden, nor steadicam, by any means. There are also many subtitles as well as subtitles to go through, often a very short time on the screen. <br /> <br /> However, he beats Michael Moore in the game that Moore can not play anyway. The characters speak for - and therefore condemn themselves. Worth seeing 7/10
