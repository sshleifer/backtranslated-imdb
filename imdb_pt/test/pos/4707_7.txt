I would give this movie a good and strong 7. Although it definitely is not the best film, or even one of the best films of the type (The Killing Fields is better) it at least tries to tell a necessary story. <BR> <BR> <BR> I think the method of introducing Laura into Burma was somewhat fabricated. First of all, Burma is not exactly the easiest country to visit, especially in the late 1980s. Secondly, if you do, your passport would not get lost. A sane person would make sure they knew where their passport was at all times. With that in mind, I'm sure the writer knew he was weak, but he needed something. Patricia Arquette's performance was underestimated and I just did not realize she was a doctor. However, at least she did not abuse the role, which usually happens in movies like that. U Aung Ko was good but also discreet. The ending is difficult to follow, since most of the dialogue is in Burmese, with people translating for Laura. It would have been difficult for Laura and also difficult for the viewer. Another advantage is the strong Southeast Asian scenery in the film, which was nice to see.
