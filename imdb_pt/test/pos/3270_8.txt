Jimmy (Heath Ledger) is given a simple job by Pando (Bryan Brown), a underworld boss to hand money to a certain address, but when no one answers the door Jimmy decides to take a swim on the beach to spend some time, but he notices that his clothes on the sand were messed up and the 10,000 are gone. Jimmy calls Pando to tell him the problem, but he will not listen. Pando and his boys try their best to track down Jimmy, which means there is no Jimmy anymore if they get their hands on him. So now Jimmy hides to organize a bank robbery to get Pando's money back. Also along this mess, he meets the innocently sweet Alex (Rose Byrne) and together they are on a day trip through King's in Sydney. <br /> <br /> "Two Hands" is simply a captivating pick-me-up movie that is lively, thrilling and incredibly cool. What you got here is pretty much an urban gangster movie with a decadent backdrop and in-the-face violence? What, how do you ask? Well, why take us to the underworld where the Australian culture shines with criminals wearing thongs and shorts, cars and a beer can in hand? and do not forget the Australian sense of humor, dry and sarcastic. You may say that you owe a lot to the likes of "Pulp Fiction", "Goodfellas" (one of my favorites) and "Lock, stock and two barrels of smoking" for your inspiration, but for me it is still on its own. The film has a real mix of merry moments but also a wicked dash with some unexpected clashes and dark humor that can be really disturbing. You just do not know what's to come and have a nice touch of moody irony (especially the ending) and great timing with your mood. A scene involving a bank robbery will leave you in stitches, I assure you. The outline of the plot is actually a story of coming to grow old (or on the road not taken) with an added drill love tale and then the gangster element to end it. Most of the subplots were cleverly constructed and intertwined, well, maybe it could have been without the supernatural element involving Jimmy's dead brother, but in the overall context, the diverse plot seems to all click together. Intense, natural and crisp dialogues filled the outrageously colorful script with swift slang / Australian accents - I'm just dinkum! <br /> <br /> What really made the film was the performance of Bryan Brown in Pando. He just gave his character such a charismatic personality that when he was not on the screen, his presence was still felt. He gave his character two sides - one being an idiot, but the other side is such a good guy. A young Rose Byrne shines with her nervously sweet / quirky character Alex. She looked radiantly beautiful and added a bubbly personality. So you have Heath Ledger that fits you is the naive Jimmy. Great support cast involved with the likes of Susie Porter, Tom Long, David Field, Steve Vidler and Steve Le Marquand. These crude performances are achieved and from there you get engaging, fun and believable characters. The pulsating rock soundtrack that explodes with the likes of Powderfinger and Alex Lloyd provides a cool vibe. Also being filmed on location at King's in Sydney, it really helped to stand out, maintaining a life of its own and showing the Australian way of life. Sliding camera tricks captured the city's scenery in a superb way, especially the hectic nightlife. This was a movie that, when it was finished, I was totally satisfied with what I received. Overall, a police thriller that achieves what it was meant to do ... a fun, smart, crazy roller coaster of excitement and excitement. <br /> <br /> I say, it's a successful Australian approach to "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" by director / screenwriter Gregor Jordan in his debut film. If you come across this, do not hesitate to give it a try.
