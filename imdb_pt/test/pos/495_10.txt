Blade is probably one of the best vampire / action movies of all time. Has everything: action, horror, blood.This movie is for action fans. It's either you like it a lot or you hate it and if you hate it, it means you do not like action movies or vampires. Wesley snipes takes his role seriously and he's the perfect guy for the blade
