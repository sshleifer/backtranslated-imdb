This film is completely underestimated. <br /> <br /> It's a movie similar to Will Keenan and Patrick Hasson, as well as Adrien Brody's Restaurant and the classic movie Breaking Away, which are about young adults who are stuck and know They're stuck, with little or no chance to break free. Death By Pizza (Delivered) is about an intelligent, thought-free, artistic young adult (Will, played by David Strictland) who is stuck and waiting, bitter to the world's hypocrisy and bitter to his own lack of direction and desire. Will knows his enemy, Reed (Ron Eldard), another clever young adult who is so bitter that he has chosen the path of crime. Both end up helping each other to free themselves from their bitterness, which allows them to free themselves. <br /> <br /> For these young adults, unleashing, or releasing, may mean advancing in life, and Will's life is replete with the trademarks of a young adult " prisoner ": a job that sucks the soul, sweaty, poorly paid, raw clients, an ex-girlfriend who left him because he was unmotivated, a partial university education without any degree, a house full of art of its own, and of course, the new friend whose unholy choices help him to save himself.
