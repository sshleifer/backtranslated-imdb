This movie is great - especially if you like the visual arts. The scenery the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful. The story is also both funny and poignant. <br /> <br /> People who like European films and "art films" will like this movie. This really is an art film - it really has a lot of art in it. Go and rent it. <br /> <br />
