I've watched this movie twice at the Transylvania International Film Festival (TIFF), the film is in competition and I really hope that Esteban Sapir will receive one of the awards (at least the best picture award). <br /> <br /> As a fan of silent movies, I'm interested in contemporary films that cite or recreate the language of cinema the year before. The previous reviewer emphasized the quotes of Fritz Lang and Fr. W. Murnau. In my view, the film makes direct reference to Lang's metropolis and to the allegorical-parabolic character of its plots. But I did not see Murnau in it. There is a more obvious homage to Melies: the Moon with a human face (cigarette smoker) and the painted mountains and cityscapes. I liked the film mainly because of its visuals, and in the meantime I found the story about dumbness and the creative means of communication used by the voiceless city dwellers very interesting. In this perspective, this film is a unique reflection on the silence of the silent movies, because in the films of the silent period hardly are histories with mute personages. In this case, one might question whether the story about the stolen voices was the motivation for the silent film form, or whether there is an intention to play with the dumb silent movies. Another example of this kind of reflection I found in Guy Maddin's Careful, where the inhabitants of a mountain village have restrictions on using their voices. I plan to write an article on this, if you know movies related to this topic, please let me know !!! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Esteban Sapir's movie to all the viewers (one of the critics called: the festival jewel). <br /> <br /> PS: The winners were announced, and the film won the award for best cinematography!
