Especially after watching MATRIX RELOADED !! * After seeing the Matrix with all its ridiculous fanciful characters with its super powers, it was great to see an action movie with real people in real-life situations! I cared about these people, and even though some of the action scenes seemed a little too much, it still made me feel like "it's possible" verses "that stupid video game" (like the Matrix) <br /> <br /> film is not a brain surgery, it's very simple. Some things are predictable - like knowing that someone is going to be a back-stabber and that someone in the beginning is going to die. Quite obvious, but, WHY? The first 15 minutes establish our reason, our motive, our main objective. <br /> <br /> I like that Theron and Walhberg have no catch scene. I'm glad they did not go there. They kept it about funny dialogs ESPECIALLY SETH GREENE. This guy IS FUNNY! <br /> <br /> This is a movie that I would buy when it was released on DVD. It's fun, fast and fun. The only thing (and I think it's a great thing) is that we're really rooting for the bad guys. This pro-gang group is already on the wrong side of the law. Not a good message for children - parents, please explain this to them. <br /> <br />
