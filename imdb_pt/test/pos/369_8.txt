I was lucky enough for this movie to come on TCM, so I had the opportunity to see it. It's hard to find, though it's a Hitchcock classic. Unfortunately, it also has its shortcomings, some of which Hitchcock repeated later. Firstly, the ending is a little tidy and "perfect." In the last scenes, up to the last five minutes, there is an impressive amount of tension; so the five minutes simply clean everything perfectly ... very unsatisfactory. The ending is also too dramatic for a Hitchcock movie. He is, has been, and will always be the master of suspense ... why would he bow to something as low as a cheap action sequence to the end? Besides the few flaws, the movie is great. The plot is excellent; one of the best and most universal ever. The theme? Simple. You know a stranger. A perfect stranger. He offers to kill someone for you ... you know there's someone you want (if nothing else, subconsciously) is dead. The footprint? He asks you to do the same for him ... will you accept this bizarre and ingenious arrangement? You are clear of suspicion, and so is he ... after all, none of you knew the victim. And you also do not know yourself ... you're just "unknown on a train". Brilliant concept, and that almost all people can relate to. The pace is good, you never lose interest or patience. Cinematography is good, but not as good as in other better Hitchcock films. The acting is impeccable. The characters are well written, reliable and realistic. Hitchcock uses some of the same elements he uses; the dominant mother, the mother's boy, etc. The film is very good but seems a little diluted. It was not the famous extra mile that would make it great. He stopped before crossing the line between what is common and what is bold. That is the main reason the film is not great, but mostly it remains good, with potential to be more than that. The end leaves you dissatisfied and disappointed. However, everything that leads to the end is very good, so the film still deserves 8/10. Good, but not great. Any fan of Hitchcock should see it, as it's among the best ... a little below the list, but it's still there. I recommend it to any fan of Hitchcock. 8/10
