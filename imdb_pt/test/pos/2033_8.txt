I must admit I was not expecting much in this movie. I was surprised that I really enjoyed it as much as I did. The script was not Oscar material, but neither was it horrible. The performance was great by Mark Wahlberg. Jennifer Aniston had a great supporting role and she looked beautiful as ever. What made this movie for me was the song. If you do not like glam metal or 80's hair bands then you probably will not like this movie. It's all about being a rockstar. Some clich√©s were present but did not bring down the film. I would recommend it to anyone who likes rock and roll and remember to get up and scream !!! 8 out of 10 for great acting and amazing music. Jason
