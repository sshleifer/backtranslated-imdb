An extremely entertaining version of Rona Jaffe's best selling boiler pot on the trials and tribulations (and, of course, the loves) of a group of women involved in one way or another in the New York publishing business. Directed by Jean Negulesco, quite recent from the success of "Three Coins in the Fountain", and the prototype for the likes of "Sex and the City" except that here all sex happens off screen. The bright young female talents of the day (Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Suzy Parker and Martha Hyer) are all well fused, while Joan Crawford appears as the Queen Bitch of a publisher who could probably eat Miranda Priestly from Meryl Streep and spit it out; with absolutely no effort, she steals the movie. The men include Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan, Robert Evans (before deciding wisely to go after the cameras) and Brian Aherne. There's more foam on display than you'll find in your average laundry room, but if, like me, you like "Desperate Housewives", not to mention Carrie Bradshaw and company, then you'll probably love it. A very guilty pleasure.
