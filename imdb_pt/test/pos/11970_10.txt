I can not believe people are giving negative reviews about this movie! I wonder why ...... maybe because of the book ..... I have to admit, he does not really follow the book ... for sure ... Dean Koontz's book is much better .. but the movie is good too !!! has the suspense ... the acting is good ... especially michael ironside, who gave a superb performance in this movie !!! <br /> <br /> Come on a sweetheart ... give this movie a chance. ... there are still many more movies worse than this ... as the sum of all fears ... ghosts ... the vinci code ... this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... really boring compared to the observers who really have great elements in the movie ... this movie contains great suspense and action non-stop !!! I'm looking for this movie ... but it's very hard to find on DVD ... <br /> <br /> In the way ... I really recommended this movie to everyone ... watch it! !!! you will never regret !!! <br /> <br /> 10/10 *
