"Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Wolves" is the same type of animation and the same creators of "Chicken run", but the story is now another: Wallace, an inventor who loves cheese and his Gromit intelligent dog, who is always helping Wallace with his problems, is trying to keep rabbits away from everyone's vegetables, since there is an annual competition of giant vegetables in his city. But when Wallace tries an invention he made, to make the rabbits avoid vegetables, the one who's going to be cursed is him. Before watching this movie I did not know that these two characters already existed and were famous. I loved Gromit, and I think he's one of the coolest dogs I've ever seen.
