I can not understand why so many people did not like this movie. Robert De Niro was at the top of his game, delivering his lines with such resourcefulness, you must believe that this is his daily behavior. Granted, the film seemed to have many conventions of friends while trying to make fun of the concept, needless to say that this movie was genuinely funny. From the police dog, to the fact that Eddie Murphy did not bother me, this movie is a true guardian. Rene Russo also equaled the rest of the cast to perfection, setting his role so he would not interfere in the relationship between De Niro and Murphy.
