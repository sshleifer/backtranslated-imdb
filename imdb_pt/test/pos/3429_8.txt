... and this film easily surpassed my expectations. The fact that it was written and directed by Peter Dalle led me to believe that I was in style with other films that I am used to (and bored) to see him enter. Anyway, I was grudgingly watching this movie and that I'm happy for. This material has humor and depth. 9 out of 10. See!
