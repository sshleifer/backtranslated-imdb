Famous and mysterious recluse Raymar, who is some sort of deadly telekinetic psychic vampire, dies abruptly under bizarre circumstances. The beautiful student Julie Wells (a warm and friendly performance of the lovely Meg Tilly) desperately wants to be accepted by the sisters' snobbish (played with sublime and malicious perfection by Leslie Speights, Robin Evans and the ever-friendly Elizabeth Daily), then she agrees to spend a night in a scary mausoleum where Raymar's body was buried as part of a rite of initiation. Of course, Raymar still has his extraordinary powers, so it's going to be a very long and distressing night of pure stressful terror for poor Julie. Director / co-writer Tom McLoughlin (who later gave us the fun play "Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives") avoids shouting in favor of creating a dark and ominous atmosphere, but not manages to take away this particular feat because the first hour is too slow, talkative and hassle-free to be remotely scary or suspenseful. However, I still find this imperfect horror film strangely appealing and entertaining. The large poofy hairstyles, a montage sequence of goofy music, falsely timed scares (including the omnipresent hand in the shoulder gag!), A scene in a gleaming video arcade, children happily smoking marijuana and the hilarious idiot teenage slang "). brain "!) gives this photo a period charm of a certain charm from the 80's. Hal Trussell's beautiful and refined cinematography (I particularly dug Steadicam accompanying photos), the brilliant and fun soundtrack of Bob Summers, and Tom Burman's splendidly macabre farce are perfect.The always impassive Adam West of TV's "Batman" fame occupies only space in a secondary part nothing.The mausoleum makes an impressively vast and disturbing main place.The grand finale with a lot of horribly rotting corpses coming out of their coffins and floating about qualifies as a wonderfully macabre piece of shock. Of course, this baby is definitely not an unfairly nested jewel, but still offers a lot of playful fun and fun.
