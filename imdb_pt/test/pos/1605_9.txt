From the first to the last scene of the film, director Visconti stands out in his art, in that the film is guaranteed to remain as a cultural treasure for God only knows how long. It's perfection - like a movie, that is, but the story has some minor flaws. <br /> <br /> Thomas Mann's novel is also a perfect work of art, so of course it is impossible to bring it to other media. Visconti follows the story very well, and it is only when he allows himself to deviate slightly that the transition fails. And no matter how marvelous the scenery, the airy tension between the characters, the hundreds of subtle signs and allegories, the almost unbearably high service of Mahler's music - yet the tiny anomalies in the plot disturb me. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just a victim of man's desire to have flaws in perfection. However, I will offer an example, which I consider crucial. <br /> <br /> WARNING: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In Mann's story, Aschenbach eats the strawberries that probably contain the disease that will kill him. , after giving up his frustrated pursuit of the boy Tadzio in Venice. Unable to take a treat, he settle for another - which poisons him. It's very subtle in the book, but it's there. The forbidden fruit, in a way, but a sign that he renounces his own life. <br /> <br /> In Visconti's film, he also eats strawberries, but in a rather insignificant scene on the beach. The persecution in Venice ends in a much more melodramatic way. It works, too, but it lacks some subtlety, in fact, and also the multilayered symbolism, giving food for thought. <br /> <br /> But this is all forgiven, when the film allows us to feast on beautiful scenery, faces and constellations, and certainly like many other symbols that we can digest - the last gesture of Tadzio, standing in the water , the ending being equally sublime and mysterious.
