Obsessed!!!!! I have all the seasons of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because of how clever the script is, it's not your normal comedy show, there's no pause after a joke that just continues, if you missed miss And it's not like a soap opera drama, because it does not use dramatic music and the actors never have that stupid look of surprise. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the best shows on TV shows of their time. It's fun because they talk so fast you can not have it all the first time it's good to come back and laugh at the other jokes. Also they have so many references, it's amazing how clever it is. <br /> <br /> And you can relate to the characters is also so real and there the actors are superb, from the witty Lorelai to the hermit Luke, to the immature Kirk. show is simply amazing. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time and spend some time with the family is definitely the show for them. There is only one word that can describe Gilmore Girls .... CLASSIC !!!!!!
