You may not be seeing the same movie if you did not grow up in France (or spent at least 10 years there, like me). I do not know if he will ever leave the French cultural borders (I include Belgium and Luxembourg here). You can not translate that kind of fun - every name is a joke (how many people out of Paris would understand the pun in "Couloirdebus", the name of one of the Roman legionnaires?). However, Monica Bel (l?) ​​Ucci is so beautiful that I almost forgot to breathe when I saw her.
