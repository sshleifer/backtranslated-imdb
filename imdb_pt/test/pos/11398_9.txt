Boogie Nights is full of surprises, nothing prepares one for your soul. Yes, he has soul as he tackles the more complicated subject with a wry smile and respect. With a brilliant and marvelous development of characters, the performances somehow combine the best of stage acting with improvisation within a movie style. The plot was richer than I expected and the underlying themes are deep and deep. The "B-series" human being is brought, through the crisis, into perspective. <br /> <br /> A case study of a sociologist, the film resonates the crude truth of what we all know about self-esteem, paternal love, and lack of love. this, attention deficit / love and its manifestation in adulthood, the desperate need to belong. Something for everyone here .. almost camouflaged as untouchable issues and their separate environment, but of course they are universal. <br /> <br /> The film works on several levels. The irony is that the environment portrayed exists only because of the voyeur, who happens to watch the movie ... <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights does not judge the subject and the characters, a rarity. He deserves all the praise he has earned and more.
