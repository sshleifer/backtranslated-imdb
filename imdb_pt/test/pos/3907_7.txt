I think this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie, and I've seen most of her films. I saw this for the first time on television when I was about fourteen, and I was so scared. from time to time, and I still really like it. I know nowadays this movie is not likely to scare people very much. This only serves to show that the cinema and television public has seen a lot of explicit violence over the past 30 years. years or more. I love movies that do not show the graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you. The cast of this movie was top notch. Jess Walton, who played the sister in the story, was very good, although her part was quite small. She also played in a fantastic television thriller at the same time called "You Never See Me Again" with David Hartman. I received the biggest performance kick from Eileen Heckart as the maid. Eileen was as good as a lady with a very bad disposition. George Maharis, who represented her husband, was quite effective. This story obviously had many of the so-called plot mistakes, but I love the movie anyway. I highly recommend this movie to people who love a good thriller without graphic violence. I gave this movie a vote of seven.
