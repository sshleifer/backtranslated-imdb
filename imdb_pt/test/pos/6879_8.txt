The notorious actor of HK CATIII, Anthony Wong, is for the first time (well ... not actually once - he was a cop in the movies DAUGHTER OF DARKNESS and a few others ...) not a weird psycho in EROTIC NIGHTMARE. Generally recognized for his role as a complete wacko in such CATIII "nasties" as THE UNTOLD STORY and THE SYNDROME OF EBOLA - this time, Wong is at the end of the evil ... Wong plays a guy who goes to a sorcerer who promises to give him really good dreams, for a price. Faithful to his word, the dreams that Wong had to have ass sex with hot schoolgirls - but dreams come with a price that is more than money. The wizard can manipulate dreams and with the help of a sexy ghost, blackmails Wong of his money and deals, kills his family and eventually kills Wong himself ... Wong's brother comes to town to find out what's going on, and eventually discovers that the murder of his family is the work of the evil sorcerer - but, it seems - Wong's brother is a very addicted drug wizard, and with the help of the wizard's abused spouse - turns the table to the sorcerer and his plans. .. EROTIC NIGHTMARE is one of the nicest CATIII movies I've seen for some time. Absence is the somber, gloomy feel of some of CATIII's other entries, such as RED TO KILL, THE UNTOLD STORY or HUMAN PORK CHOP - EROTIC NIGHTMARE, although it is still despicable in terms of sex and subject matter, is more "fun" than some of the films most serious of the genre. More comparable to ETERNAL EVIL OF ASIA - a more "carefree" CATIII entry that offers plenty of nudity and a little blood, without being overly comical as well. Definitely worth a look, especially for the enthusiast of the genre. 8/10
