This is a movie that you will love or hate. I loved. If you're looking for suspense, great special effects, action, sophistication, cynicism, etc., you will not find it in this movie. It's a good, sentimental, positive, uplifting film. The heroes of the film are Coach Jones (played by Ed Harris), a man of strength and integrity, and Radio (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a mentally retarded man who finds a way to contribute to his world. I think I did not find this movie a "sentimental bullshit" as many did because it seemed very real. I know people like these. I've seen athletes who find it fun to choose the vulnerable. I have seen men of integrity defend the vulnerable. I've seen people who think high school football is a serious business. I have seen people who know what is really important in life. Any of these people could have been people I knew. I laughed; I cried. I left the film feeling good, remembering that there are people like Coach Jones and Radio in my world. If there are no people like them in yours, you might not like the movie. If you do not like a movie that shows the best side of human nature, you will hate it.
