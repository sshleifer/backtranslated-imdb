I liked the movie, but it should have been longer. The actors did a great job. Portia De Rossi is a fabulous actress and Kristoffer Polaha is a hottie. He did not look like 100% John, but he favored him from afar. I look forward to seeing more of him on the big screen. He did not have the charisma of John, but he definitely has a charm about himself. He has beautiful eyes and a big smile. It reminds me a lot of my boyfriend. Bissett was very breathless for me. She should have checked her asthma. I will not comment on the character Darryl Hannah. My mother always said, "If you can not say anything good, then shut up!" so that's what I'm going to do. Molly
