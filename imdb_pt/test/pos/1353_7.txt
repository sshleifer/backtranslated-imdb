The role of this western title is played by Robert Walker Jr. He is a young gunman who with partner David Carradine separates after making a contract with a Mexican general. While eluding his pursuers, Carradine and Walker separate. Walker arrives at the field of law man Robert Mitchum, who likes Walker and makes him a protection and recovery project. <br /> <br /> This is the first of two films that Robert Mitchum did with writer / director Burt Kennedy. . The second was the most humorous The Good Guys and the Bad Guys. <br /> <br /> Not that young Billy Young does not have moments of hilarity. But it's a tripartite story involving Walker's recovery, Mitchum's hunt for the evil that killed his son, and a romantic triangle involving Mitchum, Angie Dickinson and City Chief Jack Kelly. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of nepotism. David Carradine is John's son. Dean Martin's daughter, Deana, is in this, Walker is the son of Robert Walker and Jennifer Jones and the son of Mitchum, Chris, is the son of Mitchum in some flashbacks in silence. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum started in the western and always looks like home in them. Angie Dickinson essentially repeats the role she had in Rio Grande. Walker had a brief career playing young rebels and doing a good job. I always wondered what happened to him. He looks amazingly like his father. Maybe he did not want to come to an end as tragic as his father. <br /> <br /> And that was not enough, Mitchum fans hear the old rumored eyes singing the title song at the beginning of the film.
