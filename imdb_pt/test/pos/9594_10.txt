I have it on VHS, but it's not a great copy since I've watched it two or three times a year since 1999. I'm also afraid that 'her in the house' will throw her out on the annual VHS cleaning. <br /> <br /> My brother and I (late 30's) still laugh at the continue in this fantastic show.Tim Healys Luck Cup Hat and telling the apprentice that you can do none of this (shooting, passing etc) and it turns out to be Peter Beardsley. As a Leeds fan, do I have to laugh at the empty dossier in Bostock before the cup finale (or did he say S ** t?) The reason I got in line today was that my brother wants it for Christmas, so ITV, please bring it out on DVD. Come on to the UnderFelt Men !!
