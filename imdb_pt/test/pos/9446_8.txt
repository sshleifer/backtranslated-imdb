Ok, so I do not understand why people are getting so annoyed with this movie. So I thought it would be Amanda Bynes' movie, but it was not. It was great. <br /> <br /> Ok, okay, so the acting was not the best, but I thought the performances were still great. Also, you could say that the actors were having fun making this movie. In other films, which surprisingly won awards, where the actors did not like to work on the film, you could say. All the actors had chemistry, and that also showed. <br /> <br /> Many people are stealing the football skills that the actors have. Yes, so they are not perfect ... get over it! They are actors, not football players. I've been playing football my whole life and, believe me, it's hard to learn, so stop cutting the level of skills they have. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie would be stupid, but it was really fun. The way Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum can make a funny situation without saying anything is funny. I found myself laughing a lot in this movie. <br /> <br /> In general ... I love it!
