This one hour and 30 minute internal joke is best understood by Catholics, the number one religion of self-styled comedians around the world. This is not to say that he is not able to do what he does, that the film is not free from flaws, which happened. Technical issues mainly: I believe that in 1998, digital was the answer when in fact it was crawling - a beta of a Beta if you will, and re-mastering will never improve it. For God's sake, Hal ... please get a Red One. Or three. <br /> <br /> If you like Hartley movies, of course you will like it. I liked it because I liked Grim / Fool, and there were additional benefits of hindsight: I could not help noticing a disturbing self-prophecy, a plane flying overhead, used as a harbinger of Armageddon in this 1998 film. Cheney had gotten the whole idea from Hal. It's true - Hartley moves his players to the camera as if it were the House of Commons, just a piece of the artifice that needs a break. After all, we are already paying attention to the actors and the writing is alive. Not great to write, but ... fervent. Can I use the fervent word? Intentional, intelligent, non-condescending. <br /> <br /> I absolutely love PJ Harvey in this course, I would love her anywhere. Strangely, if Helen Mirren needs a younger self, she should look for Harvey and bring a bottle of laurel.
