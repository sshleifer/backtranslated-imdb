I was surprised at how emotionally invested I became in this movie. Peter Boyle is a tour de force as the socially conservative fanatic of the working class, Joe. I actually sympathized with some of your complaints. Of course, he does not mention the historical socio-economic reasons underlying many of his prejudices. The film also provides insightful information about the rapid change that American society was going through at the moment. Recreational drugs, casual sex, and the challenge of parental authority have become fashionable and have replaced the traditions most respected for respect for God, country, and antiquity. Susan Sarandon fans will be thrilled. Joe is his movie debut. It also gives viewers a visual treatment near the beginning of the film. Recommended, 8/10.
