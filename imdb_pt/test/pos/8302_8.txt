This is a real gem of sci-fi farce! Peter Cushing adds a great personality to this midnite movie classic. <br /> <br /> I particularly like sound design. The strange, agitated voices of the creatures and creatures of the rhinos provide a bizarre background (of course, the baby does not mean too much!) <br /> <br />
