In terms of history, this is not among the best or most cleverly written films of Columbus, but the film is extremely well done, with excellent direction and really excellent acting. <br /> <br /> Especially the acting in this film attracts attention. Director Nicholas Colasanto did a great job with the actors in the film. Perfectly, he allowed Peter Falk and John Cassavetes to have plenty of room to play, as both are being credited here as uncredited directors of the film. It should be part of your driving style to allow the actors this space. Works great for this movie. Maybe he did it because Colasanto himself also used to work as an actor. He is perhaps best known for playing the role of coach in the hit series "Cheers," from the beginning in 1982 until his death in 1985. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk looks better than ever in his role as the Lieutenant Colonel Columbo. Also the veteran actor John Cassavetes does a great job, since the film is his assassin and is a good combination for the lieutenant. Beside them, the film also features Myrna Loy. A great star of the silent movie era and also Pat Morita, in a small starring role. <br /> <br /> But not only the direction of acting within the film is really good. Visually and technically it's also a really great movie, with long slow takes, without the use of any cuts. Also, obviously, the reason why this movie is more than most of the Columbus films. It really takes time to set things up and tell your story. The film also features some types of artistic and experimental scenes. Of course, everyone really fits in the seventies. But, as I said before, that's not among the best of Columbus's films. Also the clues left for the lieutenant are a bit obvious this time around. This makes the killer look a bit stupid, as if he did not think his plan was good enough, while the character is obviously an intelligent man. Columbus this time also tries to irritate the suspect and other characters a bit more than he usually tries to do in order to solve the crime. This and Peter Falk's different acting approach are one reason why his character may look different than he does in other Columbus films. But different does not mean worse in this case. <br /> <br /> The film also features a good soundtrack to Richard DeBenedictis, who afterwards became the constant composer of the Columbo films. <br /> <br /> A great movie from Columbus to watch! <br /> <br /> 8/10
