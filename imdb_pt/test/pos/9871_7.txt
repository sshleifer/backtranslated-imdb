I bought this in the budget department last week. I've already had Halloween and Halloween II, and since I plan to collect all the horror movies ever, I chose this. after all, the first two were good. <br /> <br /> This movie is too clever to tell the truth. seems to create the right atmosphere, and has a good "michael myers story". he uses the old sites of the original, and the main character is the boy laurie walked with babysat on that fateful halloween in 1978 ... The climax is also quite satisfying. anyway, it's way better than H20, which, frankly, sucks.
