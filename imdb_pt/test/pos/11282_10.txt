This is not a story. It's a lot of psychic needles reaching your subconscious. If you wait for a story, you'll be bored. But if you surrender, you'll be in the dream world in 10 minutes. The vague but disturbing images of pain and torture in a desolate landscape open space for his own fantasies. The strange soundtrack that gives you the feeling of isolation, the visual echoes of Christ's crucifixion, pulsating light and deep dark shadows all reach your subconscious to fill this mental space. I found myself shaking and unable to escape in front of my television. It was like dreaming with wide eyes. A strange nightmare, a bad trip, a religious experience ... touched me deeply and marked me to live. It freed my mind and gave me one of those rare experiences of loss of personality and merging with the world of archetypes. A little freedom for the soul. A violent freedom however .... Not a good movie, but a very strong and unforgettable. Literally my text has no spoilers. For me, the big surprise of this movie was its unbelievable intensity, and describing it can be understood as a spoiler. The less you know about this movie while watching, the better.
