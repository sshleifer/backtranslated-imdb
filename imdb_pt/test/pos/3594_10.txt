What I liked the most about this film was the Corfu scene, being Greek I love my country and I liked the flattering director's point of view. Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to survive alone in the war, Nazis and difficulties. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love, but times are hard and they have many sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage, who is fine in a uniform, makes a passionate account of this unfulfilled love (in the beginning). I loved Christian Bale playing Mandras as the heroine's future husband, he looks pretty good as a Greek, his personality matched that of the Greek patriot! A real fighter there, or what! One of the movies I would like to buy and keep it in my collection ... forever!
