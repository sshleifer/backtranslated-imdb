Going beyond words is a divorce story that results in a tragic battle for the custody of a seven-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> One of Kramer v. Kramer's greatest strengths is writing director Robert Benton, who beautifully adapted Avery Corman's novel to the big screen. He keeps things beautifully simple and more realistic while delivering all the drama straight from the heart. His talent for telling emotional tales like this was to prove himself again with "Places in the Heart," where he showed, as in "Kramer v. Kramer," that he has a natural ability to work with children. <br /> <The other strong point of the photo is the splendid performance that deservedly received four of the nine Oscar nominations, two of which are winning. One of them was Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor) who is superb as the frustrated business man Ted Kramer, a man who forgot that his wife is a person. As wife Joanne said, Meryl Streep claimed the supporting actress Oscar for a strong and sensitive portrait of a woman who was lost in eight years of marriage. It was also named Jane Alexander in turn fantastic as the good friend of Kramer, Margaret. The final word on the action charts should go to young Justin Henry, whose incredibly thrilling performance will make you stifle the tears again and again, and a well-deserved Oscar nomination came his way. <br /> <br /> Bright is also Nestor Almendros' cinematography and timely editing of Jerry Greenberg, while classical music by Henry Purcell is used for effect. <br /> <br /> Truly this is a touching story of how a father and son come to depend on one another when their wife and mother leaves. They grow up together, know each other and form an entirely new and wonderful relationship. Ted encounters new responsibilities and a new vision of life, and slowly realizes why Joanne had to go. <br /> <br /> Certainly, nothing more, "Kramer v. Kramer" demonstrates that no one wins when it comes to a battle for the custody of a small child, especially the child itself. <br /> <br /> Saturday, June 10, 1995 - TV <br /> <br /> A strong drama from Avery Corman's novel about a child's hurt. battle of custody between separated parents who feel they have the best interests of the child at heart. In addition to a superb script and surprisingly controlled direction, both by Robert Benton, is the superlative cast that makes this photo a winner. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is brilliant as Ted Kramer, the man torn between his career and the son he desperately wants to keep. Excellent also is Streep as the woman lost in eight years of marriage who had to leave before she disappeared as a person. In support of these two is a very strong Jane Alexander as friend in common Margaret, an excellent Justin Henry as the boy stuck in the middle, and a top cast of extras. <br /> <br /> This highly emotional, heartbreaking drama more than deserved is the 1979 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor (Hoffman) and Best Supporting Actress (Streep). <br /> <br /> Wednesday, February 28, 1996 - TV
