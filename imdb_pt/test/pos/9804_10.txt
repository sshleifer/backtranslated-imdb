I'm surprised that so many viewers did not find all the symbolism in the movie ..... that's what made the film an incredible work of art! The story deals with some of the saddest content a movie may have, but it's one of the best movies I've ever seen because of the need for your own imagination and the brilliance in the story. <br /> <br /> If you pay close attention, the message is there. The younger brother is killed by his stepfather. The older brother invented the story about the flying car as a way to deal with the pain of his brother's death. There are those who argue why he would lie to his own children with the story. For me, the answer is because he does not want to share so much ugliness with his own children, or that he blocked and replaced his memory of the horrible event with the thought of his brother fleeing to safety. I read some of the comments that believe that he was only child and that he created the younger brother as an escape to deal with the abuse he suffered. Although this is an interesting idea - I love the imagination used to get to it. I do not think he would have lied to his own kids about having a little brother. But I think it's plausible that he lied about his brother's death. However, I like this idea of ​​a much better end than the notion that the film had no symbolism. <br /> <br /> There are many different takes you can have in the movie, but if you bring the film value facial ..... two brothers creating a wagon that flies to escape an abusive stepfather - you lost the glow . The fact that I could see the subtle messages in the script was what made the movie so incredible to me. It requires your own thought process and your own imagination to make it work ... dig deep when you watch. You'll be amazed at the genius contained in the movie. The only other film I've seen so close to this in symbolism and subtle messages is Pleasantville ..... but that's a commentary for another movie!
