I really enjoyed this short, even as a fan of Toronto Maple Leafs. <br /> <br /> Director Sheldon Cohen and the narrator Roch Carrier perfectly captured all the boy's emotions. From the feelings he felt for his hero, Maurice "Rocket" Richard, for the excitement, anticipation and hope of getting a new Montreal Canadiens sweater soon, with a look of horror on his face as he took off his mother's sweater; A Toronto Maple Leafs blouse was invaluable and the shame of having to wear this terrible (in your eyes) blue and white Toronto Maple Leafs sweater; Not the rouge, bleu and blanc of the Montreal Canadiens with Richard's number nine, like his old sweater. Worst of all, his mother made him wear this Maple Leafs sweater out of the house. You could imagine and anticipate the ridicule he would get from his friends when he hit the ice wearing that sweater before he got there. <br /> <br /> I was laughing all the time and this is one of the best animated shorts I've seen. <br /> <br />
