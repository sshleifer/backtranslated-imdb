When you think of golf movies, you think of Caddyshack, but what if there are kids around? Go straight to this movie! Disney uses a proven formula to make a movie that adults and children will enjoy. The acting in this film, in my opinion, is very good and the main cast, for the most part, is very young! This film is also extremely filmed very well and unique, seeing all angles of the game of golf. I think this movie should be ready for some academic awards for movie editing or something, because the whole flow of the movie is top notch. Although the ending may be a little predictable, the movie does well on its own! It also shows that you do not need swearing, nudity or violence to make a great golf movie!
