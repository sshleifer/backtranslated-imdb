Cinematography is the brilliant feature of the film. Park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes behind a camera. Each scene is filled with vibrant colors that pop off the screen. Each frame in the film seems to tell a story on its own. I hope there is a Blu-ray release of this film because it will be fantastic. It is quite intriguing to see what elements of vampire Park's mythology used for your vision. Sang-hyeon has to drink blood to survive and look impeccable, has incredible strength and is vulnerable to sunlight. It does not have, however, prey and also has a reflection in the mirror. <br /> <br /> Although I have never seen the movie, I could not help but feel that this was the version of Chan-wook Park. of twilight. The whole middle part of the film is devoted to the love of Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo for each other. It looked like the adult version of Twilight, actually. There's a lot of blood, nudity, sex, and even a few obscenities thrown in for good measure. Maybe it's the Chan-Wook Park fanboy in me, but I honestly feel I can guarantee that this is the best movie of the two. The psychological aspect that I love in Park's previous films is also in HQ. This is an important factor for me, since any movie that makes me think or is unusual somehow ends up becoming a fan favorite. The soundtracks of Park's films always seem to fit into their respective film as a glove. Thirst is no exception. Although the soundtrack is a bit more subtle this time, it fits into the overall atmosphere of the movie without much effort. <br /> <br /> The central part of the movie seems to drag on more than the rest of the movie. It's strange, since the scenes during this time are crucial to the plot of the film and it's hard to imagine the Headquarters being the same film if any of these scenes were cut. However, it is my only detail of the film. Chan-wook Park bites vampire mythology with Thirst and puts his own obscure, psychological twist on her. Park's films always seem to have a specific formula or include most of the following: good writing, beautiful cinematography, a solid cast, some kind of psychological twist that will tinker with your head and a memorable ending. Headquarters surrender on all fronts and hopefully get more of the attention you deserved during your theatrical presentation on DVD (and eventually Blu-ray, I hope).
