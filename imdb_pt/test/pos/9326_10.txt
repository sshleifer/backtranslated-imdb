michael jackson is the greatest singer and the greatest dancer who has ever lived and this movie proves this. It's brilliant to watch and the dance is fantastic. when Michael transforms into a werewolf is a little in the part of your seat the first time you watch. and Vincent's rap pricing increases fear when all zombies rise from their graves. If you like this, then I suggest you buy 'Making Michael Jackson Thriller', which has the film then performing it afterwards. the creation shows an unbelievable performance of Michael's 'Billie Jean', which was when he first made the moonwalk television for the first time. Watch.
