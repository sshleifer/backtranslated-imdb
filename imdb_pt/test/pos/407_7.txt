Red Skelton plays a radio detective known as "The Fox" in "Whistling in the Dark", also starring Ann Rutherford, Conrad Veidt, Eva Arden, Virgina Gray and Ragland Ragland. Wally Benton, also known as "The Fox", thinks his plans to marry his fiancé, Carol (Rutherford), are frustrated when he is kidnapped by a cult farce leader (Veidt). Joseph Jones (Veidt) has just learned that his cult, The Silver Haven, is not receiving a promised inheritance because of the existence of the old woman's nephew, who will live on interest. He wants Wally to plan a perfect murder plot so the man can be killed on the plane on the way to meet his lawyer. For backup, and because he's not sure who Wally's fiancé is, Jones kidnaps Carol and also the daughter of the radio sponsor (Gray). <br /> <br /> This, for me anyway, is a top movie for the second entry. this series, "Whistling in Dixie". The plot is better, the cast is better, there's less clowning and less cheesy jokes. Skelton, when he is not grimacing and rolling his eyes, is very kind, and Rutherford is very good. Veidt has always interpreted these evil men to perfection. Eve Arden is Wally's agent, who arranges a date for him and Gray to make sure his contract is renewed. I had only seen Gray in movies from the 1950s onwards. She was always a pretty woman, but who knew she was a knockout in the 30s and 40s? This is a fun movie with a cool cast.
