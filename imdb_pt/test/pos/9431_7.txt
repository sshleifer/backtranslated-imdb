It's not a bad entry in the series, heavily flanked by war propaganda, but the sincerity of Rathbone & Bruce keeps me happy. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic story from start to finish, how many McGuffin's are there? Holmes (and Moriarty, regardless) wrapping the Dancing Men code that was not coded so fast was Amazing Watson - so why were not you impressed! The post explaining that the bomber / scout tickled me was just the kind of cheap trick Universal would use - again reminding me that they did not expect people to be watching it critically over 60 years later. This (and I think all other Universal potboiler in this period) were meant to be seen once or twice and forgotten. They might have realized that basically people do not change, that what was fun for ordinary people in 1942 would still entertain a select group now (2005) and tight on the script and the sets! Lionel Atwill was going through his rape case in Hollywood about this time, I wonder if this was a particularly effective makeup that made him look as dejected as Moriarty? <br /> <br /> The important thing about SW is that this was the first Holmes film directed by Roy William Neill, I think he directed all the rest and produced all but one, thus establishing a wonderful continuity environment.
