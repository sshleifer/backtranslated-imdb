It's been years since I've had the privilege of watching this movie on TV. I just wish I could contact someone to see you again. I married a man with three children and two with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. I did not realize this, but seeing this movie helped me to understand more about their problems and more about how I can love them and help them overcome their difficulties. My stepchild is now thirty-five years old, and I thank the Lord that he flourished wonderfully, but he still has many affections after being born to an alcoholic mother. We talk every month to rehabilitation patients with alcohol and drug dependence and this sharing really made monumental changes in their behaviors and efforts to start a new life not addicted to drugs and alcohol. Please, please let me know how can I get a VHS or DVD copy of this movie or when will they show the movie again on TV. If you're not in those shoes, you'll probably never understand their value. Thank you.
