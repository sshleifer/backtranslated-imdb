Art imitates life imitates art. Atticus Finch is reincarnated in the D.A. in this tragic and suspenseful documentary that touches more like who did and how it happened. The authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of individuals make this a compelling story in many layers. Although racism is one of the themes, there are other elements such as work ethic, integrity and dealing with sadness that have drawn me back to see and review this movie several times. The music is driving, but not intrusive; the rhythm and the visual are such that there is no doubt about the fact that these people are real and have an authentic experience.
