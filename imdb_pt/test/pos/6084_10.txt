I do not go to a generalization and I say that it is the best love story of all time, as some have already said. Okay, people feel very deep about this movie, you love it I believe ... or you just hate it. I do not want to say, best of all, because that's just too "wide" for me to make a statement like that. However, I feel very much in love with The English Patient, as do millions of other people. <br /> <br /> The awards say it all. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with critics on many levels, however, those who chose this, I could not agree more. <br /> <br /> 9-Oscars. <br /> <br /> 41 wins. <br /> <br /> 37 other indications, makes this love story at the top of the group. The director, Anthony Minghella, the story that appears on the screen and as Peterman (TV Seinfeld) said: "Elaine, I just can not take my eyes off her!" In this case, I do not agree with Elaine's response. But history builds and takes the right time, necessary to make the case beautifully. Cinematography, (John Seale) won several awards as well, as it should have. I have not really paid much attention to Juliette Binoche until now. Well, not entirely true I loved her performance in "Sabrina" Linda's story of a somewhat complicated relationship, next to Harrison Ford. But this was simply an incredibly different character for her, and as deeply talented as she is, she simply shone in her own subtle and graceful way, she was exactly what this movie was looking for, I'm really glad that was her performance and not another actress. Ralph Fiennes, was also spectacular in portraying Count Laszlo De Almasy. I had a new respect for your ability, after seeing this! What can you say except see this photo again. (*****)
