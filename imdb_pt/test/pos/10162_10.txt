Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart) and Jo McKenna (Doris Day) travel to Morocco for a holiday where they meet a mysterious man named Louis Bernard (Daniel GÃ©lin) on a bus. The next day this man is murdered, but before he dies he tells Ben a secret; a murder will happen in London. The bandits kidnap the couple's son, Hank (Christopher Olsen), making sure Ben does not reveal his plan to anyone. Alfred Hitchcock's Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) is a very intense thriller. is excellent as it always is in the films of Hitchcok. James Stewart is wonderful.Doris Day is a charming person and actress and she manages to showcase her singing talents as well. The song Que Sera, Sera plays a major role in the film.This film is a film of many classic scenes. In the final scenes in Albert Hall, made without dialogue, you can hardly blink. This movie is fifty years old now. Time has not diminished its power in any way.
