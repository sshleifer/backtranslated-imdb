I was a student when I first watched this movie. The next day I knew that all the students our way were watching and everyone was fascinated by the movie as I was. I think the same situation has occurred in all forms of our school and throughout the Soviet Union. Later I watched it every time it was shown on TV and I want to watch more. I think the comparison with "Back to the Future" or other science fiction films is not appropriate. "Gost'ya iz budushchego" is unique in many ways, once you've watched it, you'll never forget it. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of peaceful beliefs, full of belief in the beautiful future. of our world. It is not only the film, but also a prediction of many inventions and scientific achievements. The time shown in the film is the year 1984 (year of its creation) and the year 2084 (where a student Kolya Gerasimov traveled for some time and from where her friend Alisa Seleznyova was). The year is 2005, many inventions and achievements foreseen in the film have not yet materialized. Such as "Mielophone" (a device that can read thoughts of any animal and human), expeditions to Venus and Mars (as easy as going to a picnic on the weekend), creating and launching satellites as homework for the students, easy to drive flying machines (which have completely replaced automobiles), biorh√¥s, "historical identification" of any kind of material or creature performed within minutes, and many others. Meanwhile, some of them nowadays have become much more realistic than they seemed in 1984! Just wait for 2084 :-) <br /> <br /> The film also shows typical Russian students and students (and does it of course!). With your inventiveness, curiosity, humor, daydream. Look at example in Fima Korolyov, you could find such character in almost every school form of the Soviet Union, similar character was in my form too! Alisa Seleznyova ... Myself, as many of my colleagues fell in love at first sight with her! By the way, later, an actress who played Alisa became a scientist - I think she was as influenced by the movie as the people who watched on TV. <br /> <br /> Beautiful idea, beautiful achievement, beautiful actors, beautiful music, beautiful song "Prekrasnoye Daleko" ("The Wonderful Far-Away") ... Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ... <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is that different remakes and "new versions" of the movie's music and even the movie itself were made later and spread out on TV and on the Internet. All of them are not even comparable with the original. I should not even comment them, my comment is just about the original. So order the original and enjoy!
