This film certainly was not very sophisticated. No, the humor was really very stupid now that I think about it. But even as I think about it, I laugh - proving that decent comedy does not have to be too deep. <br /> <br /> Fatty Arbuckle is the definitive star of this short, though Buster Keaton is appearing in the film. movie too. He's the butcher in an old-time grocery store. A lot of silly things happened in the store and I think I laughed more in the sequence of the coffee grinder - you just have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Anyway, later on, Fatty's girlfriend is forced to go to a girls' school and because he can not stay out, he dresses up in creeps and infiltrates school. Arbuckle is an ugly woman! So, for silly and unsophisticated fun, watch this movie. It will not change your life and it is a very light image, but it is also fun.
