The Hand of Death aka Countdown in Kung Fu (1976) is an early work greatly underestimated by director John Woo. The film is starring Dorian Tan (Tan Tao-liang) and features Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and James Tien in important supporting roles. Many people believe, or have been led to believe, by misleading propaganda, that this is a Jackie Chan movie. This is not a Jackie Chan movie, Dorian Tan is the star, but Jackie gives one of her best (most serious) performances. The Hand of Death is about a Shaolin disciple named Yunfei (Tan) who is sent on a mission to assassinate a Shaolin traitor named Shih Xiaofeng (Tien) and protect a revolutionary named Zhang Yi (Woo ). Throughout his journey, Yunfei encounters a young woodcutter named Tan (Chan) and a sword-wrestler in disgrace (Chang Chung) known as "the wanderer." Both men suffered at Shih's hands and want revenge. The three unite to defeat Shih and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety. <br /> <br /> The action of martial arts is above average under the direction of Sammo Hung. Dorian Tan uses his trademark high kicks very effectively, as the "northern styles eighteen kicks" along with some "southern five-boxing" boxing. Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan offer excellent martial arts performances as well. James Tien is not the greatest martial artist on Jade's screen, but does an acceptable job. Some of the early bouts are a bit slow and seem very choreographed, but the final clashes with Chan, Tan and Hung are very good. <br /> <br /> Director John Woo provides quite an interesting character development in the film, which is refreshing. The cinematography of Leung Wing Kat is very elegant, unique and beautiful for a kung fu movie of the time. Joseph Koo's music: a combination of soft flutes and 70s Shaft-style orchestral pieces is the best of kung fu movies. Hand of Death is not the kung fu comedy of Jackie and Sammo. Hand of Death is a serious and direct revenge story. <br /> <br /> The Hand of Death aka Countdown in Kung Fu is a classic underrated in the old school kung fu genre. The film is one of the best artistically of its time and a preview of the great things that come from Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. Hung's great choreography is exposed here before her debut as director, and Chan's charisma and talent can be clearly seen. <br /> <br /> Hand of Death is an old and elegant kung fu movie and a brilliant initial work by the legendary John Woo. Kung Fu Genre Rating 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Wanderer to Tan (referring to his new weapon): "The Little Eagle Wing God Lance". <br /> <br /> Tan: "Just a trinket".
