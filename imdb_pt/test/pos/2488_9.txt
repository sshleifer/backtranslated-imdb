Contains Spoilers This is a Peter Watkins movie. If anyone has seen their BBC masterpieces "Cullodden" and "The War Game", one will recognize the style (and their voice) within seconds after the start. Made in 1971, it is set in the very near future, when the Vietnam War intensified even more and now seems to involve China. Nixon is still president and civil disobedience and the protests are treated with violence using barrel-skin courts (apparently civilians with "ordinary citizens" as judges). Because "the prison building can not keep up," an alternative is introduced: The Park of Punishment. Delinquents can choose between severe prison sentences and a man hunting in a hostile environment, in this case a 85-kilometer trip through the California desert at 100 Â° F. If they reach an American flag at the end without being caught by the National Guard or by Riot Police, they will be released, or else they will have to keep their sentence (or be dead, as we shall see). The film is made in a completely documentary style, with three European teams covering a court and the course of two groups already sentenced. Scenes bounce between the court tent, the hunting troops and the condemned hunters. Watkin's sparse comment gives us basic information (weather, temperature, etc.). The court scenes show a Kangaroo court on one side and a wide range of personalities on the other, from real to undesirable terrorists to clearly innocent ones (for example, a total pacifist who can not even hurt flies). The defense lawyer (who takes his job seriously) has to accept abuse from both sides. What makes these scenes especially strange is their resemblance to the rhetoric of today's management to detail. Meanwhile, some unfortunate events in the desert make it clear that the "rules of the game" do not really apply. The question remains open, whether it is rigged from the start or arbitrariness by the troops because of these events that lead to the outcome (I suspect they are both). In the end, we're back to square one, with the next group heading for "Punishment Park." This description may indicate a strongly biased (or even demagogic) propaganda film, but that would be misleading. The behavior (all participants were unprofessional, as usual, with Watkins) looks and seems real (court scenes may even contain text material from contemporary real essays). I would say this could be sold as the 'real thing' with no problem. With "The Forgotten Faces" by Watkins, the reaction was "We can not send this or no one else will believe our real news (because that's indistinguishable from the real thing)." With "Punishment Park", it should be the same. Effectively banned in the US as far as I know this is a must see that it has not lost its power or its relevance (especially today).
