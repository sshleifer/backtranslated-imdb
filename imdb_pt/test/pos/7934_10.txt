Nevsky is one of the great epic war movies. Of course, others such as Birth of a Nation and Napoleon have come before, but this is so influential. The acting is stock, but who knows the first thing about Eisenstein would know that this was part of his theory of the cinema. This film, unlike many of his silent works, is about the heroic individual as much as about the group. This reflects the Stalinist philosophy that stood out in 1938. Still, his film shows us the power that can be generated by people coming together to fight against something they perceive as evil. Nevsky is just one of many men. He is the prince because he is stronger, but not because he is somehow different from the rest. The romantic angles of the film provide more of a personal story than Eisenstein had previously allowed. Not all elements work and the movie is probably a little too long, but it still resonates.
