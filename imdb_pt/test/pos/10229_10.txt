As an avid reader of Clive Barker, I really expected this movie before the release ... I did not disappoint. "Nightbreed" is a different colored horse. Rich in the underlying decadence of Western civilization and dripping with alternative existence in a way we have never seen before. Barker is at his best when he allows us to spy on his world of unprecedented horror, still showing us the other side of the coin. Here the "Monsters" are terribly beautiful beings, while humans are the deceptively ugly creatures of self-indulgence. We soon learned that we were wrong all the time. By far my favorite performance by Craig Sheffer, often underutilized, and David Cronenberg's additional bonus as "Decker" is a better cast seen after it is believed. The "Monsters" are portrayed flawlessly by a bunch of English creature masters, who also brought the "Cenobites" to life in Hellraiser, including Pinhead himself. "Nightbreed" is an absolute must see for any fan of the horror genre, and who needs just a little (Something) more from their horror story. IS IS Clive Barker at its best.
