Let me say, first of all, that I spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a skateboard before realizing I was totally uncoordinated. I always thought it was cool to see cats that know how to do extreme things, but I've never been a skater and never really followed the sport. That said, I thought this was a very informative and interesting documentary. Some critics said that these guys were waving their flag a little, but what the hell? It seems to me that these guys probably deserve as much credit as anyone for jolting the skate world and they've provided some good scenes of their innovations to back it up. It's great how viewers can see these guys both back then and now, and the footage they shot while they were teenagers growing up in California provides an interesting nostalgia that goes way beyond the sport of skating. I would never have realized where the extreme skating came from, but this kind of film unites all the pieces and gives us an informative documentary. I'm sure it's at least a bit biased, but are not they all documentaries? It is worth watching anyone interested in the sport or, as in my case, anyone who has grown up in the 70's.
