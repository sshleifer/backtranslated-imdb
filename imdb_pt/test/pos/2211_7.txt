We have a character named Evie. Evie just wants to be a good person. She is nice, friendly, smiles often, but is strangely brutally honest. Evie also has a secret. Her idiot sister has been reciting the original poetry, which leaves the community excited about her sister's writing. Unfortunately, it's Evie's poetry. While her mother starts to be happy again and the kid in the neighborhood shows her interest in Evie, Evie just tries to figure out what she really wants to do. <br /> <br /> What to keep in mind while watching this movie is who Evie really is. For a person so brutally honest that he does not mind telling Ivy League guys she does not respect them, it would be strange if she could make a lie. For someone so happy and cheerful, she is completely emotionless when it comes to certain issues. These are not character flaws, they are plot developments, and they mean much more than they seem at first glance. <br /> <br /> Mostly, it is a melodrama: a mind character, the personalities of the other characters. propel them through drama as relationships are held at risk. But in terms of writing it is very fresh and bold. The acting helps to write very well (maybe the dumbest sister could have been played better), and it's a real joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Direction and cinematography are not so good. . They are acceptable, and the world of Evie is adorned with colors and lights, which makes some images very beautiful, but it is not very consistent. It's not really so much a flaw as a result of a low production value, but within that same value there is a genuine narrative and a real care with the characters. So while it's not a perfect movie, it's certainly a nice movie. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
