A formidable, fast-paced comedy / drama / farce, like a ball-to-mouth game against the 1939 implosion of France. Played with the intensity of wide-eyed, direct by a talented and chockablock cast with action, satire, social commentary and details from the authentic period, slick brillantined hairstyles and hairstyles marked for a fleet of Citroen Tractions, a shocking and brief soundtrack , but credible imitations of Charles de Gaulle and Marshal Petain. <br /> <br /> It is simply one of the best entertainment recently shown onscreen, devoid of conceit and "message." If the movies were trains (and there is a creative recreation of a trip on a steam train that works although there is no steam locomotive - an expensive accessory, no doubt), this would be a TGV.
