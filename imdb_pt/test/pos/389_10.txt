It would be expected that Hitchcock's return to the big film studio to err on the side of punished caution. Certainly few expected his rampant, rampant film, a gay melange of vicious black comedy, thrilling suspense, mocking manipulation, and surprising fantasy flights. But that's precisely what they got: STRANGE ON A TRAIN. <br /> <br /> What is remarkable is how much the transgression of Bruno disturbs the world of the film. Much has been made of the masterly cross-cutting motif, but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress that Guy is making of his life and therefore the society he represents or is eager to attend. Guy is the archetypal American, the working-class boy who did well, moving in influential, athletic, successful, handsome circles. Bruno is his destructive, gay, decadent, "European" opposite (he lives off of his father, in a Big House, and only dreams of murder). Bruno's life is repeating, circular, as Guy moves on. It is Bruno's conquest to move Guy into his kingdom (represented by the carousel) and force him to transgress (breaking the law, the hope of murder (Bruno)). <br /> <br /> Bruno is literally struggling against patriarchy. All authority figures in the film are criticized - Bruno's father, a man whose brutality we catch a glimpse of, but the true horror of which is constantly alluded to in the film (especially in Aunt Clara's paintings) that the incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere); Anna's incredibly Machiavellian and selfish father; the insensitive judge who does not think about having lunch after an execution; the tennis commentator, whose authoritative comments are always deceived. Far from being the mother-hater of the legend, Hitch, as Robin Wood realized, is deeply hostile to parents and patriarchy. <br /> <br /> Bruno's transgression turns the world upside down. This is Hitch's most surreal film. Whenever Guy is in his plot, he is filmed directly with conventionally romantic music. But whenever Bruno intrudes, the atmosphere becomes carnival, bizarre, much more fun. This is Hitch's first truly American film, revealing Americana's primitive debris. Adult men punch balloons out of boys, or try to throw them off merry-go-round. Different math teachers sing about goats on trains. The matrons of the old society are strangled in elegant sarahs. Washington is filmed as a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky, like an astonishing painting of Dali. There is one of the biggest and funniest scenes in all the movie theaters when we see a property, smiling Bruno in a sea of ​​heads spinning in a tennis match, a picture worthy of Magritte. Just look at any scene with Bruno, and watch her derail in the bizarre. <br /> <br /> Phalluses abound in the most ridiculous permutations - see all those balloons (Hitch had obviously just seen THE THIRD MAN) - as well as in more serious environments: Washington will never be the same again. STRANGERS is also, after all, Hitch's most overtly sexual film - just like the phalluses, there is sustained homoerotism, the remarkable joke with "riding" horses; the joking joke when Hitch's daughter pours powder on the cop. <br /> <br /> And yet, Hitch is not limited to good old suspense. In the very appropriate effort to show what a great artist he was, critics tend to ignore what made him famous in the first place. Much has been made of Bruno as a prototype of Norman Bates, and Hitch makes a big mess in identifying the audience, wanting Bruno to be murdered. There is a hilarious painful sequence in which Bruno loses the lighter with which he intends to frame Guy into a drain. The sighs of tension and sighs of relief from the audience that I participated in supporting an insane killer are inherently funny, slightly disturbing, and highly revealing about our true reactions to compliance and success. And Hitch commands with insensible joy - listen to mocking music and exaggerated compositions, and kick yourself for taking everything so seriously. <br /> <br /> STRANGERS is one of Hitch's top five films and thus one of the biggest. things in the movies. The dialogue is so strange and brilliant that I can not believe it was not written by Chandler. Patricia Hitchcock is a wonderful asshole, replacing her cheeky father while she teases Guy. The end of the fairground is a remarkable and dizzying fusion of an exciting and tense piece of comedy, black comedy and symbolic place. If Bruno's last words condemn him to hell (according to the Catholic precepts that Hitch supposes to incorporate: compare with a similar ending in THE KILLERS), we applaud his integrity, infinitely preferable to Guy's self-indignation.
