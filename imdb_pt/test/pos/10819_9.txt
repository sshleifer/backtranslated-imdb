First, a word of caution. The DVD box describes this movie as a comedy. I do not think this was the intention of anyone connected with the film beyond some marketing idiots. Although light and a bit funny in some places, it is NOT a comedy and if you expect it to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of this movie and had absolutely no expectations one way or another. From others. Considering the other two DVDs I picked up were big disappointments, I was so happy when I saw this movie. The acting, writing and direction were excellent. The story itself definitely interested me, since you do not usually watch movies about the last month of France before the Nazis took it in 1940. He gave some tips on the parasites who gave up so quickly and agreed to share their beloved country. Along the way, there are plots involving a selfish and weak actress played very well by Isabelle Adjani - who looks wonderful after all these years. She kills an ex-lover and then finds a poor guy to catch the fall. This sap escapes from prison and finds - with another lover - a senior government official and ferret played by Gerard Depardieu. In addition, a subplot on a Jewish physicist trying to smuggle deuterium out of the country is introduced and eventually this becomes the main plot. The story has many twists, a faint sense of humor (without trying to be a comedy) and some genuine moments of suspense. Together, they create a good package that will surely please.
