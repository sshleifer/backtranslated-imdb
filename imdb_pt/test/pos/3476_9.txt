OK. You saw the movie and I saw the movie. Truth? If not, there are many plot summaries out there, and there is absolutely no reason to waste time on any fragile attempt to create another. <br /> <br /> The most impressive aspect of the film is unquestionable. the performances of both young and young on the tracks. His emotional honesty was as convincing, if not more, than any performance I've seen in the last few months. I found that I laughed, cried and bowed along with them, and that's saying a lot because I'm often called a tired and cynical idiot. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, the story is full of clich√©s. and I suppose that's the Achilles heel in the picture. It's a story we've all seen many times before; We all know how it will end from the moment they introduce Rory. Although you do not know the exact mechanics, you know there will be a transforming friendship, a bittersweet novel and a harrowing conclusion. If it were not for the strong cast and direction, this movie would be nothing more than the soporific who understands eighty percent of the Hallmark Channel schedule.
