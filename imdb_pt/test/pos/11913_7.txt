Toy Soldiers is the story of five misfits (the most notable being Sean Astin, Wil Wheaton and Kieth Coogan) trying to save their school from a terrorist invasion after the US government imprisons the leader's father. Lou Gosset Jr. plays the school principal, an obstinate guy who tries to instill in his students a sense of discipline. <br /> <br /> 'Toy Soldiers' is a funny and cool action, and certainly the best hostage crisis film in school. I think most of the appeal comes from the teen cast, but also, the terrorists do not come off as completely useless, while in some movies, they never seem to be the intimidating group they should. Trapped inside boarding school and threatened with death if the army or the police interfere, this is a very formidable challenge for these groups of men planning to save the school. They are actually very smart about this as well. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that it was a very good movie. He keeps up a steady pace and does not get ridiculously sentimental or anything like that. Astin and Gosset Jr. perform well. <br /> <br /> I also agree that this is an underrated action movie.
