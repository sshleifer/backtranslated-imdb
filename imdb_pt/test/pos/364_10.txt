This is another of Hitchcock's top-rated films and rightly so. This is a tale of two men meeting on a train and amusingly swapping murder fantasies. One of them (Robert Walker) takes it seriously and this leads Guy Haines (Farley Granger) to bother with the law. Another fast moving Hitchcock movie with many great scenes (the carousel scene and the tennis match deserve mention). It's not a movie to be missed, it's a shame that no one is going to re-release it on DVD with a lot of extras, only a cheap Warner Brothers DVD is all that out there right now.
