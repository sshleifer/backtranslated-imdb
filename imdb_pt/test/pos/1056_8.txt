Although it's a Christmas movie, "Christmas in Connecticut" could have been made any time of the year, as is the story of a soldier passing what is to be an idyllic time with a Martha Stewart type. That's what he thinks. In fact, the lady in question, played by Barbara Stanwyck, has a popular magazine column about life on a farm with her husband and baby. She has no farm, no husband, no baby, and the many recipes she publishes. They belong to the owner of the restaurant nearby. When her tabloid editor, Sydney Greenstreet, insists she entertains Private Dennis Morgan, she asks for her boyfriend's help to use her farm, and she transports herself there and the owner of the restaurant. There's even a baby ... well, actually, there's more than one. The chaos begins, and the charade becomes increasingly difficult to play, especially when Stanwyck falls in love with Morgan. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie, and even if you are severely depressed, "Christmas in Connecticut" you can get it out of it. Barbara Stanwyck is wonderful as the career woman has become a housewife. Although not as flashy as Crawford or Davis, she was able to do whatever role she asked for - she could be cheap, elegant, hot, nasty, cold and / or sexy and she made it look easy. In addition, she is always attractive and attractive. Dennis Morgan is a handsome, handsome soldier; as an added bonus, he manages to use his Irish tenor. Groom Reginald Gardner is all business, and you can tell he is not right with Stanwyck. S.Z. Sakall as the fake uncle / real chef is hilarious, especially when he prays that Stanwyck can turn a pancake before an audience. <br /> <br /> I can imagine the impact that this delicious film had at the end of World War II. It must have been a real lighthouse for the best times to come.
