For us, an Abbott and Costello movie is something that you should be in a good mood. I am very happy to have recorded this - my wife remembered when I was young, but I had never seen it. The family wanted to watch something that was not very serious before bed and this was selected. <br /> <br /> Our daughter watched many of the old movies with us - always complaining at first, but most of the time. She ignored this primarily at first, preferring to check her email, but she began to amuse herself - often laughing loudly with zaniness. <br /> <br /> It's wonderful to think that you can have a fun night out with a 55 year old. The monochrome introduction that combines with the colorful fairy tale. It's a fun twist on a story that everyone is familiar with, which includes a little song and a little dance, along with everything you expect Lou and Bud to do. <br /> <br /> Watch with your kids and have a fun night!
