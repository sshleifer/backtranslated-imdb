A fun joke ... lots of good twists! (and we were not even baked!) <br /> <br /> I did not know this movie existed until I watched the extra trailers on a Monty Python DVD ... (strangely it was there along with the City of Lost Children). , and The Adventures of Baron Munchauhsen) <br /> <br /> The plot keeps you thinking all the time. <br /> <br /> The acting was incredible ... Hank Azaria shows off his talent again, Bill Bob is Billy Bob ... (wecis?) <br /> <br /> Definitely worth watching.
