... And there were some of them. <br /> <br /> I do not like this cartoon as much as others, in part because it was made in its period. I much prefer cartoons with Daffy and Bugs that are fifteen or more years before hand. Many people will like this, especially people who always find violence funny, caricature or not. <br /> <br /> The basic plot is well known for Looney Tunes: Elmer goes out hunting, Daffy takes him to Bugs and Daffy ends up being shot instead. Also inserted are very intelligent and very funny jokes (some do not improve the episode), ugly shootings and animations that are slightly mediocre. The plot is mostly geared toward jokes - every joke keeps the episode going. This plot form is not that uncommon on Looney Tunes (of course, if you're practically a Looney Tunes shit - or an eager one - like me, then you'll already know that). <br /> <br /> For people who love everything about Looney Tunes and Daffy Duck and like the sound of what I said about it, enjoy "Rabbit Seasoning"! <br /> <br /> 7 and a half in ten.
