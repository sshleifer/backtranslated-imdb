Talking about the characteristics of the competition at Split Film festival, we have titles from around the world. China, Korea, Canada, USA and Australia and many of these stories indicate that the world is really a vale of tears. Modern love ... for sure. In this film of Alex Frayne, two younger married people and their son are traveling from the city to the coast to visit the grave and the house of the man who created him a long time ago and who died in mysterious circumstances. The coastal village looks like something in an American horror movie where the village is bizarre and people are unusual mutants. But the episodes in Alex Frayne's pastorella can not be described as horror in the normal way. In fact, this is an extremely interesting drama where we are seeing relationships and horror through flashbacks and more. In this story and through obviously psychological facets of the actors, is shown a movie peep show, a delightfully eccentric Australian film. Such is the case with Frayne. Always something new and fresh. The visual intelligence and the unique sensitivity of some Australian directors are staggering. Frayne's film is super. There's something about the Australian scene that shows his films as special as we saw in FRAYNE's Modern Love movie and in the RAY Lawrence, Lantana and Jindabyne movies. <br /> <br /> It looks like it will be the same in future Alex titles.
