It became extremely difficult to find a good horror movie, I thought this movie was a good thriller. <br /> <br /> Could have had better production values, but what kept me moving was the suspense and the twists. I had real reservations before seeing this movie (because of the cover). I feared it was too bloody and bloody. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Although there are many scary parts, there is a lot of suspense and drama too. <br /> <br /> Dead Line performance was better than what you would do. expect from a micro budget horror movie. The characters were believable <br /> <br /> The movie is really thrilling and quite scary at times, so that makes you take your place until the end of the credits <br /> <br /> Due to your values (the sound is not very good, for example) 8/10.
