Of all the actresses in today's movies, Kristin Scott Thomas would be my choice if I had to choose one to strand on a desert island. <br /> <br /> I could see her simply, for example, sitting in a chair for a while. some hours. So it's hard for me to be completely objective about one of your movies. <br /> <br /> However, I liked this movie and its history, in itself, more than the one indicated by the average ranking among the many. people commenting on this site previously. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford is not one of the actors, however, whose performances I like the most. But he is one of the few who have reached the level of moving from 7 to 8 per film, so who am I to discuss? <br /> <br /> Ford, although often fun in its acting style, and sometimes seems to be in serious need of an antacid and a dose of caffeine - and "Random Hearts" is in this group. <br /> <br /> His obsession with probing the losses he and Thomas endured in relation to their spouses is understandable given their profession of detective-but not at the level presented here. Although not far off, he crossed the line into the "boring" category. <br /> <br /> However, most of the scenes after he and Thomas got involved were interesting and well played. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a 9 *, but I would lower it. a couple of levels, based on Ford's overall performance, and another because it contained a bit more of the odd sub-tangled elements than seemed necessary.
