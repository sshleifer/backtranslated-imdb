I'd love to see some tie-in between NightBreed, The Fury, and the X-Men Series, more or less as the second Outer Limit's Series would link stories and plots after the fact, to create a story. Arco, although it has never been planned. I would also like to know if any more information - anecdotal or not, exist anywhere on the relationship and / or collaboration between Clive Barker and David Cronenberg. I just can not understand the fact that David Cronenberg appeared as a simple actor in a Clive Barker movie. Any additional information on the subject really exists? Finally, it's been 17 years since the movie was released, and I was hoping there would be a sequel now. Does anybody there know if there was any plan in progress that has never come to fruition, or if there are plans, even now, for a sequel?
