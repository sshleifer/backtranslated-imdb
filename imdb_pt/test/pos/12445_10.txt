Slipknot is a heavy metal band from the big city of Des Moines, Iowa, where rockers wear their own distinctive mask (I know someone else has said that, but I need to fill the space for this review). The members of the band are Joey, Mick, 133, Sid, Clown, James, Corey, Chris and Paul. This band is one of the best new heavy metal bands in my opinion and should be heard by everyone who loves hardcore rock. Another good film is called "DISASTERPIECES," which shows the band's performance at the London Arena. The video "My Plague" was filmed there and is included in the DVD. The butt music they made is also there (Sic). So if you love the band, you need to see this and if you like heavy metal, then you have to listen to this band.
