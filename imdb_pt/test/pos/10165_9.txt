The film, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, was brilliantly produced. It starts with a family of three, a doctor (James Stewart), his wife (Doris Day) - who is a former theater singer, and his youngest son - my guess is about 10 years who are traveling through Morocco for leisure. On the bus, the collision into a French government agent, and they are a bit too good for him. He is killed in the market after discovering the information he was looking for. He wants to take this information to someone else, so he goes to the only person he, even if slightly, knows: James Stewart. The antagonists kidnap his young boy and say that if he says anything about what the agent told him, his son would be killed. Stewart has to travel to London, because that's where his son is, and where the murder the agent told him would be. The movie is very suspenseful. There are many twists and turns (typical Hitchcock movie). Plus, he has the right amount of comic relief. In addition to all this, she won an Oscar for the performance of "Que sara, sara" by Doris Day. This film is very good. It's hard to find a problem about that. I would certainly recommend it to all Hitchcock fans and all suspense fans. I give this movie an "A-" just because it's a bit predictable.
