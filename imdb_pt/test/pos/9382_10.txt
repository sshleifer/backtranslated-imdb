Watching "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is like waking up in hospital, two days after a suicide watch, disorienting but strangely exhilarating. There are few cinematographic equivalents to this disturbing but often humorous lesson of surrealist mythology, morality, and ideology. <br /> <br /> The experimental works of Cocteau's "Blood of a Poet" and Maya Deren evoke a taste of the strange atmosphere found in MATH BED. A closer comparison is the adult fairy tales of the literary author Angela Carter, the short disturbing stories of Unica Zurn or E.T.A. Hoffman <br /> <br /> DEATH BED has many recognizable elements from the past, but exhibits a totally original and original plot. <br /> <br /> As a storyline, DEATH BED is an incredibly simple but original <br /> <br /> view, something that only one-in-a thousand independent releases will accomplish. This unpretentious film has its technical flaws but surpasses them all with a cast of gorgeous non-actors and scary places - a true classic independent of the 1970s. The DEATH BED also exhibits a unique three-dimensional personality, subversive - a deep and continuous layer of dream images and ideas that give it a kind of "fun house" construction. The passage of time told in flashbacks and time travel histories, the bed with its sinister black humor, the rich and discreet symbolism used in his images. The most agreeable is the image of Aubrey Beardsly, the suffering artist, always trapped within the frame of his own painting as he comments and engages with the "offerings" of murdered victims offered to him as offerings of love by the spirit of the demented bed. - A sick refrain and wonderful element / metaphor for the "trapped artist" - Nothing but the strangest thing in POE or MALLARME can be just like that. <br /> <br /> Anyone who values ​​the spirit of independent cinema and craves multi-layered symbolist experience, or crave the surrealist concept of "convulsive beauty" and the inclinations of Gothic terror The low cost of film exploitation will dig this totally unique view. A simple and fun movie with delicate psychic currents. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. *****
