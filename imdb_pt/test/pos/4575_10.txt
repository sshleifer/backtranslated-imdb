I was one of the few who went out of my way to see this in the theater. I have thought about it frequently since then. After two DVD shows, I'm glad to say that this was perfect. Like any great comedy, I laughed more at each showing, both in expectation of jokes, but also after picking up lost things before. <br /> <br /> Mike Judge does very well by creating insanely comic characters and embedding them in their world to make sense. In Office Space, the environment makes the characters believable. The future of idiocracy gives you the freedom to write incredibly stupid characters and make them work. I'll be waiting to see if they release a better DVD with some real features before buying it. But this movie deserves the DVD support not offered in the theater.
