This is a wonderful short comedy - one of Keaton's absolute best. Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer. And as a result, most of the film consists of him running away from the cops and a particular detective. Although generally I am not a fan of films with many chase scenes, this is the absolute best as much as pure athletic and acrobatic ability. I saw some who had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so agile and able to move with amazing grace. In particular, there is a scene where he comes across a table, leaps on a man's shoulders and dives through the aft panel in the most gentle way that is humanly possible. In addition, many of the jokes are funny and perfectly timed, such as how he really believes he killed someone. By the way, this movie is very similar to COPS, also by Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make the two worth seeing. <br /> <br /> This movie is brilliant and the only short Keaton I can think of that I probably liked even more was THE PLAYHOUSE - where Buster plays all the roles in the theater.
