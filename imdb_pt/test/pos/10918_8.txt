I saw this because my cousin is an extra in one of the wedding scenes. I read somewhere that Oz and Rudnick wanted to have fun with liberal message films, but the climax ends up being out of one of those films. Also, part of the humor is a bit on the boring side, Joan Cusack was too exaggerated for me, and someone has a weird Oscar timeline. Still, there were more than enough funny moments, like the kissing scene, the marriage that is not, and the scene with the director, to enjoy it. Kline, as always, is good, but for me, the real surprise was Selleck, of whom I'm not much of a fan, but he mocks himself right here.
