First of all, it is pure joy to hear the legend play such wonderful and timeless music. This movie and soundtrack is a tour de force. Ray Charles is unique and amazing. I really loved the movie as it was inspiring and entertaining everywhere. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx has become one of Hollywood's leading actors, as is clearly shown in Ray and he must get an Oscar for this role, it is unprecedented. In fact, everyone who worked on this film should be praised. I really enjoyed Kerry Washington, who played the exceptional wife ... Ray Charles obviously married well. Regina King is a great actress, as well as the extraordinary Sharon Warren, who plays a young mother suffered. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, I would say that this whole project was arranged providentially. The entire cast was perfect, great screenplay and incredible scenarios ... great props for director Taylor Hackford and the crew for doing such a splendid job in bringing the life of Ray Charles to the screen so perfectly. This is my photo of the year, certainly one of the best biographical films ever made.
