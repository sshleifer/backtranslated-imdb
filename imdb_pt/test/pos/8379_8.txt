Hong Kong, the 1920s. A young man of evil beginnings dreams of being a hero and spends most of his time training and learning about kung fu and bodybuilding, much against his father's wishes. He helps a servant escape from a ruthless businessman, whose henchmen come after them and terrorize the young man's noodle restaurant. The uncle turns out to be an old and reformed assassin of the Triad, that now helps the young person to become proficient in martial arts. It's the Karate Kid style with "wash the wok" instead of "wax on, wax off". The kung fu villain is the son of the ruthless entrepreneur, who has a scorpion style that looks cool, though he is rather silly and certainly totally unrealistic. <br /> <br /> But history, which develops over time, has an epic feel. , good characterization, great kung fu and is usually a lot of fun. The young hero is very nice and provides a good protagonist to cheer. The novel dimension is not yet developed, which is a little disappointing. Otherwise, a great movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 out of 10.
