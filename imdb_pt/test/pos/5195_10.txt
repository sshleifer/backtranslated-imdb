One of the best war movies I've ever seen, if not the best. It is very difficult to talk about these films, as it is very difficult to point out any mistakes made. The "problem" is how it looks very real and so it drags you to the ruins of Stalingrad and makes you suffer on both sides. This is because this film unlike most Hollywood movies does not glorify the war or the heroism of the main characters. Instead, the movie makes them heroes just by being human and so it's anti-war as far as reason can offer. Extremely convincing scenes of war and acting so impressive, most scenes seem isolated plays. In addition, the German army is played by the Germans, which is so convincing as well. The film is produced and performed by Germans, where you can see their love for details to perfection. This is why "Stalingrad" is one of the movies I can watch millions of times and never feel bored. I watched the movie with my father who fought in World War II and the first thing he said was, "This is how real, that's how the war against the Germans looked like." This is the place you can see as it seemed to be a soldier in the worst nightmare of war in human history and turning point of WWII: Stalingrad.
