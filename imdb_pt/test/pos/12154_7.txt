I would be interested to hear from the director, Barbet Schroeder, why he decided to do his first movie, and more specifically, what his interest in hippies - or rather, that form of the Euro-hippie paradise - and his death. The movie is at least true enough to keep one interested, but in their own kind of truth is strange, biased. It is a certain heroine (aka, "Horse") is a horrible, rotten thing, the conclusion for many idiot drug users who see it as everything else, because basically it is: after that everything stops, that becomes life, and it is a continuous race for more of the same or death. More begins as something about a romance between a New York girl and a German, but that becomes something else, for better or for worse (sometimes both in the same scene). <br /> <br /> Basically, there are two. Stefan, who is in a town where Stefan has come as a sort of traveler from his homeland, is also wandering, and may be too friendly with a large pusher named Wolf. somewhere nearby, and after a rather daring "horse" attempt by Estelle, they also find a block in the form of a seemingly more remote house along the shore. Schroeder's commentary on youth, sex and drugs is not much simplistic, which makes the film really lucid and intelligent so many years later.It is direct and subtle, more about the characters and then about the fact that what he is representing could in other hands be just a propaganda picture Perhaps more pleasantly, and this is just a hunch, Schroeder uses as inspiration the long-running type of Bergman's Summer with Monika: two children in an inexorable connection, some b <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I must mention that there are problems, some great, in fact. The performances are not very convincing all the time; some scenes reach some power or have the actors in a good connection with each other, but Klaus Grumberg exaggerates himself even if he is a moody German by nature (in that case I would have preferred Klaus Kinski in part to make him more crazy). but deep enough for the subject), as does Farmer to his own degree. And there are ingenuity gaps in the script that keep him from being as deep as he really thinks. On the other hand, there are two great things: Nestor Almendros, the great director of photography (ie, Days of Heaven) is DP and is a big boost for a first-time director like Schroeder. Almost all images are seen with an incredible purpose or art, be it a photo of the cliffs by the sea or the sun or something as simple as the seemingly natural light of a room. <br /> <br /> The other thing is Rosa Floyd, probably the main reason why I and many others have heard of the movie (years before I really knew who Schroeder was, I saw the soundtrack to "More" ever that I was looking for the Pink Floyd albums). It's very good music everywhere, occasionally the hallucinating variety that gives them the reputation they deserve. Part of this is also a bit boring, even if it is a movie that relates to free love and many drugs and sometimes both at the same time. I would not rate it anywhere near a Meddle or Animals, certainly not the Dark Side, but it also helps to raise the subject to another level, particularly when it is least expected or in low tones or floating in and out of the buildings. like Stefan or other street rides. It's an almost better atmosphere than the movie itself deserves, but overall it's still worth watching More as an outdated yet powerful period as a less ambitious yet more substantial Zabriskie Point.
