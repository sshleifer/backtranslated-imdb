I saw this movie for the first time on hbo around 1983 and I loved it! I scoured all the auction sites to buy the vhs copy. This is a very good suspense movie with some twists that make it more interesting. I do not want to talk too much, because if you get a chance to see it, you'll be glad you did not talk too much!
