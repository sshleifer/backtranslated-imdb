Everywhere I hear people are calling this show bad because their premise is very unlikely .... well, maybe a good taxi driver in Philly is pushing a little (at least the taxi drivers I found), but this is the that makes the show is great. <br /> <br /> The fact that this show is a little out of the reality is an issue, but it's still fun and fun. It's highly watchable and even though you know that Mike wins in the end, he never wins in life. David Morse is a great actor and does a great job on the title role. Your support cast is great and I must say that the location of the show is especially great! <br /> <br /> After all, I watch this show not because I'm looking for a good dose of reality or a show with a lot of action. I watch this show because it has a great acting, a good premise and a great story every week. It is also an advantage when I can choose the landmarks he drives, or know at what intersection he is. I love this show and I love Philly !! Give this show a shot!
