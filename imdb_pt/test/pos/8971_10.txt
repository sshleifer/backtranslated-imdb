Charlie Wilson's War is an excellent example of how films should be made. This movie is of the highest quality and is released with perfection. Tom Hanks plays the lead and delivers exceptional performance. In addition, Tom Hanks is complemented by the incomparable acting ability of the incredible Philip Seymour Hoffman. I've never seen him in a role that suits him so perfectly. <br /> <br /> The movie is witty, clever and well written. Julia Roberts also stars in this film, but is easily shadowed by the other two protagonists. I rated this movie 10/10 and I am pleased to recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in quality cinema.
