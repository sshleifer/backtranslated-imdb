Totally disgusting and cheap obscene humor. I loved!!! It's the most disgusting and utterly horrible movie except for Nicolas Read, who plays an undead Court Jester, for comic brilliance. But being so, I laughed many times and I have to hand it to the filmmakers, it was not pretentious or ordinary anyway. Rape, fighting, zombies vomiting on their rape victims. What other movie has that? Not for the quesy, but with a pizza, a bong and a pack of six beers, you got it, if you have a cast iron stomach and a sense of juvenille humor like me.
