Viva Variety was a unique hybrid program that was a parody and a tribute to the programs it represented. <br /> <br /> It was more of a mock-up of the classic favorite of the 1970s, "The Sonny & Cher Show," with Thomas Lennon and Kerri Kenney playing a divorced couple who was forced to host this show together, female pair of the pair towering over the male, and the constant barrage of "insult humor" the couple threw at each other, as well as outlining comedies and performances of what is more gently described as "specialties"! <br /> <br /> The "hybrid" was the mixture of fact and fantasy. Of course there was "Mr. and Mrs. Laupin," and the program's announcer, Johnny Bluejeans, was equally fictitious. But all the acts they performed were certainly real, and some were even fun! But there were also some acts that would clearly be better suited for Chuck Barris' old "Gong Show." The show itself was actually more like an extended sketch of "SCTV" (it was taken from the MTV series, "The State" after all), and some would suggest that it would have been better as a bit of five minutes in the mix of such a program, rather than an independent series. But "Viva Variety" certainly must have high marks for the original concepts, and even if it was stranger than funny, it certainly paid off, especially when they traveled to Las Vegas and brought even brighter acts to perform. It is unlikely that someday we will see something like that on television again.
