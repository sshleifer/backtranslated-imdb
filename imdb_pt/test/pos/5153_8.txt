You, the live (2007) <br /> <br /> Mordant. I've never written that word before, but come to mind here. Let me search. Well, it's part of it - corrosive, but also funny as heck. So corrosively funny. This is an austere movie, sure, with so much dry dry wit and quirky humor that it's impossible not to like it on some level. Filmed in a very free style, often with a static camera and compositions really balanced and stable, such as stages of theater, we see a short staging occur. <br /> <br /> But that makes it look ordinary - which it is not. Ordinary life is shown as misaligned, ironic, delightful, timid and depressing. It's impossible. We, the living, must live and, as we are alive, we can also take note. Something similar. I think it was Ebert who said you were laughing and did not know why. Exactly. And the promotional material somewhere said it was a cross between Bergman and Monty Python, and what they mean is that it has the dry, silent, penetrating look of Ingmar Berman's famous Swedish films, but it has the moody elements and British comedians. . <br /> <br /> I would definitely say definitely watch at least half an hour of it. There is a part of me that until then thought I had passed - the rest remains in a similar set of little sketches and moments, and they gradually evolve, but there is no great plot to follow or climax of the usual kind. There are some great moments later, even just attention to the storm, which takes us out of mundane human events as well. <br /> <br /> The footage is beautiful in its classic control, almost like a series of scenes from Gregory Crewdson (and beating the photographer, actually). And the performance, with all its simplicity and simplicity, is right. An amazing, beautiful and strange experience.
