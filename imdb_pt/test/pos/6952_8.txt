Kingdom County, Vermont, 1927. Noel Lord (Rip Torn) lives with his Indian companion, Bangor (Tanto Cardinal) in the area where a large dam is to be built; Noel, however, is not willing to give up his land, and he will have to fight against the dam company in order to prevent the county from any possible destruction. "Where rivers flow north" is an exciting and contemplative story fueled by the memorable performances of Rip Torn (recently seen in the small but juicy role of Louis XV in the underrated "Marie Antoinette" by Sofia Coppola) and Tantoo Cardinal ("Dances With Wolves", "Smoke Signals"). Director Jay Craven (who also co-wrote the screenplay with Don Bredes based on Howard Frank Mosher's novel) and director of photography Paul Ryan have created this powerful story with unique contemplative rhythm / visual that reminds me of Terrence's greatest moments Malick and John Huston. It is an underestimated part of the independent period of the first (electric) half of the 1990s, generally regarded as the rise of the burlesque of Quentin Tarantino ("Pulp Fiction" is a masterpiece, but man suffers from Orson Welles Syndrome), disturbing by Todd Solondz. suburbia, the somber vision of Danny Boyle over the UK (let's not mention the film "Beach" with DiCaprio, however) ... Jay Craven should be more considered in the lists of great indie filmmakers as well. He has led a respectful and discreet career and it is always a pleasure to see a constant talent like yours. <br /> <br /> My vote: 8/10.
