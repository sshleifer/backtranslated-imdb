Boogie Nights is one of the best movies of the 90's and I would say it should be in the top 250 of IMDb. I can really understand why many do not like this because of the subject. Personally, I feel however, as many do, judging by the acclaim of this film received by the viewers and critics that it is first-rate film. <br /> <br /> The direction and acting in this film surpasses the good and reach the level of brilliance. There is a scene in this movie that is not amazing. Individual characters reach out and touch you. Given that this is a film about the pornographic industry, one can not imagine that sex scenes can be treated with such sensitivity, but they are. The direction is among the best I've seen - and I've seen many movies. <br /> <br /> The film is not about the story of an individual, it is about many. about people who have many layers to them and who, perhaps, in an industry, find aliens but who still dream of the same dreams and have bad and good things for them. Boogie Nights takes you to their story from the beginning, and although the movie is long (I believe almost 3 hours), you honestly do not even notice it. And when it ends you kind of do not want it ... <br /> <br /> I'm not easy to impress, which means there are not many movies that I would give a 10 out of 10 rating to but that's one. In addition to the study of multiple characters, it is the use of music in the film. I have never, in all my years of films seen, the song tells a story as well as in this movie. There was so much perfection in it, you know it's not something you're going to see every day. Burt Reynold's performance was perhaps the best I've ever seen him do, and Mark Wahlberg is amazing (I'm surprised that there are still people saying he does not act well. I do not know how anyone who sees this might think so), but the person who really surprised me was Heather Grahem (Rollergirl), who is absolutely fantastic in his role, in particular the memorable scene with Burt Reynolds in the Limo at the end. <br /> <br /> Once again, I'll echo other IMDb reviewers in saying that this movie is not for everyone. But I still think this was top notch. 10 out of 10.
