Dolemite is incredible. Rudy Ray Moore's rhymin kung fu pimp with horrific choreographed action sequences is the closest you can get to becoming a parody of a genre without actually being parody. Citizen Kane this may not even be Les Infant Au Revoir, but this is undoubtedly genius by itself. The production values ​​in this film are so bad that they can qualify as special existential effects. The plot drags a little in the middle, but the power of a premise as cheap as kung fu prostitutes is enough to bring all movie lovers, minus the more eccentric. The infamous boom boom ever present evokes shadows of gloriously incompetent Ed Wood and never grows bland. I sometimes wonder if the microphone boom was purposely left out as a commentary on the ridiculous aspects of the movies in general, but I usually get distracted by erotic scenes that do not have eroticism to the point of the high worldliness of art. All is that this film is alive and breathing, with desperate desire to be simultaneously loved and insulted. It works. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
