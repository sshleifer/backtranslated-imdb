I've been addicted to "GG" since mid 2001-2002 (season 2) when I tuned in to see "Smallville" 10 minutes early. Thanks to "Beginnings", now I have all but two episodes on tape, until last night (Ep. 4.9). I'm a middle-aged man, and this is the ONLY weekly TV show I watch. <br /> <br /> I love this series because: a) Lauren Graham is a very beautiful, funny and smart woman to boot; b) the dialogue is extremely well written; c) is hilarious, putting rubbish overrated as "Everybody Loves Raymond" to embarrass. Many current TV sitcoms have been heavily influenced by the highly successful and much despised slime pit known as "Married with Children," where the viewer is encouraged to mock and feel superior to the characters. In "GG", the characters have flaws, but we can see our own weaknesses and laugh with them, not with them. This is exciting for TV, where writers challenge us to keep up with rapid fire exchanges and pop culture / literature / news references outside the left field. I have great pleasure in watching these episodes several times, picking up all the verses and references to previous episodes. Stars Hollow is your own little world, which I will happily continue to visit as the series runs.
