this movie has a decent story in my opinion, very good fight scenes, but I was a bit disappointed with the end of the movie. I think it was a better way if lydie denier knew karate either or if she knew how to use some guns, her character became more interesting too and she was a decent opponent to cynthia. I think when the director filmed the final 'battle' between cynthia & denier he wanted to finish the movie sooner then he did not care how the ending was going to be No after all, I think cynthia rothrock fans will be thrilled to see this movie. It's not like 'yes, ma'am!' or sworn to justice, but it was enough entertainment and Cynthia looks amazing in this movie, so my fee for this movie is a solid 8/10
