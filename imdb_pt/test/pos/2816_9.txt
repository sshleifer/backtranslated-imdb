"Stripperella" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (dubbed by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as "The Tender Loins" and as a sexy fighter known as Stripperella, also known as Stripperella. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. Like Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and evil forces like a plastic surgeon who gives breast implants that explode or fatten and Cheapo, a criminal who steals 99 cents and causes his two hijackers to share a gun. The creator of the character and the series is Stan Lee, of the fame of Marvel (and creator of Spider-Man). <br /> <br /> In late June 2003, Spike TV (then known as The New TNN) debuted Thursday night block three animated shows. These shows were "Ren & Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon"; new adventures of classic children show the characters Ren and Stimpy for adults made by the original creator John Kricfalusi, "Gary the Rat"; about a lawyer who is turned into a human-sized rat starring Kelsee Grammar of "Cheers" and "Fraiser" fame, and "Stripperella"; the adventures of a stripper who is also a superhero, dubbed by Pamela Anderson and raised by Stan Lee. I remember seeing all three of them. I was looking forward to seeing Ren and Stimpy as I love the original show. I was a bit disappointed. It was all right, but it seemed to take things a little too far; seeing the two of them having gay sex together was a bit much. Although Gary the Rat was not bad, the best of the three was Stripperella. The animation was very good, had an amazing intro song, had some talent behind it, and was funny as hell! The show was so silly, I do not even know how to start explaining! After four or five weeks (if not a little less) the animation block disappeared, which was strange because I know it has good ratings and was advertised everywhere. I was disappointed to see Stripperella go, but several months later I discovered new episodes that went on the air at 1:00 in the morning. I just got to see one and although it was funny how the hell and I was happy to see the show back after all this time, something seemed a bit off .... <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the short running, "Stripperella" had great excitement. It was dark, moody, realistic and a bit sexy as well. The striped stripper also looked good, the character was well designed. After the long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. Instead of looking dark and realistic, originally everything was now really colorful and caricatured. Stripperella received the biggest changes. Before she had normal long hair, she now had bigger hair than Peggy Bundy (Married with Children), if possible. In addition, the mask of the eyes shows your eyes now; before being white you saw what was cool, since it was more super-heroic. In addition, the top of his clothing was a sort of collared vest and his suit was dark blue; this changed to his clothing being a bluish-violet color and his top costume being really horrible in comparison. In short, the show was a cartoon and much exaggerated beforehand, but in the second half it became more caricatured and although still hilarious, it became more crazy; for example, there was a later episode about a beaver-de-ser-vi ... yes, a deer-beaver. <br /> <br /> Anyway, instead of complaining about the mid-series changes, "Stripperella" only ran one season, but it was a pretty good show. As Tales from the Crypt's film "Bordello of Blood" can be very exaggerated, but it's a lot of fun. As long as you're not a prude, you'll find yourself laughing repeatedly at this show. I have not seen all the episodes because I still do not have the DVD for two reasons: Paramount # 1 released and they have this spoiled policy about not including extras on almost all TV shows released, even though this is the entire show (I would have liked to see the explanation of some comments explaining the change in animation and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee)) and # 2. The incredible song Kid Rock during the opening was replaced. Now I'm not a fan of it, but this introduction sang was the theme of the show! If your not going to pay to have some extra, at least pay to have the original intro song you jack-asses. The show also had some interesting guests like John Lovitz as Cheapo and Mark Hamil as the plastic surgeon who hates models. Also Tom Kenny (SpongeBob) was on the show as the owner of the strip club in most episodes. Stan Lee has a special participation in an episode as well. <br /> <br /> The collapse: <br /> <br /> PROS: Had a great look at the beginning, FUNNY HELL, a very fun, great show. Most of the time, the talent of the voice, the boss Strogenoff (watch the show and see some of the things he does), and it was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> CONS: The mid-series change animation and the low-quality DVD described above. Aside from the fact that part of the humor might be a little dumb sometimes I have nothing really negative to say about it. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: Stripperella is a huge guilty pleasure of mine and it's a shame that it only ran one season. It was a very funny, sexy and action-packed cult series that I hope to see one day in Adult Swim with the original introduction intact and possibly give another season as Family Guy. Check it out, even if it's on the bad of the DVD. You will laugh at yourself silly. Rated TV-MA: gross and sexual humor and nudity, duration: about 25 minutes per episode, Score: 9/10
