I have to confess that I slept in the movies while watching the first Asterix movie ... but this is simply FANTASTIC! It's very funny and leaves the first kilometer away. It has lots of funny jokes and funny situations that made me laugh from the first minutes of the movie and I just stopped laughing when I got to the car to get back home. I repeat: this movie is spectacular ... Obelix is ​​very funny and Cleopatra is a real girl !!
