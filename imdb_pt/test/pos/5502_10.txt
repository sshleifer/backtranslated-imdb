For some unexplainable reason, Jerry's films often seemed to receive criticism from certain quarters, though they were rarely disappointments at the box office. It's one of the great mysteries of life for me because your movies have always had a "good" factor on them for me. But this film is not only not bad: it's an extremely good and intelligent comedy. For those who can be stimulated by cruel or "modern" humor, do not watch this movie: there is nothing like that and you will be wasting your time. <br /> <br /> I only saw this movie once on television. I have waited since then to see it again and it has been a few years. You'd think the idea of ​​an arrogant, millionaire businessman getting ready to win the war against the Nazis with his own small army deprived of subservient employees would be annoying, would not it? Well, only Jerry Lewis would dare try such a plot for a comedy out and out and it works, I have to say, brilliantly. <br /> <br /> I think as with 'The Nutty Professor' and most of his other films, this movie bears witness to his comic genius both in concept and execution. I think Buddy Love might have said, "You know, the real comedy can not only cause a six-year hysteria, but it's going to do that for his dad." Maybe some Nazi generals with monoculars and a limp would not like the movie, honestly. If you only see one more comedy in your life, check this out. Be careful, you can die of laughter. And I'm not joking!
