I saw Dark Harbor at the Seattle 98 Film Festival. Filmed against an autumnal Maine backdrop, this film features an excellent cast and plot that keeps you guessing everywhere. Sometimes weird, sometimes funny, I have to say that stayed with me for days after seeing it. Rickman and Walker are wonderful as the icy weddings and Reedus is someone you will listen to more, I'm sure. The opening shot of a winding, deserted road in a torrential downpour at dusk (and the scoreboard that accompanied it) set the tone just as well - just fantastic. Well, good work from a new director / writer and his talented team.
