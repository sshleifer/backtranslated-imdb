I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a bit off-beat, everyone in the making of this movie made a good movie for many laughs. Writing and jokes are much more literate than I expected. Better yet, they are delivered with resourcefulness by unknown actors doing a good job, all of them. <br /> <br /> The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from "Ed" and the new Apple computer ads. He was just starting to perform as an actor in "Ed," and he was excellent here. It is natural in front of the camera. Lewis Black is a social commentator who does not punch. He's on "The Daily Show" at Comedy Central once every two weeks, but he really shines on HBO's "Red, White, and Screwed." I regularly pick it up on XM Radio's uncensored comedy channel. Give an idea to Black and let him improvise. If your speeches and phrases here are scripted or improvised, it does not matter. He is invaluable in giving his thoughts on the anguish of the middle class. One thing about delivering Black, his hand gestures are not those of a comedian. He seems to be talking to you, and I think that makes him unconsciously more effective.
