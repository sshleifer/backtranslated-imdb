It's a very good (documentary) film about Istanbul and its people and it's music of all kinds. The editing and success of the director is very impressive. I've been interested in Faith Akin ever since I've seen "Gegen die Wand" ("Duvara KarsÄ±") and I admired his work a lot, but that was the most touching thing for me, so I'm writing that. It's not just about Turks or something, it's a very good biography of a city and how music stays alive in it we can say. There are visions of many people and very varied ideas about life and love. I liked it a lot and I think everyone should see it, NOT ONLY, but especially those related to Turkey ...
