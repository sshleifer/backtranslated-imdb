I've seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and I never get tired of it just because it's perfect. And also got the best movie music of all time and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie. I mean you just have to love Robert Duval, Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie, but especially Duval. I can not believe that Kramer vs. Kramer won an Oscar instead of this incredible war movie. So this is my conclusion if you get the director of the biggest movie in the world (The Godfather) and the best of Hollywood actors that you can only succeed. Now I just have to write something to get this preview, so do not read this except the last line. This movie rules !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
