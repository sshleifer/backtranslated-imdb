A bit crazy, but funny fun. You kind of have to see this from the beginning to follow what's going on, but every story to earth has its own joke. Very good special effects for a very low budget sci-fi t.v. exhibition. It's fun to watch. More or less in vein of Red Dwarf, but still lower budget. For someone who is getting in the middle of one of the episodes, what you have to realize is that these guys are all incompetent because they climbed the ladder of command because the other cops died. Also, the main guys are from the laundry sector, which is why they have laundry at all. If you like Red Dwarf, you'll probably like this. Slightly different t.v. concept, in which all you see is the commander's report every day. It would be better if this were explained more, not just at the beginning of the first episode, but then it was very difficult to figure out what happened in Red Dwarf as well, if you had not.
