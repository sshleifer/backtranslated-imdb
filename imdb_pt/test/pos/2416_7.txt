This film was very different from the previous films and I had to ask myself, "Where is Ralph Macchio?" he could have gotten involved in the plot somewhere like the old friend of Myiagi who teaches Julie what he already knows, so Myiagi can come along and add a little more! Macchio might have been Julie's love interest in this movie! Does not matter! <br /> <br /> On a serious level, I liked this movie because it involved teaching a teenager to do karate, and her feelings are very different from what Daniel was. Julie is much wilder than Daniel and needs to be tamed, something that Myiagi finds very challenging; she is a very troublesome girl and a rude and nasty brat! <br /> <br /> It was very gratifying to see the transformation in Julie as she approaches Myiagi and begins to understand more about Karate and her life in general. We can all learn a thing or two from the jokes of Myiagi!
