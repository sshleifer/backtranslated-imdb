This is a romantic comedy, so it's really a fairy tale, but unconventional. Cinderella, instead of living in the ashes, lives in a superdecorated castle in the suburbs with a handsome husband who is not a prince. She finds her prince, but he is not so handsome. Instead of a castle, at least initially, she makes a small breakthrough in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> Pfeifer, Stockwell, and Ruehl lead a cast of fully accomplished, if somewhat exaggerated, characters. <br /> <br /> Demme reaches the highest level of movie production in my mind. It creates a world in which I want to move - a neighborhood in Manhattan and a street life filled with life and community. <br /> <br /> I wish the IMDb to associate with the other reviewers' comments. I would like to know what other movies the people who criticized this hate. I'm always looking for lots of laughs and cool places to "live" for at least an hour or so.
