In 'Hoot', Logan Lerman plays Roy Eberhardt, the new kid from the school who just moved out of Montana. But Florida is very different from Montana. Despite problems with mixing, Roy discovers a bigger problem. A new franchise restaurant is coming to town and the families of bureaucrats are in trouble. Could the new kid, a brat (Brie Larson) and a fugitive (Cody Linley) prevent big business from destroying the home of these owls? <br /> <br /> This movie was very good. The children (Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley) are the true stars of this film. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko) is fine, but really does not play a very big role. Neither Robert Wagner (mayor) or Jimmy Buffett (Mr. Ryan). <br /> <br /> However, this was a fun movie that the whole family will enjoy. For the first time producer, I thought Jimmy Buffett had a quality job. Besides, the owls were really cute.
