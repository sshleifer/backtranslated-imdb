This movie reminded me of watching the old black and white movies with my dad. More faithful to the characters of life looking for love, to be in love and to lose it. Fresh view of ancient history. Larenz Tate was as Cary Grant in style as the character may have been in a clumsey situation, but the actor prevented him from looking silly and like a cardboard cut. Nia Long has always been one of my favorites, she's sweet even when she's tough, almost like Kathrine Hepburn. This is one of his best works and showing that he is better than ever playing a furious black man. <br /> <br /> This film is a classic, excellent performance, well written, a true love story in Chicago, the What more can you ask for? <br /> <br /> SuperB Black Love Story
