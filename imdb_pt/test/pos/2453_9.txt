This is a little-seen anti-war film that has been ignored for a long time. The time is Thanksgiving of 1972. The place is a typical suburban home somewhere in Texas. The eldest son has just returned from Vietnam and is taking time to adjust to the life he left behind. And the family does not know how to deal with the problem. I honestly do not think I'm exaggerating when I say this is one of the most exciting war movies I've ever seen. The funny thing is that there are only a handful of combat sequences throughout the movie. Most of the story takes place inside a house for a couple of days. But the kind of war that happens in this house is as intense as any real action on the battlefield. The film does something that is difficult to accomplish; Somehow, Estevez and his team have created a film that incorporates the whole experience of Vietnam. And considering the similarities between Vietnam and the current invasion of Iraq, the film is surprisingly relevant. Estevez does a magnificent job with material. He gets a lot of help from a handpicked cast. Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates, in particular, are excellent as parents. A truly moving movie. Highly recommended
