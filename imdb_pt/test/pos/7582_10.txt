I'm not a filmmaker, but I know it's hard to tell a story in seven minutes and attract your audience to the character. Horses on Mars do this and more. When you're watching a good movie, you do not want it to end. That's how I felt watching this movie. It is visually expansive and the microbe assumes such human qualities that you feel you are on the journey with it. <br /> <br /> Really eager to see what thrilling adventures Mr. Anderson takes us into the future. Well done.
