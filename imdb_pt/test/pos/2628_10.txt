Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett excel at this 1970s melodrama. The lush settings, haunting music, and plot twists make it a truly interesting movie. I had seen it when it first came out on TV. Again, it aired when I had a VCR, but I did not get a chance to record it. I would love it on VHS if someone has a copy. In addition to the suspense (which is worked beautifully) I feel that the story is unique, and is quite faithful to the book, MRS. MAITLAND'S AFFAIR, by Margaret Lynn. I would say it was one of the best films of the 1970s, which were neglected, from films made for TV. I gave the film a note number 10 because it is done with so much originality. There is a true pathos and air of romance that makes the viewer sympathize with the guilty.
