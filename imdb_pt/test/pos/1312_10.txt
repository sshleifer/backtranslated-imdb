This film is a haunting of the life of the author and poet Mishima. He jumps through his past, through his last day, and through some of his stories, but is cleverly constructed as he moves from section to section. It captures the taste of man, his work and his times ... the difficult 60's. <br /> <br /> I think the most wonderful parts (literally, filled with "wonder") are the snippets of his construction. . The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing .... stylized, beautiful and effective. They could be used as examples for any set designer. I woke up at night dreaming of the golden pagoda. <br /> <br /> Stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and art. After watching this movie, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics or Japanese history.
