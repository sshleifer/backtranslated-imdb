This deceptively laid-back Australian criminal thriller, discreetly casually paced, unfolds with casual ease and relaxed self-confidence that is a delight to behold. Jimmy (an irresistible Heath Ledger), eager for a working-class beaver, yearns to do something about his normal, unrewarding life. Jimmy gets his big break when local crime boss Pando (an excellent Bryan Brown) gives him an easy messenger service that involves handing over $ 10,000 to an old lady. Jimmy is in deep trouble when he loses Pando's money. Gregor Jordan's tale and screenplay about how things are not always what's being cracked, young love, all actions that have consequences and that the old punishment on how unpaid crime works like a charm thanks to a wonderful wealth of well-observed secondary details, a strong subtext about man's mourning ability for good and evil, a good sense of unforced irony, the frightening way violence is presented, and the marvelous basis of the assorted warts in complex (for example, Panda is shown playing Scrabble with a footman and at one point interrupts a business conversation with a colleague to talk to his son on the phone) . Judging by his portrayal of cunning, finely-shaded, two-handed fists, unless played with Pando, Bryan Brown undoubtedly qualifies as one of the best actors of all time in the celluloid. A sturdy and satisfactory sleeper.
