The movie someone had to do. <br /> <br /> Waco: The rules of engagement dissect the evidence behind the impasse in Waco, Texas that led to the destruction of property and the supposed cover-up of the government. The first thing you need to know about this movie: you will see brief but disturbing photos of the bodies of the victims. This is not meant for shock value, but to illustrate points about the way they died, as if you were present in the coroner's inquiry. <br /> <br /> The second thing you should know about this movie: at two and fifteen minutes, it's pretty heavy - especially if you've followed the events up close at the time. If you are not aware of any of the events beyond what has been reported in the mass media, or if the only side of the story with which you are familiar is the official government report, this may be an essential vision. If, on the other hand, you want a more concise (though unapologetically unilateral) version of events, you should see "Waco: The Big Lie." <br /> <br /> In short, this is the definitive documentary. about this tragic event, and it's very disappointing, but as a film-making job, I could test your patience, especially if you have a short attention span. And sometimes it is superfluous for those who attended the CSPAN hearings and the 60 Minutes reports. <br /> <br /> Maybe someday someone will make a documentary that covers some of the strangest aspects of this story, like the bizarre chain of events that led to the ATF invasion or psychological warfare tactics, the FBI used explosive rock in the sect, and its charismatic leaders (all rock musicians) took their instruments and turned their huge amplifiers to blow their own music back. for them.
