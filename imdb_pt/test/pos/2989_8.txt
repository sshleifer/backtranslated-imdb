I can barely remember that DECADE I saw this movie. That's when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started watching it as a late-night movie in the mid-1980s, and a lot of that remained with me ever since. Seeing other reviews, I had no idea it was shown in theaters, or that someone still young existed. I do not think I even mentioned the movie to anyone else. <br /> <br /> But half a life later, I still remember much of the movie I watched so late last night. I think the innocence of the characters, their situation, their mutual affection over a long period of time, left a long-term mark for reasons I do not quite understand. Maybe it's because I was a teenager at the time I saw it, and it touched me somehow ..... I really do not know! I also really wanted to know what would happen when the end of the movie happened. Oh, the agony !! <br /> <br /> I have not seen this before, or since, but I'd love to. I maintain a casual appearance, but now I doubt this has been shown and seems to have disappeared into oblivion. But I would probably miss the TV guide, even if it did. Pssttt !!! <br /> <br /> Reading the comments here has renewed my interest. If anyone knows of your availability in Australia, please e-mail me and let me know. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Sean Bury ... it's good to see you make an appearance in the comments here. I took a look at the history of your movie and noticed your last appearance in a James Bond movie. what are you doing today? Oh, and you have a copy of the movie? CHEERS!!!
