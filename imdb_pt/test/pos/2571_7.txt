In "Black Snake Moan," screenwriter and director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with the heavy symbolism that part of me felt the whole movie was pretentious - a stifling southern parable with such a risky subject. The film also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being transferred to the scene - again this is seamlessly integrated. After the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly weakens until the whole production comes out with the artificial quality of a play (and I'll admit, the last 15 minutes go a long way in the territory of "Happy Ending" to the My taste ). Not to mention the archival footage of musician Son House, ruminating on love and death (and strongly foreshadowing the things that are to come, of course). However, in a strange way, these demerits are also qualities of "Black Snake Moan", the tale about the old Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), recently abandoned by his wife (by the brother, no less), who comes across near-death. nymphomaniac Rae (Christina Ricci, easily giving the hottest picture of trailer trash in the all-time celluloid); nursing the girl back to health, he chained her to her radiator to overcome her demons, and hopefully redeem her own fallen self. While there is an extremely lascivious appeal to see Ricci fall out of her tiny costumes, her performance is risky and mature - not a trace of Addams's fourth to be found, and she easily stays with Jackson who embodies "the blues" in his portrait of a flawed and God-fearing man. Despite the heavy hand, the scene in which Lazarus sings a song for Rae in the midst of a storm / blackout is compelling, as is a scene inside a blues club that makes you wish to be there. The setting is strong, and it can be argued that literal symbolism (the stream, the radiator, the strange blurry man that haunts Rae's libido) is a deliberate consequence of superstition and spirituality. And it's the conviction with which this spirituality is touched that lends "Black Snake Moan" a lot of its strength - the compromised performances of Jackson and Ricci make this a movie that ranges from painful to uplifting with grace, well, seamless. While Justin Timberlake's envious lover is an invention of the plot that I could have done without, neither he nor the subtlety of the sledgehammer can prevent it from being a fascinatingly meditative film.
