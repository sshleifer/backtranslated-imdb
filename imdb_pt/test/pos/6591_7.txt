Ernesto is a man who earns his living deceiving other solid citizens of his hard earned money. Along with Manco, an older man with a lot of experience, he pulls out capers that allow him to live a decent life, but that does not make him a rich man at all. Enter Federico, an older man who has more experience in the art of deception. Together with young Ernesto, they are a winning combination. This only lasts until Pilar, Federico's former love interest, appears in the photo. <br /> <br /> This Spanish film directed by Miguel Bardem, is light and pleasant to sit on. Other best-made caper films were made with very clever plots, but the film is easy to pick up and sometimes has many funny situations. <br /> <br /> This viewer will see Federico. Luppi on anything, even reading the phone book! He is an actor. We had the privilege of having seen him at the Buenos Aires stage doing an excellent job before his international film career. Like Federico, he does what he does best. It is impossible to imagine anyone better in their role. Ernesto Alterio, son of Hector Alterio, is a young actor who promises to have a great career. Victoria Abril makes Pilar fun when she gets involved with these swindlers. Miguel Alexandre, a veteran actor, is also good as Manco.
