The film is a great watch very thoughtful. I think it's a movie about how it would suit you if you lived in a catalog-created world. The scenes are all perfect recreations of an Ikea catalog and even see furniture on TV. When they enter the kitchen, they create another perfect picture of what a kitchen would look like in a catalog. When he is reborn or what you would like to call, he returns to the harsh reality of life. I love the little when he says his new love, he left his partner. He mocks commercial bliss, saying you can have it all and although it's nice to have the same things but some things you do not want to share. A movie without children also by Say makes a perfect ten.
