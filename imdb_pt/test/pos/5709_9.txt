Four adorable young nurses in their senior year of nursing school experience all kinds of turmoil and excitement in their lives: sweet Susan (lovely wife Elaine Giftos) tries to comfort the bitter and terminally ill Greg (a moving performance by Darrell Larson) , anxious but the neurotic Phred (beautiful blonde Karen Carlson) celebrates the beautiful gynecologist Jim Caspar (affable Lawrence Casey), free-spirited priscilla hippie Priscilla (the incredibly beautiful Barbara Leigh) gets pregnant by the laid-back drug dealer Les Richard Rust) and compassionate Lynn (very well played by Brioni Farrell) helps the revolted Mexican revolutionary Victor Charlie (the excellent Reni Santoni). Despite the fact that this film was made for Roger Corman's legendary exploration outfit, New World Pictures, it's all but its normal, dull soft-core sling. Instead, it's a very nice, charming, and often often thought-of time capsule of the social and political upheavals of the early 1970s (the sub-story involving Lynn and the revolutionaries is especially potent and provocative). Special congratulations are in order for director Stephanie Rothman, who brings a welcome and refreshing intelligence and sensitivity to the material. In addition, the four attractive and attractive women lead solid and commendable work. Scottie MacGregor also impresses as the wise supervisor Boswell and the face of the ubiquitous 1970s trailer voice Ronald Gans provides the voice off the screen of a psychiatrist. Stevan Larner's refined cinematography, the fantastic rock soundtrack and the delightful Clancy B. Grass III soundtrack are poised for success. A real sleeper.
