Now, more than ever, we need Peace and Love in this world! <br /> <br /> This movie really shows the wonderful music of the Broadway show and the fabulous Choreography of the legendary Twila Tharp! I've seen it again after many years, and it still holds up well. <br /> <br /> Thank you, MGM / UA for putting this on DVD! I love the widescreen viewing option. MGM does this in many of its DVD releases. <br /> <br /> You have to love Treating Williams like Berger and John Savage like Claude. They could not have chosen better actors and actresses for this movie! Beverly D'Angelo is a "hot mama" in this movie - I had forgotten how hot! WOW! <br /> <br /> The cast of support is absolutely fantastic, with the late great Nell Carter making a special guest appearance in some scenes, as well as the kooky Charlotte Ray (Mrs. Garrett on ' Facts Of Life 'The story gets a little weak in the end, but the anti-war sentiment of the late 60's still holds and is relevant today. It's beautifully filmed (somewhat on location ) and it's so colorful and adorable that it really brings the spirit of 1968 back to the big screen. I saw this movie when it was released in 1979 when I was 15, and was moved by it then , and it still moves me now at the age of 40. Some other reviews here say they should have been made before - I do not think Hollywood was ready to make such a movie in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The Vietnam War ended in 1975, and the whole thing came a little close to home, I think this story should be filmed before it was (as in 1969, 70, 71) Brave to director Milos Foreman! I love this movie !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It's good to see this again, this time on DVD. Never looked better!
