One of my favorite Hartley movies. (As if there could be a "bad.") Though, this may be a bit more of the religious side of things than we would normally expect. However, he still holds that Hartley's point of view to which we all get accustomed. <br /> <br /> First picture: Jesus and Satan discussing their ideas, opinions, hopes and regrets about the imminent end of civilization. Now imagine all the conversation going on in some drinks at the neighborhood bar. And as a conversational distraction (not to mention visual), let's play PJ Harvey as the sensual companion (also known as Magdelena) for Mr. Chist. Then, just by smiles, in the background, an ever-present Salvation Army Band (played by Yo La Tengo) to serve as an additional diversion. The path to moral justification has never been a pleasure. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly more questions than answers, but there's the fun. And Mr. Donovan is brilliant, as always.
