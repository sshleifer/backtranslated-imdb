I watched pp the other night. I have to say that I was very impressed with how real the movie looked like. It was very much like a documentary. I also think the film presented realistic possibilities. In the film, the war in Vietnam intensifies to the point where China became involved. What if that had happened? I think the scenarios would be similar to the one pictured in the movie. We've had camps before in this country ... and we still do ... Highly recommended to all ... especially radical ... <br /> <br /> I kept saying that if I was in the position that those boys were in which I would just lie down. I love America and its great wars (wink wink)
