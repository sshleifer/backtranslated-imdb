Some time ago I watched a video of Paul Thomas Anderson in which he expresses the great interest he has in pornographic films and how this industry could have produced better films and as a consequence, a complete genre and not just sex in videotape . Paul Thomas Anderson put his own beliefs about the pornographic industry into the character played fantastically by Burt Reynolds. His name is Jack Horner, a director whose biggest dream is to make a "real" movie that can keep the viewer in suspense because of the great dramatic story and at the same time thrilling with beauty? and with the "big roosters and breasts". As soon as he meets Eddie Adams (Mark Walhberg), he believes he has found the new star for his films. And that's how the story of young Eddie in the porn industry begins. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a sequel inside a nightclub where we can see all the people who will be part of Eddie's life and then we can see them outside the porn industry, living their daily routine. But soon we can see them inside the porn industry and after just a party, begins the story of the new Eddie, the story of Dirk Diggler. They will all prove their real success with Dirk as the lead star, winning many awards and helping Jack make his biggest dream come true with a series of films about Brock Landers, Dirk's new character. This type of exploration film is an incredible success and, for Jack, it's his first "real" movies. But here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the "horrible '80s, when there will be $ ex, DRUGS and Rock & Roll for Dirk and his friends. But we all know that excesses can destroy anyone and erectile dysfunction can destroy any porn star and here the film focuses on their lives after total success and how everyone is having a bad time with many problems due to poor appearance of society for porn industry and for a period with too much excess. In Dirk's downfall, after trying and failing in the music industry, there is a brilliant sequel that can perfectly sum up how things are going for Dirk and his friends. This sequence is that of his first drug dealing, with the appearance of Alfred Molina, which ends in a total mess. It's funny for us and a terrible experience for Dirk and friends but there is always a solution if you go back to what you know and when Dirk is back, Brock is back. <br /> <br /> Well, I did not mention more of the characters in my resume type, but I must say that they are all incredibly well developed. The cast is simply superb with the best performance I've ever seen from Mark Walhberg. Julianne Moore has a powerful performance in a really touching character; Reilly, Macy, Hoffman, Heather Graham, Guzman, etc. are simply memorable, all their characters with funny and sad moments. <br /> <br /> Finally, I really love Anderson's incredible cinematic style here with a unique insight into the pornographic industry of the late 70's and early 80's. I used to say that "Magnolia" was my favorite of Anderson, but now, after watching everyone except "Sidney", I can not say I have a favorite because I love them all! <br /> <br />: Somewhere I read that this movie is Anderson's "Scorsese Movie", so I am more than sure that if you love "Goodfellas" and "Casino" you will also love this . F * cking love "Boogie Nights"!
