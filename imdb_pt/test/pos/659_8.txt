In fact, I had about 13 years camping near the McCloud River, near Shasta, when this movie was being filmed. My family was paid to leave our camp during the afternoon when they filmed Vincent floating downstream. A little triviality ... the scene in which they took him, was where he began to float down the river. And if the stunt man lost his net, there was a 20-foot waterfall about 1/4 mile further down. <br /> <br /> Anyway ... I watched on the hour, and could not. It was not until years later when I saw the movie and I really understood the meaning of it. It's a very powerful film and certainly a great job for Jan at such a young age. His film career never took off as expected, but of course he later found success on TV. I wish this movie was available because I would love to see it again.
