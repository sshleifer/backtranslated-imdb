I'm a glutton for B movies. I love the old Drive-In fare like this movie. This movie, made for very little money it seems, does one thing that some larger budgeted films fail. It's shocking. It's bloody. It has no real plot, but it entertained me for an hour and a half. I was laughing or covering my eyes in shock. There are some great effects such as a shot from inside a guy's mouth when he is stabbed in the chin by a knife and he pokes his tongue and hits the roof of his mouth, and a rude guy with a face getting his eyeballs ripped out. But there are also many zombies, and some psychopathic killers follow the Saw Massacre, and a demon has a scarecrow. I loved the dialogue that killers make while they torture and kill people. Has great camera work and some cool editing tricks. This is more original than the first bloodbath, and the undead look better, but it is still standardized after those nicknames of useless zombie movies of the 70s and 80s and still have a cheeze factor that ranks powerfully high. Do not expect Romero, only Fulci second-rate. I would say that Horror fans will like it, and it's funny, fun and a quick ride through the movie B Land.
