Text taken from 2001 Guide to Melbourne International Film Fest. The title is a pun based on the mispronunciation of the lead actor in the film Fabian Stratas of Falkland, a reference to the setting of the film and a little less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist. <br /> <br /> Fabian is an Argentine citizen, an amateur magician who pretends to be a tourist who visits the Malvinas soon after being reopened to his people. His master plan is to win the final fight by seducing and impregnating the local females, starting with the delicious Camilla, thus generating a whole generation of Argentinian middle. Fuckland creates the illusion of a documentary and maintains a fish-eye perspective that gives the film a voyeuristic touch and intimacy. (ARGENTINA)
