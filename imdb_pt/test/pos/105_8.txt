For a moment, let's leave aside the cultural aspects of this film, even if it's a very important side of it, and let's look at the simple fact that this is a very good love story. Two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation, caused by two selfish husbands. They have to live their sad days without any ray of hope. If each of these two women were alone, imagine what kind of life each would have to accept. They met and fell in love. That this love was against all the social, religious and cultural laws of its environment is almost irrelevant. They loved each other, found relief in each other, that was enough. The reaction of individuals around them is only a small fact that they have to accept, even suffer, and then they can continue with their lives, their lives. Very enjoyable.
