When I first saw this movie, the first thing that surprised me was the performance of Kelly Overton, a young actress I first saw totally surprised me .. she's amazing on the screen and I'm really looking forward to seeing what the future holds brings ... <br /> <br /> The movie was good in the sense of letting Kelly Overton do her things and take the wiever for a ride ... not very new tho I had the feeling that I had seen all before .. but a good experience :) I would recommend this movie ... if only to see Kelly Overton .. this stage actor takes the screen by storm .. I give this movie a vote of 7 ... 5 for the performance and 2 for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> And in one last note .. sorry about my bad English .. if this is scribble for you: p plz ignore me ...
