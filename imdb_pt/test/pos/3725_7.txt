Luc Besson's first work is also his first foray into science fiction, a genre to which he returns fourteen years later with "The Fifth Element" (1997). Even if this movie was heavily influenced by Hollywood movies, it's still very enjoyable. In 1983, "Dernier Combat" reveals Besson's own approach to science fiction. He picks up a threadbare topic and his efforts are noticeable to do a stylish job. Filmed in widescreen and black and white, a disaster has destroyed virtually the entire population of Earth and we will never know what that disaster was and why the men can not speak anymore. Some barbarian hordes were formed. At the same time, a man (Pierre Jolivet) lives alone and arrives at an unrecognizable Paris, where he is received by a doctor (Jean Bouise). <br /> <br /> There are no words in Besson's work. The actions of the characters and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures. Although the starting point and scenario are unnerving, the film never looks like a discouraged one. It seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to humanity before the disaster. The movie opens with the man having sex with an inflatable doll. Later the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. It is even more intriguing how these paintings seem to come from prehistoric times. Following this reasoning, it can be argued that the bearded giant (Jean Reno) incorporates evil and a threat to the efforts of man and the physician to recover what has finally transformed into a human being. The same goes for the bandits at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> The pessimistic smell that such a film could convey is not really on the front line and gives way to a glimmer of hope. Personally, the movie could have won without any music, except the one the man can hear with his cassette recorder. Luc Besson was doing better and still expanding films like this, he also boosted the career of Pierre Jolivet as director who will leave an uneven job behind in the future: "Force Majeure" (1989), "Simple Mortel" (1991), " Petite Entreprise "(1999) or" Filles Uniques "(2003).
