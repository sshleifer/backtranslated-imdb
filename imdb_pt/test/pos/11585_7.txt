-Faces (I): "Mar Adentro" relates the well-known story (at least in Spain) of Ramón Sampedro, a tetraplegic Galician who killed himself (helped by some friends) after 28 years prostrated by his condition. The judges repeatedly denied their petitions for active euthanasia. <br /> <br /> -Faces (II): "Inland Sea" becomes THE MOVIE OF THE YEAR in Spain. Everyone talks about it: politicians, singers, ordinary people ... Everyone likes it, even the opinions of critics are unanimous. The film wins many awards (Golden Globe, Oscar, Goya ...) and bothers the Catholic community and the quadriplegic lovers of life. A star is born. <br /> <br /> -Faces (III): The intensity and quality of the actors in "Mar Adentro" are simply incredible, and this makes me wonder, why do we have to watch the same evil young actors in the most recent films in Spanish. I do not know if Javier Bardem is a great actor or a great imitator (there is a big difference between one thing or another); in any case, his work is impressive, as is the work of Lola Dueñas, Belén Rueda, or the work of all the invited actors. This is (the selection of actors) the strong point in the movie of Amenábar. <br /> <br /> -Faces (IV): Alejandro Amenábar learned his lesson there at the Film School, no doubt: he has a privileged brain. He has a good control of each of the technical aspects, he knows what the audience wants, he knows how to play the right chord, even if it turns him into a demagogue (just as Spielberg is one of Amenábar's idols). <br /> <br /> -Faces (and V): If you criticize a movie like "Sea Out", it will seem that you have some kind of problem with the moral issue of the story. There is a trap in this kind of image: you have to differentiate between the film itself and the moral concepts. If you do not like the "Schindler List", does not that mean that you agree with Hitler's philosophy (or not?). So for me, it's a good movie and an extraordinary story (since it's a true story that makes it so much more extraordinary). Grandiloquent, egocentric, and anything but neutral (no matter what Amenabar or Bardem said about it: those characters who are not in favor of euthanasia do not come to anything good!). 50% Difficult / 50% too sentimental. <br /> <br /> -Epilogue: "Sea Inner" would not be at all in my ranking of the best 50's films of all time. No one has special merits in history, but Ramon Sampedro himself. He is the movie. Now, Alejandro Amenábar will become the most international Spanish director of all time, perhaps he will live for Hollywood; but some of us would like to see him filming a simple story without final twists, without living dead or dying alive ... "The Others" is still his best film. <br /> <br /> * My fee: 7/10
