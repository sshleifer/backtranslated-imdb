This is a silent movie. It is a simple story about a writer who can not write his story back to his hometown to begin with, but instead he engages in a friendship with a strange older man whose life externally represents perhaps the internal state of the writer - is a museum of unfinished ideas, outdated equipment and "useless" people. <br /> <br /> There are no extraordinary circumstances or great movements in the plot. It's a film about internal changes. Being stuck in their lives that are not developing much, the main characters are able to help each other to transform themselves, to leave to go out in dreams and to achieve something or at least to achieve a change and to give their life the desired and long awaited new direction . On the side of filmmaking, I can think of only one weakness that could also be considered as a feature - we do not have many character descriptions or insights from the inner world. It is very narrative on the side of thoughts and events and we have to guess about your true feelings that are quite hidden, but you can still see them, and that is what makes your mind work, trying to understand them, to understand the impressions. made by those people, and is not empty underneath - the actors definitely hold well some of their characters' internal states. It's close to real life, where you most often never know someone well enough to fully understand them, and it turns us around and puts us before our own feelings and choices. <br /> <br /> The most important thing for me is that this simple and almost flat story leaves you wondering later, about your own life, about your own dreams and achievements, is there any or are we stuck in routine and pleasures, leaving 100% or just dreaming about it, we could do more and we moved to some place where we would like to be, than just letting ourselves and other stories feed like "I'll do it someday" - do not move a finger so this really happens, or "I'm fine where I am" because it's easier to follow the habits than actually make a change? At least that is the impression that left me and was very timely for me, which enhances my appreciation for this distant film of the famous. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the movies made for the heart, but those who need events and actions should stay away.
