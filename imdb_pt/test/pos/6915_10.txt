Hell gives Los Angeles what it deserves - a baptism in fire, the death from above. An excellent cast of obsessed characters could survive and sweat the passage of coronal mass ejection, but that would not be fun and certainly would not be dramatic. A very stupid critic of Variety criticized the characters for worrying about their personal redemption rather than banishing together to save the world. But what is refreshing about this great heat is that there is nothing anyone can do about it. We are therefore mercifully not subjected to "heart-warming" scenes of fascist presidents and other great fanatic statists by inventing implausible plots to save a chosen remnant of humanity (Deep Impact). Here the soggy sweat and dirty half-dozen, fueled by lust, exercise their own redemption or face their old-fashioned personal forgetfulness - together as individuals or ...... alone with Alone. Excellent TV movie in all. Clearly undenatured by the destructive meddling of overly zealous Network Executors. I highly recommend it.
