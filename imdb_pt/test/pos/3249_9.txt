Two hands restored my faith in the Australian films. It took an old premise and made it fresh. I liked this endless movie. I recommend it to those people who like Guy Ritchie movies. Bryan Brown was fantastic and almost perfect in a paper tailor-made for him. Ledger was suitably dumb and his performance anchored a movie very satisfying to me.
