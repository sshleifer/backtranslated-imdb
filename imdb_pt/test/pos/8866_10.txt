"I know I'm human, and if you were all those things, then you would only attack me now, so some of you are still human. If it defeats us, then there are no more enemies, no one else kills him, and then he is vanquished. "<br /> <br />" The thing "by John Carpenter is one of the films the most fun terror ever made? Fast, smart, and purely thrilling from start to finish. This is how all films of the genre should be made. <br /> <br /> Occurring in Antarctica in 1982, the film focuses specifically on a group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission, but we are pushed into their existence when a pair of apparently crazy Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing after a dog that has escaped. The Norwegians are killed, and the dog enters the colony, which is when things really start to go crazy. <br /> <br /> It soon becomes clear that the "dog" is actually a change of form. alien body that manifests itself in the physical form of its victims? in other words, it begins to eat Americans and imitate them so well that the remaining humans can not discern the difference between their friends and foes. The group of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for their own survival, using intelligence instead of muscles. If the thing is really between them then how are they going to reveal it? How many things are there? How can the thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed?) <br /> <br /> The creature's origins in the film are easily explained: Thirty thousand years ago a spaceship fell to Earth and was frozen in the Antarctic ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered on ice by the Norwegians, who unknowingly freed him from his natural prison. <br /> <br /> "The Thing," the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien." "(1979) Many comparisons were made - the protagonists are stranded in a desolate area, pursued by a rarely seen enemy who manages to kill them one by one." The Thing ", for all practical purposes, came first . Based on the famous tale "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr. (written under the pseudonym of Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted as a 1951 production by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby, "The Otherworldly Thing," an indisputable classic, but to be fair it bears little resemblance to the tale, and Carpenter's remake does more justice. The idea that the Thing is capable of adapting the physicality of any person is what essentially makes this film so great, and is the most important link to the story. In 1951, the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably portray the changing body, but thirty-one years have brought "Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what could easily become an extravagant festivity into a scary (and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, though it has never really taken a specific form, is constantly seen in a stage of transformation and the effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years later. Ennio Morricone's (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a little electronic and tinny, but still haunting when used correctly. <BR> From the fact that his cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that his ending is one of the most provocative and atypical conclusions of all time, "The Thing" ?? by any standard? it's Hollywood unconventional at its best. Not surprisingly, at the time of its release, "The Thing" performed poorly in theaters, and "E.T." ??? released the same year and with a much nicer alien ?? became the highest grossing picture of the two (by far). <br /> <br /> In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and failed during its 20th anniversary re-release. "The Thing", on the other hand, gradually climbed a ladder of cult classics ?? is one of the most famous non-famous films of all time. <br /> <br /> Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career ?? from the astonishing "Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the disappointing and silly "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his best film. Although its reputation over the years has never been honorary enough to get a place on most lists of "great movies", "The Thing" is still one of my favorite horror movies, and ?? over close inspection ?? masterfully crafted. Is it a ride of bold and resourceful emotion that is both unique and creepy? a genuine relief for movie fans who are tired of the same old imitations of terror. This, at the very least, is genuinely unpredictable.
