This is not so much a review as it is a testament that has been proven, once again, that the Academy rewards money, not artistic achievement. And I must say I'm saddened by the fact that this usually artistic and intelligent band of imbd members has left it out of the top 250. Boogie Nights is powerful, raw and brave through script, direction and acting. Very few films can claim this triple crown.
