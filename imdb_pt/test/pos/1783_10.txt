Having seen the complete film that Kieslowski made of this episode of "The Decalogue" years ago, we returned to this spectator while we watched the ten complete vignettes. As with the other films, this is loosely based on the fifth commandment, or "Thou shalt not kill." <br /> <br /> Kryzsztof Kieslowski, writing with Kryzsztof Piesewicz, took a look at a young man's mind. man who commits a heinous crime in murdering an innocent person to vent his own frustrations. This plot has a Dostoevskian character that kept reminding us of "Crime and Punishment," or at least some of the novel's qualities are passed on to the aimless young man who apparently has no redemptive qualities. <br /> <br /> History shows the young man as he walks the streets of the city without a clear idea of ​​what to do or where to go. The only moment of tenderness he displays is when he visits the photographer's house to ask that an old photo of his sister be restored. Kieslowski leaves the destination for the killer to board a taxi with the intention of robbing the driver, but it is his anger and frustration that take the best of this young man to kill a man who did not deserve to die. The last moments of this criminal is one of the most exciting sequences in any film, past or present. <br /> <br /> The other element of the story is the relationship between the accused and the criminal. Nothing can stop the court from condemning the young man's death. The lawyer feels that in the end he has failed with his client and goes to the judge to see where he has made a mistake. All the young man asks is to retrieve the photo and send it to his mother. <br /> <br /> Kieslowski's account of how he interprets the fifth commandment makes an amazing film that will remain in the mind of the viewer for a long time. after that episode is forgotten.
