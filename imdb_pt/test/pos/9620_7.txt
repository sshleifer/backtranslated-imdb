The 1972 film epic "Five Fingers of Death" by Chang Kong Ho is widely considered by many movie experts and kung-fu film fanatics as the martial arts film that started it all. Being released in 1972, it was phase two of the three-step process that would lead to the explosion of martial arts films in the West - "Billy Jack" (1971), with his famous confrontation of Hapkido in the park , was released the year before, and Bruce Lee starred in "Enter the Dragon" (1973) two years later, thus solidifying the place of martial arts films in Western cinema. <br /> <br /> But what's all the commotion about "Five Fingers of Death"? The film, with its terrible action sequences of dubbing, explosive (if not highly improbable), technical flaws and everything else, has a plot, albeit very fine. Chih-Hao (the late Lo Lieh) is a young and dedicated Chinese gong-fu student who is selected to represent his school in a martial arts tournament. His teacher offers to allow him to self-train in the "Iron Fist" fighting style, a style so deadly that it could very easily kill a man with only one blow. <br /> <br /> In addition, Chih-Hao The arrival at the school coincides with a violent conflict with a rival school, its students and a trio of heavy killers of Japan. Before you know it, a big backhand threat Chih-Hao's training, and his ability to represent his beloved school in the upcoming tournament. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that "Five Fingers of Death" is actually the movie that started it all. As another viewer mentioned, "Five Fingers of Death" helped establish many standards in martial arts films over the next three decades - martial arts films in Asia, Europe, and North America. Such standards include dedicated student, patience and perseverance, conflicts between rival schools, intense ethnic animosity between Chinese and Japanese, and learning a system of struggles for the good old-fashioned motif of the action movie: revenge. "Five Fingers of Death" would also serve as a major influence on the films "Kill Bill" by American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino (Tarantino borrows quite liberally from this project, among many others, just so you know). <br /> <br /> The acting is very good considering the fact that this is a martial arts movie from the early 1970s, the best of which is Lo Lieh. As the atypical student of martial arts, his performance is quite innovative, although at first glance in this movie you really did not know him because of how this particular character arc was done so many times over the years. He is quite humble in his acting, doing all he can to persevere over his enemies and not fight them out in anger or lean to their level of stupidity or arrogance. Also, when he suffers his greatest setback, he makes his heart sink a little because it is so brutal and you wonder if he will recover enough to fulfill his ambition for life. <br /> <br /> "Five Fingers" of Death is a classic in every way. <br /> <br /> It is not perfect, and viewers would be crazy to expect something in the caliber of the "Godfather" of martial arts movies. which he offers is the best example of Eastern melee fighting since the time before Eastern cinema was a major challenge in the West. <br /> <br /> 7/10 <br /> <br /> PS: "Enter the Dragon" Bun Yeung also appears as the Mongolian street fighter near the beginning of the movie.
