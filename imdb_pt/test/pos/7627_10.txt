The ultimate dinosaur is a movie that is meant to be fun and exciting. He can do both. <br /> <br /> Maston is a great hunting hunter who hunts a great game (goes figure). Possessing a company, he plans to make an expedition with a group of people, including a photographer named Frankie, a Japanese scientist, a guy who works for his company named Chuck and an African who helped him on many safaris called Bun Ta. . The goal is to study what is believed to be the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the dinosaur that killed the last expedition to the area. They will be arriving in this prehistoric area by taking a drill vehicle traveling underwater called Polar Borer. After reaching the area, they soon find the Tyrannosaurus, which Maston tries to shoot, but his weapon gets stuck. Chuck immediately realizes that Maston wanted to hunt the dinosaur all the time to add it to his "Stuffed Animals" collection. While they were out, the Tyrannosaurus invades their camp and takes the Polar Borer away from their camp. Upon returning the group realizes that they may be in the area longer than expected and Maston claims that he will kill the Tyrannosaurus. <br /> <br /> The story is great for a science fiction movie. Punching a prehistoric area is something that really seems to happen. The scenery is beautiful and looks like a place where dinosaurs could still reside. <br /> <br /> I also liked the characters in this movie. Maston is the typical big-time hunter who wants to get anything that could be a trophy. Also great was Bun Ta, played by Luther Rackley, formerly of the NBA, who really looks and acts like an African tracker. Jackie is the typical woman who causes problems for the group and does not seem to belong to the desert. Chuck is the former employee of Maston who has his vision of his boss change when he is in the wild with him. <br /> <br /> Tyrannosaurus in this movie is one of the best in a movie. It's a little above normal, like Godzilla, and it drags the tail, so it's a guy in a suit. But the costume looks good, especially the head and tail, and Tyrannosaurus looks good and very scary. I've seen many other movies in which dinosaur suits seem a lot worse. Tyrannosaurus in this movie sometimes emits a roar sounding like Godzilla and at other times roars like King Kong of "King Kong Escapes" and "King Kong vs. Godzilla." So a great tyrannosaurus. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action in The Last Dinosaur. Of particular interest is a great struggle between Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops. Also a great scene where Bun Ta tries to launch the Tyrannosaurus. There are other big parts that I will not give. You have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. Watch out and you will not be disappointed.
