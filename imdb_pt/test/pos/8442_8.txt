It was easy to dismiss this movie as hyperbole at the time of its release. Fonda, Douglas, and Lemmon were known as "lefties," but the accident at Three Mle Island provided a shocking backdrop to this fictional drama. <br /> <br /> This film works on several levels, capturing both public services and TV news. . 1979 was the pinnacle of the infamous "Happy Talk" TV newscast (see also "Ron Burgundy") and is on display here in all its glory. The sound anchor reads a story about a "frontal collision of grinding" before cheerfully presenting Kimberley Wells (Fonda), making a story about a veterinarian making calls from home (or who is "aquarium?"). The program's producer and season manager discuss the content - or lack thereof - behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> There are some technical errors. The public relations office (James Hampton) shows Fonda and Douglas the required scale model of a pressurized water reactor plant, built by Westinghouse. Later, while Lemmon and Wilford Brimley (who play well with Lemmon's friend / colleague, caught between duty and loyalty) fight a sudden crisis in the factory control room, they obviously operate a boiling water factory (built by GE) . small point, but curious, considering how many details the writers got right. <br /> <br /> Like any good drama, the film asks more questions than answers. The TMI real-world accident proves the film's basic premise. The film's tentative title was originally "Power," and you'll see why. As nuclear energy prepares to make a comeback in these $ 3 gas days, "The Syndrome of China" is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago.
