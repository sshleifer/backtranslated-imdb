Whenever this movie is mentioned, usually the discussion begins and ends with the wonderful collection of cars and drag scenes, often overlooked are often eclectic characters who populate the film around the three central characters <br /> <br /> A character who stands out is Rebel played by great veteran Australian actor Max Cullen. Rebel is a blind trawler who almost runs over the hero and his party in the middle of the night because he is not wearing any headlights. <br /> <br /> In the background story we find that the rebellious master builder of street racing cars, and he and his wife seem locked in a fold time of the 1950s. Rebel continues to play a small but fundamental role in Mike's teaching, played by Terry Serio, the almost spiritual truth about street racing. It's not speed, reaction times that make a great rider. It's the one that feels the car that will become the biggest one <br /> <br /> This is best exemplified as Rebel explains to Mike after a test drive "You have all the agony, just lack the style" <br /> Graham Bond is another well-credited actor who lends his talent as a dishonest cop seeking to part in the financial action being generated by street races. The confrontation between Bond and Fox, played by Richard Moir, increases the tension of the story. Bond not only expects results but also Fox to boost the racing business. <br /> <br /> For most of the film, Fox exhibits a real manipulative and evil side, but at the climax he presents a sense of honor that turns the final few minutes into an extremely tense and memorable finale. It's almost as if the movie was reorienting its true intent, to show us the culture of street races instead of the daily activities of people. One of the main complaints about the film is the script. Although not exciting at all, I believe the complete lack of chemistry between Mikes' girlfriend, played by Deborah Conway and her mechanic, played by Vangelis Mourikis, has more to do with the problem. Any scene in which these two interact simply should have been cut off. <br /> <br /> Finally, in terms of actors, a truly remarkable performance is given by Kristoffer Greaves, who plays a deaf and crippled member of Fox's inner circle. His background story is never explored, he was injured in a race, born that way, what does Fox see in value to keep him around? <br /> <br /> The reality of the movie is simple, it's about street racing and the culture behind it. When the cars are flying and the action sequences are on the move, it's the only time that director John Clark and his writer Barry Tomblin seem really comfortable with what they're doing. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a deep exploration of human relationships, defining life's defining moments in drama, then this movie is not for you. If your wrist runs with the thought of a Chev Chevrolet or the iconic GTO Phase 3 shining on the streets of Sydney then you will not find much better than this movie
