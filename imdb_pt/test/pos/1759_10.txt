I first watched this in black and white around Christmas in the early sixties when it was shown on British television. I was absolutely hooked, and watched again whenever it was replayed on TV (possibly two or three times only, as it happens - if we had had video recorders, then!). As described by other contributors, the plot describes the return of Hoppity the Grasshopper, after a lost period, to an American city of the forties. He discovers that not everything is as he left it, and his good insect-friends (who live in the "lowlands" outside the garden belonging to a composer and his wife) are now under threat from "humans", who are running over broken fence that prefaces the property, using it as a shortcut. The houses of insects are being flattened by the feet, and are also often burned by cigarette butts and matches. Old Mr. Bumble and his beautiful daughter Honey (Hoppity's childhood sweetheart) are in grave danger of losing their Honey Shop to this threat. To make matters worse, devilish insect 'tycoon estate' C. Bagley Beetle has romantic designs on Honey Bee himself, and hopes, with the help of his henchmen, Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito , forcing Bumble to give her hand in marriage. <br /> <br /> Will the heroic and fearless Hoppity win? the day, and be able to save the insect community from his cowardly destination and especially his precious Honey from hers? Enjoy the classic songs ("Katy Did, Katy Did not" is a superb example, swinging, optimistic), and the colorful visuals as the tale unfolds. <br /> <br /> Time did not dull my fascination for this. animation masterpiece and storytelling, and I was very pleased to discover that it had been released on video, although I later discovered it was in NTSC PAL format. No matter, I sent the video immediately, and only then did I buy a TV / video combo combination (complete with NTSC playback). <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed many nostalgic visions ever since, and found that television rights changed from the BBC (which informed me that they would probably never show the film on any of their stations) to FilmFour, which !) showed it on her digital stations in early 2007. <br /> <br /> My granddaughter (three years old) was absolutely delighted as we watched her together - and this is a child that was influenced by the digital age and resulting computer generated productions! <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie for any age, and especially the youngest of the viewers. <br /> <br /> Give Max Fleischer a posthumous Oscar!
