The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: Henry's "The Gunfighter" and John Ford's "Wagon Master". "The Gunfighter" was historically noteworthy, as it clearly influenced the westerns of "High Noon" (1951) and then Zimmerman's revisionists. <br /> <br /> However, I personally find the "Wagon Master" superior to its contemporary equivalent. Ford's minor masterpiece is not much about narrative; should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of the old west. Although optimistic and warm at heart, we are deserving of naivet√© because it is completely free from underplaying pretentiousness. The border scenario is well used because it perfectly supports the poetic narrative. Add a naturalistic camera job and we are transported among Mormon travelers to witness the western folklore told in the film mediums.
