Yes great cult TV series. Great atmosphere, top script and good performances make this a class A candidate for DVD release. <br /> <br /> This is a seminal tour de force of Australian TV history and has that unforgettable vintage soundtrack with the voice of boulder and phlegm of Doug Parkinson spitting the Australians of the 70s all over their box of cathode rays reveals the religion of the open road in all its anti-Macedonian glory. This is a remembrance of another time and not too far away, and has the proud seal of the mighty earth Down Down from beginning to end in all its raw freedom and gritty grandeur. <br /> <br /> Come to ABC! Follow the program and release this adorable 70's cult baby so everyone can have fun - or have fun again if you're lucky enough to have lived the dream at the time.
