This is a difficult show to watch. Not something to sit and relax. It kept me at the edge of my seat for several seasons. People get screwed, raped, tortured and die like flies. There are male organs everywhere, there is excrement, vomit and blood. Oz is a brave show. It brings up issues such as racism, homosexuality, prisoners' reality and, above all, -death penalty. It is, in my opinion, also successful in doing so, unlike, for example, the single "Medium." <br /> <br /> He bored me sometimes. I had some weird plots and they spent a lot of time in characters that just did not interest me. Oddly, I found the first season quite annoying. If I had watched while it was on the air, I do not think I would have continued to watch it. I love seasons 2 - 4. Season 5 and 6 are watchable, (although I do not think it should be allowed to pronounce the words "Cyril" and "Death Row" in the same sentence) There are so many characters wonderful to cheer. The old Bob and Busmalis, for whom I fell in love from day one. Said Adebesi, Pancamo and Schillinger, four very strong and charismatic leaders in their own way. Augustus Hill, whose monologues tied the episodes together efficiently. Staff with people like Sister Pete and Ray Mukada - also brilliant. Also minor characters that were only for a few episodes or a few seasons, but left a good impression as well. <br /> <br /> My favorites are the O'Reily brothers. Their relationship was the most harrowing and heartwarming I've ever seen on television. If there's something I'll always remember about this show, it's them. There will never be another "pairing" or what to call it, that will make me suffer so much. That's why, when the ends get to them too, they almost hurt a lot. I wish it had never happened. I wish I had never attended. <br /> <br /> But a good Fontana. I recommend.
