This movie is one of my best childhood memories. Seeing the Muppets (at the height of their popularity) driving Hollywood, singing and dancing, with Miss Piggy googely-eying her beloved Caco, Fozzie Bear doing her best as everyone manager, and a generous cast of "extras" delivering a movie that has become "okeykey". Kermit's scintillating "Rainbow Connection" number was nominated for an Oscar that year, but was defeated by Norma Rae's "Go Go Like It Goes." I'll get the Kermit song sometime! Take the children and enjoy this timeless fantasy ... someday they will find, rainbow connections, lovers, dreamers and me!
