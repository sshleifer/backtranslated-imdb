From acting to Cardone's direction, this new twist on the familiar ghost theme made wrong, will keep you glued to your place. Slow sometimes because it builds this tension "what will happen". Medium-well in Gore but the ones there are pretty nasty. The death of the jockhole and subsequent feast is a highlight for gore dogs. <br /> <br /> Writers crafted an old story, but added twists and re-imagined you typical haunting. Cardone brings that to life. . . er. . uh death. <br /> <br /> Lori Heuring, Scout Taylor-Compton and the ever-fabulous Ben Cross are real, there are no signs of acting here. Everyone in the cast is committed and really is not what any director strives for. The actors believe, so we believe. <br /> <br /> Along with the traditional story of ghost surprises the movie is loaded with tons of atmosphere, mine, Hank's house and Tunny's house, there is a creepy fear of the first frame to the last. <br /> <br /> Terror fans, do yourself a favor and enjoy what is one of the true horror movies that exist today. <br /> <br /> I end up with a great kudo to Boaz Davidson (story) Ben Nedivi (screenplay), for not having inventive writers, Hollywood would be nothing more than an ugly reality show party.
