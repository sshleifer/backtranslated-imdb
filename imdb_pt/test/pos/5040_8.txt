Possibly John Travolta's best role ever. Saturday Night Fever was a great movie and role, but a long time ago. I can not think of many of your movies or roles that I liked, and it's easy to think about the rotten ones. He can do wicked like in Pulp Fiction, but he makes the perfect funky angel, and it's hard to imagine someone doing a better job (equally slender) with him. Plot summaries are available everywhere, but the plot is not the point. Just go for the ride and enjoy the cleverness of the little funnies along the way. There's nothing to dislike about this movie unless someone is looking for something deep. I wish there were more movies like this. We need a deep or striking break or horrible or complex or hysterical.
