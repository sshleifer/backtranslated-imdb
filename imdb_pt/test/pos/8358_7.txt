Aslan Adam, or Lionman as it is most commonly known among the English-speaking audience, begins with an epic battle as King Solomon and his army defeats a lot of guys, though I'm not sure who they were and the film itself is not very helpful in establishing the fact. Anyway, after King Solomon killed all these guys, Princess Mary, Bishop Osorio and Commander Antoine are forced to sign a treaty that allows King Solomon to rule virtually everything in sight. Soon after Princess Mary seduces Solomon and they have sex, meanwhile, in the shortest wedding ceremony (only two sentences) Antoine married Princess Mary and is planning to rebel against Solomon and win a sweet revenge in the process. Antoine and his guards attack and kill Solomon, despite his pregnant wife Princess Almunia escaping with his protector Rostin with Antoine's guards in pursuit after the shortest job ever (less than 5 minutes or the time it takes to run around of a shrub) Princess Almunia gives birth to a boy who is hidden in some bushes of the guards of Antoine. Unfortunately, when Rostin tries to recover the little boy, he discovers that the baby was adopted by Lion's pride as one of his! Year after and evil Antoine now rules treating his subjects without mercy, Princess Maria gave birth and he has a son, but Rostin is still kicking the attempt to set up a gang of rebels to overthrow Antoine, the task seems hopeless unless who can count on the help of the legendary lion-man who is more ferocious than man ... This Turkish-Greek co-production was directed by Natuk Baytan as Natuch Baitan & is a type of film, I found it hilarious, but at the same time immensely fun. The script never seems to take seriously, it's a very funny movie, sometimes it moves like a rocket and it's never monotonous or boring, and some of the dialogues dubbed in English are hilarious in the context of what's happening on the screen. None of this makes sense, we have a boy created by Lion, an evil king, betrayal, obscure family secrets, birthmarks that form the Lion form in an element of the story that was present before the boy was raised by Lion, crazy fighting scenes, torture scenes where people must be tied to quakes, ancient castles interiors that randomly contain zip yarns and gymnastic rings, idiot thugs who seem to have extensive facial hair and a central character who has a jaw line similar to a house brick, can be stabbed twice, has acid-coated hands (this acid can eat through steel traps, but is kept in a ceramic jar!) and drop more than 20 feet into a concrete floor! Aslan Adam is an incredibly entertaining movie, I do not think I've seen another movie that I can compare too, if you're looking for something serious, then forget about it, but if you like 'so bad, they're -good type movies and wants to have fun, laugh and have fun, then Aslan Adam should be at the top of his list. Total 100% gold for fans of bad movies and those with a taste for the different and bizarre. On the disappointing side, Lionman only gets his steel claws 10 minutes before the end, which is a shame. Director Bayten certainly keeps things moving at a brisk pace, though it's far from being well done during the opening battle. One moment guys are fighting on a sand dune in the next of them on a grassy hill with trees in the background! There's a point where Lionman uses a "branch" for pole vaulting, but it's obviously just a long tube with a creeper wrapped around him! Then there's the scene in which a bloodthirsty bunch of hunting dogs supposedly pursues the Lion Man, but used dogs are obviously different breeds including some of the most harmless dogs of all time! There are so many individual scenes in Aslan Adam that are just hilarious, stupid, bizarre or all three that I could go on forever. Just check the end, when the Lionman is jumping and flying all over, as if he could fly. There is a lot of blood in Aslan Adam, although there is not much violence or the flu, some stabbings and someone has their hands cut off is as graphic as possible. <br /> <br /> Technically, Aslan Adam is quite unpredictable, the period the costumes are bright and gaudy with purples, yellows, reds and various other bright colors. The fight scenes are cheap, but at least the filmmakers tried to put as much action as possible. The song seemed more suited to a classic ballet than to an action movie and is another bizarre aspect to Aslan Adam. The acting was poor, even dubbed that you could say that the acting was bad. <br /> <br /> Aslan Adam is pure gold from beginning to end, there are so many things to like, laugh and enjoy in this movie that I ended up really enjoying. By no means, Aslan Adam can be considered a good movie in any sense of the word, but it's a hell of a fun. I may have to watch this soon, just to prove to myself that I did not dream at all! The best Turkish action movie about a man created by Leo that you will never see, period. It proved popular enough to generate a sequel, Lionman II: The Witchqueen (1979).
