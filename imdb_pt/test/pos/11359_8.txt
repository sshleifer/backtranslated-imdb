MY DINNER WITH JIMI is a glimpse of Howard Kaylan's dizzying and dizzying ride to fame with his 60's folk band, The Turtles. Tortoises were a kind of 'second level' act during the sixties, but the film clearly demonstrates that they could eat, drink and party with the hippie culture titans. And, not only that, they had the musical talent to support him. Many of the season's star acts are seen when they interact with the band at work and at leisure. This provides my only complaint about the movie. Almost since the beginning of the film, it has been found that it is almost impossible to find actors who can convincingly represent such recognizable stars. Often during the film I felt I was witnessing an engaging display of wigs and fake mustaches. But, if you're a fan of The Turtles, or The Swinging 60's music in general, this may be the movie for you. And do not forget to see the extras. There's a very funny (and informative) part of band members Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan about their disastrous experiences with managers and agents.
