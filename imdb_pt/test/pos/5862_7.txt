"Murder by Numbers," by Barbet Schroeder, starring Sandra Bullock, is a solid, though not particularly attractive, work. I am a big fan of Sandra Bullock, and she is effective here as a forensic detective Cassie Mayweather, who is not very friendly and a broken person as well. However, there is a sense of detachment inherent in the structure of history. It's about the perfect murder run by two spoiled sociopath teens, Richard (Ryan Gusling), who is the cool one, and Justin (Michael Pitt) who is the likable geek. Basically, Richard and Justin kill a young woman because they have nothing better to do on a school night. They are very intelligent and very arrogant, which is not usually a bad thing, but it just does not work here. Tony Gayton's script does a great job of detailing the investigation of an intriguing murder, and it's really about the numbers. We have these two punk boys showing their superiority and we just want them to fall. <br /> <br /> This is not a big exploration of the somber side, like Schroeder's "Reversal of Fortune" about Claus von Bulow. There are interesting curves in "Numbers". The film is not so much a thriller, but a character study of Cassie. Sandra Bullock balances Cassie's bravery, her fear of letting people in with her and her secret past. Bullock brings courage and strength to a character who suffers. His partner and kind of love interest, Sam (played by Ben Chaplin), is more a revealing plot than a real character. Although Chaplin does the perplexing thing very admirably. The other nice touch is having Richard and Justin engaged in a strange sexual attraction. The most interesting thing about "Numbers" are Pitt and Gusling. <br /> <br /> There are lots of fun twists throughout the movie. Everything is done with a lot of competence. I saw the movie about a week ago and in retrospect, I like it a little more than when I saw it. However, it is not just an inspired work. Sandra Bullock and Barbet Schroeder deserve much better, and so do we.
