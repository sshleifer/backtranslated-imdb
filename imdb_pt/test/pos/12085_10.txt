I've seen this movie for a long time, but it remains in my memory as the saddest movie of all time. I cried non-stop. My mom will never watch this movie again because it's almost painful to watch. Anyway, in addition, the story is not exactly complex ... Ann Margaret is dying and has to donate her 10 (?) Children. As if that were not enough, it is during the depression and she has to break the brothers next, one by one. I think this was very sad for me because I am also from a very close family and could identify with the pain of each child leaving their mother and siblings. <br /> <br /> Maybe I am a masochist, but I would like to see this film again because it was well done and the end, surprisingly, is slightly happy (at least we could smile and sob simultaneously). It should come on the TV at some point so I can see it again.
