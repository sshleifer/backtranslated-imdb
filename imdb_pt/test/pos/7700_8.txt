This story happens in Wisconsin. I was kind of watching my tape when I heard the name Appleton. I was not sure where it was happening until I heard them say Green Bay and then realized it was Wisconsin. Watching confirmed it even more. Eagerly awaiting the result, I could feel Corrine's frustration. I did not know it was fact-based until the end. It made me happy, but sad and wanting to know more.
