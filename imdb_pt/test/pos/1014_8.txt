I finally saw LAURE and I have to say I liked it and I was scared about it. What's great about it is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. The story is non-existent for sure, but with these movies it does not really matter. The pace in the languid and the settings are exotic. The movie has a lot to do with it. Unfortunately, there are also some things against it. The first thing is that beautiful Annie Belle and beautiful Al Cliver have no chemistry whatsoever. Because the two are playing a couple and are on the screen for almost the entire length of the film, the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite responsibility. According to IMDb, Al and Annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie. They were sure to be drawn to each other on the screen. <br /> <br /> The other problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are ineffective or even ridiculous. There is a sex scene that stands out as one of the most silly I have ever seen in any pornographic film: our young blonde couple is caught by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross-dresser! The pilot flies over the city to get his girlfriend (!) And they have a sort of orgy in the helicopter, in the air. And Al Cliver is filming it all with his 16mm camera! I'm not kidding with you. Ridiculous. Later, we see 16mm images being edited in a moviola. As the footage rolls, Al and Annie begin to kiss. This scene is really good, but the filming on the screen behind them was sometimes too much. Watching the footage of the cross-dresser with his bimbo while piloting the chopper almost made me roll on the floor laughing loudly. Is this supposedly erotic or believable in any way? The last thing I want to see is a woman giving pleasure to a man in the drag, certainly when the man of trawl makes a woman so ugly while piloting a helicopter, not less. Al and Annie doing this was cool as was the music throughout the scene. I just wanted the footage on the editing screen was not so silly. <br /> <br /> Speaking of drag, another boring plot in LAURE that really drags the movie are all those moments with the great Orso Maria. Guerrini and his two wives. A married trio is an interesting idea, but hardly registers here as hot or even interesting. The two women are kind of dull and we rarely see all three having sex. In fact, Orso keeps his clothes on for most of the movie, even when he's with Annie Belle. This is another small complaint about LAURE: there is nudity, but not as much as other films from the same era. I just needed more skin to punch. <br /> <br /> Except for those minor complaints and drag queen moments, LAURE is really very watchable. I love this kind of 1970s softcore movie, when attention was put on the mood and atmosphere, not the raw things we see today. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> ps: be sure to watch Emanuelle in Egypt, starring Annie & Al, but also another famous couple of screen, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. The music in this movie is great, too.
