Four young Latter-day Saints from the Mormon country go to LA to preach the gospel to the urban pagans. But one of the young Mormons is a repressed gay who "happens" to cross paths with a young LA party. (What movies would be without coincidence?). These two very different young people become friends and, in the process, affect each other's perspective, which in turn creates an inevitable clash between gay and Mormon cultures. <br /> <br /> This is the premise of "Latter Days," a 2003 film written and directed by C.Jay Cox, himself a former Mormon missionary. The story of the film is, of course, highly relevant, especially in contemporary America. Variations of this story need to be told, retold and retold hopefully in future films ... because the underlying theme brings to light the hatefully superior attitude that Christian fundamentalists often demonstrate toward gays. By its nature, "Last Days" is provocative, and I doubt the film was well received in Provo or Pocatello, even though the screenplay is intelligent, sensitive, and insightful.
