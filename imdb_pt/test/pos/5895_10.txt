Thirty years before the CERVANTES DEER came this film, an excellent meditation on the effects of the war inflicted upon the American family as seen from both the war heroes and their wives. A truly ironic title, the best years of our lives is everything, but since those times have disappeared into still images and all that remains is an uncertain future for those involved. Truly a cast despite the top-Myrna Loy's treatment, the best years of our lives focus more on the stories of men. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) returns to a house that has changed irrevocably as his children grew up, though he finds support from his loving wife Milly (Myrna Loy). Fred Derry, on returning, can not find a decent job despite being a war veteran and is stuck in a marriage he does not want Marie, a carefree girl who wants more out of life and who increasingly comes to hate him . Homer Parrish, on the other hand, has bigger problems due to the loss of warring hands and feels that the whole world - including the girl he loves and his family - thinks he is a freak of nature. <br /> <br /> With almost three hours in length, the film never seems long and drawn out. There is so much thrill going on even in small moments that the breeze plot; nothing seems to be wasted or placed on the screen due to lack of editing. It's not a fake performance, although the highlights are Dana Andrews as Fred Derry, Harold Russell as Homer Parrish and Virginia Mayo as Marie Derry. Even so, each character has its moment in the film, and it's time to talk about all the pain and suffering that had not been seen in American movies (including those made around World War I, which were not interested in such films). topics). Although there is never any obvious violence, it is all there, in the haunted expressions of the three male faces, in the place where the planes now reside, ready to be trashed (and therefore oblivious), into the cynicism of shop owners who do not they bothered to employ those men in shock who had seen the battle or, worse yet, to induce them to imagine what it would be worth. This is the movie in which COMING HOME and BORN ON THE QUARTER OF JULY are in debt. At a time when the United States fled the war films, thinking about it when the end of World War II was still fresh was a necessity to make a more honest film.
