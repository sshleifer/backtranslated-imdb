The "Puppet Master of Yong-ki Jeong with only scary parts" was the latest Korean horror film I had the pleasure of seeing. With the title "Inhyeongsa" in Asia, this film immediately surprised me when I saw it being reviewed online, with images that made me think of Puppet Master, Childs Play and other horror films based on dolls in the past. But for some reason I did not think ... "Boy, this is going to be cheesy," I figured it would be scary and fun. The horror of the toy was almost done well. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly, but I like it, so that's fine. The score, almost as I found Acacia, was beautiful and very reminded me of classic horror scores of the past. I will not give much, but the story was strong on this one, and I recommend it to any fan of Asian terror. It's not extreme, it should not be taken with the utmost seriousness, but it's really good.
