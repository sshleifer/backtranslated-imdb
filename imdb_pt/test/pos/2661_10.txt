The self-awakening of Humanity is the theme of "2001: A Space Odyssey," a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. We "see" our primordial past and "infer" a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception in our continuous collective journey. From this transcendental perspective, a conventional and egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our frantic conflicts and important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary changes, and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is far beyond understanding. It is a difficult lesson for a vain and aggressive species. Not surprisingly, then, some of us huff and puff over the slowness of the film and minimal story. For perceptive viewers, pay is an inspiring feeling of admiration and admiration. <br /> <br /> In this film, which is mainly visual, the geometric symbols guide our intuition. Circles and arcs represent nature. Straight angles represent conscious intelligence. Some people think that the black monolith is a Von Neumann probe. Perhaps. Undoubtedly, the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown. The mystery is deeper than the explanation. <br /> <br /> "2001 ..." is unique among films in content and scope. Cinematography is out of this world, special effects and visuals are breathtaking and classical music is sublime. I rarely use the word "masterpiece" to describe a movie. But "2001: A Space Odyssey," by Stanley Kubrick, is art in the highest sense, such as Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa," or Vincent van Gogh's "Starry Night."
