The film Night Crossing captures the feelings experienced by the vast majority of East Germans during the period 1961-89. I lived in West Berlin for most of 1967 and traveled through The Wall to East Berlin on a weekly basis. Because? Emotion, crossing a border in a Soviet ruled country, experiencing the smells and the East German feel, and that's why Night Crossing is great, it captures that feeling and it's exciting. I was arrested by the Vopos at Checkpoint Charlie and approached by a man in his leather jacket and sunglasses that I was led to believe was Stasi. When I watch the film, I smell cheap diesel and cooking oil, I can see the outdated vehicles, the monotonous clothes that the public wore and the dull products in the shop windows. It brings back memories of realizing how lucky I was to live in a free country. In 1988, I visited the GDR from east to west, north to south. East Germany had changed little since 1967. The Trabants, in constant collapse, were still the main means of private motorized transport, the shops still did not have much to try, uniforms were still common, but ordinary people were open and good when you gained their trust. Watch Night Crossing, it's as close to the truth as any movie you'll see in Germany divided, even closer than two other favorites The spy who came from the cold and funeral in Berlin.
