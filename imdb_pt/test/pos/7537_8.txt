As hilarious as the 1950s British comedy might have, THE BELLES OF ST TRINIAN'S has almost a gag a minute ... and in the 91st minute is a great opportunity. Other films I also recommend from the same period are THE TITFIELD THUNDERBOLT and THE GREEN MAN. In fact, any movie with Alistair Sim or Terry Thomas, George Cole, Richard Wattis or Joyce Grenfell or any combination is a delight. in ST TRINIAN, we have a double dose of Sims doing two roles with that hilarious disdain that he constantly lets go through his face. Joyce Grenfell, like Ruby Gates (oh dear, that name!), Makes the "gay hockey sticks" incognito to hilarious perfection. Possibly the best laughs come from George Cole as Flash Harry (who comes out of a bush when whistled) and several visits to classrooms by Miss. Fritton (Sims) reacting to explosions ('Oh poor Betty!') Or science lab gin production ('just send some bottles of it to my room.' ") Every part of the movie is funny about the characters, their fantasies, the sequels, but the first three are the best: including this one, BLUE MURDER IN ST TRINIAN'S, and later in ROBBERY'S COLOR OF THE GREAT TRINIAN TRAIN.
