Having never read or seen the original work of the Bardo, I can not begin to compare this work with its history. Then, I will not go. Instead, I'll just say that this was a very entertaining story with some very nice special effects (and some that seemed a bit smaller in budget but still decent enough to enjoy). I found that all the primary actors did a great job. The spell style looked more black than white and it would almost certainly offend someone easily upset about this sort of thing, but I thought it was well done.
