This film makes several nods for several science fiction films. The prologue reminds me of the original theatrical version of the THX-1138 (the BUCK ROGERS trailer, here were clips from one of the first Japanese SF programs). Then the opening shot of the city in 2345 has the dragon flying over the head with a billboard, reminding one immediately of BLADERUNNER. The BLADERUNNER aspect comes even more pronounced when we find the hero, who is called the Replicator (He is blonde and is called Ryo, a tribute to Roy Batty, Rutger Hauer's character in BLADERUNNER?). A battle scene soon begins, which immediately resembles MATRIX. The government forcing people to use drugs is like the THX-1138 and the police chief, although it looks like a cross between Elvis and Dan Ackroyd, turns out to be a robot, much like TERMINATOR. The final battle resembles one of TERMINATOR 2 and the end result is hilarious. Probably not one of the best SF movies out there, but it's nice, certainly much nicer than guts like BATTLEFIELD EARTH.
