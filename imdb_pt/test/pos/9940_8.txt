If you're okay with the strange work of the premier horror director of Italy, able to accept your scandalous story lines and extravagant style then you should have a great time with Opera. If you do not then you will not. <br /> <br /> Cristina Marsillach plays Betty, a beautiful young opera opera star who is shot in fame (in an avant-garde production of Macbeth) when the star of the show is hit by a car. As any actor who has "stepped on the boards" will know, Macbeth is a production that carries a curse - and Betty soon discovers that the series in which she is now the star is no exception: a killer is systematically dismissing the team on the spot. theater and poor Betty is forced to watch for the sadistic killer (who records needles under her eyes to stop her from closing them!). With the help of a girl crawling through her air-conditioning ducts, her director and agent, and a few crows who saw the face of the killer (!!!), Betty discovers the identity of the killer , and the truth about his mysterious past. <br /> <br /> Let's face it ... Opera is a crazy movie, with its absurd twists, complicated death scenes and a final that defies belief. And while director Dario Argento has never been one for, let's say, conventional story lines, this particular giallo is so stupid, and features many of his stylish touches (all augmented to the max), which is almost as if, with each film successive, he is seeing what he can do (sometimes parodying his previous work). <br /> <br /> That's exactly why I find the movie so much fun !!! <br /> <br /> The movements of the Argento camera are absolutely incredible: gliding, crawling and, in an incredible scene, even reaching around the opera house above the audience; the power of Verdi's music blends perfectly with the majesty of Claudio Simonetti's synthesizer, providing suitably grandiose accompaniment to sumptuous visuals; and several exceptional set-pieces (with Sergio Stivaletti's nauseating FX) prove that no one dies better than Argento (check out the death of a character in which a bullet passes through a spy hole in a slow-moving door and directly into your eyes!). <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.
