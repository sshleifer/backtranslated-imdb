So forgive the game scene, the cardboard and the studio. For this part I should have given the film 5 instead of 7, but read on ... <br /> <br /> From the premise to the plot there are many similarities to "The Replacements". Some say that this movie rip off "The Replacements", while some say this script wrote before. Both films require some sort of "disbelief suspension on the basic premise, and this is especially difficult for" Second String "since it has the NFL licensing team and the whole story behind it. sounds very lame to some people, and not to mention in "Second String" Bills have to overcome great scores again and again, with the limited budget in filming the game scene, this makes it look even bad. In "Replacements," the premise and league is fictional, but you know it happens in real life. I believe it's easier to accept fictional story and scenario with actual event ("Oh yes, this happens before!" Instead of real scene / background with fictional scenario ("There's no way Bill can win a Superbowl!") Some of the scenes were actually filmed in pre-season games of Raven's games, real stadium, real audience and some NFL games the same). <br /> <br /> But let's say that both movies came out the same day, and we erased the budgeting factor (well, ive the action scene game): Overall, I like "second chord" over "replacements", not by much, but I like it more. <br /> <br /> It has a "relatively better" character development. In "Replacements," the character Keanu is "out of sync with the world," and all he cares about is maybe getting a girl? In Second String you see QB's struggle to get the job back, and deals with his past with the coach. Or the fumble-type problem. This "hold the ball all day" solution, of course, is not new, but we see the progression when fixing it. <br /> <br /> What about the tricks? I think it's "relatively realistic" than "replacements". The "Dan Marino" as fake pass on the knee, flicker-flicker, wild cat back back rush, all real except sometimes this look a bit too easy. But for me, it's better than the central bet of "Replacement" and the 50-yard race, or how a 60-yard goal looks very easy. OH BTW, I'm glad they did not force the TE kicker to do their shooting .... Of course - if you objectively revise this movie about other football films there, it could easily be a 5 out of 10 movies. But some say that this is the worst football movie? Try "The Comebacks".
