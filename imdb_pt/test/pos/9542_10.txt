This wonderful film never stopped moving me. Color, compelling cast and stunning scenery make great contributions. This production, unlike Carlton's later remake, is more impressionistic and more presented from the perspective of the children themselves. It focuses on certain episodes of the charming story of E. Nesbit rather than trying to make a somewhat more documentary style of "warts and everything" that Carlton adopts. Above all, the great soundtrack of the late Johnny Douglas sustains the story throughout, adding extra emotional depth. The net result is a truly formidable combination of sensory experiences that cumulatively depict the moving story of "The Railway Children." An uncomfortable factor for the viewer to ponder throughout this movie is how things have changed since those times - and in many ways, for the worse! Yes, perhaps many of us no longer need to use outside restrooms and travel on horse-drawn carts, but what about quality of life in general? Consider the runaway celebrities who now "grace" our TV screens. His language is now apparently considered perfectly acceptable. Consider also the fragile "here today, tomorrow" aspects of many of today's "partnerships," as well as all single mothers - what happened to that institution called "marriage," when people accepted each other's faults, but still they remained together. loving your children? These details add more pungency when watching this wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> I hope that as the generations go by, children can still enjoy this movie. Not to mention some adults!
