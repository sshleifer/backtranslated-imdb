Beautifully constructed, "Traffik" tells the story of the use and trade of narcotics from multiple points of view. From the point of view of a policeman, a political vision, a vicious vision, the vision of a smuggler and the vision of a farmer. In a carefully constructed plot, we get the impression of how everything is interrelated. From beautiful photos in poppy fields in Pakistan, downtown Karachi, Frankfurt and London airports, in the old buildings where smuggling occurs, we see the enormous size of narcotics consumption.
