If the legendary masterpiece of Monte Hellman's 1970s road movie, "Two-Lane Blacktop," had been made more like a firm, stripped, fiercely tense and straightforward temper, embellished by that distinctive stingy, rough and difficult, very crude and raggedly macho Australian mentality and culminating with a generous pungency of punk nihilism, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless of any sort of end-of-the-road, would undoubtedly be very similar to this somber and atmospheric knockout. Friendly factory worker Mike (a scruffy Terry Serio) comes into conflict with the sarcastic Fox, the fascist car racing champion Fox (a perfectly odious Richard Moir), when he steals Julie, Fox's attractive girlfriend. his. Mike and Fox begin to compete in increasingly lethal races in which stakes are getting higher and higher with each successive fight, culminating in an all-or-nothing race with only one true winner allowed. Mike, aided by his worried but loyal mechanic friend Tony (a splendidly smooth turn of Vangelis Mourikis) and guarded by an extremely modern blind style rebel (wonderfully rehearsed with Max Cullen), voluntarily puts his life on the line because of his reputation, the affection of his old lady, the money and, most importantly, the chance to bring down the arrogant Fox from his arrogant and glowering thrown. Directed with extreme gravity and intensity by John Clark, written to laconically correct perfection by Barry Tomblim, with a Peter Crosbie soundtrack and a flickless cinematography by David Gribble, this authentically rude item from the 80s features not only race car concept as an alternative lifestyle, but also an obsession and a reason for life that consume everything (it's the thing that most of the characters in the film is really passionate about) with a remarkably shrewd and unblinking look. Complete with a pungent pungent ending and an intrepid and unpleasant message about the bitter price paid for being the best dog, this fascinating representation of a dead-end existence is an extraordinary cinematic achievement.
