I'm not kidding with you. Yes, "Who's That Girl" has the distinction of being one in a series of Madonna films that bombed, but I really enjoyed this movie more than "Desperately Seeking Susan." In "Susan," Madonna's character is relegated to being Rosanna Arquette's second violin and does not have much to work on. No disrespect to Rosanna, but in WTG Madonna plays this bizarre and outrageous character, done only in a style of the 80's. Although it may seem tacky today, this is actually one of Madonna's best movies and one of her most underrated films. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a former drug dealer who is sent to crime for a crime. she did not compromise. She is being released from prison after four years of good behavior. Griffin Dunne, who is also a very underrated actor, plays Louden Trott, a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from the jail to take her to the bus station. Of course, when those two come together, that's when madness happens. Sir John Mills has a small role as the wealthy businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of Manhattan with a rainforest (???) on his roof. <br /> <br /> This movie spoofs everything. Rich people, the despicable characters who live in Harlem and totally destroy Louden's Rolls-Royce, the gay cops who follow Madonna and Dunne around town, and Dunne's boyfriend Wendy Worthington who allegedly slept with all the taxi drivers in New York by Haviland Morris, who was Jake's girlfriend, Caroline in Sixteen Candles). Hilarious! In addition, Dunne is also responsible for a rare breed of leopard reminiscent of "Bringing Up Baby." In addition, Madonna had a great 80's blonde platinum look back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack. Throw all this into the mix and you'll get the WTG pomp. <br /> <br /> Madonna is the queen of expressionless acting. There are moments in the movie where she says a straight line and surprisingly, ends up being funny! This is how some of the best comedies should be played - straight. Madonna should have done more comedy and it was a shame she did not choose to do it. She later became much more controversial and became involved in more dark and sexually charged roles in the notorious "Body of Evidence" and "Dangerous Game" films. <br /> <br /> Some people say that Madonna can not act, and that's fine, people are entitled to opinion, but I believe the real problem is that people can not see the difference between Madonna playing a character in the film, I still see only Madonna and that is the main reason she is given more respect for her music than her films. It's still a fun comedy from the 80's. Not for everyone, I'm sure some of you will not like it, so I'd recommend it mostly to Madonna fans, but you never know, you might be surprised and pleased! Interesting note: One of Madonna's friends in her early 80's in New York, Coati Mundi, who plays Raoul, was a member of the bands Kid Creole and The Coconuts and Savannah Band.
