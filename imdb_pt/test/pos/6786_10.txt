I just wanted to say that I'm watching National Velvet on TV, now it's February 2006 and I was checking details of dates, etc. Surprising to see it was done in 1944 and Rooney was 24 while Liz Taylor was only 12, what a talented English actress she is. <br /> <br /> To put some right American contributors: There are no Irish villages in England. Ireland is a completely different country and has nothing to do with the English countryside. The scenes shown are supposedly taken on the south coast of England between Brighton and Arundel (Sussex County). No scene exists now unfortunately. Like many other places, roads and buildings were built on the hills and beaches. <br /> <br /> So, please, all of you, lovely Americans, do not confuse Ireland with England, ever! we make a big exception to that. How to confuse Texas with Coney Island.
