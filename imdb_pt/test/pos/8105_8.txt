I once took a 20-minute part of this movie at Turner Classic Movies about 6 months ago. I thought every minute of what I was watching was golden, and because I was somewhere in the middle of the movie and I did not want to ruin the whole thing if I watched it from the beginning, I decided I would rent it right away. Well, the video store I frequent does not have a copy, so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it. Previously, I had seen some Chaplin shorts, funny but not very ingenious, but after I saw the excerpt from The Great Dictator, I checked three of his other films, City Lights, The Gold Rush and Modern Times. great, I found the Gold Rush a bit overrated but it was still worth it, and I found Modern Times one of the funniest movies I've ever seen (second funniest thing behind Keaton's Sherlock Jr., more exactly) But, to be honest, he had his moments of both comedy and drama, but those moments do not always blend well. <br /> <br /> Chaplin's comedy worked well when mixed with melodrama ( City Lights is the best example of this), but it did not always work with social commentary, in addition, the fact that there was dialogue diminished the strength of Chaplin's talent, do not get me wrong, I liked the movie as a whole, but I thought of minor importance. of a solid 7/10 on the scale of evaluations. not to the end. The final speech the Jewish barber gives is enormously powerful. Yes, it is addressed to the tempora et mores of 1940, but its message is perfectly applicable to the world today. The speech has brought me to tears, and I consider it one of the best finals I have ever seen. Final score: 8/10.
