This is a very entertaining and fun movie. It's funny and sometimes hilarious. The ending is a bit disappointing as it tries to wrap it all up in a really cool package. The film is most remembered for its invaluable vignettes: Jane Austen's staging, the camping trip as examples. B & H does not attempt to reflect the prevailing attitudes toward homosexuality and bisexuality. Most characters accept sexual diversity. In that sense, it is a joyful vacation of homophobic society. And it is a celebration of flexibility, a loosening of rigid sexual categories - perhaps a happy omen of things to come.
