I was extremely amused to read some of the bad reviews about this movie. First, many said that they took their 4-year-old daughters and granddaughters to see this and they did not like it. First, I do not believe this is a children's movie, at least not a movie for very young children, at least not 4. It has a very subtle mood but it is not to offer quick fun as seen in Tom and Jerry or something. Many people have also complained that it goes very slowly ... I think these people are accustomed to "quantity" of "quality." Although I have a small quality problem with this film and the film has not been as thorough as the short films, I still believe that it has worked very well for a complete film. And how can people complain about jokes? The jokes were sensible, timely, and well-thought-out, never rude, insulting or "in your face." Wallace is extremely intelligent but cautious and Grommit is the most adorable, intelligent and cute character he could be. This was a beautiful movie and the theme was very appropriate ... for adults that is .... especially with the increase in obesity and metabolic diseases in the world, there is nothing wrong with promoting vegetables and fruits at one go .. and this has been accomplished in a very tasty way in that ... while people are concerned about the aspect of vegetables that does not necessarily mean they are healthier or that they eat more ... but just that they season with the nature, which is in fact what caused the rabbit's legend to come true. And for those who complained about religious jokes, I say ... came! Are you real? Many villages revolve around the local church, and legends / premonitions etc. are normal, undamaged themes. This movie was absolutely amazing, but some people have had negative comments about it and I find this absolutely absurd !!!
