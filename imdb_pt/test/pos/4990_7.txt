"Comanche Moon" had everything for that. To begin with, the back of Simon Wincer, a man whose name is synonymous with high quality westerns. Unfortunately, the problems with "Moon" are something that even the most talented director could not solve: a poor script based on a lackluster novel. <br /> <br /> Forget the historical precisions - as any reader of the novels can tell you, the biggest farce of "Moon" is that it is neither consistent with the information of the original masterpiece "Lonesome Dove". So many wonderful and rich moments in the miniseries and, to an even greater extent, the book, are completely missing in "Moon." Considering the fact that most viewers of "Moon" probably come with at least some kind of "Dove" backdrop, the lack of a character-driven and emotional background story is absolutely painful. <br /> <br /> Having said that, "Moon" is an example in which the adapted version could and should have been altered to make it more suitable for the screen. For example, the novel "Moon" focuses mainly on the Comanches themselves. To their credit, the miniseries tries to serve the Comanches, but in the end it gives them just enough to make the viewer realize that they are missing out on some important part of the story. Likewise, Val Kilmer's Scull also loses - the role should have been expanded, so Kilmer (and Rachel Griffiths, actually) had something to do, or the roles should have been reduced to smaller, supportive parts. Instead, Kilmer gets the best billing for a character who just leaves you scratching his head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act. <br /> <br /> There are strange moments throughout the film that simply do not make sense to those who have not read the book (a killer parrot?) - plus, there is not a single scene that shows us that Call and McCrae are anything close to the incredible Texas rangers they claim to be. Not one of his Moon expeditions (or "Dead Man's Walk") ends successfully, and Call and McCrae seem to make their way through one useless mission after another. Frankly Larry McMurtry should never have gotten the job of writing the screenplay, and he only did it because of the compliment about that other cowboy movie, Brokeback Mountain. McMurtry can write good novels (although there is some dissent about the consistency of this statement), but he never established himself exactly as a screenwriter. This production would have benefited not only from bringing back the director Wincer, but the original screenwriter Bill Wittcliff to adapt the novel to the screen. Witcliff does not exactly have a lot of writing material on the screen, but no one can deny that he did a fantastic job of reducing the original "Lonesome Dove." With all that said, "Comanche Moon" is almost a brilliant production, aided by a fantastic cast that unfortunately is not given enough to do. Steve Zahn's portrait of Gus McCrae - or rather, his portrayal of Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae - is dead. And while some have criticized Karl Urban as Woodrow Call, saying that his performance does not mimic the quiet and stoic Woodrow of the original movie, all I can say is: blame McMurtry because McMurtry is who - both on the "Moon." "romance and now the miniseries - has transformed Woodrow from an inept, clumsy but natural social leader into an emotionless character whose lines are just tedious and whose character motivations are clear if you have seen them portrayed much more accurately in the" sequel " Still, it's the cast that shines on "Moon," as I left the miniseries with the same feeling of melancholy, I felt the original "Lonesome Dove" - ​​this time because I realized it's probably the last time we'll see these characters appear on the screen for a long, long time to come - and honestly, this cast could have done so well on a well-developed network TV series. <br /> <br /> All in all, in addition to wasted opportunities with the cast, bi The biggest scam is that the novel Lonesome Dove contained a rich background story for the characters that would have been fascinating, totally fascinating, to be translated on the screen. Unfortunately, all this was cast aside in favor of the tedious, inconsistent, and ultimately irrelevant prequel to McMurtry.
