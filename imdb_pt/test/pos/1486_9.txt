As Mr. Bean hardly ever speaks, I strongly recommend that you use a DVD player with the teacher to hold your finger on the pause / play button. At the end of the class of any age group, just take 5 minutes to pause and play the DVD, encouraging students to shout out the answers "What is this?", "What will happen?", "What is going on?" ? ", or any other question that draws answers from the new vocabulary and grammar of the lesson. <br /> <br /> As everyone is watching TV, students usually shy become vocal. How can the DVD be started or stopped at any time, is a perfect "fill" for the "in between" difficult times while the students are coming out and coming. <br /> <br /> I've tried other DVDs, notably "Tom & Jerry" cartoons and DVDs from Red Skelton, but no other was as good as "Mister Bean" in keeping the students' constant attention.
