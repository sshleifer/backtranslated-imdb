Retrospective is a wonderful thing. Much criticized when it first appeared, (inspiring the famous review "Me No Leica"), this forerunner of "Cabaret" can now be seen in comparison and not so bad. Certainly not classic, but has its own rebellious charm (the film version of "Cabaret" follows this plot, while the stage version changed the plot a bit). One must, of course, resist the temptation to laugh when Laurence Harvey's Christopher Isherwood (he retains the true name of the original author, God knows what Isherwood thought) describes himself as "a confirmed bachelor" and Harvey is totally inappropriate. (as Marisa Berenson played in "Cabaret"), Julie Harris is a wonderful and wonderful Sally (it's a beautiful piece of comedic acting) , and Anton Diffring is first-rate as Fritz, the German Jew in love with Shelly's character. Of course, if "Cabaret" had never appeared, you might wonder if this would have seen the light of day again. The fact of being revived may not be a cause for celebration, but it is perfectly acceptable in the same way.
