The vampire's "mania", in my opinion, actually proved the value of such an infamous categorization. There were many subgenre films last year from a multitude of countries. I have reviewed many and have a few more to discuss. Forgive my indulgence, but since I recognized the trend as a phenomenon (which is and coincidentally presents my favorite basic horror). I'm going to leave North America a little and hopefully introduce you to movies that you have not seen since now. <br /> <br /> Of the many effects of Twilight is the creation of "face" and "girl" vampire movies. I hate this sexist categorization, which has the effect of polarizing an entire generation of fans on "sides". I think men tend to hate the work of Stephenie Meyer (and his descendants) to some extent because they feel some sense of betrayal that an archetype that has always been theirs is now released. Women are unlikely to enjoy "neutral" photos of the future as they have grown up with rigid expectations that have been reinforced four times. We need more directors to create vampire movies that the genre is able to enjoy (unevenly) if vampires survive the mania and remain relevant. Cue: Thirst This Korean movie was directed by Park Chan-Wook of Oldboy fame. There are two ways to dissect it. Either between gender expectations and it is universally marginally enjoyable, or it is a mess that does not decide which audience it prefers and therefore should not be seen by anyone. Do not let me convince you that the film has no inclinations. Its director is a man whose fame is action movies based on stories. His protagonist is male and has a passive-aggressive interest in his lover (more on that later). Still, his desire for a woman he knew before and after mortal life is not planned, and his attention is returned. There is a male inclination to this image, but it is not so one-sided that women could not appreciate it. The same can not be said of Daybreakers or New Moon. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a novel by Emile Zola called Thérèse Raquin, which I did not read. According to Wikipedia, the novel is about a case that develops between a married woman and a single man. He kills her husband on a fishing trip and starts dating her. The two are unable to have sex because they imagine the dead man's body between them. They are therefore driven to insanity, but they take care of the woman's sick mother. At the conclusion of the novel, they try to kill each other, find out each other's plans and commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Now, transcribe this French novel of nearly 150 years to modern South Korea and you have Headquarters. Chan-Wook does not embellish the story enough to elevate it to must-see. He often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration. I think the most memorable parts are when their scruples are disturbed by the narrative. Her use of the mother-in-law as the result of her bad romance is simply perfect. See the. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is originally a devout Christian who becomes a vampire after a defective blood transfusion after volunteering for a new remedy. He thus becomes the god with whom he was once wounded. People come to him and see him as a great healer. IT'S OK. This is very cool and could have provided a great basis for his relationship. Still, this idea takes little screen time as it becomes a realistic figure of Christ who tries to maintain his virtue, even if his lifestyle demands that he renounce it. Instead of confronting delirious people, he drinks blood from patients in a coma. <br /> <br /> Let us continue with the Christian allusion. The woman deceives the vampire man to kill her husband. Her overprotective mother-in-law suffers a stroke and eventually warns family friends about the betrayal of her daughter-in-law (finger movements). The man kills her, but resuscitates her. The two invite former friends and the woman begins to ruthlessly harass the humans. The man says it is enough and decides to drive to the beach and force him to wait for the sunrise with him. The two die, but he expiates his crimes (and his, but the film portrays his evil more prominently). <br /> <br /> The female character is a caricature, and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior. She is an uneducated housewife, while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive. Vampirism expands its characteristics. It becomes a monster as you would expect it from someone without knowledge. He becomes a demigod with a spirit. Your life is how atheists see you and your life is how religious people see those without divine intervention.
