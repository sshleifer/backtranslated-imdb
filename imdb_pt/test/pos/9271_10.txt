So totally original and fun! Another great Canadian invention. A regular "Joe" (Dan) and a gang of misfits (also known as Puppets) divide the residence into a half-way house. Dan's job is to keep an eye on four "threats to society" and help them rehabilitate themselves. Bill, the homicidal mannequin, Rocko, the dog cigarette smoker, Button, the nymphomaniac teddy bear and Cuddles the comfort doll. The five find themselves in all sorts of strange situations. Despite their homicidal and often overtly perverse sexual tendencies, it is hard not to find them kind. <br /> <br /> I give this show a 10/10 simply because it provides good entertainment, without needing a big budget, and exudes a Canadian touch that makes me proud.
