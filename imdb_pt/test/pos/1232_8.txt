This film, for what it was set to be, succeeded. It's a little tragic movie. Although my choice of film is really the one that develops characters and their relationships, this movie is just to give a little taste, leaving you with the "what happens next" factor. After watching it, I really wanted more, more of the story of the characters, what influences they had to turn them into the people they were. I think that's what the manufacturers wanted the audience to see. The acting is incredible. There are not many lines in the movie, so body language, facial expressions, and general presence need to be powerful enough to hold a scene. Franco and Mineiro have this element and it shows. For them (especially Franco) to have time to do this, they obviously say they believed in this movie and wanted to part with it and so I enjoyed the movie for what it was. I'm also happy to own it so I can share it with others who would never know it existed.
