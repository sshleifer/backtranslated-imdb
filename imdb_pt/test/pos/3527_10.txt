This completely forgotten horror film is one of the best horror movies ever made. Too dark sometimes it reminds me of a famous little thriller "Deliverance." Director Jeff Lieberman creates a fantastic atmosphere of dread and despair. All actors are decent and the climax is really exciting and memorable. So if you're looking for something scary, try to find this little treasure. My personal rating: 10 out of 10.PS This is even more creepy than "Halloween".
