Once upon a time, in Sweden, she was a poor sister of the Salvation Army. At the door of death, she asks: "Send to David Holm!" But, Victor Sjöström (as David Holm) can not be located because he is spending New Year's Eve in a graveyard with his drinking companions. The dying sister Astrid Holm (as Edit) wants to see if she prayed for the soul of Sjöström, in the last year, produced some result; no doubt this did not happen. In the cemetery, Sjöström tells the story of "The Phantom Carriage", which he heard from his dead friend Tore Svennberg (as Georges). According to legend, the last person to die in each year must catch the souls of all dead people, until relieved on New Year's Eve ... Director Sjöström, whose main performance is very strong, combines with photographer Julius Jaenzon to create a visually appealing film. The great effect of "double exposure" is often used, but never seems exaggerated; and, does not make the other dramatic highlights of the film less memorable (eg, Sjöström's tear of his sewn coat and the door ax). A story by Selma Lagerlöf probably was not one you could, or would like to tinker with, in the 1920s - which may or may not be, because the ending of this movie is a disappointment. And, unlike similar spiritual stories, it's hard to suspend your disbelief if you think carefully about what's really going on in "Körkarlen." <br /> <br /> ******* Körkarlen (1/1/21) Victor Sjöström ~ Victor Sjöström, Hilda Borgström, Tore Svennberg
