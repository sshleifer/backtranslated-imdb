The most intense and powerful film I've seen in years. There have been other films before that plunged into the Vietnam vet, but nothing compared to this emotionally devastating film, as a typical American suburban family, around 1972, unravels at the seams, revealing the scars that Vietnam left on all our collectives. souls The cast is A ++++ fantastic with all four actors (with Kathy Bates a stand-out) giving fascinating performances. What is wonderful about this movie is that you do not take sides, but you understand all four characters and you empathize with them, even if all four have divergent views and needs. There are scenes here that are as powerful as family secrets and feelings are revealed (like the confrontation between son and mother) that will leave you emotionally exhausted and in tears of anguish. I really cried in this movie, something I rarely do. The shocking ending is a stunner! A very overlooked film that must be seen. I classify this 1996 film as a superlative piece. Highly recommended especially in this day and age with our country engulfed in a hideous war, our screaming headlines of atrocities, and again our young men and women returning with deep psychological scars, with their deep pain of actions done on the line of honor. A must see movie.
