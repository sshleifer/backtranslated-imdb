Countless TV monitors and the memorable appearances of four of today's mega-stars (plus the debut on the screen of Hope Davis) keep the Flatliners still in prudence. The plot is about a non-academic research of five medical graduates pursuing the crazy idea of ​​discovering the secret of death, and learning what is after death, then coming back to life again. However, the plot was not conceived as fascinating as the idea of ​​the plot. <br /> <br /> There are popular stereotypes to develop a regular teen-slasher screenplay on Flatliners. There is Nelson who creates the idea of ​​decoding death, beautiful but introverted Rachel, David who cuts the Gordian knot by luck not to be fired from school, the girls' man Joe and finally the smart Randy ("I did not go to the doctor" school to kill my classmates, no matter how upset they might be. ") They join hands in an experiment in which Nelson's heart will be stopped and revived.Then they decide to continue this experiment in strict confidence at night in the Not long after Nelson's experience, they all start a race to have the wildest and longest death experience, risking their lives one by one, yet they soon realize that their daily lives are affected by their experiences. The visits to the afterlife bring back their delinquent feelings from their childhood memories.Depolarizing their deep subconscious vigilance, they begin to have somatic illusions and visual hallucinations.When the point comes where the explanation of the subconscious, director Joel Schumacher jumps that all mankind has a subconscious personality that they are not aware of. This inner personality prevents one from becoming a loss of identity. If you lose or depolarize this subconscious personality, you will surely lose your identity instead of reliving childhood memories. I wanted to add this as a movie error, which was already mentioned through movie critics in the early 1990s. Obviously here in this film Schumacher made the actors less affected. So why do you hesitate to continue the experiment after learning the lesson, as if death were conceived as indisputable by God? David had been introduced as an atheist, now he believed in God when he remembered a flashback of his childhood. After witnessing this 180 degree change in David, it is clear that Schumacher's film was so conservative and fertile; that is why it is never classified as a science fiction work. There! He had good potential. He even tried to say that unconscious maturity has an experience of death, beginning to believe that death is simply natural and is only a part of a human's life. <br /> <br /> More than it is in the movie, it was also memorable to remember what there is with the film. Jan de Bont as director of photography, who worked almost every time with Schumacher, creates a dreamy atmosphere as if it were a gothic horror film. The blue color schemes on every wall, reflecting on the faces of the actors, provide a first class of lighting, which fits perfectly to the film. The close-up photos of the gargoyle statues on campus buildings, the Catholic frescoes on the walls, the stop-motion cameras, and the dynamic camera speeds were all Bont's competence. <br /> <br /> Flatliners has become a cult movie. in time with his sociological portrait of the youthful generation X, especially through his futuristic editing style with storyboard connection sequences, such as being part of a video clip aesthetically. Those were the times when accelerated and multi-sequenced video music clips were on the rise. This style was very rare to find in those years after Tony Scott's pioneering "The Hunger" (1983).
