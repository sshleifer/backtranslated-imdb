this is amazing!!! there is no partnership like Errol and Olivia. love is genuine I'm 24, but this movie is as catchy now as I'm sure it was 60 years ago. Raoul Walsh is an understated genius, his direction is so comprehensive, so broad, but so intimate. the last scene between Colonel Custer (Flynn), and his (havilland) wife, almost brought me to tears (not easy for a 24 year old !!), it's so painful. there is also a deep Christian message implied here, the faith that Custer has in bringing his glory with you, and the trust and faithfulness of his wife to the point of letting him go, in order for him to fulfill his moral duty to protect the innocent . civilians of a certain massacre. There is no movie that deals with these problems like this. a must see for anyone looking to see this decisive moment in American and military history from within. patriotic, for all the right reasons. I knew that Errol Flynn was a star, and De havilland was a screen legend - this only confirms my suspicions that they are among the best!
