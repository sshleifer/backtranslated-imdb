First of all, the whole script is mostly impromptu, adding to the fantastic illusion that what we're watching is a real documentary. Second, the actors hired by Watkins were purposely chosen to represent their true alliances and political origins. The portrayed hippies are real hippies, government officials (although not necessarily in the government itself) are at least healthy conservatives within the system, and several police officers are actual cops. The interactions of these actors, given the textual freedoms allocated by Watkins, end up coming to a violent head, where even Watkins himself is convinced that a cast member had actually been shot. (We hear him shout "Cut! Cut!" In the background). An AMAZING movie, although American critics have been pretty harsh in their reviews, reporting that it was the "most offensive" film she had ever seen. This is not entirely unexpected, since the unveiling of this oppressive and communist mentality of America during this era would surely shake some cages. This pseudo-documentary definitely requires an open mind, although if you're seriously looking for an intensely accurate portrait of the culture of the 60's, this would be the movie to watch.
