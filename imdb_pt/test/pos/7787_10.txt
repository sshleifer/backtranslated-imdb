Andaz Apna Apna is my favorite comedy movie of all time. Both Aamir and Salman Khan performed brilliantly while Aamir's performance was far better than Salman. Amir Khan is known as' MR. PERFECTIONIST 'in Bollywood and he proves in all of his films. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around two young Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan) both of poor families and are a great dreamer They want to get rich without enduring pain. Then when they hear about Raveena Bajaj (Raveena Tandon), daughter of Mr. Bajaj (Paresh Rawal) who comes to India to find her fianc√©, they both deceive their parents to marry Raveena Bajaj and the journey begins. There is also a twist on the film that makes the film even more funny. Rawares is in double role (Teja and Mr. Bajaj) and has acted brilliantly as he always does. Sakk kapoor (master of crime Gogo) also adds a great comedy. <br /> <br /> This film is a first minute tickling comedy to the last and is one of the classic Bollywood comedy movies.
