"Crossfire" is remembered not so much for its three stars having the first name "Robert", but as being one of the first Hollywood films to deal with anti-Semitism. <br /> <br /> The story opens. with the murder in silhouette of a man we later learn is a Jewish man named Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene). Police officer smoking pipe Captain Finlay (Robert Young) is assigned to the case. A former soldier, Montgomery (Robert Ryan) comes on the crime scene and we learned through flashback that he met Samuels in a bar along with other soldiers who were in the process of being recruited out of service after World War II. > According to Montgomery, he and his friend Floyd Bowers (Steve Brodie) followed Samuels and Cpl. Arthur Mitchell (George Cooper) to Samuels' apartment for drinks. Montgomery tells Finlay that Mitchell left the apartment first and that he and Floyd followed next with Samuels still alive and well. Unable to locate Mitchell, Finlay suspected the murder. He asks the sergeant. Peter Keeley (Robert Mitchum) to help him locate Mitchell. Meanwhile, Mitchell has been thinking the streets in a confused state. He meets the prostitute Ginny (Gloria Grahame) in a bar and befriends. She gives him a key to his apartment and he goes there to rest. Unexpectedly, a man (Paul Kelly) comes looking for Ginny. Mitchell, still stunned, leaves and returns to find Keeley and her friends. Keeley manages to keep him away from the police and hides him in a movie theater all night long. From Mitchell's perspective, we learn that Montgomery hates the Jews and is probably the killer. Finlay begins to focus his investigation on Montgomery trying to prove his guilt. He arranges to have one of the soldiers, a boy named Leroy (William Phipps) has set a trap for Mongomery. <br /> <br /> "Crossfire" is considered one of the best of the genre "film noire". In fact, he received several Oscar nominations, including Ryan and Grahame, as best supporting actor. It was done on a modest budget in about three weeks. <br /> <br /> It has all the elements of the classic "film noire", the shadows, low lighting and history playing mostly at night. The requirement "femme fatale" of the play is Gina de Grahame, who plays a minor role, but is nonetheless her classic "femme fatale". The unnamed character played by Paul Kelly (in a great chunk) was chewed and spit on by Ginny and she was about to do the same for Mitchell? <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan steals the image as the brutal Montgomery though he typed in similar roles in the next few years. Robert Young makes a good understated detective, but Robert Mitchum has little to do but befriend the character Mitchell. Others in the cast are Jacqueline White as Mitchell's wife, Lex Barker (who would next year perform "Tarzan") as one of the friends of Mitchum and Richard Powers (formerly known as Tom Keene) as Finlay's assistant. Director Edward Dmytryk would soon come into conflict with the House's anti-American committee as having Communist affiliations and spend a few years in prison.
