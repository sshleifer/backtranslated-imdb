This film was very interesting to me, practically a movie within a movie, which is about a very capricious director who cleverly convinces an actress and actor (who happen to dislike each other) to produce sexually active chemistry on film. The director faces a series of obstacles while trying to make the two people perform beautifully in the movies. Sex is Comedy is much more than a comedy, full of uncomfortable and quirky moments, the film also addresses the psychological and innate instinctive behavior of men and women in relation to the sometimes controversial sex act. I loved this movie, the character Jeanne played by the beautiful Anne Parillaud presents wonderfully on the screen as you share your struggle to produce a cinematic work of art.
