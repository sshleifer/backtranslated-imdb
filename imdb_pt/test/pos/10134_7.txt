Not much for this, but a validation of the small town values ​​and the embrace of a young man with mental problems in his heart. <br /> I read some of the reviews and was amazed at some of the hostilities it engendered. I felt that Cuba Gooding handled the part with dignity and respect, unlike the frilly portrait of Sean Penn in "I am Sam." <br /> <br /> The fact that this is based on a true story makes everything more comforting. Sports are taken seriously in high school America from a small town (and elsewhere, I suspect), and I felt that the portrait of these competitive students opening their hearts to a less fortunate one seemed true, at least to me. <br /> <br /> The coach was never forced to choose between his daughter and Radio, but rather kindly made the decision under the open and loving ways of Radio. Very well done to all. 7 of 10. <br /> <br /> Debra Winger, we need more of you in pictures!
