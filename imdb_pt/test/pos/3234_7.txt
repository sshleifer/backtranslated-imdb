I think this film version of NORTHANGER ABBEY is really very good. It certainly is fun. Well, it's not a work of art like PRIDE AND PREVIEW (95), but there are very good things about it ... especially the city of Bath! ..The Royal Crescent, the Roman baths, the fascinating Georgian atmosphere .. This is excellent. If you are a fan of Bath like me, you'll love watching this movie! The performances may sound a bit "melodramatic," but I have the impression that this film, like the novel itself, is deliberately making fun of popular stories of romance and terror and society at the time. The only drawback is probably the female lead, since I personally have another idea of ​​the physical appearance of Catherine Morland. The music is also a little "unusual" .. but I strangely find it acceptable, although it has nothing to do with the historical period portrayed. I'm wondering what dear old Jane thinks ... :)
