After watching the Harry Potter movies, I'm a fan of the trio Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson; however, we hope to see if they would do other projects besides playing the same character year or every two years of the J.K. Rowling Series. Primarily instead of a trio, the cameras and magazine articles focus more on Daniel and Emma, ​​being that they are the main man and only the main woman in the saga leaving the dead end of Rupert. No matter, every actor has a time to shine and Rupert's light hits him once in this movie. "Driving Lessons" is called Harold and Maude of this generation, with Rupert Grint playing Ben Marshall, a young British man who lives with his domineering mother (Laura Linney) and a seer ) for which he wants a summer job but can not find work while at the same time doing his driving exams. (and failing) and writing poetry for a young girl who has no interest in him. <br /> <br /> Ben looks for an ad in a church newspaper for which the work requires to care for an elderly lady. He accepts the job and realizes that he is taking advantage of Evie's surprises (Julie Walters, Rupert's mother in the Harry Potter series), an unemployed actress who is also a poet, giving Ben a chance to make money. They bond where and tell each other secrets, along with Evie acting like a child and getting into trouble where she drags Ben along for a road trip. From her not only Ben directs all the way from Great Britain to Scotland since Evie needs to recite in a local library, but at the same time an older lady falls in love with the young man in which Ben begins to become a man. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> There is a setback, the rest of the movie. world that although he brings a bit of Ron Weasley inside Ben Marshall, there is no stopping the actor in his brilliant performance.
