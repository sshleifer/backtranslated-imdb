This movie is one of the best of 1986, with scary and intriguing performances by Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper! The Reagan years were pretty dark for many people, not just teenagers, but this movie really captured despair and despair. Well directed with great script (apparently based on a true story), I really do not see any weaknesses in that. The opening shot was brilliant. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves was decent for a change and Miss Skye was right about the money. Hopper had three other big appearances that same year (Blue Velvet, Texas Chainsaw II and Hoosiers). I imagine this to have a cult following and I wonder how that picture would turn out if it were re-released. Super things!
