I was watching an NFL game and I started surfing for a break and found it on one of the HBO-type channels. I missed the start, but when I started watching Deadly Voyage the clicker was put down and I did not even think until the credits rolled. You will find yourself cheering against the villains and on the edge of your La-Z-Boy throughout this one. If you have the chance, take the time to watch. From time to time I think of getting the cable company to take my movie channels, but when you come across great ones like that, you know why it's worth paying more for them. Happy Holidays for all of Cape Cod !!!
