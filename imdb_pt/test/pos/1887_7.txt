Okay, so I love silly movies. If you like silly science fiction movies, about the best movies, or if you are a fan of Mr. Bruce Campbell, I would see this movie. This movie is all I wanted it to be. Being a fan of top movies, this fits into the design. Every time I thought to myself "this movie would be the best movie ever" if "blank" happened ... "so, as I thought," blank "would happen. It's a wonderful movie b 'b'-silly. If you are a fan of Campbell, I would say 'see', bring your friends, laugh about it. It's fun. It's not classic or anything, but if you're on TV some night, watch it. It became, for me, a movie that I would file on "indulgent movies." Movies that may not be good, but after a hard day's work, I could go back home and watch (this list also includes 'harold and kumar go to white castle', 'army of darkness' and 'intolerable cruelty') < <br /> If you feel like a wonderfully bad movie, watch this. if not, go rent "Bubba Ho-tep"
