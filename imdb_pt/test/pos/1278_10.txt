Given Christopher Nolan's hit film series, it's not surprising that I want to check out his feature film, which is filmed in black and white in England, under 70 minutes long, made on a budget, but containing all the characteristics that have made him a master filmmaker and storyteller. <br /> <br /> Although short, the film is no less thrilling with its sinuous plot that will leave you guessing because the premise does not even scratch the surface of this tale, which is rather surprising considering the depth in the structure and narrative characterization. As said, we follow an aspiring writer named Bill (Jeremy Theobald), who begins a habitual obsession with following random people whom he imagines on the streets in a voyeuristic way, which at first could be conceived as research, before beginning to make rules, and break them. <br /> <br /> He meets the charismatic Cobb (Alex Haw) who turns out to be a thief with peculiar sensibility and modus operandi, and soon finds himself addicted to going out with him to go about breaking and entering and speculating about the victim's livelihood, as well as the pursuit of a blonde femme fatale (Lucy Russell), a mob mobster who rejects all his advances. Counted in a non-linear way that comes with scenes that do not add up at the beginning, this sets the movie to multiple views as you study exactly how Nolan sustains this suspense and intrigues you as the waiting audience and wants more, which is properly delivered. There are enough twists here, which leads the film to a dizzying crescendo, where the loose ends begin to unite and the glow of the star story begins to shine. <br /> <br /> It's also amazing how, as first What's smart and sophisticated can be conceived from your own experience of being mugged, with Nolan involved in every stage of production, from writing to filming, producing and driving, having worked on the project for a year since shoots can only happen on weekends. I think here is an example of the humble roots of a successful filmmaker, who should serve as inspiration and stimulate new filmmakers out there. Now I wait patiently for the release of Christopher Nolan, which will be released later this year, whose trailer is already a provocation.
