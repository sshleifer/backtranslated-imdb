It's not a bad movie, but it could have been done without the full frontal nudity of a 10-year-old boy in one of the opening scenes. This film has excellent dialogue; which is certainly common among foreign films. Foreign actors still know how to act in opposition to American actors who let the CGI, acrobatics and special effects do all the work for them. This movie is just a good old fashion acting. Gerard DePardieux did an excellent job as usual. The costumes and scenery are accurate over time. My only complaint is that they should have nicknamed the English words about French instead of using captions; this may be because I hate reading subtitles.
