This show is my absolute favorite. This show is smart, fun and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines as the beautiful and clever Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of Rory's best friends, Lane Kim. I love witty dialogue, it's what makes it unique in the program. Kelly Bishop is great because Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman are great like Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a joy as Luke Danes and band members are unique to watch. The community, Miss Patty, Babette, Mrs. Kim, Taylor Doose, Kirk and others always laugh, are funny, quirky and interesting, which always make the phrases of effect stand out. This show has changed a lot over the years it will never get old. Gilmore Girls is an original and clever show that keeps you watching. That's how good it is. I give this show a 10/10 grade.
