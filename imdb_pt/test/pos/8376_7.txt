Previous commentators have noted the similarity in appearance between this film and The Third Man, the classic noir film by director Carol Reed, starring Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. This resemblance strikes the viewer almost immediately. It is, in fact, a great compliment compared to Robert Krasker's award-winning cinematography in The Third Man. The plot of Stolen Identity was also delineated quite accurately, but in fairly common terms. I found it highly creative and fun. As common as the device "Foolish or Stolen Identity" is in the theater and the cinema, it is only a device and should not be confused with the plot itself. Consequently, while the viewer may have seen this device "a thousand times," the plot of stolen identity is full of surprises and twists based on this device. It's the unexpected twists and turns that make this movie so much cooler, more original and captivating than a plot synopsis could convey. Stolen Identity does not depend on the kind of suspense that characterizes most primeval movies because there is no real mystery here. Instead, rely on smaller, more constant surprises. In summary, the Mistaken Identity device is quite common; But this plot is not. <br /> <br /> Finally, although I was not familiar with the cast, I thought the performance was uniformly good, occasionally excellent. I could easily have envisioned other actors turning this movie into a melodrama, with bombastic, exaggerated gestures and obvious facial expressions. The acting is always more restrained and subtle. Donald Buka is especially restrained and believable, never "popping the lid" with an obvious facial expression, as we see so often in films that rely on the maintenance of subterfuge to sustain dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment in this movie, which would otherwise be good, was the very weak development of the sub-plot love story. As it stands, it seems like a belated reflection-a light surprise, in fact-applied to the end. Or perhaps, during the shared ordeal, the actors simply could not convey a palpable level of chemistry that I could appreciate. This sub-plot should have become more apparent as the story unfolded. In short, I thought this film was a little precious and I wondered why I had not seen it before. Try it, you'll like it.
