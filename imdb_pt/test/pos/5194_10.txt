Describing Stalingrad as a war movie may be a little inaccurate. Of course it focuses on the longest and bloodiest battle in world history, the most expansive theater of the most costly war in terms of lives, money, and material that has ever occurred. Yes, it contains action scenes that describe bitter battles and terrible destruction. Visceral narrative and harsh images make it more than a war movie, even more than an anti-war film. Instead, Stalingrad is an absolute and undeniable movie about hell. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with visual descriptions of the worst kind of warfare, one that is intensely personal and close, where days are spent in a single block. , only to have it resumed in a surprise attack. The primitive form of modern urban warfare that the Germans called Rattenkrieg (rat war) is portrayed in brutal and uncompromising terms. The characters fight in sewage tunnels, railway yards, and building in the infernal bombardment of Stalingrad ruins, only to be defeated by the relentless Russian winter. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the question of war. Nazism and defamation of the Germans in this period, as many other films from Germany and the rest of the world do. His characters are a group of soldiers swept away by the winds of war and simply trying to get out with themselves and with as many of their comrades as possible alive. The characters do not fight the Soviets because of any ideological hatred between National Socialism and Soviet communism, not for any big Grossdeutschland dream or racial superiority. They only fight because otherwise the enemy will kill them, and if the enemy not their own officers will certainly refuse to fight. This portrait adds another layer to the suffocating envelope of desperate trapped that permeates the film. A sort of land-based companion of Das Boot, Stalingrad fits the epic struggle of World War II in a personal light and the unexpected prospect of the common German soldier as a kind of hero made tragic by circumstances and a brutal government that would pervert its sacrifice.
