Ok ... so I'm looking through the extensive collection of DVDs of my mom and dad (mostly because they do not charge late fees ;-)) and I come across "A Thousand Acres". I was shocked that here was a movie that had Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer (with a little Jennifer Jason Leigh appearance) that I had not seen. I do not think I've heard of this before. Well, this is exactly the kind of find I dream of since I have to admit that my parents have created two movie fans in my brother and me. With a few exceptions (none of us can even get them to consider watching The Lord of the Rings movies, but my dad loves the Matrix trilogy - GO FIGURE), we have very similar tastes in movies. <br /> <br /> Today was a particularly TREBLE day in relation to time. It rained all day, so I got into this movie and then I was hypnotized. <br /> <br /> This has to be one of the best "sleepers" I've ever seen. Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer are great in their roles, especially because they are playing very different types. The character of Jessica Lange is a follower who likes people who, despite being the eldest daughter of the family, rarely takes a leadership role. Instead, she bows to her father (Jason Robards) and her sister Rose (Pfeiffer) and is committed to teaching her little sister Caroline (Leigh) to follow suit. Michelle Pfeiffer plays a stubborn cancer survivor who is barely able to keep the anger in her unhappy life contained. This movie is five years before White Oleander, remember, so it was definitely inspiring to see her play such a strong and angry character. <br /> <br /> I would say that this movie is likely to attract more women. However, true movie fans who enjoy a movie for what it is, regardless of genre or target audience, will find it hard to deny the allure of this touching drama about family secrets and what they do to the people involved and to those who love them. I do not know how I missed seeing this movie before, but it sure was a good distraction on a rainy afternoon. APPRECIATE!!
