RKO Radio Pictures did a real classic in 1947 and even managed to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture. The acting, script, continuity, et cetera, are almost perfect; and the story is well worth the 82 minutes of the viewer. Although the short photo tells the true story of life making the murder victim a Jew rather than a homosexual, most viewers will see the victim as a Jewish homosexual - such disguises never work, they may not intend to do so. <br /> <br /> I could nit-pick on some details, but just for fun. There was not a movie house that lasted all night in Washington, DC in 1947 - and if there was desire, Robert Mitchum and his friend would not talk about the show. There were no bars where a soldier could get a pretty blonde. NONE! If Robert Ryan wanted to read the latest news about the murder, he should have bought the Daily News; not the Times-Hearald, Evening Star and certainly not the nothing Washington Post. But these little things do not take away from this classic. <br /> <br /> The film benefits much from the absolute lack of a musical score, except during the credits. I only saw this done in some movies. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, since 1995, comes with a TMC introduction, where some liberal blabs about what the public was "ready for" in 1947 ... blah blah blah! As if this idiot had some business judging his superiors. I would say that the ex-GI in 1947 - the Greatest Generation - was much smarter - and had better values ​​- than any commentator, film historian or other scholar in 1995. Put a sock on it!
