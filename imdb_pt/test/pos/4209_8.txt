A beautiful movie. John Garfield's character is a distant relative of Jean Valjean's "Les Miserables," while Detective Rains recalls Victor Hugo's Javert, the relentless branch of law. As in many noirs movies, the city symbolizes evil, while country and nature represent sanctuary, redemption, and a second chance for those whose lives seem doomed forever. But even in the bright light of day, the danger may suddenly appear, as the excellent scene in the reservoir shows. John Garfield - an actor who, as Leonard Maltin points out, must be rediscovered: I've never been disappointed with any of his films except for his supporting role in "gentlemen's agreement", but it was not his fault - to give a sensitive and sensitive performance to the public with him so he is unjustly accused (the first sequence shows a hypocritical and impolite person but all his ordeals redeem him and how we felt for him during the last scenes with Detective Rains.Colorful characters ) a lot of joie de vivre that is needed.The humor is also present in the game of strip poker, since the brats of the Dead End play a rich kid. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
