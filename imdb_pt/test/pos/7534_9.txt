An impressive and careful observation about modern life for young people in Japan such as sand grains investigates issues such as rape, homosexuality, and pubertal anguish in a subtle and meaningful way. It gives insight into young culture struggling to set itself outside the confines of its parents' generation, with its strict conformity and facade. Typical of Japanese cinema, often what is not said is more important than what is, therefore, for those not versed in the Japanese cinema and culture, beware. It may seem monotonous and minimalistic (pretty much like every movie that comes out of Japan's Mangas bar) if you do not know what to look for. I first saw it when I was 15 and it was what originally aroused my interest in Japan, it is culture and language. Considering that I am 22 years old and learning Japanese with the intention of living there for 2 years, it goes without saying that it is a powerful film. Appreciate!
