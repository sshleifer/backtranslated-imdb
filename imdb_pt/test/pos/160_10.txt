Not by scruples, but by the number of twists and turns, inventive uses of situations using vampire mythology, wonderful visual extremes along with interesting and quirky characters make this one of the most impressive horror movies I have ever seen. He descends into absolute madness along with characters, but never seems exploitative or horrible without purpose. There are copious amounts of sangria accompanied by some unpleasant sounds of sucking and sizzling but also subtle moments where you laugh out loud. As it tends to do, Chan-wook Park keeps you out of the center with time and plot jumps and situation that you have to fill by yourself forcing your involvement in the story and characters. <br /> <br /> And there are many literal leaps. Keeping in the vein of vampire myths (pun intended), they have superhuman strength and can almost jump tall buildings in a single boundary (to coin a phrase). The first time our heroine is carried through the tops of buildings by the troublesome vampire priest, she has all the magical romance of Lois Lane and Superman - but this novel becomes increasingly disturbing - but driven by a strange and conflicted "love affair" . not out of sheer horror. <br /> <br /> The performance is superb, particularly OK-vin Kim, the beautiful actress in the leading female role, at age 22, shows a remarkable series. The character borders on a type of black film widow noir. She cares about being innocent and impetuous, from shrew to demon with total conviction. This is a very good and nervous performance. <br /> <br /> If you love true art in horror, or are a fan of Oldboy - do not wait for the video, see it right away.
