I was quite shocked to see the low ratings that this movie received here, personally considering it a fun family fare. It revolves around a young teenager, Sandy Ricks, who is sent by her mother to Coral Key to spend the summer with her Uncle Porter. While there he befriends a dolphin named Flipper. Many adventures take place amidst the predictable nephew / uncle bond, as well as a little romance for Sandy with a local girl. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Crocodile Dundee, I loved Paul Hogan so much in his grumpy and comical Uncle Porter role. To begin with, he keeps an endless supply of Spaghetti-O in his house to serve as his usual, heated meal with a blowtorch! Elija Wood, Frodo of The Lord of the Rings, seemed quite competent playing young Sandy, a boy who at first did not like much of his forced summer vacation locale. <br /> <br /> Of course the dolphin is magnificent and there are some wonderful underwater scenes. Set in the Florida Keys, it was apparently filmed in the Bahamas. This Flipper adaptation is an excellent family entertainment, a sweet, sentimental and entertaining movie that is infinitely superior to many of the movie offerings for today's young people.
