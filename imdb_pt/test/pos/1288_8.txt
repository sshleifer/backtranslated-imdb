The premiere that snatched from obscurity one of the brightest stars of contemporary noir is an assured but limited claw of cheating and obsession. Filmed for zero money, Nolan could not have chosen a better subject than the dark, dark side of London to run his craft given the lack of funds. This short (67 min) is at its best in playing with the expectations of the audience and the protagonist about who is scamming who, although the initial set-up does not sound some alarms in the credibility department. Muddy cinematography (he often used natural lighting due to the budget) can be attributed mainly to styling noir, although limitations sometimes show. <br /> <br /> One can easily see Nolan's style developing in this incipient endeavor; many of the same themes of blurred identity and expectation of crushing repeat in MEMENTO and INSOMNIA. It's not a masterpiece, but good and certainly worth looking at for the modern fans of Noir and Nolan.
