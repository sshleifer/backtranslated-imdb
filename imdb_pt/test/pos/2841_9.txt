Impeccable writing and brilliant acting make this extraordinarily delicious and witty plot one of the best American movies I've ever seen this year. The fantastic cast and cynical direction of Neil Labute makes this film not become very sentimental, while the authentic performances of Ren√©e Zellweger and Morgan Freeman give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear, Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all make noisy and fun performances. The biggest parody of soap operas since the film Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.
