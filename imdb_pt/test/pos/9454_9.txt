I thought this movie would be totally unsatisfactory based on the ads I saw in theaters. When my sister borrowed a friend, I decided to watch it because it was summer and there was nothing else to do. . . There is no time to say ten minutes in the movie and I loved it. Amanda was a great actress in the movie, her comedic timing was perfect. The guy who played Duke was hot, pure and simple. My favorite scene was definitely when Amanda walks by the gardener and a colleague who suspects her and is talking to her about dresses - since she is pretending to be a guy! I re-watched this part over and over ... to shorten a long story, the movie that I thought was going to be lame - now I own it.
