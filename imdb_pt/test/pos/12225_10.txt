I love this show. It is truly unique. I was under the impression that I would have more seasons. In anticipation of the series 2, I recently bought the series 1 to watch again in order to be updated when part 2 was started. Now, after watching it, I was excited and wishing more, so I went to the site to see the continuation schedule. I am very disappointed to see that there are no more plans for a second series, as I was eager to see more of this story. I think they really got the ball rolling. There was a lot of story to build and a lot of unanswered questions. I am now with a very unhappy vision and I hope they reconsider their decision and return to where they left off.
