A comic book tale about a priest, Nazarin shows the economy that Luis Bu√±uel managed to achieve by being able to tell a deeply humanist fable with the least noise. As a result of his Mexican era of filmmaking, he was an invaluable talent to own, with little money and extremely tight schedules. Nazarin, however, surpasses many of Bunuel's previous Mexican films in terms of acting (Francisco Rabal is excellent), narrative and theme. <br /> <br /> The theme, interestingly, is something that was explored again in Viridiana, made three years later in Spain. It concerns the struggle of the individual for humanity and altruism between a society that rejects any notion of virtue. Father Nazarine, however, is portrayed more sympathetically than Sister Viridiana. While this one seems to choose charity because it wants to atone for its (perceived) sins, the whole existence and reason for being of Nazareth seems to be to help others, like it or not. The last scenes of the film, in which he questions his behavior, and in a fraction of a second, has to choose between the life he leads or the conventional life expected of a priest, they are so emotional because they concern their integrity moral. and we are never sure whether it remains intact or not. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkable film and I would like to ask all those interested in classical cinema to look for it. It is one of Bunuel's most moving films, and encapsulates many of his obsessions: frustrated desire, crazy love, religious hypocrisy, etc. In my opinion, 'Nazarin' is second only to 'The Exterminating Angel' in terms of its Mexican films, and is certainly at the top of Bunuel's total film production list.
