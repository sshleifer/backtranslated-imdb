My family and I usually do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they have no depth, and simply are not worth our time. <br /> <br /> The trailer for "Nasaan ka man" got my attention, my daughter in law and daughter, so we took time to watch it this afternoon. The film exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting incredible. Jericho Rosales was really good, so it's Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despise Diether Ocampo proves that he was effective in his role. I've never been touched, moved and affected by a local movie before. Imagine a cynic like me wiping my eyes at the end of the movie? Congratulations to Star Cinema !! Very well, Jericho and Claudine !!
