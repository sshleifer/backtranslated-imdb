this movie has a great chase scene, if you listen to the soundtrack when the cars are chasing each other, it sounds a lot like the movie bullet soundtrack, you will hear the shift of a speed of 4 and they will show the brake pedal in Roy Schneider's car, it's an automatic brake pedal! I think one of the funniest moments in the movie is when villain Richard Lynch is looking at the driver of the car he's in, as if the guy were crazy! ........ the thug who drives the garage is also the guy who in the first rocky movie, the rock boss. good movie! also when the door is pulled out you can see the guy sitting in the car opening the door, the guy helping him out of the car looks like Mr. Brady from the Brady pack, right?
