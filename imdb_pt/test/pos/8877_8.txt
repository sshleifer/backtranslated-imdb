The only thing I really can not forget about this movie is its beginning: classic comedy, brilliantly crafted. I love it. See for yourself (there are no spoilers here!). The dispute between DeVito and Crystal also shines in this film, with DeVito as the perfect oppressed son. One of my favorites. Highly recommended for crystal fans.
