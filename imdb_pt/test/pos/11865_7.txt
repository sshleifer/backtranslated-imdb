If you have nothing better to do, then go ahead and rent that movie, it's smart, funny, it sure will get your attention taken care of for a while. <br /> <br /> I find this surfing channels on a boring Sunday, it was on cable, and for the faces I saw, I thought it might be worth the try, made me laugh and for a movie on a Sunday with Nothing else on the TV, everything was fine. Liv Tyler looks incredible in the film, although her acting is not what I expected, it's a poor performance and for the rest of the team, I liked Reba in her role as a Dra. I found it interesting see the face of the comedy "What I like about you" playing an almost gay lawyer. <br /> <br /> As for J. Goodman I found that, as always a great performance, Michael Douglas plays a small role, but his characterization was difficult for me to identify him .. <br /> <br /> It's also a good movie to watch with the company.
