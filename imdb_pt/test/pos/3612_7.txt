Here is a well-made, well-filmed and well-executed war story. The portrait of the Italian and German occupation of the Greek island of Kefalonia is well done. John Hurt as Pelagia's father and island doctor is superb, Nicolas Cage does a good job as the title captain, Penelope Cruz does a good job of being beautiful and tapping his eyelashes in the Cage. There is heroism and humor, there is drama and romance, and everything is set on an idyllic island. <br /> <br /> Strangely, a very similar plot, or should I say almost identical, with the same characters going through the same series of events, is told in a novel by the same title, written by Louis de Bernieres. This wonderful historical novel tells the story of the beautiful Pelagia, daughter of Dr. Iannis, and his life in Kefalonia during World War II. The bride of Pelagia, the local fisherman Mandras, enlisted when the Italian army invaded northern Greece, from Albania, under false pretenses. When the Axis finally prevails, with much help from the Germans, a garrison of Italian soldiers is stationed on the island, and Captain Corelli plays an important role in keeping the occupation in a moment of peace. While Mandras joins the partisans, the charming Corelli and his mandolin are lodged with the doctor and his beautiful daughter. Of course, this makes a romance about love. But it is also a war novel, a summary of Greek history, a tale of postwar communist revolt in Greece, a portrait of Mussolini's folly, and more importantly, an ode to life on the island in Kefalonia. <br /> <br /> Some of these elements return in the film, but in general, it is an impossible book to film. Glad nobody ever tried. <br /> <br /> The movie 'Corelli's Captain's Mandolin', however, is worth seeing. Just make sure you read the book * after * watching the movie.
