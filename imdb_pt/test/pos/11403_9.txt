I've seen the two films and I've no doubt seen that re-make is the best, I know a lot of people would disagree with those who became fans of the original, they probably will not like this re-make, but I thought about it. and definitely scary, It was so good I'll see it again tonight, the original scared me because they kill the kids, I mean, who does it in the movies anyway ... but in this the kids have at least half of a chance ... The only bad part about this movie is when the nanny (Jill) walks toward the sounds she hears and runs to the bushes to check someone, clearly that no one in their right mind would do that while babysitting, so that's the only thing I found wrong with the movie, and even then they probably had to put it there to create suspense, I do not want to give too much away to all those who have not seen it, I recommend you do it instead to hear all these people saying their crap and worse than the original would be a better movie for teenagers as it exhibits things that most of us are afraid of but when I was in the movie there were at least 10 adults over 70 watching , and they liked it, if they liked it I think you're going to! I give 9 out of 10!
