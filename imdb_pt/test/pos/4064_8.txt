I will not go into too much depth, but Showtime was a very funny movie. There were no funny scenes to hit with the knee (which I can remember), but had their moments. The cast is very good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy does a very funny performance. Rene Russo was very well in the movie, no complaints. There were two characters in the story that I liked and did not explain much. The first was the friend of Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy) in the gym, played by Ken Campbell. I assumed he was just a friend of Trey's, but I wanted to know more about him. The other character I liked was the colleague / partner of Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro), played by Nestor Serrano. I think he was just another cop working with Mitch Preston, but I wanted to know if he was his partner or not. I think maybe I'm thinking too much about a movie, after all, it's a comedy ... who cares about the characters? I think so. I was very happy to see that this was directed by Tom Dey, who also directed the Shanghai Noon. Ever since I saw the film, I was looking forward to his next job. I think he did a good job with this movie, and I'm looking forward to his next job again. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a good movie, but I would not recommend paying the full price for it. a ticket, unless you're a diehard fan of Robert De Niro / Eddie Murphy / Rene Russo. Worth seeing in the theater, but not for the full price, I'd recommend seeing it in the price of the matinee. <br /> <br /> Also, here are some trivia about movies for you. The guy who played the cameraman, played by Judah Friedlander, is the face of the Dave Matthews band's "Everyday" video. He was also the "Meet The Parents" clerk, also starring Robert De Niro. And in addition he also played Derek Zoolander's brother in Zoolander (Zoolander and Ben Stiller). Just some useless trivia for you. <br /> <br /> Hope you like the movie. Thanks for reading, <br/> <br/> -Chris
