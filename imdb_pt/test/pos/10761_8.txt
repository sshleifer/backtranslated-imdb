To the eight people who found FIERCE PEOPLE's previous "Psycolicious Me" and "Topdany" "useful" comments, as well as any future visitors to the site who see them before their authors exclude them: these negative reviews are not only shorter than mandates for site directives, but they are totally false, untrue, inaccurate, and poorly informative. For example, Blythe's father is in a coma, NOT dead - Maya and Finn even visit him at the hospital. Also, it was a deer hunter Dwayne - NOT Blythe - who overthrew Jilly, the maid, etc., etc. So if you have ADD, which makes you unable to focus on the simpler details, please keep your condition to yourself. pretending to be Siskel or Ebert. Otherwise, include a notice with your comments!
