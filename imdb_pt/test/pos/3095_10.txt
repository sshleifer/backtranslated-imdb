You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this movie if you want to finish watching. The film begins with images of airplanes landing at an airport, one airplane after another plunging into a track full of mirages. You will be able to guess with precision that this movie is not about a "story". In the first view, it is even easy to think that aperture images are repetitive images of the same plane. The initial drama lies in the sharpness of his perception, which is built upon his willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images. If after this opening, you want to see the movie, you will not be bored. You may even be hypnotized. The movie can be an emotional experience; can be an intellectual experience; can be both. Judging by the DVD's comments, which is essential, it was mostly an emotional experience for Herzog, and at one point he explicitly talks about how the film is a collaboration between filmmaker and viewer. There is plenty of room for the viewer to make this film exactly what he wants to make of it. Take a bet?
