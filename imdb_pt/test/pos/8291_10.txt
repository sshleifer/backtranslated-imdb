One of my absolute favorite children's films. The Chipmunk adventure brings incredible fun geared towards young and old. The animation is lively and colorful and the film itself features some of the best songs ever put into an animated feature. Who could forget the dynamic "Boys / Girls of Rock n 'Roll", the thrilling "Diamond Dolls", and the moving "My Mother"? <br /> <br /> This should be considered a nostalgic classic animated gem of the eighties. Too bad they do not do that anymore. Most animated films today resort to violence, coarse humor or sentimental porridge ... except, of course, the Pixar staff. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: An incredible and unforgettable adventure for all ages.
