Walking With Dinoasaurs is a new and exciting program that uses amazing visual graphics to display live dinosaurs. The information presented here is impressive. The moods of the series change to catch your attention, things like dramatic music when fights begin. There is clear evidence here for an interesting documentary! My greatest thanks to writers, directors and producers, and not forgetting the other people involved. If you come across this video in stores, I suggest you buy not only for the graphics, but also for the efforts and productive work that the series has to offer. 10/10
