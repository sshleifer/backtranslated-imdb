I rarely write reviews, but this film simply requires more attention than what it contains, since it contains the most hysterical sequence of kidnappings ever filmed. <br /> <br /> I only saw this once and thought it was the funniest movie. I already had the privilege of watching. I laughed from start to finish. It's a shame not to be on DVD or video. <br /> <br /> You can only compare your cinematography with that of It's Crazy, Crazy, Crazy, Crazy or Promise It to Anything. Only this plot is not as complex as the Mad World. <br /> <br /> I hope that in the near future this film will be released, since it would be a shame to lose a comedy like this among the waste we have nowadays.
