A film expertly directed by Martin Ritt, where a roving and anti-hero John Cassevetes lands in NY to escape a tragic incident in his life, where he killed his brother in a car accident and also left the army. Cassavetes, always an intense actor, shows courage in his picture of a movie. I'm surprised that Montgomery Clift did not get that part. <br /> <br /> Ruth White is your mother and does very well in two scenes on the phone. <br /> <br /> Once in New York, he befriends Sidney Poitier as the two work at the docks. Immediately, Jack Warden, a bully and villain in this film, has a dislike for him and the tragedy happens when Poitier tries to defend his friend. <br /> <br /> Ruby Dee, plays Poitier's wife in this movie, and is brilliant. in a scene where she exhorts Cassavetes to reveal her husband's killer. <br /> <br /> This is definitely an interesting film of moral values ​​and solitary in society. Against the background of tenements, good humor is portrayed in the film.
