Having seen only once and in the early hours of the morning, it seems that I can not forget this haunted movie. A mixture of mystery, suspense and touching romance reminds me of Vertigo. The actors, though not as well known, are especially good Joan Hackett in one of his best performances. You believe in her, in her love, in her new quest for freedom brought by her love, and in the end in her overwhelming pain. The plot is ingenious and compelling and does not extend credibility. Management and technical material could certainly be better, but they do not compromise the overall effect. And you have a message: do not let revenge blind you, you can become its last victim. It's a shame that it has not been redone, but it may be a better piece of time left in peace.
