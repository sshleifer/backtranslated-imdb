I felt cheated by knowing the whole story. Although there could be a turnaround, this turnaround was so significant that I felt betrayed. I believe I could have used a better writer who could better gather all the elements of the story. The writer could have revealed more of the 'twists' throughout the film, rather than all at once in the end. Also, I think the actors got on very well with what they had, particularly Matt Damon, who actually had a small character in his character, little quirks that were not self-centered or like a criminal who always knows what he's doing. The other main characters were their own separate entities who happened to talk to each other. The cohesion of the group at Ocean's Eleven left.
