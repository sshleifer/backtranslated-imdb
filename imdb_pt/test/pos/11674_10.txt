The debut of Spheeris should be one of the best music documentaries of all time. And as far as I know, it's also the only one that focuses on the Punk Explosion of the early eighties. It's all there: not just big, big bands like Black Flag, Fear, X, Germs, whose names may not mean much to you today but whose influence on current alternative rock can not be overestimated but also promoters, first of all audiences - the punks - all portrayed in a way that makes you laugh, shudder and sigh in amazement about the energy, anger and fury that these young people put into their music. Where is it today? The eighties may have been a big hint when they came to mainstream music, but the underground was rocking. If you need proof for this, watch the Fear in Decline performance. Incomparable. Great movie! Why is this not available on vid, LD or DVD? P.S. The accompaniment Decline Pt. II is hilarious too
