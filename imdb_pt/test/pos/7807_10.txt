It's just ridiculous how underrated this movie is. It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It never stays, never slows down, it's a movie that has a wonderful flow to the plot. That along with the brilliant writing makes this an incredible movie. Aamir and Salman are outrageous, even Raveena and Karishma are funny in this movie. Paresh Rawal and Shakti deliver a great villain comedy, but Viju Khote and Ajit-wannabe are the best with their stupefied villainous intentions. If you want to laugh and enjoy a movie, watch this movie, do it with family or friends, you will not regret it. Most Indian movies tire me to the end because they are 3 hours long. This movie is so long, but I wish there were more when it ended, because it's an incredible movie.
