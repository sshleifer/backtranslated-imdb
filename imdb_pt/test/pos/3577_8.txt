"Nightmares always come back as unwanted friends," says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives on a vast estate in the area. "And last night I met at the Limmeridge Cemetery." Normally, people who are dead are still dead, just as it is usually the criminals who are locked up, not the victims. And we set out on a gothic story of first-class madness, deception, and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins's great Victorian mystery novel. It's a good idea to pay close attention because there are conspiracies within parcels, but they all focus on a cunning and relentless scheme that involves, what more, money, lots of money. <br /> <br /> Marion Fairlie (Tara Fitzgerald) and her sister, Laura Fairlie (Justine Wadell) are dedicated to each other. Marion is fierce and protective; Laura is softer and much more romantic. Marion has no money of her own; Laura will inherit riches when she reaches the age of majority. Marion has no prospect of marriage that we know of; Laura was promised some time ago to Sir Percival Glyde (James Wilby), a very charming aristocrat. They are the wings of his uncle, an agitated, condescending, and immensely egocentric hypochondriac (Ian Richardson). Everything seems to be quite routine, but a young artist, Walter Hartright (Andrew Lincoln), is committed to teaching them design and artistic appreciation. And when he arrives at night to the local train station, there is no transport, so he leaves walking to the property. In the dark forest he meets a strange woman, all dressed in white, wandering and talking about things he does not understand, which then disappears. Are we uncomfortable? Yes, and so is he and the sisters when they come to realize that the strange woman is very much like Laura. Later, love arises between Walter and Laura? Does a bud bloom? Is there any misunderstanding that sends Walter back and results in Laura marrying Sir Percival? Does a cancer spoil? And the secrets slowly come to light on the relations between Laura, Marian and the woman in white ... we learned to distrust deeply of the intentions of Sir Percival ... we come to appreciate the style and the manners of the intimate friend of Sir Percival? , Count Fosco (Simon Callow) ... and have we finally realized the depths of depravity, as well as the power of honor and true love, which mankind is able to do? Do we visit nursing homes for Victorian madmen, see towering tower tops, dig open graves in the middle of the night, and watch a retribution come through the roaring flames of a locked church? <br /> <br /> Well, of course, and it's a great journey for us. <br /> <br /> This BBC / Masterpiece Theater showcases excellent performance and excellent production values. Adjusting Collins's 500-page romance to a television show of less than 120 minutes means that good business had to be cut or shortened, and some changes were more likely to have a greater impact in the short time available. Still, on its own terms, the production of The Woman in White, in my opinion, works very well as a dark, romantic and obscure tale of television. Tara Fitzgerald as Marion gives a command performance as a determined woman to protect and then save her sister. James Wilby as Sir Percival manages the clever feat of letting us slowly see the depraved mud under the skin, which still has charm among the villainy. Ian Richardson as the uncle of young women almost steals the show. He gives such a bossy and poignant performance that he almost unbalances the story every time he appears. Perhaps the weakest of the major parts is Simon Callow as Count Fosco. The Earl is simply a monster, though supremely civilized and charming. Collins described it as being of immense circumference. Callow does a good job, but for me he does not have a bit of the evil monstrosity. At one point, Marian tells us, "My sister and I really like Gothic novels, sometimes we act like we're in them." Little did she know what was in store for her and Laura.
