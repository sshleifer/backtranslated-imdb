I just read what I believe to be an analysis of this lyrical Irish film. Lovely to read. <br /> <br /> However, a concise analysis of this film is that it is an interweaving of the seven deadly sins with the four kinds of justice. envy, greed, pride, indolence, anger, etc. and justice in forms of retribution, distributive, blind and divine. <br /> <br /> I was able to demonstrate three examples of each, one for each of the three protagonists; however, it is much more fun to notice them for yourself. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it.
