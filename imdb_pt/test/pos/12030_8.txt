Guest from the Future tells a fascinating story of time travel, friendship, battle of good and evil - all with a small budget, young actors and few special effects. Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya "Nick" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years in the future. He discovers a near perfect utopian society, where robots play guitar and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people like everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows reading minds of humans and animals. The device can be used for both good and bad, depending on the hands it fits into. When two evil space pirates of Saturn who want to dominate the universe try to steal Mielofone, he falls into the hands of the twentieth-century school boy, Nick. With the hot pirates on their tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow how unlucky pirates try to mingle with Earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school where Nick goes and demonstrates superhuman skills in physical education class. The problem is that Alice does not know how Nick is, while the pirates know. In addition, pirates are able to change their appearance and literally turn into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea of ​​Terminator ...) Who gets to Nick - and Mielophone - first? Excellent plot, uninterrupted adventures and great soundtrack. I want Hollywood to make children's films like this ...
