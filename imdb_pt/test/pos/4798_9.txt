This film is a fascinating example of the narrative skills of Luis Bunuel. This is a comedy that is not a comedy and a social drama that is not a social drama. Even though I did not find it particularly funny, it made me laugh. In addition, despite the fact that you can never take Bunuel too seriously, the movie made you think about religion and its importance in some people's lives. Bunuel tells the story of a Catholic priest dedicated to his faith as no one and the spectator witness what happens when the priest's immortal commitment to serving others is put to the test. As always, Bunuel's target is Catholicism, but I do not think he has tried to mock the church as he usually does. At least I did not take the film as a mockery of the institution. I think he's trying to make an interesting point about how religion could be a nuisance in today's modern society. Not because faith itself is bad, but because people always try to misrepresent the concept. Message aside, I think this is one of Bunuel's smarter jobs. Francisco Rabal is superb as the priest. Definitely one of the best films of the filmmaker.
