In Belarus 1942, two Soviet soldiers are captured by Belarussian friends of Nazism. In captivity, the attitude of the two men to their fate is very different. One of the soldiers manages to find inner strength and spirituality incomprehensible to the other man. Larisa Shepitko's latest film is one of the most beautiful war films in film history. Vladimir Chuchnov's cinematography is incredible - particularly in the opening sequence, where long and slow tracking shots describing the solitude and almost desperate nature of the winter landscape in rural Belarus have set the mood perfectly. It is easy to make a comparison with Tarkovsky's films, especially since Tarkovsky's alter ego, Anatoly Solonitsyn, has a small but important part in The Ascent. The performance is globally brilliant, especially by Boris Plotnikov, in the Sotnikov part. The film reveals an outdated belief in the strength of religious passion, which seems to be related to characters such as Dostoevsky's Prince Myshkin or Tarkovsky's Stalker. However, this is not a weakness of the film, but one of its greatest strengths. The religious content seems so honest and human that it is impossible not to be moved. The emotional richness of the film can not be exaggerated; the answer is not as simplified as a brief summary of the plot would make you think. The slow development of the characters, and the emphasis on their complicated relations between them, somewhat resemble The Commissar, another great Soviet film. The Ascent deserves a second remark, as well as a third and a tenth. It continues to provide interesting ideas, beautiful images and emotional complexity.
