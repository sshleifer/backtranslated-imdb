I learned one thing: you have to take this movie as a funny comedy season if you do not want to be disappointed. The film is enjoyable because it's a delightful comedy. I think the excess hype has hurt you: the much glorified Monica Bellucci appears in few scenes and is not as good as they wanted to let you believe. She seems unnatural, fake: the best actress in this film is Sabrina Impacciatore, who speaks with a perfect Tuscan accent and shines along with Massimo Ceccherini. Elio Germano is very, very good: the most promising young Italian actor, according to me. Daniel Auteuil looks like Napoleon, but I preferred other actors. So the hottest performances were also the worst. The costumes and production design are fine: of course, American period films are more accurate about these things because they have larger budgets, but the Italian skill rewards the lack of money. A pleasant comedy, in short, with a casting of first category (except Bellucci and Auteuil).
