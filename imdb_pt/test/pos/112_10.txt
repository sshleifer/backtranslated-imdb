'Water' (2005), the final part of the film trilogy of Indian film director Deepa Mehta was finally completed almost ten years after the release of the first controversial element, 'Fire' (1996), which was followed with a controversial sequel a slightly smaller '1947: Earth' (1998). Mehta made her directorial debut with a 24-minute Canadian short film 'At 99: A Portrait of Louise Tandy Murch' (1975), but it was her Canadian feature on the lives of the Indians living in Canada. , his country by birthright, 'Sam & Me' (1991). International recognition came in the wake of 'Camilla' (1994), starring Bridget Fonda, along with the actress who in 1990 won an Oscar for Best Actress in a leading role category at age 80, paving the way for middle-aged actresses still have hope, for her portrayal of a stubborn old Jew in 'Driving Miss Daisy' (1989) at the end of Jessica Tandy. <br /> <br /> "Camilla" dealt with a friendship between two women from two other extremes of human life, a May / December friendship. "Camilla" was the last photo of Tandy; she died the same year. <br /> <br /> International fame followed Deepa Mehta in 1996 with the release of the controversial 'Fire', which spread angrily among the false patriotic sentiment existing Indian extremist. Having already explored the friendship between two women in 'Camilla', in 'Fire' Mehta went a step further to portray a more intimate relationship between two neglected lonely women. Situated in modern India, in the suburbs of the capital New Delhi, shows two brothers and their wives, the elder brother (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) having joined a strange Hindu sect leads a life of celibacy, true to its guru of sexless existence. The younger brother (Javed Jaffrey) is having an extra marital affair with a Chinese woman (Alice Poon). Thus, both wives, Shabana Azmi, who plays the wife of the older brothers and Nandita Das, the younger wife, find themselves neglected in their own way. A forced to live a celibate life, thanks to the eccentricities of the husband, and the other whose only interaction with the husband is through sex and nothing more. Living in a world of in-laws and being the only two strangers in the family, having no one else to rely on, the two women fall into one another's arms. So comes the question of lesbianism. If there was an outside shoulder to cry on, there would probably have been a chance of them falling into a man's arms, but having no one else to trust, their need to support each other is pretty obvious. It does not necessarily indicate that all neglected women would end up taking lesbianism, just happened to the two women in this context. All in all, the movie is great, and it dives deeper than just two women rolling in bed. The main focus is not lesbianism in the film, but the current situation of neglected Indian wives, even in the capital, the two female characters happen to have a sexual relationship. <br /> <br /> Two years later, the second part of Deepa Mehta was the element of Mother Earth, released in India under the name '1947: Earth', another great film by a great director, this time in Hindi. language, unlike 'Fire', which was done in English. <br /> <br /> Now Deepa Mehta has managed to complete the trilogy, despite many problems, having recently released the last installment, 'Water'. No doubt it would be as good as the other two.
