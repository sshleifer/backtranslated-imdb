I saw this show when it was aired on PBS in 1983. I was involved with local theater at the time and had seen some amazing things from the Dell Art Players, but Bill Irwin stepped in. <br /> I was very impressed with how a man of his size (he is tall and burly) could fold in a small box without pausing to adjust and cross the stage to a race without even even a whisper of sound. of his feet if he chose not to make any noise. <br /> <br /> The most incredible thing to me, however, in this performance, was the way he stood up during the jack-in-the-box / marionette. piece. Those who have seen this show will remember that when it came out of the box and collapsed on the floor with flaccid body and akimbo limbs, it "pulled" by the top of its head as if by a rope, and rose not only to its feet, but to a full ballet point and did so in a fluid movement, seemingly effortless. Just consider the strength, grace, balance, and focus that a series of moves must make to accomplish them the way he did! Add to your physical prowess your strong and dependable characterization skills, and therein lies an accomplished actor / performer. My jaw dropped in motion and my heart broke with the picture of a puppet that is determined to be more than just a lifeless thing in a box. <br /> <br /> As for the unfortunate (yes? "tragic" would be a better word) unavailability of this piece in the form of domestic media, I have noticed that much of PBS's work is not available on tape or DVD. Sometimes PBS programs will be available for direct purchase for a limited time immediately after the broadcast, but rarely stay in the market for long. There are exceptions, of course, but they are mostly documentaries of science and history; rarely does a piece of art remain printed for a long time, assuming it has already been released on VHS / DVD to begin with. I do not know why this should be so; Certainly, PBS could use the media marketing recipe at home for its programs, but they do not take advantage of it. This is a shame. There are many things I've seen on PBS that I'd like to have but parts like "The Regard of Flight" are, I'm afraid, once, once in a lifetime, never to be replayed on PBS again and never be available for purchase home media. That really sucks. I'm lucky I got it when I did it. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, our local library got a copy of "The Regard of Flight". And yes, it was stolen.
