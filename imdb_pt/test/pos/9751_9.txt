I really enjoyed watching this movie! Only a few parts were slow, but only adjusted the weather and increased the action. I thought this film was very educational, it taught me more about my Croatian heritage. I also learned more about Louise Arbor, and I can say she has a great influence on me. Time magazine named Louise Arbor one of the 100 most influential people in the world in April 2004. I recommend this movie to people who enjoy historical movies (obviously). This film was very dramatic, but still told the truth of the events in the former Yugoslavia. Louise Arbor is a brave heroine, and I'm glad they made a movie in honor of her. If you see the movie, I hope you enjoy it.
