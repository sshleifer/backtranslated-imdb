The biggest Tarzan ever made! This film is done in a way that no other Tarzan came close to doing. It has everything you would like in a Tarzan movie. No other Tarzan movie ever portrayed the character. I would say if you saw a Tarzan movie and liked it, you should see this movie and love it, and if you have never seen Tarzan, you should see this and forget the rest of them.
