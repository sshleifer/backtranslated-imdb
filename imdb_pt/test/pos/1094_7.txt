One should not be too critical of the director's second trait. <br /> <br /> I really like Madiba's camera work. As Mr. Shawn pointed out, he had a unique way of seeing things. <br /> <br /> However, how does a 14 year old kid shoot such beautiful pictures? Remember that he has no education whatsoever. I do not think English is the common language in the ghettos of Cape Town. Worse yet, Madiba seems even smaller than her supposed 14-year-old. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you overcome the above mentioned quirks, you can watch the movie and still have fun because of the good camera work.
