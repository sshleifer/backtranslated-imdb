And she really was beautiful (Laraine Day, that is) - herself, her part and her performance. An engaging story of selfish versus selfless love, by the same man, the rich and dipsomaniac heartthrob Robert Cummings. One of his drunken episodes leads to an incident that infuriates the local community and tests the courage of the two sisters (Jean Muir and Laraine Day) who are close to him (and each other). Her comfortable, somewhat shallow environment is on the rise as the two girls face the ensuing crisis and respond to their conflicting demands for prudence, integrity, loyalty and love, with profoundly different consequences for each. With the ancient vanities and abandoned subtleties, their real characters are revealed in fascinating contrast. <br /> <br /> A wonderful find at TCM!
