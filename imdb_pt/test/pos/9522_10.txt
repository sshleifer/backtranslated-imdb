I've always loved French films because I think they are filled with a lot more emotion and good sense than Americans. This movie is a gem. <br /> <br /> Beginning with the wedding, it's so funny that you just want to join them and in the end where the little children in the family tell us who you are with who is extremely funny. Catherine Deneuve is simply hot and so good that it is absolutely possible for a youngster to fall in love with her, and Vincen Lindon is perfect for that role. The best scene (except the wedding party) is at the family reunion where Antoine went crazy and shouts his feelings to Lea in front of the family. It's a shame I could only buy this film from the French and not from the English (so I have to learn French to watch) !!
