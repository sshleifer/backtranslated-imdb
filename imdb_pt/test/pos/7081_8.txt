This movie started out confusing and grew into one of the best movies I have ever seen ... The acting was absolutely superb and when I was not wiping my tears, I enjoyed Meryl Streep whose performance was extraordinary. The film deals with the difficulties of a distant family dealing with a mother who develops terminal cancer. The film was very difficult to watch and moving. The soundtrack fits into this movie for a tee. Brava Bette Midler !! Out of 5 stars, I give this a 4 1/2.
