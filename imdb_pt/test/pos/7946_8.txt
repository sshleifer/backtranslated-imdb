Many accuse Rod Steiger of exaggerating, and anyone who has seen the Amityville Horror and the "flying" section would have difficulty saying otherwise. That said, he's brilliant at it. <br /> <br /> It's never on TV, you can not buy it on DVD (rightfully). In 1988, when Channel 4 still had a recipe for innovation, they showed it between a small amalgam of 1960s films, Privilege etc - and I remember an essentially theatrical experience transposed to the movies. The great thing about the theater is that it's closed - how do you make it available and interesting on the screen? PH just pulls out. Since this kind of movie is never broadcast on cable TV or anywhere on Sky, it's difficult to debate, but for anyone who has seen or can remember, my memories are of a direct and almost strident performance of Sally Geeson. all care "(which avoids the almost timid general performances of her and her brother in many offers of the early 1970s), she says the judge's conception. There are several of these - key lines that you remember years, decades later. That's the power of a movie like this. <br /> <br /> PS I just saw it again and it feels so good. One day, the TV will also be illuminated.
