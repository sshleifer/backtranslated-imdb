This is a brilliant and exuberant Czech film by the father-son team Sverak, all about two Czech pilots fleeing to England to help RAF in the Battle of Britain, but also fall on a woman (the beautiful Tara Fitzgerald). Features some excellent and incredibly realistic aerial combat scenes ?? probably the best ever and far better than Pearl Harbor or even the movie Battle of Britain - and several interesting general themes like love, war, romance, companionship, loss, and servitude. In addition, the trials and tribulations of moving abroad and learning a foreign language (although facilitated here with the great faithful Anna Massey). <br /> <br /> The film has some great little motifs, such as the world-famous RAF bullseye device. , shown over and at one point well reflected in the black vinyl record, spinning around cutely (music is another theme of the film, of course). In addition, all the traditional icons of English life: dimpled beer glasses (unlike the postwar straight glasses worn at Pearl Harbor), tea in a beautiful set of porcelain tea in an English country garden (though filmed in the Czech Republic?) the mascot dog, a vintage bottle of HP sauce, even a dart game! Of course the airfield and the surrounding countryside are ridiculously different from any other place in the south of England, although the virtues of the air sequences compensate for this, showing Eastbourne and the Seven Sisters, always synonymous with the south of the England and the Battle of Britain. But best of all is Ondrej Soukup's sensational soundtrack, as good as anything from Hans Zimmer, but all in the tradition of the late and great Ron Goodwin, who made the original Battle of Britain film among other classic English war films . Has even a small special paper for the ??? apparently ?? the famous Czech musician and actor (and similar to Kevin Kline) Oldrich Kaiser, who plays piano on the theme song of the title, Dark Blue Sky. Great! <br /> <br /> He also has some cute and funny Freudian devices, such as always showing an inflated condom floating on the ceiling whenever Karel (the brilliant but brilliant Krystof Hadek) gets stuck in the landing field while The rival love is fellow pilot Frantisek (Ondrej Vetchy) is with Susan. <br /> <br /> Another great English actor in this movie! Charles Dance is good as commander of Bentley Wing. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended and worth watching / hiring ?? get the DVD with special features (things like how they created the dog fights and other things). Probably the only movie to combine captions with characters who speak English, German, French and Czech at once.
