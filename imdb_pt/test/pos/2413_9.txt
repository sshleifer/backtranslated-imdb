For the first time a sequel to "The Karate Kid" without Ralph Macchio! Hilary Swank did a great job playing orphan Julie Pierce. Pat Morita, the one who plays Mr. Miyagi worked his way with Julie quite different from Daniel. Both Daniel and Julie were in favor of karate. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the crassest person Miyagi had ever challenged. And there was no tournament to compete. And there will be some humor in this movie too. I liked the part where when Julie arrived from school, Miyagi went to see how she was and saw her change into the process. That was really funny! And the classic "Wax on, Wax off" scene was also different. It was funny when Miyagi tells Julie, "Uh-oh, lost spot." The set in Boston was a long way from California. Militant's group in that group was like the "Cobra Kai" in Boston. And Colonel Dugan of Michael Ironside was not John Kreese. His group practically abandoned him when Julie kicked a serious ass. They all paid the price when they blew up the classic Oldsmobile. What a cowardly act. At least they will find the redemption of Dugan's venom. This Karate Kid defines some morals, unlike the last three, which spoke about "Honor" and "Respect". Hilary Swank is incredibly hot in any movie and everything else she does. Movie 9, Hilary Swank 10!
