It may be an exaggeration to say this as an obstinate Carlin fan, but the material, both written and presented, in It's Bad for Ya is one of the best materials of the end of the age so far. At age 70, Carlin recovers from the level of desperation (and some of the stumbling blocks in the act itself) of Life worth losing for a special that is firmly structured but loose and fun - or as much as the "old f *** "can stay and is continuously, incessantly, funny. And funny as reminiscent of what some of us had when we watched Back in Town or 'Disease' for the first time. The material, even if it sometimes sounds a bit of the formerly done (ie the whole part of the children in school and in the camp as the infant segment in sick), is always fresh and with such a real sting for everything that scrambles the mind while (here it goes) tickling funny bone. <br /> <br /> Going from the theme of death (how long will it take to get a name out of the book? six weeks, unless in the computer programmer), the facets of communication, looking down from heaven, stains of God (of course) children and only problematic gestures involving hats in religion and if people actually have "rights" make up the bulk of the special, centered around the premise that what is bad for you, simple and simple, is BS. Total, complete BS, which as we also learned (or if you really learned that it's like the kid waiting around the corner for a week, after being randomly left by the parents) keeps the country together. Carlin is not necessarily angry, even if the contempt seems more pronounced, even if it's just to watch how the children's teeth are getting gruesome. It's skepticism tinged with the feeling that everything is NOT going to be "fine." <br /> <br /> What comes next is this: Carlin is for the dirty, spirited and cautious stand-up comedy what Yoda is for Jedis everywhere, which is a small spark of hope through a crystalline wisdom in a world where it is very difficult to get some. At the very least, we have the classic GC - outrageous lines and excerpts from the 13th (or 14th) man's comedic special, including eyebrows about people playing Mozart's music at birth!
