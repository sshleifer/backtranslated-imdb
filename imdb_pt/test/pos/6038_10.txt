This is another of my favorite Columbos. He sports a first-rate cast, including John Cassavetes, who has never been more stylish or sexy, such as Anjanette Comer, Myrna Loy and Blythe Danner. Now here's something I always imagined - Gwenyth Paltrow was born when this episode was filmed, or was Danner pregnant at the time? Thanks to IMDb, I have my answer - she was five months pregnant. Now I can really feel the antiquity. Cassavetes plays a brilliant conductor whose marriage to Danner was apparently using his mother's social connections (Loy). He has a lover next door, Anjanette Comer, a prominent pianist, but she announces that she wants more. She's tired of being on the street. On the night of the show, he gets rid of her and makes it look like suicide. Columbo picks up some problems immediately. One thing he realizes: "You have a beautiful woman here - bedroom eyes - she has money, a body and a career. Where is the man?" It's wonderful to see Falk and good friend Cassavetes together. There's a very funny episode at the vet with Bassett of Columbus. Everyone in the cast is great. <br /> <br /> This is one of the episodes that made Columbus the classic series that became.
