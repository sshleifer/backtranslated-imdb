I just watched this movie over the weekend, and I must say I really enjoyed it. The 2 actors of Italo American are excellent as always (Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia). It is obvious that the director was influenced by two great films directed by Italians. At first he was influenced by Dino Risi and his film IL SORPASSO. It is the story of two young people who meet by chance and become friends. One is extrovert and the other is introvert. They enjoy the whole day together and, at the end of the day, the timid discovers that there is more to life than their usual monotony. The same thing happens with Albert De Santi. Unfortunately, IL SORPASSO has a very similar ending and this apparently influenced the director of ON THE RUN because he uses the same technique but with a twist. I expected something, but I was surprised to see that it turned out to be the opposite. If you watch the two movies, you will understand. The other film that influenced the director is After Hours, directed by the great American Scorsese. I recommend all 3 movies !!
