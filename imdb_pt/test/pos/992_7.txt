This is mainly about love in World War II but we must remember that it is also a biopic for Dylan Thomas and those around him at this particular stage of his life. <br /> <br /> The timing of the movie is great. It really captures what I think would have been the spirit during those times; smiling and hoping you will not be bombed. While it may be tedious for some, the film has a particularly dangerous edge. <br /> <br /> At one point, my heart was racing to the end when the movie reached its climax. It really does feature some poignant moments that are treated with skill by the four main actors. Cillian Murphy is in good shape here, just like Matthew Rhys. Both are polar opposites and make an interesting watch. The relationship formed between the characters of Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley is wonderful and we have the performance of thanking (and being attentive to a special participation of Suggs of 'Madness'). <br /> <br /> Despite all this, it's a rather slow movie. Coupled with the fact that it is only two hours, it is a very arduous task to come to the conclusion. Overall, it's a solid non-fiction war movie with many wonderfully created moments that were undoubtedly helped by the splendid number of British names known behind the scenes. But this really makes a lot of noise sometimes. Still, it's worth watching. 7/10
