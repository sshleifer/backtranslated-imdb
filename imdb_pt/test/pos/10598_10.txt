"Haggard: The Movie" is well written, well directed and well represented. There are many moments of laughter and some great skateboarding scenes with Margera. The scenes from West Chester, PA are filmed beautifully and the script is simply funny. What I like about the movie is that instead of being more of a love story or another version of "Jackass," it takes a dark and funny look at the breakups from a different perspective. Most break-up movies feature a naive woman shot down by a traitorous man. She then goes to find Mr. Right and starts telling him ex cheating if he misses. This film takes a look at the emotional rollercoaster of an abandoned man ... without taking himself too seriously. Ryan Dunn does a great job as the abandoned man and with Bam Margera and Brandon Dicamillo as their best friends trying to help you at this difficult time, how can you take something very seriously? It is obvious that Margera and Co. are incredibly talented both behind and in front of the camera. I look forward to your future films and ventures.
