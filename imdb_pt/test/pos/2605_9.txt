I must admit that this is one of the few Lou Costello movies that I actually saw in the theater. Most have already been seen in T.V. and I must admit that Lou is really nice and he also gets the girl. This was the first time I saw Dorothy Provine perform and, of course, I fell in love with her like so many others that day. I saw most of the work she did and enjoyed every one of them. His performance in The Great Race is one of the reasons why I bought the first disc! <br /> <br /> Every comment about this movie says that this is the only movie Lou Costello did with Bud Abbott, which is true, but if Lou had lived he would have done a lot more. He really does a good job and does not need to rely on his old routines for laughter. I at least feel like Patterson's little man, N.J., did not get a chance to do that. <br /> <br /> I hope it comes out on DVD some time so I can add it to my comedy / science fiction collection.
