I've never seen a Bollywood movie before, but I took the first ten minutes of it, laughed at myself silly and pressed the R button on Sky +. I'm glad I did !! I hope I do not insult anyone (because basically, the BF and I love it!), But we can not take half the seriousness of the actors - especially the obsessed (which, I understand, is a big Bollywood star). because we've seen him on the cover of many DVDs since then and I even saw a doll of him today at Hamleys !! The BF keeps talking about this guy - I'm starting to think he's obsessed! He goes on to say that it is strange the traditionally handsome to be the anti-hero of a movie! But we like movies that are not your predictable Hollywood stock). <br /> <br /> It was completely exaggerated, but very fun. If all the Bollywood movies are like that, then we're watching more. I had that thriving song in my head all week and I can not speak a word of Hindi! PS any recommendations would be appreciated!
