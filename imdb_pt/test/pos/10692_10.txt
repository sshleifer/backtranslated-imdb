Wow. I've never seen or heard of this movie. It just came on tv (2am in the morning) and I'm completely amazed. Setting: a lot of rich fat cats are off golf. One hits a ball in the rough. She falls for a NINJA !!!! A man in a tuxedo walks to catch the ball. The ninja grabs. She crushes his hand. Man pulls the gun. Ninja pulls a blowpipe. Ninja blows the dart on the gun barrel. EXPLODES OF WEAPONS !!!! This is just the beginning of greatness, people. Everyone should see this movie. 10 big fat stars of trust.
