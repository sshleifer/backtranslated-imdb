I doubt the true story of Western Union's development has won a real audience. Instead of talking about building the telegraph system to the west, it was the history of boardrooms, dominated by one of the most interesting (and not liked) great "Robber Barons": Jay Gould. Gould took the struggling company and turned it into a communications giant - and part of his attempt at a national rail system to rival Vanderbilt's. But this, though interesting, is not as exciting as the very history of the placement of the telegraph lines. At least, that's how the public would see it. Jay Gould died in 1892. Had he lived in the modern era and invested in Hollywood, he probably would have agreed with this assessment as well. <br /> <br /> The film deals with how the placement of the telegraph system is threatened. by the Indians, stimulated by a Jack Slade (Barton MacLane). Slade, a desperate one, is not pleased with the development of a communications system that will certainly weaken his ability to flee police in the territories. He is confronted by the man in charge of installing the telegraph wires, Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), Creighton associate Richard Blake (Robert Young) and a quasi-lawman Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott), who is Slade's brother. Blake, an Oriental with little understanding of the West, is dating Creighton's sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore), but finds it difficult to get used to the new environment. But he becomes a close friend of Shaw's, especially when trying to confront Slade. Slade was a true Western criminal by the way, and the subject of a ROUGHING IT section by Mark Twain. He was hanged in the 1870s. But he had no involvement in inducing Indians against railway or telegraph companies. However, MacLane makes him a memorable evil type and totally vicious. His death from one of the main characters is done suddenly and from behind - and he sees the corpse as if it had just gotten rid of a hassle. But Lang is responsible for this as well as other touches. Watch the sequence with Chill Wills, where he's on a telegraph pole to fix it. He spits out tobacco juice several times while talking to Young, who gets a little spattered. Then there is an Indian attack that we watched from ground level. At the conclusion, Young suddenly gets splashed again, but it is not brown, but red, which covers it. He looks at the top of the pole, and there's Wills with an Indian arrow through it. <br /> <br /> It's an exciting movie to watch, and it's worth catching.
