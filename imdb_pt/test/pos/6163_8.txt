A well-paced romantic war story that should have more exposure. The Czech pilot who played the piano gives a gentle touch to the story. The flying footage may not have been enough for aviation fans like me, but again, this is not an action movie. Although it has nothing in common with James Salter's novel, "The Hunters," which became the movie about the pilots of the Korean War F86 Saber, Dark Blue World had a similar feel but with more of a romantic element. Better in some ways than the Battle of Britain, in that it does not depend on big names of actors. Suggest viewing this movie with a little Czech beer and some Czech dumplings called kneldniky (sp).
