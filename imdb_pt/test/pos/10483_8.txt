Stephane Audran is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measured study of a small Danish community at the end of last century. Two beautiful and talented sisters abandon their own prospects of happiness and marriage to care for their aged father. One day, a French woman, Babette, comes to work for them. After a few years, she wins the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who accepted her. Its solution is to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous party that changes the lives of all the guests. This is a film about human and cultural interaction, reflected in the changing language of the Danish-French dialogue, and especially between the obedient obedience of northern Protestant Europe and the sensuality of the Catholic South. It is also about human needs, and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of the senses. A deeply uplifting film.
