I loved great enlightenment and was warmed by this history of American working class society and port life in the first half of the twentieth century. I was drawn to the timeless timelessness of this realistic performance. see and feel the power of the star. melancholic "Greek" comedy. Someone in the mood for a shot with a beer back? ... or some ginger? Hey, water kid !!
