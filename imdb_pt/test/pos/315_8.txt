'Apocalypse Now Redux', Francis Ford Coppola's war work is probably the most beautiful war film I have ever seen. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is a Vietnam soldier who is called to direct a very dangerous and highly classified mission in Cambodia to 'finish the position' of Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a highly ranked and highly regarded army man . apparently went completely insane and defected from the army, setting up his own little society and being aided by an entourage of soldiers. Accompanying him down to the river to Cambodia is a handful of navy men, and along the way, they meet several interesting people (most notably is Robert Duvall's Kilgore, a tough lieutenant colonel with a few loose bolts) and some situations horrible <br /> <br /> "Apocalypse" is a war film less historical than a philosophical and psychological study. It's more 'Full Metal Jacket' than 'Platoon'. The 'Apocalypse' runtime is over three hours but the film is so wonderful and attractive that by the end of the movie it came, I was really surprised at how much time I spent. Beautiful cinematography is certainly what most stood out to me, however. After seeing this film, I am convinced that Coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history. The "Godfather" movies were all dyed almost sepia tone, and the shadows created the feel of a baroque composition. With Apocalypse, there is an incredible use of natural light, and the shadows, particularly in the scenes involving Brando and Sheen, almost become a living character, they are so pervasive and effective. Another beautiful scene was when Cpt. Willard and Jay Hicks (Frederic Forrest) were in the woods looking for mangoes and found a tiger. The enormous enormity of the surrounding foliage (leaves as large as a house) made the characters almost lilliputian, but the colorization of the scene was incredible. While all the rest was almost a dumb gray, the leaves were an incredibly vibrant green, an effect that was particularly impressive. Another really positive moment in the film was the big scene in which the helicopters carrying Duvall and company attacked the small village while playing Wagner. This could have been just an ultra-dramatic underlying soundtrack to the scene, but Coppola turns the song into a real part of the scene, with Duvall mentioning that he likes to play as they approach to 'scare the hell out' of them. '. <br /> <br /> The performances in 'Apocalypse' are first class. Much has been made of the amount of money Brando earned for the film, and the amount of trouble it caused. Regardless, it achieved powerful performance for a relatively small amount of screen time. Sheen is quite remarkable - is this the first time I've actually seen him release in a movie? and Duvall is a lot of fun to watch as the loony Kilgore. 'Apocalypse Now' is a film that has been so widespread in pop culture so far (most know several lines of choice of the movie, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning' et al), but I knew little about it that there were many surprises left to try. I have not seen the original cut of 'Apocalypse Now', so I can not compare it with this new cut, but this is a movie that certainly must be experienced. 8/10 <br /> <br /> - Shelly
