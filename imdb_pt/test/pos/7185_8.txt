This movie is great ... It starts out really slow and boring, but as the movie progresses ... well, the fun keeps coming. The power of the film may be in subtle references to many (and I mean a lot) of other films. For me, the best part was perhaps the Bruce Lee / Crouching Tiger scene, Hidden Dragon. As the two actors switched from French to Chinese or any other Asian language, it was incredible. Then the jokes with the names, they are hilarious, but maybe you will not understand them all when you are an American (no offense). Overall a great movie
