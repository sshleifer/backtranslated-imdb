An unfortunate reality of post-Soviet Russia was that people's well-being did not change much from Soviet times. As we see in "Window to Paris," most people are still as depressed as ever while they are encouraged to go after money. <br /> <br /> So everything changes to music teacher Nikolai Chizhov (Sergei Dontsov) after he finds a window leading to Paris. He and his friends are naturally very surprised by what they find. This movie has one of the funniest discussions of Elvis Presley and Edith Piaf I've ever heard. So watch this movie. You're sure to love it. It is a kind of precursor to "Being John Malkovich".
