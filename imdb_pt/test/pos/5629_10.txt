My comrades were surprised to discover that this movie was a documentary. It was so funny, it looked like script, but it gives an exciting real life picture in the life of the indie movie. We were motivated to buy Coven and wanted to meet Mark and Mike. As college students, this movie gave us a much needed glimpse of real life.
