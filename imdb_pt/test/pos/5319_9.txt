I remember seeing the trailer for this movie and I absolutely knew I had to see this movie. It looked like something that would be right in my alley. <br /> <br /> "The United States of Leland" is a great movie. It is not the one that will leave you with a nice and pleasant ending, but with a sad and empty feeling. And when I say it will leave you with an "empty" feeling, I do not want to say it as a bad thing. I believe you are meant to fill that empty feeling with your own thoughts about the characters and general motives of the human being and how they act as parts of society. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling is perfectly chosen as Leland. He is intelligent, but stoic. I like the way he tells the movie with his diary. The support cast is great too. Kevin Spacey is very good, as always, and Don Cheadle is amazing as Leland's teacher and mentor. <br /> <br /> This was a great story and it's very clever and thought provoking. I recommend.
