So what is 'Batman Returns' anyway? <br /> <br /> It was marketed as an action movie, and many people who saw this seem to think they watched an action movie - but, really, this is not much action, and Tim Burton hardly seems interested in it. <br /> <br /> People often line up with the "toughest" superhero comics of the late 1980s, but honestly, if you read "The Dark Knight Returns," that sounds a bit absurd; Burton's excessive imaginations have more in common with the 1960s TV series (Penguin drives a giant plastic duck, for God's sake). <br /> <br /> Burton's style is often described as gothic, and this is a little closer to what we see on the screen; the penguin - deformed, evil, with a tangled history and an underground lair - is a gothic threat clad in more respectable Dubuvian outfits - Udolfo disguised as Uriah Heep. <br /> <br /> But what about Catwoman? She can be resurrected from the dead, but this PVC overalls is decidedly Twentieth Century, and her alter ego The world of Selina Kyle is all boardrooms and apartments - reminiscent of a romantic comedy of the 1930s. > And then you click. The clever but oppressed secretary, romanticized by a lonely millionaire? The complications arising from deception and disguise? "Batman Returns" is clearly a romantic comedy in the old Hollywood style, filtered through the sensibilities of Burton's S & M dungeon. It has more in common with 'The Hudsucker Proxy' (including Expressionist series) than with other superhero movies. <br /> <br /> Like many romantic comedies, it focuses on the transformation of heroin; not from ugly duckling to swan, but from doormat to dominatrix. Michelle Pfeiffer gives one of the performances of her career (often remarkable); she's iconicly sexy as Catwoman (poor Halle Berry never had a prayer), playful and vindictive, memorable because she knows how to act with her whole body. In retrospect, however, it is her scenes like Selina that impress; almost all of them are a little comic gem, particularly the glimpse we have of their solitary domestic life. It's a delicately balanced tragicomic performance, and it's in those scenes that the film really comes to life. Nothing thrills me like Selina and Bruce Wayne dancing under the mistletoe of Siouxsie and the Banshees, a secure weapon between them, simultaneously strengthened and imprisoned by their alter egos, condemned to conflict. Forget the easy sentimentality of 'Big Fish' or the extravagant thrills of 'Edward Scissorhands' - this is the most sincere scene of all the Burton films. Love, revenge, fatalism, fetishism, insanity, self-loathing and not a little humor, all in a few short lines and absolutely preached by the actors - particularly Pfeiffer. Elsewhere, Danny de Vito almost matched her, finding the wounded dignity buried under those truly repulsive jailers. The villain in the upper crust of the comic books turns out to be nothing more than a farce; Burton's Penguin is a ferocious creature submitted to its own form, in the style of Eliza Doolittle (almost literally an 'ugly duckling'). It's the most radical - and funniest - Burton reinvention. Max Schreck by Christopher Walken completes a perfect triptych of villains, sliding between casual charm and empty-eyed psychosis with disconcerting ease (and is it just me or your company logo reminding Mickey Mouse? Maybe we should ask the ex - Disney Burton animator) Christopher Nolan's "Batman Begins" - a true action movie - was highly praised as the first film to do justice to Batman; I admire the Nolan movie, but it would be a shame if it were allowed to overshadow this idiosyncratic jewel.
