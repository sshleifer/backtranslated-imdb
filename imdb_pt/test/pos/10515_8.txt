I love Ln Chaney's version of "Phantom" and I appreciate Webber's version, even if only by growing interest in the book, I want to find yet another mysterious horror with the underestimated romantic aspects. I do not approve of the fact that Andrew Lloyd Webber made the relationship between Raoul and Christine less restrained. <br /> <br /> Luckily, since this is a short comedy, with only Erik and Christine, this version neither needs bothering with any other characters. <br /> <br /> I thought I'd still be waiting for another version to match Lon's performance. I was completely wrong. Leslie Nielson is fabulous as Erik, of course this is a parody. It's still brilliant. <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed the fact that Erik looked more like a living corpse than an accident victim. I still have to see a Ghost like that, other than Lon. <br /> <br /> However, I do not recommend this if you do not like spoofs. Because this should not be taken seriously.
