I've always been a Jackass fan, as have Viva La Bam and Wildboyz. And when you're a fan of something, your expectations are high in relation to your "heroes." And if there's one thing I've learned about expecting a lot from the people you simply love watching and listening to, it's never expect too much, because in 99 out of 100 times, you'll be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although when I heard that there was a Jackass 2 coming up, I thought, "Not even I can refuse my expectations for this movie," and as a result I sat down today, ready to laugh, but also ready to say in the end "Well, that was OK, but I'm a bit disappointed." How wrong I was! Every member of the Jackass team brings this movie to the first, showing you a crazy blow after another, making the whole world see that there's nothing they would not do to try to get hurt - and that's what we love! I cried my eyes laughing from the first minute to the last second of the movie, sometimes even screamed out in laughter, unable to control me! Stuntman after stunt, joking after joke and hilarious comments about the flow - it just can not get better than that! Amazing from start to finish, guaranteed to make you laugh your butt. I have two things to say; WATCH AND PLEASE, God, have a Jackass 3 - these guys clearly have a lot to offer!
