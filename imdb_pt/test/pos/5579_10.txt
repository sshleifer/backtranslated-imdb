Well, how can I categorize Farscape without resorting to superfluous superlatives? Okay, here it goes! The scripts are fantastic, with each episode providing both entertainment, drama, humor and pure vigilance. The cast is perfect, especially that of Zhaan (the blue lady) played by Virginia Hey, each character has a depth that is simply not there in the Star Trek series. <br /> <br /> I think having an Australian version of the show does it for me, Australia has been knocking out quality films for years and Farscape is no exception. <br /> <br /> I've only seen the first four episodes in the UK and they have a quality that makes every minute show (UK) stand out more like a movie than a weekly TV series. <br /> <br /> The episode that really does that to me is 'I, ET', which transforms the alien concept around where Moya (a living ship, even the spacecraft has a large character) is forced to landing on a planet that has yet to make 'First Contact' and is surprisingly like Earth and Crichton encounters a radio telescope operator and * he * is the 'little green man' for them. Things that grab. <br /> <br /> In short, the effects are great, the scripts are high quality and the main characters (none of them really matter more than any other) are interesting, not always 'good' and just great. <br /> <br /> Roll in the second season!
