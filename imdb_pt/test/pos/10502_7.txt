The offspring is about a husband and wife who suffer loss of time while making love. Completely unconscious of what this bizarre experience means they try to carry on with their lives. The husband begins to question the bizarre event and receives help through a very annoying psychiatrist. He goes on to believe that the aliens are responsible for that lapse in time and that the fetus he thought to be his and his wife actually belongs to the aliens. <br /> <br /> If you ask me, this is a great scifi / horror story. Taking a highly questionable real-life scenario involving alien abduction and hybrid reproduction is definite thumbs up from that guy. I love all things related to aliens and this story definitely gave good ideas. So if you also share an interest in extraterrestrial things, you should be very happy with Progeny. At least from history anyway. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is generally medium-sized. With average performance by all the actors. Yes, even by the consistently incredible Mr. Dourif, who still performs best. Although the black doctor, delivered his lines very well. There are some points in the film where part of the delivery is bad or laughable, which is fine in my book. I like them cheesy and this had a bit of some nice smelly cheese, and I mean it in a good way. <br /> <br /> Anyway, with a less than stellar script you can not blame all the actors. I did not particularly care about the mother hysteria that the movie did. She wanted so much a baby to neglect and discard everything her loving husband (who is a doctor!) I told her. It almost got to a point where you really did not care what happened to her. <br /> <br /> The Progeny is another Brian Yuzna movie from the icky-sticky movie Society. Again, it offers some viscous effects and, again, it offers a unique horror story. If you like scifi / horror or are a fan of Dourif and Yuzna movies, there is no real reason not to take a look at this movie if you have the chance. A generous 7 outta 10.
