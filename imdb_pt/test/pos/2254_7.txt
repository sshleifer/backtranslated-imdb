The film "Everything is Illuminated" comes from writer and first-time director Liev Schreiber, adapting Jonathan Safran Foer's first novel. The book was ambitious and expansive, its magical-realistic elements and vivid use of language seemingly impossible to represent on screen. The film wisely tries less. Although the final result is not as original as the novel, it is still a film made on a strange trip to Eastern Europe or, as one of the characters put it, "a very rigid pursuit." <br /> <br /> This character is Alex (Eugene Hutz), a young Ukrainian who loves American pop culture, but it seems that he can not understand the English language. However, his grandfather (Russian actor Boris Leskin), who runs a tour company for American Jews, persuades him to serve as a translator for Jonathan (Elijah Wood). Jonathan is investigating the history of his family and specifically trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. More than one family secret is revealed during your search. The film Jonathan (not to be confused with the author of the novel) is a semi-kleptomaniac weirdo who steals his own grandmother's teeth to add to his collection of "family stuff." Wood's quiet, wide-eyed and sincere ways work very well in this role. Hutz makes an impressive debut as Alex relaxed and relaxed. His malapropisms are hilarious, but he is also able to promote the character's growing self-awareness. The dog Mikki is very funny like the demented Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., and one of the few movie dogs I have ever seen that is not so cute and precocious. "Everything is Enlightened" eventually places the Holocaust on a human scale, asking us to remember not as a general event but as millions of specific small tragedies. Reminiscent of a European film, it also reflects the effect of past events on young people like Jonathan and Alex. With his unique perspective, strong performances and some very striking visuals, "Everything is Illuminated" is a great job for a beginner, and we hope Schreiber will continue to direct films.
