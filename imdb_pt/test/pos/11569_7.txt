Okay, the show was a little bumpy, but I still loved it. I found the two main rabbits annoying, but Hamton & Plucky were always fun. <br /> <br /> I really want the episodes of Baby Plucky on DVD (or even on VHS). Please release these! <br /> <br /> Specifically, the episode "Potty Years" aired on 11/22/91; the episode "Up" aired on 9/17/92 and the episode "Minister of Golf" on 11/92. <br /> <br /> They are the funniest of the whole series and even after a decade we still refer to these bits! <br /> <br /> (I have nothing else to say, please reduce the minimum to something like 5 lines and reward us for brevity!)
