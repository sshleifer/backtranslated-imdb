If you're going to fool James Bond, it's a brilliant idea to find a protagonist who looks like Jean Dujardin and Sean Connery and Leonard Rossiter, who perfectly captures Connery's smile that masquerades as a smile, and the self-delusion of Rossiter thought. it is soft. Dujardin plays as a Clouseau who can do well in karate. The plot makes him search for Our Man In Schtook, which mysteriously disappeared and includes improbabilities like a Nazi cell hidden inside a pyramid. If there is a dissonant note, it is the protagonist, Berenice Bejo, who has all the sensuality of a tallow pudding and is eclipsed - but only really - by Aure Atika. It's good for a view, but that's about it.
