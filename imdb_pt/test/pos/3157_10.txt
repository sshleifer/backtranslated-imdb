It's funny because I read all the comments on this page after getting this movie and it's a love or hate reaction. You're probably going to love or hate it, too. I think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact. I'm at the five-star camp because this movie made a big number with me and made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was fine tuned when everything was happening. Especially in Afghanistan and I feel guilty about it. The music through the movie was beautiful. I kept getting lost especially during some of the historical flashbacks. Personally, I found the audio great. It seemed to me that the soundtrack with speeches, music and radio was set up so you feel like you're in the trailer with Jim, the main character, or in your head. Everything that was not on the radio was very clear and everything on the radio sounded like it was really on the radio. Anyway, this is a very amazing DVD that made me cry.
