I just saw this movie for the first time, and I must say I'm very impressed. <br /> <br /> How dark. How full of despair. What a nightmare. Amazing. Visually stunning, several scenes are embedded in my mind ... the first appearance of the ghost carriage ... the soul of David Holm when he rises from his corpse ... his spirit on his knees, pleading. <br /> <br /> This film has a simple story - that of the ghostly carriage driver of the ghost carriage, doomed to collect the souls of the dead for a year - and brings it to the current scene of the world. movie and then uses flashbacks as a means to explain how David Holm ends up in his situation. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this released on DVD so that more can see it. Everyone should.
