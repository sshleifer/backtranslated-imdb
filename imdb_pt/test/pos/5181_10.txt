I watched the movie today and found it brilliant. It has no special effects that blow your mind, and it's not violent or bloody, nor terrorist or alien, but it's brilliant. It's simply nice, sweet and brought me to a totally different time, a much simpler time where people could take their time to walk down the street and look out to the ocean. I think it was beautiful and I recommend it. Nick was a great character and his friendship with Harry was one of the highlights of the film. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I believe everyone should watch this, especially when they feel down, or when they want to share something good with their friends.
