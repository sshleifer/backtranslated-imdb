I got this movie on the Sci-Fi channel recently. In fact, it turned out to be pretty decent as far as suspense / list B movies go. Two guys (a naive and a noisy a **) make a trip to stop a wedding, but have the worst luck possible when a maniac in a weird hybrid tank / truck decides to play cat and mouse with them. Things get even more complicated when they catch a ridiculously indecent hitchhiker. What makes this movie unique is that the combination of comedy and horror really works in this movie, unlike so many others. The two guys are quite friendly and there are some good chase / suspense scenes. Nice pacing and comedic timing make this film more than acceptable to the horror / slasher fan. Definitely worth checking out.
