Being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's Mechanical Orange, there was obviously "no doubt about it" that I had to see that one. However, I postponed it for a long time because some of my friends dismissed it with comments like "extremely boring" or "nothing happened" "a complete waste of time." But when I saw images on the internet of the mysterious black monolith, I could see a glimpse of the extraordinary experience that is 2001: A Space Odyssey. There was no question in my mind that I was going to rent the movie the same night. <br /> <br /> It turned out to be the biggest visual experience of my life. Of course watching a good painting or picture can be wonderful, but watching a movie built with the same kind of virtuosity in each frame adds a new dimension to it. My God ... I really like my friends, but it's a shame I can not share with them the same thing that makes my heart jump with excitement and makes my spirit fly like a bird in the sky. This thing, my friends, is beauty. As this movie goes, beauty is terribly underestimated in our technologically advanced, intellectually shallow, consumer-oriented western fast-food societies. This does not mean, however, that I reject such accelerated societies or that I despise them (or even Kubrick), but that they can be much more so if people stop for a moment and take a little time to absorb the pure beauty of the world in that we live. And what better opportunity there is to do this then slow down to the elegant pace of this movie and let yourself get carried away to that place between waking and dreaming. <br /> <br /> When we go to this place, it is possible to get the so-called "natural high". It is something that our spirit can do whenever we find pure and unlimited beauty. And never in my life has this "natural high" or "spiritual orgasm" as it is called by some or "samaddhi" by others were more intense. Yeah, it's more intense than a normal orgasm ... several times more intense, actually. Many religions have stated that this particular feeling proves that they are right. They are right? For me, a direct answer to such a question would only undermine the impenetrable mesmerizing mystery of the universe. In my opinion, the film attempts to convey the same mystery by depicting the black monolith and stating the following: "Except for a single very powerful radio broadcast to Jupiter, the four million-year-old black monolith remained completely inert. and purpose are still a total mystery. " The trance that Bowman experiences is the same thing I experience when watching those gorgeous visuals. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that the mystery can be frustrating for those who need direct answers from fast food to major ontological issues. But instead of comforting ourselves, we are constantly irritated by the awareness of the simplifications contained in these answers. The subsequently caused doubt and discomfort will cause us to point to our deeper intellectual activity as the source of this whole problem, while in fact we only have our easy answers to blame. But this film shows us that when quick ontological statements give rise to nothing more than doubts, we can always rely on phenomena to make some sense out of the world. From the moment you realize that beauty is something that can only really be presented to us as a phenomenon and never as a "thing in itself," the mysterious black monolith is no longer disturbing, scary or irritating, but becomes fascinating, charming and perhaps even reassuring. We do not need an answer to what is really out there to be in touch with one of the greatest forces in our lives. When we are able to let the mystery be what it is, to embrace it even ... we can finally bring our souls to rest. I am sure that a film that contains so much beauty and philosophical and artistic depth can never be surpassed. Especially now that the greatest director who ever lived is no longer with us.
