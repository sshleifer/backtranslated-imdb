A teacher from a small town (Geena Davis) slowly begins to realize that she suffered amnesia and actually used to be a secret killer of the government! Soon, there are men behind her and a little private detective (Samuel L. Jackson). <br /> <br /> This was action packed, with great special effects and pretty funny phrases (especially from Jackson). ). Although the action can be a bit silly at times, who cares? After all, are not movies a good time? <br /> <br /> Craig Bierko is entertaining as a ruthless villain. The movie itself was a good time. Just do not expect to have to think too much about it, because then if you take it too seriously, then the movie will not really be fun, but stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie does not deserve to be called stupid or any other bad name.
