I watched this movie on a night that I could not sleep, I loved it and tried to find out when it would be turned on again, probably the best movie I've ever seen at the time, and even now the cast is full of people I've never seen before, but it looks like a real-life story based in NYC. This is the kind of movie that elevates the pleasure of seeing why you see, hear and feel, from the moment I saw Wirey drinking a beer and watching the game I figured out how it should be growing up without a father, there are so many lines in this movie that I use daily as "personal time alone" in the bathroom drinking a drink 7-11, GREAT FILM
