I am a history teacher and overall, I was pleased with the film. My teenagers liked it during the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little hard work in some places? Yes ... but took my kids away from the computer and the game station to spend four nights watching everything. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes were impressive and we encountered many historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff, like Bent, was evil and charmingly brilliant. We all think that Charles stole the show from Orry and George. <br /> <br /> Let's enjoy the movie again!
