I really love this movie: music, cinematography, acting, history and all Mormon cliches. Just because they are clich√©s does not mean they are not true! This is not perfect, after all it's a movie. Although excommunications are performed in well-lit rooms with large and pleasant tables and chairs, it was entirely appropriate to portray him as the dark and cold scene they made in that film. I also liked the scene with the angel waiting at the bus stop, smoking a cigarette. I found this very cool. I mean, I believe the angels take care of us. What should you do while you wait? Smoking is a way that some people spend time while they wait. I loved the irony because Mormons make a deal about smoking. I've seen this movie 7 times in theaters in Salt Lake and I've cried every time! That drives me away. And I watched it 3 times in the video now and it still makes me cry all the time. I'd skip the chance to see him again on a big screen. I hope the Tower Theater in Salt Lake brings it back regularly at the time of the General Conference as a cult movie (pun intended but not meant to offend).
