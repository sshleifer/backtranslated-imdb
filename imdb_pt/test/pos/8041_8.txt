The acrobatic sequences (as well as the special effects) are brilliant in this film. Michael Scherer must be one of the best stunt coordinators at Canadas of all time. The Coffee Blast is a wonderful combination of acrobatics, special effects and visual effects. The director had an idea, which the crew managed to create in the film. <br /> <br /> In addition; Donald Sutherland does one of his best performances in this movie .......
