This is something I've never seen before. It made me laugh all the time, I do not think there was a scene that I did not laugh at. It's about a girl from the countryside who goes to a big city for college. At school, she befriends RA on the other side of the hall. When she realizes he has no family to go to for Thanksgiving, she invites him to go home with her. Rabecca and her family and her serious boyfriend all go out to dinner one night and Becca realizes what her boyfriend is about to do ... Propose. She asks Cral to do something, so he gets up and shouts something like ... Sorry, man, but you're late. I already asked Becca to marry me a few weeks ago at school and she said yes. This all turns into Chaos. Please see this classic, it's totally worth it ... I swear.
