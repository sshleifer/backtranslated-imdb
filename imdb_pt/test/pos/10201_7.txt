WESTERN UNION counts in melodramatic way the chain of telegraph lines between two points to the west. Brothers Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore work for Western Union, and Randolph Scott and Robert Young work for the Creightons. Indians and some bad white guys get in the way, but nothing can stop the progress of the United States. This sense of manifest destiny is greatly enhanced by a first-class soundtrack and vibrant color photography. Scott is a bank robber who tries to fix his ways, and both he and Young engineer vie for Gilmore's attention. Many of the character's great actors help keep production going.
