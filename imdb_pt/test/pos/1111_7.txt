John and his wife Emily, accompanied by their son Edward, venture into the comfortable suburban surroundings to the village where the husband spent part of his childhood. There was a death in the family, and John must begin a process to take control of an old, dilapidated seaside hut that was once inhabited by an old man who apparently committed suicide. <br /> <br /> Skeptical about the circumstances of death, John divorces his family and reality, puts his own life in danger, and puts on the clothes of the old man who is now dead. <br /> <br /> The movie now changes - nothing is as it seems - people from their past appear in full gothic glory - their wife worries about their state of mind - and their son disappears in the reeds. <br /> <br /> John discovers that the old man does not commit suicide, that his death is much more mysterious and strange. In a chilling finale, we learned that the events of the movie never happened and that the whole narrative was envisioned by the little boy Edward, who is struggling to accept the divorce proceedings of his parents. Modern Love is a macabre piece of high art cinema, an intriguing and perverse piece of pretentiousness, full of vague hints and unexplored stories in red. It is humorless and seemingly unconcerned with current Indie trends, which both validates its creators as well as makes it outdated. <br /> <br /> But the weaknesses of this Australian film are totally outweighed by its sheer cinematic vision, its blood-stained and uncompromising blood and its eccentric Euro horror. The slander of script norms and the lack of smooth dialogue become insignificant against a noir scenario and a major performance that needs to be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> One of the most aggressive Australian films of all time.
