Estevez, Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are superb in this portrait of a veterinary Vietnam war house, but still haunted by it. Bates plays a clueless mother who just wants the family to be a "family." Sheen is great as the father who tries to understand what his son is going through but is very involved in his principles to really have empathy. The setting is Thanksgiving and relatives are coming in for dinner. Estevez, who plays the returning veterinarian, does not want to be part of the family tradition and insists on wearing his combat clothes for dinner, explaining: "That's what I used on last Thanksgiving." Family fights and arguments are invaluable, particularly the "fragile peanut crisis", but the ending is exciting and terrifying. It has to be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Overall, one of the best movies I've ever seen.
