This is a movie that will brighten your day, for sure. Caco the Frog is just a common frog in his swamp when a talent agent walks past him and tells him that Hollywood is looking for frogs to be in the movies (laughs). On the way, Kermit finds Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, Gonzo and his chicken Camilla, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem, Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker. But also on the edge of Kermit is the owner of a chain of restaurants, the French Doc Hoppers Fried Frog Legs. All things considered, however, Caco and the Muppets arrive in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This movie is recommended for everyone, young and old. <br /> <br /> There are some wonderful musical numbers, such as "The rainbow connection," I'll go back there someday "and" Movin 'Right Along. "Muppets also use many forms of transportation in this movie. Kermit drives a bike, Fozzie drives a Studebaker and another car, Gonzo takes off with a packet of helium balloons (which is one of my favorite moments), and Kermit and the rest of the Muppets finally go the rest of the way on the Electric bus Mayhem (Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Janice, Scooter and Animal), who meet them in the desert after Fozzie's car crashes. <br /> <br /> Even some Muppets from Sesame Street make appearances (eg , Big Bird is walking down the road on the way to NYC to invade public television. "The finale is also a very exciting moment.Each Muppet created is in the final scene, alo With a final reprise of" Rainbow Connection " But those poor Muppets worked hard on their set, so Not everything collapsed, and the camera explodes in a huge ball of sparks. You'd think everything is ruined and destroyed, but the rainbow comes shining through the roof at the end, and it all sums up the magic of this movie, and you know that everything will be all right. Perfect 10/10. Watch and you will be delighted with the fun and sadness of this movie.
