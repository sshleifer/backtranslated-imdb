Oh, classic comedy. At the point in the movie where the brains mix, a two-minute scene with Bruce Campbell ripping apart partially reminds me of how simplistic movies and ideas can catch you and wrap you up in a whole movie. <br /> <br /> For years and years, Bruce Campbell knows what kind of movies we want from him. We want to see strange films like Bubba Ho Tep. We want to see special roles in Sam Raimi's movies, and we want to see 'Man with the Screaming Brain'. Just with the title, it is known that it will border on this kind of completely silly film, such as Army of Darkness, only with more silly and less monsters. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is simple. Bruce sees the doctor. The doctor has a new idea. Bruce makes bad things happen to him on the way to see the doctor. Coincidentally, it's the thing the doctor wanted to show him that saves him. Hilarity follows. <br /> <br /> With the addition of Ted Raimi as a Russian stranger, and the artificer Stacy Keach as Dr. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov, it's funny, that makes this movie. Full funny. It's never a scary point. <br /> <br /> If you like the silly Bruce Campbell, you'll enjoy it. So again, why would you be watching this if you did not like Bruce Campbell?
