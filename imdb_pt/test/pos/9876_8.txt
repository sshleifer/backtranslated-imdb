This was a really interesting Halloween movie. I was not really happy with Thorn's theory, but it's still a good movie. I liked to see Tommy Doyle back, but unfortunately Donald Pleasance died shortly after the shot. The film had a really bad director who did not give a shit about the series, so I heard Donald treated poor, and would not let Danielle Harris come back as Jamie. It's like he's just trying to bring down the movie, but I still like it. There have been a lot of cuts and song changes, and if you're lucky, you can get Producers Cut over 40 min. of scenes never before. With these scenes, it turns into a whole new movie. Check it out if you get the chance.
