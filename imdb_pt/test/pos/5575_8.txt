I remember ignoring the TV series when it debuted for the first time because of its "look" with Jim Hensen's muppets. However, recently a friend lent me his Farscape DVDs, and now I'm realizing the terrible mistake that was. <br /> <br /> As with any TV series, there are episodes that shine and those that do not. I ride the adrenaline rush and emotional rush during the big episodes and suffer from the dull ones. However, I stand independently because of the main storyline that links all the episodes together. What I'm talking about is the growth of the main characters and their love for each other. Let me warn you, it's absolutely irresistible to watch. I do not remember any other TV series (Babylon 5, Buffy, Angel, etc.) that smart and smart together put together a ride so painful (sometimes) and suspense. <br /> <br /> I think at the end of season four things were finally getting focused and I was shocked at the decision to cancel the show. I look forward to the release of the miniseries and invite others to discover this incredible jewel.
