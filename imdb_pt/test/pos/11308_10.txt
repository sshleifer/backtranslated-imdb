This parody is cleverly done: from the songs (Express Yourself becomes Expose Yourself, as a prayer is now Party in my Pants and Vogue is now Vague) for the cast's false interviews of the show, this movie is hilarious. Remember Madonna saying she did not know about the rainy season in Asia? In this, she does not know about the volcano season. It is a beautiful jewel. They made lots of money with this parody and that makes up for it. Highly recommended!!!
