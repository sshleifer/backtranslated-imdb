When I was a kid, this was the movie I watched. I think it's a great movie for kids to watch and parents do not have to be afraid of any violence or obscene images. Rainbow Brite is a cheerful young woman and she is trying to make the winter go away. she discovers that something or someone is trying to steal the source of life and keep it to herself. I love this movie and I think even adults can enjoy this movie.
