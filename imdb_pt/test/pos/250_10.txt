"Cover Girl" is the best musical Rita Hayworth ever made. Mrs. Hayworth will always be remembered for "Gilda", however, the next film would be "Cover Girl". The story is great. It's about a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and become great at show business. She does this without the help of her talented boyfriend / director (Gene Kelly). Mr. Kelly has a chance to choreograph the musical numbers. The dances are spectacular. It's fun to watch Phil Silvers, a comic book, do the musical numbers with Mrs. Hayworth and Mr. Kelly. <br /> <br /> The support cast is perfect. Lee Bowman has the chance to be an interesting third wheel, the other boyfriend.
