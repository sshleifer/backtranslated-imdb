This is a very funny movie. There is a self-deprecating and iconoclastic tone in the film that is very appealing. The characters are interesting. The film flows very well and maintains its interest throughout the duration of 1 hour and 50 minutes of the film. The quality of the film is not of the highest Hollywood standards; however, the original film should be made in the genre of a punk-rock style. The documentary about the attempt to make the film and the subsequent betrayal of the filmmakers is very detailed and easy to follow. The original filmmakers themselves have become the main characters in the documentary version of the film. The interviews of filmmakers and actors were brought together in a highly entertaining story that illustrates the struggles involved in producing the original film, the eventual failure of the original project and the emergence of the ashes that have turned into a phoenix-like documentary. . In my opinion, the documentary (The Texas Tale of Treason) is a much more interesting and entertaining film than the original movie (Waldos Hawiian Vacation) would ever have been. Two thumbs for a job well done.
