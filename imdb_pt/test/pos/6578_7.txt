Paha maa is a different Finnish movie. But the things that set it apart are copied outward. Some narration techniques are from Amores Perros, Jackie Brown and Elephant. Scenes are filmed from different angles again. Paha Maa is a good movie, but it is not so good that the hype says: "Realistic movie, no happy ending and no commercial admissions". Some actors did a great job. Sulevi Peltola was as good as a street vendor of a vacuum cleaner. Also Jasper Pääkkönen shows his skills. But Mikko Leppilampi was so stupid. He is so overrated actor, he is handsome and a nice guy, but not the best actor in Finland. But if you like Finnish movies, it's worth seeing Paha maa.
