About 12 minutes into the song, in the scene where Daryl Hannah and JFK Jr are hugging for the first time, there is a very beautiful song playing ... what is this song? And who is it that sings? It is a song that sounds very romantic and is a singer, piano playing, etc. I've tried everything in the world to search for music on Google and iTunes, etc., but it just does not show up, not even on Lyrics sites. So if you listen, I'd love to know enough about this so I can try to get the CD with this song, or find it on iTunes. I do not know if my email will change, I'm new at it ... but I'll be looking back here.
