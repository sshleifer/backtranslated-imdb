This is a film that left me breathless ........ wanting to learn more about Afghan history and traditions. With the current mantra of "evildoer" obscuring reality, it was inspiring to experience the beauty of people and their beliefs. <br /> <br /> The choice of cast was flawless, the setting was simply wonderful. The performance was top notch and the fact that the Academy has forgotten that (except the music) is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> The script is a wonderful and emotional journey. To provoke an "ugly cry" from this observer. <br /> <br /> A movie worth watching a second and third time.
