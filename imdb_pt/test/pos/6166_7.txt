It seems that, no matter how many films are made on the subject, there is no shortage of stories that arise from World War II. It stands to reason that a conflict on such a scale as the global war would capture the imagination of filmmakers everywhere and provide them with ample material on which to base a story. Going in a different direction than most of the films about the war is Dark Blue World, a film that does not deal with the great traditional battles of the war, does not tell the story of many of its main figures, nor does it focus on soldiers of any one of the main allies or powers of the Axis. Dark Blue World ventures into the world of refugee soldiers struggling in exile by their occupied nations. The film does a wonderful job of portraying the challenges faced by Czech pilots flying under the Royal Air Force, expressing the frustration they felt both in the language barrier between them and the other pamphlets, but also in be prevented from taking revenge against the Germans until re-trained. <br /> <br /> Dark Blue World also works very well outside the war movie arena as being a story about human relationships. A love triangle develops between the two main characters and an Englishwoman who complicates the teacher-mentor relationship of the two exiled soldiers. This relationship is extremely well executed, becoming almost parent-child relationship in many points. <br /> <br /> The air combat in the film is among some of the best and is also very interesting to explore the cultural challenges. mentioned above as men struggle to fly their machines, fight the enemy and transmit commands and answers in an unknown language. The tension and struggle of these scenes continues the tension between the men on the ground, just as the tension in the ground continues in the air. <br /> <br /> This may not be a movie for everyone. The war-buff may find the exploration of relationships a little disappointing, but it is generally an excellent film, regardless of the war element or not.
