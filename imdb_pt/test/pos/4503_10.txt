This is absolutely one of our favorites of 2007. <br /> <br /> The tale of two boys who come from different worlds but are as close as siblings are brilliantly told. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot, and scripted - from childhood to adulthood, it never fails. <br /> <br /> A brilliant vision of a lost culture and a very good way of understanding Persian cultures and traditions is also an exceptional tale in itself. It is both compassionate and exhilarating, edifying and filled with immense sadness, joyous and depressing. <br /> <br /> With excellent cast performances and great technical skills behind the camera, this is really the best film. <Br /> <br /> Higher recommendation: a real slice of life that raises and informs.
