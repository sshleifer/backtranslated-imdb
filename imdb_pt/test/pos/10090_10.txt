Normally, a movie can have factors like "awakening", "good sense", "sense of purpose", "plot", etc. There is always something that can be taken from the movies, it's just a matter of how convincing the reason is, for me to own it in my collection. "Tales of Two Sisters," as they call it when it was released in my country, has a tremendous sensation and a eventually (mostly) self-explanatory plot. I love horror movies that revolve around a house. The titles that come to mind are "The Others", "The Haunting", "The Haunting of Hell House". This movie will be another great example that I will remember. The film had an extremely rich color, the way the house was decorated, the clothes the characters wore, the open sky daylight scenes that contrasted with most horror films, which typically make use of desaturated shades and dark environments (I think Honogurai mizu no soko kara, Dark Water, which is another program I like) this film a sense of aesthetics and joy when it was not in its most exciting moments, the characters are extremely believable, which may be partially attributed to the family background of this film, maybe the domestic problems are also easier for me too. as the actors identify themselves and the actors become Some of their characters with exceptional delicacy. the director plays with timelines in order to give the audience the story in pieces, allowing them to come to their own terms of interpretation, rather than presenting everything in a linear fashion. This is a positive aspect of this film, in my opinion, and perhaps it is my interpretation of this film that allows me to find it enjoyable. I would definitely look at this on DVD.
