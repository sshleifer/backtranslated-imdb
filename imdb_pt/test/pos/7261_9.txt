I've seen the previews everywhere before deciding to watch it. And what you know, I really liked it! There is a new twist on eighteenth-century England. Although the music in the dance scene has obviously been modernized and also the colors of Liv Tyler's outfits (though she's beautiful!), She fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> If you just want a good time, you should check it out. Very different from other detailed 18th century films.
