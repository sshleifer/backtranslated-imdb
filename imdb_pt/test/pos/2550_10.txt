For the same reason that I love movies like "Central Brazil" ("Central Station", 1998), I really love "Chop Shop". There is no coating of sugar, there is no attempt to turn these people's lives into something more palatable or beautiful. What you see is what you get, and this is often courageous and sometimes painful. But that's exactly what makes a movie like "Chop Shop" so wonderful, alongside the fact that the plot unfolds so elegantly and subtly. For a younger brother and sister who are closer to homelessness than you might want, working (and living) at a mechanic's shop in Queens, New York, is the best you can. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? This is the question that this film essentially represents for the viewer. This movie is really a fantastic piece of slice of life that sometimes looks like a documentary instead of a drama, and that's great because it looks and it's so real. In the midst of this, so many current films based on essentially surrealistic and often implausible plots, stumbling into "Chop Shop" is like finding a little gem.
