In the late 1940s, there were a series of short films entitled "Flicker Flashbacks," in which excerpts from silent dramas featuring such names as Mary Pickford and Blanche Sweet were played for laughter. Clips scratched from old-fashioned old movies were rearranged, projected very quickly, and received a superposition of songs and jokes. The attitude expressed through this brutal treatment summed up the vision of Hollywood from the middle of the last century: silent movies were considered corny, flowery, a bit embarrassing, and only good for a laugh. During the 1950s, this attitude gradually began to change for several reasons. James Agee's famous 1949 essay on Life Magazine's silent clowns was a major factor, but television played a major role in resurrecting viewers with silent films. Admittedly, TV networks sometimes dealt with the material as roughly as people on "Flicker Flashbacks," but the higher-pitched series, such as "Silents, Please," treated the films with respect. Another landmark was Robert Youngson's compilation, THE GOLDEN AGE OF COMEDY, which proved to be a surprise when it was released in theaters in late 1957. <br /> <br /> I do not know if Charles Chaplin was aware of Youngson's film or his success at the box office, but it was at this time that he decided to release a theatrical re-release of three of his best short comedies, THE DOG'S LIFE, OMBRO ARMS (both made in 1918), and THE PEREGRINE (made in 1922 and released in the year Following). These three films worked well as a trio, as they contrast very well with plot, theme and scenario. In addition, all three feature familiar faces of the Chaplin stock company, some of which play several roles in each short. At the time of the revival, the films had not been publicly shown in more than thirty years, so perhaps Chaplin was concerned about maintaining his reputation with a new generation of moviegoers, especially since his best work was rarely on television. Unfortunately, Chaplin apparently concluded that the films moved very quickly at the old speed of silent projection, so the decision was made to "stretch" them, which meant that everyone else's picture was printed twice. Maybe he wanted to avoid the "Flicker Flashbacks" look, but that was not the best way to do it. Aesthetically speaking, the results were terrible and practically destroyed the flow of action of the films, but that was how THE CHAPLIN REVUE was released in theaters in 1959, and that was the version that was transferred to the video and made available commercially by Playhouse Video in the years 80. I bought a VHS copy of the movie at the time and was terribly disappointed by the irregular rhythm of the movies. <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure to find that David Shepard's restoration of Chaplin's compilation (originally produced for the CD format) is a major improvement over the Playhouse Video version. For the most part, the projection speed was corrected. The "stretched print" has disappeared, however, although the action seems to creep at times. For example: in DOG'S LIFE during Edna and Charlie's clumsy dance at Caf√© Green Lantern, Edna's bare arms seem visibly confused; At another point, during the trench scene in SHOULDER ARMS when Charlie is released from sentry duty, the action seems strangely slowed down for a few moments, but this may be the result of a movie restorers maneuver to cover up some decomposition. . Overall, the picture quality is fantastic considering the age of the movies themselves. <br /> <br /> Other bonuses: REVUE begins with rare behind-the-scenes scenes from Chaplin's studio. This includes scenes from an obviously staged rehearsal session where Chaplin strangles the diminutive actor Loyal Underwood as well as scenes of Charlie on his dressing table, putting on his make-up and trimming the famous mustache. These scenes are accompanied by the narration of Chaplin, distributed in a fast clip. Chaplin also composed a new music score for the compilation, and in my opinion, his songs for REVUE are rated with their best compositions, especially the pieces used during the coffee sequence in A DOG'S LIFE. The only exception is the song written for THE PILGRIM, a pseudo-Singin 'Cowboy called "Bound for Texas," sung in Fifties style by Matt Monro (sounding quite like Gene Autry), who is distractedly anachronistic and out of place. Otherwise, throughout the rest of REVUE, the song is perfectly suited for action and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It seems that the release of THE CHAPLIN REVUE image is, in a sense, its long postponement. premiere, featuring these classic comedies the way they were meant to be seen all the time. In this form, REVUE ranks with Chaplin's more durable and pleasing jobs.
