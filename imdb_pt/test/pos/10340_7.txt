The plot of this movie is as stupid as a bag of hair. Jimmy Smit plays a character who could have been annoyed by the ridiculousness of the story. He is an evil and a wife spanker. It's a character as far as possible from the NYPD and LA Law roles you could have. <br /> <br /> If you thought he had the looks and acting skills to play the role of bad boy, she is your gift. . <br /> <br /> But !!!!!!!! Mary Louis Parker wears black miniskirts and small black dresses throughout the film. <br /> <br /> She has always had some of the best legs in movie history. This makes the movie worth it for this leg admirer. <br /> <br /> I would buy the DVD for that reason only if it was available.
