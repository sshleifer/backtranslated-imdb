For a TV movie this was definitely worth seeing. The whole performance was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme. I did not read the original and as a rule I can not stand Shakespeare, but I liked that movie (the civil war scene was also very well done). Do not expect to see an epic, however, you should find it moving enough to enjoy. By the way (on a side note) do not compare this (or any other movie for that matter) to the original work. Movies should not transfer a book to the screen, but rather take the general idea of ​​a book and then adapt a story from it. When people say "the book was much better" (anyway, they are usually wrong), what they are really trying to say is that the book was very different.
