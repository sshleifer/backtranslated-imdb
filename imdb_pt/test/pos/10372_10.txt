After the Funeral was absolutely superb, and by far the best episode of the season. I was disappointed with Cards On the Table, which started very well, but declined considerably in the last half hour, and I did not know what to think of Taken After the Flood, although I remember being confused in the end. After the Funeral, as I said, it's one of my favorite Poirot episodes, up there with Five Little Pigs, Sad Cypress and The ABC Murders. I feared they would ruin the story, but instead, she is very loyal to the book. Now I will say that I do not care about the changes in the books, and I try not to compare movies and TV adaptations to their sources, except when the book is a masterpiece and adaptation does not do it justice. That's why I did not like some of the Marples like Nemesis and Sleeping Murder, and so far from the Poirots The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Taken in the Flood and Cards at the Table are the only ones that really disappointed. Everything else ranges from good to excellent, even the recent Appointment with Death, despite the many deviations from the book, which I admit to not being a favorite, was surprisingly good, thanks to marvelous production values, stellar ensemble performances and excellent trail sound . Back to After the Funeral, the production values ​​are fantastic. It has a really cinematic feel, and the stunning photography and splendid settings and costumes have made it a visual feast for the eyes. The song was very exciting and even haunting, and the whole cast gave wonderful performances. David Suchet is always impeccable as Poirot, and Geraldine James and Anna Calder Marshall are equally wonderful. But to me, the highlight was Monica Dolan as Mrs. Gilchrist, she's up there with Donald Sumpter and Polly Walker as the best supporting actor / actress in an episode of Poirot, that's how her performance was good. In short, unmissable, one of the best episodes of Poirot, and one of the most faithful as well. 10/10 Bethany Cox
