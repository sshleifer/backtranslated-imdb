This is both a fun and touching version of the classic tale, also quite clever, not the school's 'Me Tarzan, You Jane'. <br /> <br /> It is the famous story of a child brought up to adulthood. in the jungle by monkeys. A titled British couple (the pregnant wife) is trapped in the African camps after a wreck. After the parents' death, the baby is raised in the jungle by monkeys. Twenty years later, this young man (ie, Tarzan) rescues a wounded Belgian explorer, recovering him from health. The Belgian discovers evidence that his rescuer is the young Lord Greystoke and returns him to his rightful state in Scotland, where he must adapt to civilized society. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two parts. In the first half, we see Tarzan in his jungle environment. Not being an expert, I do not know the realism of his description of the monkey community life, but it's certainly fun. For me, the most moving part is the second half, when Tarzan must meet his royal family, develop language skills and adjust to the aristocratic British society, while courting Jane (Andie MacDowell). He is portrayed as a "noble savage" either in wildlife or in elegant Edwardian halls. In contrast, the upper crust is described as often much more barbaric than the jungle that Tarzan left. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert is fantastic in his sympathetic portrayal of Tarzan both in the jungle and in civilized environments. It conveys a real sense of his confusion and conflict, torn between the two very different worlds, his family of original monkeys and his new human family. Sir Ralph Richardson, one of the ancient British legends, is as brilliant as ever in the role of Tarzan's grandfather, the Sixth Earl of Greystoke. <br /> <br /> The film focuses more on Tarzan's struggles in adapting to civilization and its internal conflict than on its exploits in the jungle. This unusual view of the old classic makes the dramatic adventure typical, but also, above all, a touching personal story. I was not surprised to note here that its director is the same guy, Hugh Hudson, who also directed Chariots of Fire, another brilliant movie.
