This movie is like Happiness meets Lost in Translation with a Sixth Sense ending (or maybe a surprise Crying Game), and the best soundtrack I've probably heard ... if all this makes sense. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds pretty much say you're on a winding road. (I was surprised that no one left early during the premiere in Brooklyn.) But from then on, the film sets in a conversation festival between two really damaged people, Daphne and Buddy. <br /> <br /> Alone, mess and boy they talk about sex. Daphne brings to life her most interesting tales about escort, some are quite funny (Mr. Chang) some disturbing (the Harlan scenes with music telling us what we see now may be what is happening, or what Daphne is really feeling ), and because I have a friend who used to accompany, I might add, most seem pretty real. <br /> <br /> You are alone is multi-layered and mostly brilliant. Okay, maybe a couple of minutes less than talk, and I do not know if we would have missed something. <br /> <br /> So again, I need to see this again knowing the end. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. <br /> <br /> (The director asked the people in the Brooklyn public to write a review on the IMDb, because many people read them. Grant granted.)
