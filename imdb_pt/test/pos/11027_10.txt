I watched this movie at 75 and this movie was kind of open-minded to me about how important it is to take care of the Natur and the wildlife. When I got a dog in '83, I called him TRUSKA (in the movie, Avakun's dog) to never forget this movie. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, I have a Copy this Movie, but it's in Portuguese and the quality is not as good as a DVD or a new VHS (I recorded almost 20 years ago and SLP speedy. is so good ..) <br /> <br /> If anyone wants a copy .. I will try converting it to DVD and can I send it to you OK? <br /> <br /> Ot's a great movie and I agree it's a movie to always be watched. <br /> <br /> Waldemar Braz - SÃ£o Paulo / Brazil
