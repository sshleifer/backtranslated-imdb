The fast pace and many pop culture references may leave some viewers confused, but once you realize the Gilmores' ways, you'll be hooked for a lifetime. Just a few random reviews, I recently (finally) started watching Season 6 and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far. I love the Luke-Lorelai thing and all the drama in the various episodes is (as always) exciting. The only thing I do not like so much is the bad attitude and the reckless actions that Rory suddenly "adopted." Unfortunately I do not think this is very realistic and I hope it's not just a way to bring more drama to keep the season strong. All in all great season however and I can not wait for the next one !!! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashly a.k.a. "Tookie Clothespin"
