This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has all the tragedy and happiness, love and hate. And a deep friendship that even war can not destroy. <br /> <br /> The most splendid cast I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were first-rate in this film. <br /> <br /> If you see Part 1, you will want to see everything. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at my house, then went out and bought the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm a Civil War aficionado, but this movie has my grandchildren interested in history. Any movie that can get kids to learn history is great. I have Books I, II and III and when the girls come from Florida every year they want to see the North and the South.
