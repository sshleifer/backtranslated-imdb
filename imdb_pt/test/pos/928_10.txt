In the "goofs" section of this film, there is a comment in the sense that there is an error of continuity in which Auguste's car is seen parked in a different place from that seen in an earlier shot in the same scene. This is incorrect. One of the views is from Auguste's apartment, the other is from Valentiné's apartment across the street. The whole purpose of this segment is to show how Valentiné and Auguste - who can be made for each other - almost cross paths (as they do several other times), but never do, until circumstances bring them together on the ferry at the end of the film . (And here is the implication that Joseph manipulated things so that Auguste was on that ferry, having inspected Valentiné's passage to see which of them she was registered.)
