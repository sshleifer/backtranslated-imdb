This movie is great from beginning to end about a group of medical students who come together and literally kill each other by quitting their hearts and then recovering. They then research what happens from the experiences of "near death". As each one passes through experience, they become haunted by their deeper fears that seem to materialize as reality. This ranges from dead boys with hockey sticks to dead parents who seem to be upstairs. <br /> <br /> The cast is top notch and Oliver Platt is hilarious in one of the best roles of his career. I'm not a big fan of Keifer Sutherland, but even he does a great job. This is a movie that I can watch over and over!
