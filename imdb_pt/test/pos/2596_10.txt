Chuck Jones's 'Rabbit Seasoning', the second of the much-loved hunting trilogy, is often considered the best of the three. Although I find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic designs, I would have to admit that 'Rabbit Seasoning' is the most refined script. Here the emphasis is put on the language as Bugs and Daffy go through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of Abbott and Costello's 'Who's on next' routine. As a long-term Daffy fan, I've always been delighted with the hunting trilogy, because it's always Daffy who picks up all the best lines (the famous "pronoun problem" is one of the classics of all time) and does most of it of work. Bugs plays the role of legal manipulator, while Elmer, as always, is the dupe dupe. Part of what makes the hunting trilogy such fun is that Daffy and Elmer pose such a small threat to Bugs that he's basically just relaxing and laughing easily. Elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him, but it is poor Daffy who comes out of the worst, being shot in the face again and again, his beak ending in increasingly ridiculous positions. It all relies on the inevitable climatic statement, "You're despicable." As intricate an example of the impeccable timing of Chuck Jones as you will find, 'Rabbit Seasoning' is a true classic.
