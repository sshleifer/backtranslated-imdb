Good drama movie about a children's custody case with great acting from all the actors. A good example of what an excellent script can do to boost a simple story to a much higher quality. However, the screenplay was only medium and was Still, the great acting makes this movie a good movie to see if you're a fan of court dramas or a big fan of the leading actors. The film should have been a little longer. for excellency, but that would be really difficult ...
