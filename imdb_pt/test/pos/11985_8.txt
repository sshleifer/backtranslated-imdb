This is not especially well written. The songs are not memorable. The cast, however, tightens this situation of Martin and Lewis in the Navy. Both look great as young sailors. They are believable. The scenes on the submarine show just how tight it must have been on these underwater missions in the 1950s and before. <br /> <br /> Many sailors in many scenes. Hundreds, perhaps, on a great outdoor exercise field, and again in a boxing arena. <br /> <br /> You'll see James Dean in his scene. It stands out even though it is an extra here. In a scene where Jerry crosses a busy street, we see some of his "near-misses" comedy that he would bring into play years later on Patsy. <br /> <br /> Dean giving Jerry boxing instructions is a good comedy skit to watch. Jerry in the boxing ring shows off his high energy that was his trademark in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The dance of Dean and Jerry is a pleasure. Not great, but it's better than most movies that are not dancing. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing if you do not mind black and white. Good end. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
