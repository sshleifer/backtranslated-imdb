Doctor Who is incredible. It's everyone's cup of tea. Must be. The boys will like the monsters and the action and adventure and the girls will like the emotions and feelings that are there. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper was extraordinary like Rose Tyler. She was so emotional and made Rose so real. <br /> <br /> David Tennant is also so witty and funny and is so nice to watch. <br /> <br /> But now Billie left and Rose is trapped in a parallel universe with her on-off boyfriend Mickey and his mother and father (he died when Rose was a baby, but this Pete Tyler is from the parallel universe) . It will be very strange that Martha is the new companion, as I only saw her with Rose (besides the Bride in Escape with Catherine Tate). <br /> <br /> Freema is better to be good !!! <br /> But nobody can beat Rose !!!
