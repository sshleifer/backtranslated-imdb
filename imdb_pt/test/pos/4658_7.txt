Somewhere in the dark recesses of my brain cells, a song touches my head. I can not forget, no matter how hard I try. It's the MIDNIGHT MADNESS and it will get to you! I wish I could find a copy of that on a 45rpm record. Five different teams leave one night in LA for a trail hunt instead of physical objects. A sloppy game master with two gorgeous assistants is the mentor of all this insanity that is about to be unleashed in Los Angeles. All the teams are stereotypes (this movie is from 1980, before the political correction spoiled everything): the "goodies," the nerds, led by Eddie Deezen, the idiot "athletes" who love beer, "women who do not we need a man, "especially the redhead. The laughing twins are also screams. And finally, the "bad guys" with Stephen Furst as the leader. Furst is hilarious as the obese Harold, whose attempt to use a computer to decipher the various clues leads to a sticky mess. Movies like this are no longer made. Nowadays, movies have to have a "nervousness" for them, with some dark characters and other nonsense. Go back to the days when the "good guys" led by David Naughton were still good and did not clash desperately. Then pour out all the serious pretensions and go back to 1980. IT'S MIDNIGHT DEATH. . .
