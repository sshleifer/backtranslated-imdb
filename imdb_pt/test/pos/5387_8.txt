What is your fucking problem? You have nothing better to do than sit on your fat ass and blog about how you find something tasteless? Here's an idea: Go outside. That's right: Walk out of your mother's basement that you've been living for 13 years and GO OUT. "But I can not get out! Star Trek is in 30 minutes and I still have not married this avatar in World of Warcraft!" Oh my God, in that case, stay inside! All right, I could have gone to the sea there. I mean, Star Trek is fine, but I do not watch much more. Anyway, do you really have to write some crap about Mind of Mencia? It's a good show. Maybe you're just venting your anger because that girl dumped you in World of Warcraft. Or you are constipated. Try to put fiber in your diet.
