For just making a few movies with his life, Late Great Chris Farley. Farley died in late 1997 and will be lost mostly by his co-star Tommy Boy, David Spade. From the spoiled Police Academy 4 Spade really did well in his film career. Tommy Boy is a classic and we will always remember Chris Farley when we watch. From appearing on Saturday NIGHT LIVE to doing Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, Ninja Beverley Hills, Almost Heroes, Billy Madison and Dirty Work. I think Chris Farley has had a short and successful career. Tommy Boy was his best in my case and I would watch over and over again and laugh at the same part every time. Thank you Chris Farley.
