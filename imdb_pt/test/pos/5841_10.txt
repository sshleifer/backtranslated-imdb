I've never seen a show with so much history, mystery, suspense and overwhelming emotion before. I barley watch TV more, but I own every season of this show and it's amazing. each episode is extremely well interpreted, written and plotted. at the end of the program, I felt the stories were getting exaggerated because they were in prison, but the actors succeeded. Sopranoes is a huge drug compared to OZ. in fact, any program that is on a cable network, HBO or not, can not hold a candle to the OZ. I'd like you to come back for another season. if that happened, they would probably kill all the characters in the show, but, hey, we all have to go someday. As for the characters, I'd say O'Reily and Alverez were my favorites. both were hardley in a scene together, but their individual stories that I thought were the strongest of anyones except Beechers, of course, but still ... anyway, best show of all time, best network of all times, some of the best actors of all time.
