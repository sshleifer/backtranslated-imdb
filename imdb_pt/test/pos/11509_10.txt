The film is about Paul (Páll), a young man who plunges into the cruel world of insanity and stays at the psychiatric hospital "Kleppur" and his friends. Victor (Viktor) who during his education in England began to think that he was Adolf Hitler. Peter (Peter), who took too much LSD and tried to fly from a roof on top of the fall did not leave broken bones or physical damage just insanity, he is obbsesed with China. Oli Beatle (Oli Bítill) Oli spent most of the time in the hospital, although Viktor is a little older than him, he claims that he wrote all Beatles songs and sends them by telepathy. <br /> <br /> The novel is better than the film and covers the entire life of Pauls from birth until his death, long since I saw the film, but if I remember well, the film does not cover Paul's childhood. <br /> <br /> "Englar Alheimsins" is funny, sad and powerful, if you have not seen it, watch it now! and reading the novel first makes the movie better
