I saw this movie for the first time last night. I've been thinking about it all night and this morning. I can not say it was my favorite movie, at least not yet. I need to see it again. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is impressive. Each scene has a lyricism that would be expected in a movie that has the name of Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> It's always tempting to see Chirico in any image of rows of orders disappearing into the darkness, but in this case, the analogy fits. In many ways, Malkovich's figure traversing the fog and wind of Ferarra echoes the shadow of the statue that haunts Milan in the main works of the Italian-Greek painter. He is slightly threatening, a presence he watches and, in his capacity as a film director, exerts influence over the whole story. <br /> <br /> Wenders' dedicated fan can not help but think of a bit of Damiel and Cassiel wandering the streets of Berlin, observing everything but not interacting directly with the locals. And, following the metaphor Himmel Uber Berlin, the angel (or in this case Malkovich, the director) manages to interact with one of the stories. <br /> <br /> At this point I have to get away from taking this line of criticism too far. I need to see the movie again. I'm pretty sure that this is the topic that will bring Malkovich's monologue together. <br /> <br /> Perhaps your reflections and pontifications are a pretentious and empty dialogue that sounds good, but can not be analyzed in real communication. Perhaps that is the main point of this. No one can make this judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until he has done his homework. <br /> <br /> We must be careful when playing the word "pretentious." It is easy to dismiss anything that smacks of the intellect as a pretense, but this leads to a terrifying state of mind in which the only conversation seen as genuine, earthy, or authentic is the most banal. When we dodge all the discussions about philosophy, God, existence, meaning, and all that brain, we are preparing our culture for a slow, stupid and ugly death. Maybe this is the warning that Wenders and Antonioni are giving us. Certainly not the only theme of the film, but I think it can not be ignored. <br /> <br /> The other (and most obvious) leitmotif is that of satisfaction. There is a lot here, and a thorough review of all the subtleties and consequences of developing this leitmotif would exceed the 1,000 word limit for this review. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch the movie. . But I offer a caveat: it's not a standalone movie (at least I do not think so yet). Some films interact so much with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their times that the viewer needs to have a track record in the Zeitgeist before approaching the film. Par-dela les nuages ​​is one of those films.
