For me, "Anatomie" is certainly one of the best movies I've ever seen. I do not think "Anatomie" was meant primarily to be a horror movie, but a movie questioning the ethics of science. If you watch with that in mind, this will become a really good movie. The only annoying part was the awful dubbing of the English version. How can you expect any non-German to hear these unbearable German accents for two hours? Let native English speakers speak or use subtitles!
