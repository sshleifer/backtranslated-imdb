My friend took me to a screening of this movie in Hollywood and it was amazing! It's a noir movie with incredible acting, great script, cool music, the whole thing was very well made and fun. I do not know if it's getting a release in theaters, but this would be a great date movie or a fun movie to rent if you see it on Blockbuster. This is the kind of movie that I love, little budgeted, but great in style and imagination. I hope that Alexandra Holden has more great parts as she has in this, she is fantastic.
