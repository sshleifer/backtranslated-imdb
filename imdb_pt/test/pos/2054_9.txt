I had never heard of this movie until it appeared on cable TV and I can not understand why. Geena beats Arnold as an action hero in this movie! Geena is a brain-dead former CIA assassin and receives an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. She continues this life for 8 years with a husband and a daughter. Clues begin to come to her that she may have been someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. It seems that her former employers have discovered that she has never died and wants to make sure she is dead. She hires Samuel L. Jackson, who is a former police officer. Together, they form a pair that is as much fun as Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. When Geena finally regains her memory, she undergoes a transformation in the killing machine that once was with the song "She's Not There" playing in the background. What follows is that Geena and Samuel have to go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive. Throughout the rest of the film, Geena has to decide who she really is. The insensitive killing machine? The mother / teacher with a quiet family life? Or a combination of both? Especially since the thugs catch Geena's daughter. Great action scenes that fit any of the Die Hard movies!
