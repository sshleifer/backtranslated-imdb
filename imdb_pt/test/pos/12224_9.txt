I'm continually amazed at the US networks. What's the matter with them? However, another very promising series ended up with only 15 episodes and we did not know what the heck happened to everyone. I really enjoyed this show and I'm so annoyed that we're never going to find out what happens to the characters and the 'monsters' from the depths. This show had it all. Humor, suspense, action. What more could you want. Why, oh, why did you take that? It just does not make sense. Buffy continued through 7 series, as well as Charmed and enjoyable as they were, Surface, Invasion and Dead Like Me were even better. Just because a show does not have a very high audience does not mean it's rubbish, and if they did give it a little more time, more people would probably pick it up and end up with a big hit on their hands. One season just does not give enough time to pick up and the networks are far from wanting to pull the plug. They must learn that, like good wines and cheeses, they take time to mature. <br /> <br /> Bring surface and invasion back - P L E A S E !!!!!!!
