I felt this way when I saw the episode in its original version and still agree when watching the reruns. You made the culprits ridicule Columbus throughout the episode and treat him as if he had down syndrome. And in the end you see their shock when Columbus picks them up for rights and arrests them. You also get a realistic reaction from arrogant, overbearing killers. They still could not give Columbus his props and say he was only lucky. I like the formula where there is an elaborate crime, the killer totally underestimates Columbus, and then you realize that Columbus was playing totally with the criminals. I remember that in the first episodes of the episodes post 1989 they were not following this formula and this was the first episode that I was satisfied.
