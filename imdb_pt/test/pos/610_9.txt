Mikio Naruse's examination of the lives of three unrequited, unclaimed ex-pattersons in postwar Japan is a wonderful piece of character. They used to be friends in the old days, but now their relationship is tense because one of the women has become a successful moneylender and the other two owes her. Although the lender is the only one who has succeeded in this reconstruction economy, she is the only one of the three who has no children. The other two have a child they depend on for income because none of them works. Complications occur when children decide to marry (though not with each other) and leave the home. This makes the old bitter and complaining women even more bitter and grumbling, getting drunk and lamenting their rotten children and the indecent friend, the moneylender. Meanwhile, the moneylender is unhappy, despite his fortunes. She has no one but her young deaf maid to keep her company, and casual encounters with two ex-lovers of her geisha days do not lead to anything-all they really want is to borrow money from her. The three characters are all sunk in the quicksand of their own bored lives and are too tired to fight hard, generally preferring to resign themselves to the futility of everything or at the very least throw complaints from one side to the other. others. <br /> <br /> "Late Chrysanthemums" is very slow and not much happens, but Naruse, like all great directors, has the ability to do much with very little. I have not seen much of his work, but I suspect this is not the best of him, even if it's very good. The problem, I think, is that everything does not seem like much. But the movie is full of good points. Although it's cynical, it's not that much. Naruse seems to sympathize with his desperate characters, and he paints vivid portraits that make the characters seem somewhat noble in the misery of their misery. While the film is not a must-see, it's important as a fragment of the work of a large and little-known (out-of-the-way) director, precious little of what is available on video here in the US.
