"Showtime" is a funny movie starring funnymen Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents, The Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story goes like this: at the beginning of the film, Detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective enter a television store trying to arrest some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray (Eddie Murphy), a police officer, tries to arrest Mitch without knowing that he is a police officer. During this scene, many funny things happen that catch the attention of TV producer Chase Ritz. She's so excited about their adventures together, she decides to do a TV show called "Showtime," starring Tray (the cop) and Mitch (the detective). But that's just the fun part. The rest is strictly thriller and action. There is a foreign man who is selling and making extremely dangerous weapons. While they play LAPD on the show and do it in real life, DeNiro and Murphy have a great adventure in this story. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give seven or eight.
