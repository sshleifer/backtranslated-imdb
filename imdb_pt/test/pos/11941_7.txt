Peter Coyote was the only name I recognized from the cast list, so I was not too interested in watching this movie. The only comment about the IMDb was positive so I watched it on T.V. late night I would recommend this movie as a good view late at night. It's better than much of that genre. The plot is great, the acting is not brilliant, but not bad. I do not usually like flashbacks, but in this movie they work. As I said, I did not recognize any of the castings by name, but I recognized Michele Lee, who did a decent and enduring performance, like the woman wanting to stand next to her man, who is lying to her. (Was it Knots Landing?) Anyway, she's wearing it very well. Note: You can have more fun if you miss the first few seconds of the credits. I did and it helped me. When you see the final credits, you understand what I mean. Wayne Kennedy's character, which is really weird, takes it to a 7 instead of a 6.
