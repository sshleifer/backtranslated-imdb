The red dust is well executed and well made, but the film is about what I think will annoy many viewers, as it did with me. There was a movie that was previously released called "in my country" with Sam Jackson and was not so well received and both films were almost exactly the same, I think the red dust was better because of the more interesting performances especially by O future Oscar winner Chiwton Ejofor, but the plot is only to lack, it starts very strong, but the film reaches the viewers with innumerable sessions of non-interesting court room, this could have been a great film if the writing was not so lack. But watch out for the performances.
