<br /> <br /> When I first heard about it in 1997, during breakfast with friends, I decided to take a look. The only problem was that it was on a small screen in one of my local cinemas. <br /> <br /> That did not stop the pleasure of seeing a simply great movie, with a high level cast in Aidan Quinn, Donald. Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. The whole movie kept me glued to my place. <br /> <br /> I just did not find flaws in this great movie, I gave my highest recommendation to those who love thrillers. I'm very proud to have this in my collection. <br /> <br /> 10/10 (I do not take it lightly).
