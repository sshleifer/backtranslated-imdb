There are times when I'm convinced that the Mikado is the best Sullivan & Gilbert opera ever, but that's only while I'm not listening to Iolanthe. In any case, the Mikado is probably the most frequently filmed of the Savoy Operas. (Yes, I put the composer in. No one says Hammerstein and Rodgers, or Hart and Rodgers, or Boito and Verdi, or what is his face and Strauss.) You do not even hear the names of the librettists of Offenbach, Suppe Gilbert was just the biggest name (and the biggest ego) at the time, so they put their name first. It's time for this silly practice to be laid to rest. Mikado is a complication of S & G's operetta. He has some of Sullivan's most compelling numbers, combined with some of Gilbert's smarter lyrics. This particular production, filmed in a live performance in 1990, transforms your imagination into striking simplicity: at a British seaside resort at the end of the Art Nouveau period, it ends with the japonerie of the original. is to dress and put on a mixture of white, gray and black, accented by occasional fragments of red (and less frequent uses of yellow and green). It takes some getting used to, but it's really cool. Of course, when the choir says they are lords of Japan, you would be right to exclaim, "Oh, pooh. (I just said that?) It is very gratifying that this good production is now on DVD. However, one caveat: the impression seems to be photographed through a glass of imperfect clarity, so that the expected sharpness of the image is softened and always slightly diffused. The tendency to overlay images is, unfortunately, annoying. Why do people who are doing a really cool production want to ruin everything with this kind of art? But it's the performance that counts the most. We can skip the opening, since, although one is executed, Sullivan never wrote one. (It is true that he may have written nothing to any of the Savoy, but Mikado's opening did not even date Sullivan's life and was compiled by observing the techniques used in the others.) As for the rest of the operetta, it is first-rate and extremely funny. <br /> <br /> Ko-Ko here is the esteemed Eric Idle, who credits him. There is a tradition of bringing a great name to the role. O was a US TV production years ago when Ko Ko was interpreted by Groucho Marx with mixed results. Idle's performance is delightfully peculiar ... he does "Extracted from a county jail" watched by a tennis racket. His "I've Got a Little List" is made as a speech to a microphone - of course he has the usual up-to-date lyrics, which are a lot funnier than usual for such things, and his delivery is positively hysterical. It continues everywhere. <br /> <br /> In this operetta, it is important to have a good Katisha; It's no fun if you're not being yelled at in style. This Mikado has a fabulous Katisha in Felicity Palmer, almost as Big a Name as Idle. She plays with the best of them in a wonderful rich contralto ... wonderful, especially for a soprano. And your fantasy ... !!! (Not to mention his recital with Franz Liszt, apparently, accompanying). Nanki-Poo is played by Bonaventura Bottone. I have difficulty getting around, it's a chubby nanki-pooish fault - but the voice is undeniably a solid and rich addition to the vocal palette. There is a nice touch during "The Wandering Minstrel", where the chorus reacts with disgust to the mention of "your nancy in the knee" - keep in mind the Mikado's decree on flirting. Anyway, Bottone is a great singer and if his appearance does not put the best face on Nanki-Poo, his performance does. <br /> <br /> Yum-Yum (Lesley Garett) and her friends are appropriately cute and silly. She and Bottone make beautiful duets. Pish-Tush (Mark Richardson) interprets his persona as something that is a blageur and does it very well. Poo Bah (Richard Van Allan) is wonderful as a plush shirt out of the water ... a role later made to death in American sitcoms (you know: arrogant butlers forced to care for spoiled children - that sort of thing). The Mikado (Richard Angas) is wonderfully marvelous, with an imperious voice in absolute disagreement with his ridiculous lyrics. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend that you achieve this as your only Mikado. Get good traditional production too, so you can see what Gilbert intended (more or less) in terms of staging. That said, I will watch this video twice while viewing any traditional bit once. Overall, this is a fantastic offer, a vocal and visual delight, with a delicious over-action. It's a treasure trove, with dervish maids, tap dancers and everything. Pay attention to the chargers with signs.
