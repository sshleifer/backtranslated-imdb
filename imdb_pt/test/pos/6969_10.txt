Ghoulies IV may not be the best in the series, but it's not too bad if you do not take it too seriously then you might like it. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Peter Liapis return Johnathan Graves, who gave up using magic and became a detective, but still thinks about what happened at Ghoulies. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a woman named Alexandra who is Johnathan's ex-girlfriend who invades a museum and picks up a red gem, using the gem she arouses her boyfriend named Faust who is the black side of Johnathan, but he needs the gem so he can get into the real world and John gets sent to hell. <br /> <br /> Something goes wrong and Alex loses the gem, so she needs to find a new one, as she leaves the portal still open and two little Ghoulies called Lite and Drak appear. They're not the real Ghoulies, since they look like guys in a Troll costume wearing a mask, but that does not matter, since they're funny in parts. Lite and Dark need to find Johnathan, since he can return them home so they go around causing chaos as they try to find Johnathan. Another difference is that the two Ghoulies are the good guys, unlike the previous films. <br /> <br /> I have found that Ghoulies IV is good but this movie may not be for everyone, check out if you like low budget movies like Troll 2.
