Originally filmed in 1999 as a TV pilot, "Mulholland Dr." was rejected. The following year, David Lynch was given money to film new scenes to make the film suitable for screening in theaters. He did it - and created one of the biggest, most bizarre and nightmarish movies ever made. <br /> <br /> The movie does not really have main characters, but if there were main characters, they would be Betty (Naomi Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Betty is a cheerful blonde who stays in her aunt's apartment while auditioning for parts of movies. She meets Rita at her aunt's apartment and decides to help her. You see, Rita lost her memory. She has no idea who she is. She takes her name, Rita, from a "Gilda" sign in the bathroom. So the two set off to find out who Rita really is. <br /> <br /> David Lynch is known for making some weird movies, but this movie is the definition of weird. It is bizarre, terrifying and indescribable. It's like a dream captured in the movie. At the 100-minute point, the film has become extremely confusing - but if you're watching closely, it will make perfect sense. Having watched the movie and then read an article on the internet pointing things out in the movie, now I fully understand the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. Watts is great. Justin Theroux is very good as a Hollywood director who faces problems with the local mafia. The music is great. Angelo Badalamenti offers one of his best scores. And the direction - hah! David Lynch is as masterful a filmmaker as he ever was. <br /> <br /> Is this your type of movie? Well, that depends. You should probably see more of Lynch's work before watching this movie. You'll need to be patient with the movie and probably watch it a second time to pick up the many clues that Lynch left throughout the film. For Lynch fans, this is a dream come true. "Mulholland Dr." is a masterpiece. It's brilliant, enigmatic and masterfully filmed. I love it.
