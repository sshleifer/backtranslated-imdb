George Cuckor, known as director of women, could not have waited for two more talented and beautiful women in his last film. Being a remake of Bette Davis's exaggerated "Old Acquaintance," written by John Van Druten, this movie is definitely dated but still delicious. <br /> <br /> Bergen and Bisset shine as best friends who compete at all, but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a "serious" writer, intellectual and elegant. She meets her best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls' school and they start a lifetime of not always friendly competition. Later in their lives, when Liz is a serious but promising serious fiction writer, Merry decides to try to write, which infuriates her friend because of Merry's casual approach to the job she herself might take a little too seriously . <br /> <br /> To Liz's disgust, Merry's useless novels have hit the public, and finally her old friend Liz is judging her novel for the National Book Award. Bergen steals the show as the arrogant bestselling author who plans to piece together the broken pieces of her life in conjunction with her final literary triumph, but unfortunately things are never that simple. The supporting cast includes David Selby, whom you can remember as the tragic Quentin Collins of Dark Shadows, Hart Bochner and, of course, a delightful young Merc Ryan, in his first role since who left the soaps. <br /> <br /> Rich and Famous is disguised, outgoing, witty and wise. This culminates in a New Year fiasco that emphasizes the enduring nature of true friendship, and I never let a year go by without watching it on New Year's Eve. Watch and you'll see why.
