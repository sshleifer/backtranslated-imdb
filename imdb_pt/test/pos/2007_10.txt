Drawn by Pain is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen. Here are my reviews of the episodes released so far: <br /> <br /> The first episode was even better than I expected and from everything I had heard, I expected a lot. I'm very impressed with the actors already. His father was scary and played perfectly. The girl is so expressive that she uses her eyes to convey such emotion. The animation was excellent. The cinematography was amazing, every angle of the camera capturing the feel of the scene perfectly. The editing was done so well, each scene matched perfectly with the next. The music captured the emotions very well and drew you into the story. I just can not say enough about how wonderful this episode was. It definitely whets my appetite for more! <br /> <br /> Episode 2 was even better than the first! Everything I said about the first episode, only you can see even more of the development of the character. I can not wait to finally see Episode 3, or the rest of the series for that matter. What is developing is an intriguing, character-driven plot with all the pitfalls of a major Hollywood production, but without the pretense. So much is said, with so few words. This series is something like you've never seen and perched to become a real success. <br /> <br /> This episode was FREAKING AWESOME! No other word describes it! WOW! Everything I said about the previous episodes is worth it, and it was even better! I do not know how you get to bring something amazing and make it even better! The character's further development proves that this is a completely character-driven piece. Cinematography stands out as it always does and takes you to Emily's pain, fear, hatred and emotional roller coaster. I can not wait to see Episode 4 ... or the rest of the series for that matter. You really got over it! <br /> <br /> As much as I've loved the other episodes, Episode 4 is the best of them all. I love the character's progression. I feel like we're really getting to know Emily, her pain and her inner struggle. The other themes I mentioned in previous reviews continue. EXCELLENT cinematography, the writing is superb, the actors are right with their portraits and made the characters themselves, and the animation is simply amazing! Another great job from the DbP crew!
