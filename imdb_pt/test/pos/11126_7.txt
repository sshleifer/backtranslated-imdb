"Fame" is a very well-done portrait of the students who inhabit the New York School of Arts. The film focuses on a group of students who dream of succeeding while perfecting their craft in the now-famous school. Director Alan Parker allows each of the featured students to mature on the screen, allowing you to sense a connection to each of them. The music here is contagious and fun. The dance is exciting and fresh. The film eventually became the basis of an Emmy-winning TV series starring Debbie Allen and some of the other actors in the film. One of the nicest "dance" movies of the '80s. He received Oscar for music. 8/10
