Everyone who worked on this movie did an AMAZING job. This is honestly one of the best lesbian movies I've seen in a long time. The acting, the writing, the cinematography, the music, the visual, everything was first quality. As an avid fan of the genre (both lesbian films and gymnastics), I was incredibly happy with this film. This really gave me a lot more than I expected on the whole line. Listening to Q & A with the cast and crew was great, the lead actress has lots of positive energy and is so humble and gracious, it is a pleasure to see people who can be talented and not lose sight of what is really important. And the writer did a great job, besides driving and editing was amazing. Many thanks for making a great movie! Thanks also for the phrase about "if you're going to put a label on yourself, it would be bisexual." I'm so sick of movies where characters who have a relationship with both sexes become gay or straight, it's wonderful to see bisexuals being recognized for being and being part of the gay community, and it was good that the labels were not even needed at all in this movie. What an end! Just when I thought you could not give me more, it happened. Nice work and I applaud everyone. I'll spread the word, this is definitely a movie not to be missed!
