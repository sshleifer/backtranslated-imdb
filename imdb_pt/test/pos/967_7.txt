The fat liar is a very funny movie. But as I watched, I thought of something. Some of the events that occur in this movie are unbelievable. So really, the movie is kind of a big lie. There is no way he has escaped all this. Here are all the unbelievable things. <br /> <br /> 1. When he pretends that his father choked on a meatball and acts as if he were the father. Jason (Frankie Munez) could not have escaped that. Well, fortunately for us, he did not. So she did not cling to it, the scandalous one. <br /> <br /> 2. Even if her grandmother was blind, she might still have discovered that she was not her granddaughter. <br /> <br /> 3. They could not have gotten on the plane, flown to Los Angeles, acted like they were sellers of the jacket, entering the studio, and then, and then ... Well, part of the movie is a little unbelievable. But it does not hurt to tell a white lie. Trust me, I do this all the time. <br /> <br /> Liar and fat, though unbelievable at times, is fun. It's also very funny. But let me tell you one thing before continuing this review. If Paul Giamatti was not in this movie, it would be very bad. That would be awful. The fat liar is also pretty funny, though tacky at times. I'll give you a little treat. <br /> <br /> Liar and fat: *** / ****
