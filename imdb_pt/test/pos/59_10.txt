I always felt that Mrs. Merkerson had never achieved a role that would fit her abilities. Familiar to millions as the lieutenant of law and order, she was seen in several theatrical releases, always in a supporting role. HBO's Lackawanna Blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as a nanny, a successful entrepreneur in a world that goes from segregation to integration. But the story is really about the colorful set of characters she and her foster son find in a guesthouse in Lackawanna, New York, a suburb of Buffalo. <br /> <br /> History can be set in any large African country. American community of the 50s and 60s, from Sweet Auburn from Atlanta to Harlem in New York. But the angle of integration of segregation is only a subtle current in the colorful lives of the people at Nanny's pension. The story revolves around Nanny's relationships with all sorts of people, played by some of the best actors in the business (I purposely did not say black actors - this set is an impressive array of talents that are black except for Jimmy Smits). , of course) I recommend this movie as a fun and colorful look on a past day.
