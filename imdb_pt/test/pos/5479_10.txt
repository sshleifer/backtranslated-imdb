This is the excellent Washington thriller directed by talented Wolfgang Petersen with screenwriter Jeff Maguire (who seems to have done very little over the years so maybe he'll take care of his roses). The film has Clint Eastwood as a secret service agent who is aging and John Malkovich as a vengeful assassin laid against each other in a huge testament and creativity test where the president's life is at stake. The unnecessary secrecy and competition between rival security agencies almost condemns the president, which is an authentic touch. This movie was made when Eastwood and Malkovich were at their peak. Probably Eastwood has never done a better job than him here, and it's all so easy for the old pro. There are some wonderful sound effects of him snorting and gasping as he runs alongside the President's car like a bodyguard, for whom he is very old. I wonder if anyone else noticed the mood of those noises being added. My 'guardian angel', whose name is Vigil, liked this movie more than I did, but bodyguard movies are very much your thing. Rene Russo was a perfect choice for the female agent who falls in love with Eastwood, since she is so not obvious, but so talented, and she shines. Tension is stretched every inch of the way in this story, and Eastwood's psychological struggles to redeem himself from a previous failure in protection are marvelously demonstrated by his typical discreet performance. With Eastwood, if he raises an eyebrow by a millimeter, beware! Of course, he's the super-legal master. Malkovich has the opportunity to satisfy all the shivers he might desire in the paranoid character he portrays, and he captures man's central vanity to perfection. How nice.
