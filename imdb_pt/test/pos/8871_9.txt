This movie stayed in a pile of dusty videos in my house for a long time before watching it. We knew it was there, every time someone wanted to watch a movie, that was suggested. It almost became a joke ... "I know, let's watch Momma from the Train" ... I do not know why it was always refused, it just was. Little did we know what we were missing out on. It still happens to me why it took so long ... I mean it stars Danny DeVito, Billy Crystal and Ann Ramsy (we call it "The Lady of the Goonies"), a cast of stars that should have appealed to everyone in my house . But he stayed there for nearly ten years. Until one day it was suggested and we could not refuse ... <br /> <br /> It was like finding the tomb of King Tut ... <br /> <br /> No movie ever made me laugh so much, and I doubt any movie will. I had to go back to almost every line because I was still laughing at the line that came before, and I lost the ability to listen or pay attention. Not just laugh, too ... the kind of laughter that spends more energy than running sixteen miles in the cold. The kind of laughter that you can not control, that causes you to roll around and spasms, and tears and snot trickling down your face, because it's just that funny madness. Once I learned the color film, I will say that this effect has diminished, but I do not think I will get tired of watching it and find new quirks in it to appreciate. I think that's all I can say. I would recommend this movie to anyone, but if you do not like it, please do not let me know, I'll probably be offended.
