Hilary was great as Julie, and Pat was once again magnificent as Mr. Miyagi, but there should have been more references to the other three films! I mean, come on! First, where is Daniel? Miyagi makes a brief mention to him and that's it. Daniel was his best friend and should have at least appeared in the movie. He could have helped Miyagi train Julie-San! On the other hand, the song remained faithful to the film, with a little more instrumentation (Fretless Bass) to accompany the beautifully played Pan-Flute! It does not look like a Karate Kid movie, unless you listen to Pan-Flute! Thank you Zamfir! Overall a decent movie though! We miss you, Noriyuki!
