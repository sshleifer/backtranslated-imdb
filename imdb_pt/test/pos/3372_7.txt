The creator of Donnie Darko brings you a strangest fashion story. The film focuses on a young middle-aged couple living wages in salary in 1976. One day a mysterious box appears with a red button. Later that day a scary gentleman appears and tells them that they have the option to push the button and get a million dollars, but someone they do not know will die. It's a disturbing and provocative question, told with a lot of suspense in the trailer and TV commercials. But know that you just do not know where you're going until you see. Sometimes pretentious and somewhat melodramatic, the film is ultimately effective because of its good acting and intriguing subject. It would be unfair to ruin any of the twists for you, but let's just say that the movie will deliver the aspects you expect and do not fully meet the others you begin to outline. There is much apparent symbolism and subtext in the film that is both interesting and boring, as was not so evident in his other top film, Donnie Darko. There is not much else to say without ruining the movie for you. is to inspire many coffee conversations afterwards. However, I would also like to say that it was filmed well and has a properly aged appearance and is worth watching. Check out.
