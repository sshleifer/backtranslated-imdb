It was probably watching this TV movie that interested me in the debate about whether "Anna" was actually the daughter of Tsar Nicholas, Anastasia. Since I saw him, I made it a point to watch several documentaries and also bought a book. Despite the evidence that has been discovered since the movie was released, sometimes I still think it was. Such is the power of Amy Irving's performance in this par 2, which is somewhat liberal with historical facts, but full of drama and the totally convincing performance of Irving. <br /> <br /> I was not consciously aware of Irving before that, although I should have seen her unknowingly in "Carrie" (another favorite movie). In "Anasasia," I never felt for a moment that "it's just a movie." For me this woman was Anastasia, and when part one ended with her in the train carriage, meeting members of the royal family, I knew that in hell or the high seas I had to see the second part. I just wanted to see how she would prove she was who she claimed to be, and as the story progressed I felt an intense hatred for Rex Harrison's character, although I admire him very much as an actor. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie listed again in the TV guide, I convinced my mother that we should watch it, and then she thanked me for doing so, for being almost as interested as I was in watching the part 2. So I bought the video and can fully recommend it. "Anastasia" is one of those rare TV movies that you simply must watch for the sheer pleasure of watching the best acting I've ever seen on TV, and it does not really matter whether you believe in the legend or not.
