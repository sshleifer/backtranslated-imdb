I was able to get an original BBC broadcast of this film on video and I loved it so much that I had to try to locate the original video in its original box; Thank you go to Ebay. <br /> <br /> Excluded in any format since 1990, this exceptional wildlife film is finely constructed and well represented. Directed by Stewart Raffil (MAC & Me), the scenes of tigers jumping through the Alaskan wilderness are nothing short of impressive and their timeless tale of a hunter trying to survive alone in the frozen deserts with two tiger cubs is moving ahead each view. <br /> <br /> Why no big company got this movie to distribute on DVD is a great wonder; but it makes it so special to know that it is also difficult to locate. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie by chance or eventually crawl it to add to your collection, make sure you never let it disappear from your collection. tightness Movies of this caliber, as shown, do not come often. <br /> <br /> A true masterpiece in every sense of the word, and highly deserving of your praised remarks, "WHEN THE NORTH COME BLOWS" will sink into your heart as soon as you see it.
