In The Book of Life, Martin Donovan plays Jesus, who appears at JFK airport Dec. 31 to inaugurate the new millennium, wrestling with Thomas Jay Ryan (Satan) and deciding the fate of the world. There's also David Simonds (Amateur's Kurt's accountant) as a compulsive, homeless gambler. <br /> <br /> As always, Hartley creates a surreal world in which the beauty of the common makes the world strange and supernatural. framed scenes and urban / industrial landscapes filled with dazzling light and shade. As usual, he introduces seemingly incidental details at first, then brings them back later in hilarious and unexpected contexts - humor is simple, but dizzy and irrepressible. Hartley has an incredible ability to build small and sweeping moments while mundane and scandalous. As always, it creates a tired and tired tone of the world, but at the same time vulnerable, open and honest. It moves in a few minutes, from a whimsical humor to a metaphysical and poetic language - the kind of writing so impervious and perfect that it is difficult to contain tears, despite the lack of obvious emotion. Another amazing and very funny movie. <br /> <br /> The Book of Life is filmed (a digital camera?) With a blurred effect: a heavenly sensation side by side with impending death and a hyper-consciousness of the present as fragile and fleeting in its later moments. All of Hartley's films have a way of prioritizing the present, but this unique effect composes it as the images pass through the screen in a way that is at first dissonant but becomes more and more beautiful as you accommodate her. The final shot is spectacular. All of this may seem precious, but the film is a comedy and makes fun of itself as it makes fun of the concept of Armageddon, Judgment Day and "urbanity." Although it is really very deep, moving and affirmative, it is mostly carefree and playful. The performance is flawless in terms of the kind of subdued tone that Hartley has developed in his films (a tone some people do not understand and that leads them to dismiss such acting as empty - the same people who have a negative response to Peter Greenaway). As always, there will certainly be people who will respond to this film with cynicism and contempt - people delayed by Hartley's abrupt changes and what they consider to be pretentious or Mannerist techniques - but any fan of Hartley will love this movie. (if they can get a chance to see it). It's hard to say what it would look like in the video.
