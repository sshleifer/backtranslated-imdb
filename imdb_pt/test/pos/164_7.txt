Three children are born during a solar eclipse and turn into despicable little killers who are beyond suspicion except for Joyce (Lori Lethin) and his younger brother, Timmy. That's the story in a nutshell. The acting in this is tolerable for the most part. Remarkable by MTV-J Julie Brown (not the Downtown) showing some skin, and a very early part (albiet small) for Michael Dudikoff. It's not a great movie of any kind, but in the subgenre of 'killer children' it's a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Julie Brown shows T & A (the only movie so far) to claim that honor); Sylvia Wright is topless <br /> <br /> DVD Extras (R1): 16 minutes of interview with producer Max Rosenberg (in which he insults the director and Canada, great stuff); Biography of Ed Hunt; and trailers for "Kiss of the Taratula", "Do not open the door", and a red strip for "Homework" (featuring nudity). <br /> <br /> My Grade: B-
