Some people are born with mourning souls with their song singed singularly until they find another soul as tortured and / or bitterly sweet as their own and an unusual magic happens. YOU ARE ALONE is a brutally honest look at two tortured souls that intertwine for a moment of understanding and oneness only to be torn apart by the differences in oneness between them. Death is explored figuratively and literally. It is what happens when the soul is dead or just as alive too, awakens too much for reality. It is not the life you imagined behind the eyes of passersby. This movie explores the pain in all of us, the frown under the cheerful facade, the pain below. Ugly thoughts and instinctive and animalistic acts become honest and true, and then Bechard spreads a hint of unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix, knowing that both remain in all of us. Bechard, the writer, is an experienced observer of the human condition and because of his non-judgmental attitude presents life in a light that we often protect our eyes but we long to see and understand. He, as a director, focuses on the nuances of the actor spirit that shines through the character they are playing for the actors to personally experience the emotions brought by each situation. This is the most faithfully written and directed portrayal of the characters from a male and female experience that I have encountered so far, even though the two characters are probably not the "normal" encounter. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack encapsulates in the lyrics of each song what the characters let their hearts shed if they were able and strong enough. It is the voice of every real character sung through the beauty, pain, talent and emotional intelligence of emerging indie artists ready to explode in the alternative music market. The perfect soundtrack for those of us in trouble - those of us who admit that we have problems and those of us who hide it. <br /> <br /> I always enjoy exploring the darker sides of life with Mr. Bechard, both fascinatingly creative and realistic view of life and the characters that revolve within it.
