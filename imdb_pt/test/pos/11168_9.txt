I read the reviews on this movie before watching it and was not expecting much, but as a B movie it's a curiosity. I think you have to be a certain kind of person to take advantage of this sort of thing, but I seriously thought it was amazing. People should only watch by experience because it is totally unique. Do not expect too much of it. The acting is bad, the transitions were obviously done on a PC, etc. Definitely a B movie, but still worth checking out. Very funny. Gentle gore, and some questionable themes, so it's probably not something to show your grandmother, but for the more adventurous viewer I'd say it's a must see.
