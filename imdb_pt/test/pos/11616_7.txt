Well, it's safe to say that Subconscious Cruelty is a weird movie! Supposedly a vision of the human mind, Subconscious Cruelty is made up of four macabre and bizarre tales of the extreme. The first segment, titled 'Ovarian Eyeball' is really just a warm up, but it's good because it gives the viewer an idea of ​​what to expect in the next three segments. He simply sees a naked woman lying at a table while another woman cuts off her abdomen and pulls out a human eyeball! I have no idea what the point is, but it certainly makes a visceral vision. The following story is the best of the group and addresses the theme of incest of the "old favorite." The segment follows a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister. He has revulsion over her pregnancy - but he wants to have sex with her anyway, and of course he gets what he wants. This story stands out because of the monotonous narration and 'matter of fact' as well as the ending - which does not fail to deliver shocks. This segment is well represented, well filmed and easily the highlight of Subconscious Cruelty. <br /> <br /> Of course, the next two sections are not as good as the second; so the only way there is down, but director Karim Hussain can still get something out of the bag before the movie ends. He does not do this immediately, however, as the third segment is the weakest in the movie, and simply sees a lot of people having sex with the ground. It is very surreal and therefore memorable for the same reason; but there does not seem to be much sense in this, and I was in the mood for something a little more morbid after the second section. The movie ends up high, however, though I do not know exactly what the argument was - the final segment features the best images in the film. This segment focuses on religion, and certainly not for anyone who values ​​it! Director Karim Hussain has achieved something here - as long as this collection of four "extreme" stories does not come together as a whole, the film seems to be in taste as it is filmed so eloquently and attractively. The director seems to have imitated the highly respected surreal director Luis Buñuel, albeit with blood, rape and incest; and if you ask me, he did not do a bad job. Not for everyone, but certainly worth looking for extreme fanatics!
