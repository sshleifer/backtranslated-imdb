I agree with another reviewer, this is such a destructive movie, it will be difficult to watch again soon, though only by quality, it deserves a repeat viewing. The complexity of the characters, the incredible cinematography and the superb direction make this movie worth the emotional price of watching. <br /> <br /> There is a scene, of the two partisans dragging themselves through the snow to escape a patrol, perhaps for sheer physicality, the most incredible performance I have ever seen. In fact, although not episodic - the story flows - this is a movie of memorable scenes. There is the passage of rations between the guerrillas, the scenes of snow, the scene of the ruined farm, the meetings in the houses, the interrogation, the scene of the "basement", the "ascent". All stand out as jewelry in a necklace. <br /> <br /> For me, religiosity is not self-evident. Frankly, I do not think it would have been allowed in a Soviet movie. I see this as an existential parable about the value of life. Here is a tale where the hero - and he is a true hero - becomes the villain, and the weakest becomes the strongest. Is this a mystical process or dictated by circumstances? There is a transfiguration, but comes from inside or outside? You should see the film to understand the problems, as they can not be discussed without revealing much of the story. I can not say enough about the acting. It is difficult for me to choose which of the leads is most affective. I'm not familiar with the Soviet 70's movie and I'm not familiar with any of the actors, but they're all superb. I also notice how director Larisa Shepitko uses children. They remind me of Giotto's infant angels. <br /> <br /> There's a bit of confusion in the end. Apparently, there is an earlier relationship between the soldier Sotnikov and the interrogator Portnov, but this remains pending. And the final scene is a bit ambiguous. But in comparison to the total experience, these are arguments. This is a movie that will mark you for life.
