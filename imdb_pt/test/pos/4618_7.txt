Being featured at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and earning a great deal of fame, this film seems to be another modern and deep school drama. <br /> <br /> This is a group of teenagers who go through a revealing and desperate day at school. Everything is circling around a suicide - shown at first, to a certain extent - that happens at 2:37 pm. The characters are somehow connected to each other. What moves them is described through short interview sequences, taken strictly in p / b. The characters are well written, the acting is intriguing (especially Teresa Palmer as Melody and Frank Sweet as Marcus are discovered). <br /> <br /> Let's stick to the technique of the movies. That's what really impressed me. Rarely there are cuts, most of the time the camera follows one of the protagonists as in the Elephant of Gus van Sants. Some scenes are presented more often than once, but each time from a different point of view (here: character). This certainly evokes an atmosphere that develops slowly but draws you in, literally. The colors are vibrant, somewhat unfeasible, considering the difficult plot - but this is nothing short of a clever contrast, a disturbing "everything is good." The use of lighting is appropriate all the time, underlining the current mood of the characters. And finally, there are decent music placements. 2:37 somehow bothers you from the start. It does not compromise or serve laughter. Instead, it unites what psychologists would define as moments of terror. This film focuses substantially on emotional cliffs. There is no one who is not able to deal with some kind of neurosis, even the smallest represented parts (eg teachers) seem to be in some state of disorder. And that's what keeps that movie from being really good. His summary of penetrating tragedies is not realistic for his own bones. There is no friendship, love, smile, truth, passion. There is: pretense, humiliation, despair, disease and beating. It's like being hit in the face very hard all the time, but you get numb after the first hour. This movie keeps hitting you until it reveals something quite instructive in the end. <br /> <br /> For being sensitive and superbly represented: 9. For being technically innovative and original: 9. For being one-dimensional: 3. <br /> <br /> Makes a solid 7 out of 10.
