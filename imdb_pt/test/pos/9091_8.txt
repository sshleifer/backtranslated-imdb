When I first watched Flatliners, I was amazed. It had all the necessary characteristics of a good movie: the cast was superb, the plot was superb and, in the case of thrillers, there were genuine "shivers" everywhere. <br /> <br /> Keifer Sutherland offered a wonderful performance. as the protagonist of the play, portraying a scientist who believes he can find the answers to life and death by killing himself and returning to life, essentially "stealing" the secrets of death. Kevin Bacon performs well as Keifer's most morally decent counterpart, while Julia Roberts offers her most convincing role. William Baldwin portrays a student who excels in class and, apparently, in sexual intercourse. And Oliver Platt, in another excellent performance, portrays the voice of reason for the group and the most innocent. <br /> <br /> The story is relatively simple but original, and the acting is refreshing - definitely a highlight film for the genre, and one that set the standard for me to measure other thrillers. 8/10.
