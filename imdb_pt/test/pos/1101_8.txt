OK .... so, at 15 minutes in the movie, there is still no dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie came to me in a quilted Down Under bag, with encrypted Sharpie information in front. I am a programmer of an American festival, and MOD LOVE was sent to me by our boss as a potential initiator having preem'd in the distant interface Moscow / Karlovy Vary. <br /> <br /> Immediately I thought "this movie is not for us" (without 15 minute dialogue?), but kept watching anyway. Well well well. He built it and built it and built it, and halfway through it I was involved in this movie because, like when you go to the zoo, you're reticent at first, but when you get to the dangerous snake patch, you're totally there. <br /> <br /> This movie has a danger, nothing like the much-hyped WolF Creek, but because it is so totally 'other' in every way and way, and it seems to weave a web made up of all the fantasies of the majority of the first independent timers, ie. - dark mood, red-neck intrigue, strange splicing, mysterious music and a storyline that, though imperfect and basic, has a bit in common with one of the "great Australian films", ie Wier's Cars That Eat Paris. But MODERN LOVE is not really a very Aussie movie in the sense of Ocker-ishness and playful self-depreciation that pervades many of the films of that country. It works in a most terrifying realm from the beginning. No cell phones, no brand names, no i-pods, no urban anguish - just a guy married to a handsome man, an old Volvo, and a little boy (son) who has strange teeth and chuck things out there. Oh, and it's in the weird seaside village where people seem a little "wrong." Photographed by Nick Matthews (2:37) and music by Tom Huzenroeder (Ten Canoes), the MOD LUV succeeds where many Aust. movies fail - that is, it rises without taking into account the country "abandoned by God" from where it leaves. Instead, he revels in a choppy but fun puzzle that the film itself can not solve - and here lies the weak link ... what in the world does this movie have to do with "Modern Love" ???? The final minutes of the movie seem to give an answer, or at least suggest one ... and as I sat down and had coffee and ate my Hershey's afterwards, all I could guess was that the movie in this movie, Alex Frayne, Probably You're going to have a lot of fun with it.
