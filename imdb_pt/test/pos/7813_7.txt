I have discovered that this is an underestimated and silent Western Spaghetti (also known as DEAD OR ALIVE). Despite modest credentials (in addition to co-writer / multi-purpose producer Albert Band, the only notable member of the crew is composer Carlo Rustichelli), the film clearly benefits from the presence of its three American stars (newcomer Alex Cord is an ambiguous anti-hero, while veterans Arthur Kennedy and Robert Ryan lend a mythical quality to the process) as well as the unusual plot (involving a crippled protagonist, an amnesty device covering a strategic cleanup of the city, and having the law finally taking sides with the gunfighter against a horde of Mexican bandits). <br /> <br /> Are there several difficult action scenes on hand ?? the film is covered by a terrible climax in which the trio of stars is surrounded within a burning cabin? plus some scandalous moments that are a trademark of Spaghetti Western: from the street, Cord sees a gunslinger hidden in a window reflected in a bottle of whiskey; a man who helps escape Cord is repeatedly immersed in a pool of oil by the villains. Nicoletta Machiavelli also has a good impression as a girl from the village with whom Cord lodges; the support cast, then, is dotted with familiar (if largely anonymous) faces? all of them essentially style games. <br /> <br /> I was not aware of the fact that the English-dubbed version of the movie on MGM / UA DVD R1 was cut: I was fooled by the wrong runtime being listed on the back cover; the movie was only 99 minutes and not 118? apparently the character of Cord is dead in the longer Italian version!
