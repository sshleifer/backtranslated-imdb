In 1242, Russia was invaded on two sides: from the East by the Mongols and Europe, by the German Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire. The city of Novgorod is the last free city in Russia. The population, in order to organize the defense of Novgorod and the lands of Russia, calls the prince Aleksandr Nevsky, who had defeated the Swedes in an earlier battle. His strategy of success defeats the Germans, after a great battle on a frozen lake. This film was made in 1938 due to the German threat to Russia in a pre-WWII period. The idea was to pro-Russia propaganda. However, it is a powerful masterpiece stunning, wonderful and breathtaking. It's amazing the fighting scene on the frozen lake. The current generation is very accustomed to special effects, as in the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, and you may not be able to understand how this black and white fight is fantastic. If the viewer can forget the ideology and see it as an art, he will certainly be surprised at the end with this masterpiece. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Alexander Nevsky
