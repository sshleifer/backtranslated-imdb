Although it was out of the air for 6 years, the Promised Land was one of those shows that happened once or twice in a generation. Good cast, supporting cast (including Richard Thomas and Ossie Davis) and crew. The plot is credible with McRaney rearranging his family and just saying "to hell with everything" after having been subjected to so many disappointments and incidents since his return from Vietnam years before. I think many veterans of the Vietnam era, including myself, could really relate to McRaney's thinking process in finally deciding on his course of action. Many of us did exactly the same thing in real life, after coming back from that war and finding that America was not the same place we left. The show conveys not only values ​​but a glimpse of what has happened in a veteran's life. Only in these two aspects, I think it is one of the most pungent TV series of our time. Why this program only worked for 3 years is beyond me.
