Oz is a great series, one of the underrated TV series. It has a certain relation to the novel in which something evil is always happening, and is the unfolding of each instance of evil that fascinates. From my discussions with people who are actually in prison, it's true. Every interaction has some machinations working in the background. Behind every action, there is a plan, a conspiracy to make another person. I like this series so much that it's one of the few TV shows I bought completely on DVD. <br /> <br /> And, yes, I agree with the writer before me who commented that there are elements of satire in him. The character in the wheelchair who offers his preconceived view of life does so with a certain ironic humor.
