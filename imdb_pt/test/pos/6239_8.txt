Despite a silly premise, ridiculous plot devices and low budget, Tourist Trap can be impressive. An inventive and beautifully marked film, a must-see. You have to throw rationality out the window to fully appreciate what the director was trying to do. If you can, you will have a pleasant surprise. Also note that this is one of the few semi-classic horror movies that have not been spoiled by countless sequences.
