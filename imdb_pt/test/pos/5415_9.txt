I saw this movie when it was a ticket to the Santa Fe Film Festival. Heavy movie! The depiction of a completely dysfunctional family taken to another extreme level might have left me depressed to the extreme, were it not for very funny jokes and dialogues along the way that illuminated the overall tone of the film. The relatively "uplifting" end gave hope to those affected by the initial tragedy. Still, I did not leave the theater ready to go to a fun party. The movie stayed with me for several days. <br /> <br /> Brought back memories of "Ordinary People" but with humor mixed with tragedy. I thought the performance was great, especially by Sigourney Weaver and Emile Hirsh. How each character dealt with the tragedy was sometimes sad, self-destructive but also sometimes hilarious. Intelligent dialogue and situations.
