Hayao Miyazaki's final and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully entertaining and imaginative visual from childhood. While it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney / Pixar CGI masterpieces, it is refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on the traditional hand-drawn animation to tell their charming and charming stories. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the friendship between a magic elf / goldfish and the human child she meets during a curious walk to see the human world. The human child, Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) lives in a small house on a cliff overlooking a small port city in southern Japan (based on Seto Island), where he lives with his young mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko). Sosuke names the strange goldfish "Ponyo" and takes him to the nursery / nursing center where Lisa works. Ponyo is definitely not her typical goldfish and soon begins to adapt and take on human aspects (she develops human speech and appetite for ham meat) by sampling some blood from a cut on Sosuke's finger. <br /> <br /> However, just as Sosuke and Ponyo begin to develop a bond, Ponyo is taken back by his father, Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), who is a former human who rejected the surface world and is now trying to collect and develop magical elixirs from the sea that help him repair and rejuvenate the world's oceans. <br /> <br /> Ponyo's desire to become human has become so strong that Fujimoto is unable to contain it and she assumes a more human appearance and frees herself from her home world of water and returns to see Sosuke. During his escape, Ponyo unintentionally releases Fujimoto's cache of magical elixirs, which releases all sorts of magical sea creatures that cause a violent storm in the seas surrounding Sosuke. Desperate to solve Ponyo's rebellion, he soon asks for the help of his beautiful wife, Ponyo's mother - the Water Elemental, Mother / Lady of the Sea (Amami Yuki). As in his previous films, Miyazaki's "Gake No Ue No Ponyo," addresses various themes of ecology and environmentalism, this time focusing on the health and vitality of the world's oceans. The opening sequence is sometimes disturbing when Ponyo encounters a ship that is scraping the ocean floor, discovering mountains of garbage and debris. One can understand the anger and frustration of the character of Fujimoto who spent his life trying to repair the damage that civilization is causing to his oceans, and still finding it to be a dismal and almost fruitless effort. <br /> <br /> Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this movie. Sometimes it is bizarre and outrageous, but at the same time charming and curious. Obviously, Miyazaki wanted to capture the meaning and style of a child's imagination. The art style has the appearance of wax chalk / pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful. It's almost as if a child's colorful book came to life. <br /> <br /> Children's actors Nara Yuria and Doi Hiroki do a great job as Ponyo and Sosuke. They bring lovely charm to their roles. Nara Yuria in particular sounds so cute as Ponyo that it is no wonder that Sosuke of Doi falls in love with the magical girl. Former campaign girl / model and actress Yamaguchi Tomoko (Shichinin No Otaku, Swallowtail) is also very good in her role as Sosuke's modern mother, Lisa. I was a bit confused at first with her character, because initially I thought she was Sosuke's older sister. It also did not help that Sosuke continued to refer to her as "Lisa" instead of Mama, but I think it may be a sign of the times and an indicator of the modern Japanese family (in the Crayon Shinchan anime, Shinnosuke also refers to Mama's his first name too. <br /> <br /> The 80's comedian Tokoro Joji sounds totally different like the serious Fujimoto but wisely does not make his character look villainous or threatening.While we do not know his character anymore, former baseball player and actor Nagashima Kazushige (who plays the father of Sosuke, Koichi) also offers a good voice work. The opening theme "Umi No Okasan" by Japanese soprano Masako Hayashi is simply beautiful and exciting. In contrast, the Fujimaki Fujioka and Nozomi Ohashi theme "Geke No Ue No Ponyo" is light and fun and evokes images of a traditional Japanese chant. During a brilliant sequence, the soundtrack assumes an almost Wagnerian operatic sound with music that sounds like "Die Walk√ºre". <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect, but suffers from the moments when the central story of Ponyo and Sosuke takes second place in some fantastic visuals of Miyazaki. I also wished we had more time to explore the background story of Fujimoto as well as the relationship between Sosuke and his father. <br /> <br /> As "Kiki / Majo Delivery At Takkyubin," "Howl's Moving Castle," "Momonoke Princess / Momonoke Hime" and "My Neighbor Totoro / Tonari No Totoro", "Gake No Ue No Ponyo "is another Miyazaki classic that is a wonderful feast for the eyes. Like a modern fairy tale, the film tells a timeless story of friendship and love that will surely be appreciated in the coming years.
