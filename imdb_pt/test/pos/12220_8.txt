The problem with TV today is that people were spoiled by the "light" TV view. This type of television program equates to elevator music or "easy listening" jazz. The typical idea of ​​"continuity" viewers is to remember who was eliminated from the island last week and wonder who will be the next to leave. Show them a show like the surface, Firefly, Dr. Who, or anything with a plot arc of more than three episodes and ... well, they'll just go back to Survivor. <br /> <br /> 95% of the TV watching sheep do not want to break their brains. They want excuses not to think. They want to make sure the "boob tube" lives up to its name ... and they do not want shows that try to go the other way. Because of that, Surface and many other high-quality shows that should have lasted much longer have got the ax. <br /> <br /> Viewers do not want stories, morals, or philosophy, or anything more than a third. level of vocabulary. They want people to eat worms, or super-dramatized "real life" series (you can not observe something without changing the very nature of what you observe) or hormonal shows involving groups of people having encounters and then bragging about <br /> <br /> Today's television is nothing but a wasteland, and the few diamonds you can take out of the dust are thrown away because no one else knows what a diamond is. Surface was one of these diamonds.
