When I saw LAUREN BACALL from CACTUS FLOWER on Broadway, I never dreamed that one day I would see an actress like INGRID BERGMAN playing the role of Bacall onscreen. But here Ingrid really leaves her hair down for some good comedy moments as the dental nurse pretending to be the wife of WALTER MATTHAU so he can continue with the lie he told GOLDIE HAWN. <br /> <br /> It's a laughing story from start to finish, humorous things that never lose dry humor and intelligence throughout the execution time. There are plenty of sentences or jokes that are way above the usual comedy situation you hear on TV - the lines are true because they blend so well with the characters and their motives. <br /> <br /> A foolish girl who contemplates (at the outset) committing suicide because of her unfortunate affair with Matthau, GOLDIE HAWN (newborn as a TV actress "Laugh In") plays a silly role in perfection. It's easy to understand why she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Ingrid is surprisingly attractive in a rare comedy role, although there are times when she seems to be a bit too much matron to the role. Either way, it is an amazing choice to interpret the nurse who does an act of freezing in the office, but it is considerably warmer off. <br /> <br /> As Goldie's neighbor, Igor, Rick Lenz absolves admirably, and makes a fitting pair for her in that final scene. Matthau plays the kind of character that became his trade role in all the roles of Neil Simon he had - an adorable cad who gets caught in his own mess when he tells a lie after lying. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of comedy that makes you laugh out loud at some of the fun lines that Abe Burrows and IAL Diamond managed to undo, based on a French farce.
