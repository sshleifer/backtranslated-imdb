I think this is Pauly Shore's best material, he did the perfect part. I really enjoyed this movie, Patrick Renna is very funny as Zack the boring little brother. Son In Law is a good comedy that deserves its time, but the only thing I would like Tiffany Thiessen to be the farm girl instead of the one they had.
