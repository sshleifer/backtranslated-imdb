This is one of the best "Bloke" movies of the early 1990s and although a bit dated, it's one of those movies that would never be made today, which makes it very special! In fact, a very similar film was made in the 1990s, called "Masterminds," and it was a PG variation on the same theme, but it was not at all as fun or realistic about it. <br /> <br /> So, what is it? So special about this movie? It is the feeder between the main characters and the theme against all the odds of the movie. Sean Astin is very friendly and has performed in some of the most memorable films of the 80s / 90s, particularly "The Goonies". He also went to bigger things with "Rudy" and "The Lord of the Rings" Trilogy, but "Encino Man" is a good journey down memory road. Will Wheaton's "Stand by Me" lends good support to the film and Andrew Divoff is a great villain. Louis Gossett Jr dreams of his role, but he adds some brevity to the film, particularly its relationship to Astin's rebellious nature. <br /> <br /> How's the action? By today's standards, it's rather tedious and cheap, almost like a TV movie, but production values ​​are good and violence is really unpleasant for a movie involving school students. However, the director pays off the limited budget with some pleasant moments of suspense and humor well placed. <br /> <br /> So park your brain at the door and enjoy this action movie fondly, but do not expect Oscar material. !
