039: Anna Christie (1930) - released on 21/2/1930; Viewed October 10, 2006 <br /> <br /> On October 24, 1929: black Thursday, the bag falls. Now, the country and, in fact, the world will seek in Hollywood the escape from the Great Depression. <br /> <br /> BIRTH: Anne Frank, June Carter, Yasser Arafat, Bob Newhart, Barbara Walters, Doris Roberts, Ed Asner, Dick Clark, Roy E. Disney, Gene Hackman. <br /> <br /> DOUG: Finally, our odyssey is resumed with Greta Garbo's first sound film, a simple character study called Anna Christie. An excellent performance by Mrs. Garbo, who showed right away that her talent could move from the age of silence (I wanted to see part of her quiet work, but Netflix does not seem to be stocking them. One thing I noticed several times was the pronunciation of the Swedish accent, like replacing the letter J with a Y-sound. Anna ends up being the only character I liked; I did not really care about your distant father or your would-be suitor. It seems that sound recording systems are improving (no one leaning to speak in the mysterious tin), but the camera is still not moving. We'll be sure to watch for this to change as our odyssey continues. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Our first movie of the 1930s is the first sound film of silent star Greta Garbo, Anna Christie. This is a very simple film with only about five different locations where we spend long stretches of the film's 89 minutes, often with a static camera. It was great to see Marie Dressler in sound too, and quite hilarious as what we hear is an endless chain of sincere insults still inebriated. I really enjoyed Garbo's performance, because she supports the film even in the most meandering moments. I really did not like George Marion or Charles Bickford, maybe because I was not sympathetic to any of them, so I was relieved and excited when Anna finally got up and showed them that she did not "belong" to either of them. his estranged father or his muscular Irish boyfriend. It's also great to see that the renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion did not miss a step from silence to sound. <br /> <br /> Last film screened: Speedy (1928). Last film in chronological order: The Love Parade (1929). Next movie: The Blue Angel (1930).
