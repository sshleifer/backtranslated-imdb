Why have a perfectly good original drama based on a perfectly good novel, and remake it as an almost musical? And cast it with actors who are lacking exclusively in singing or dancing talents? Somewhat like "Showgirls" or the two most recent movies "Star Wars", "Lost Horizon" is full of unintentional laughter. Who can forget Sir John Gielgud smiling uncomfortably in his Dali Lhama outfit, overseeing an interpretive dance for the Republican Party ("Family")? <br /> <br /> Or Sally Kellerman lovingly rooting for George Kennedy, making her best impression Cher as she jumps from rock to rock ("Every Little Thing You Do")? And my favorite, Bobby Van, incorporating the strength of the American educational system ("Question Me An Answer")? I can not wait for the DVD release as I hope it contains comments from Liv Ullmann, who will finally explain what she was thinking when she agreed to make this movie!
