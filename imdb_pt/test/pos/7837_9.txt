I found the episodes fascinating and well written. As a TV show, it was fun that is what I expect from the fictional entertainment. I like the "relationship" between the teacher and her female security guard ... although sometimes her Scottish accent makes it a bit difficult to understand what she is saying. I was hoping there were more than just four episodes. I recognize that one commenter / reviewer in this series has had comments about your opinion as a doctor. I understand the comments of this gentleman; however, this is a fictional television series that is intended to entertain ... do not present accurate facts as a documentary. Patrick Stewart performs well and makes his character believable. If you want to watch a documentary then this is not the series for you. But if you want to watch unique scientific theories in an entertainment-based medium then you will enjoy the four episodes.
