I took my younger niece to an early viewing and she LOVED it (I also liked it). I do not need to explain the plot, since the film remains completely true to the award-winning book sold by famed author Carl Hiaasen. The film takes the popular book and staged it with a beautiful cinematography (I want to go to Florida now!), Humor (thanks to the funny, Luke Wilson and some newcomers), and good music! I have to get a Jimmy Buffet CD now! I know a movie is good when I get goosebumps in the end. Overall, it was great family movie that felt comfortable to take my younger niece. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
