Two things can happen when a cast is assembled. Or you're left out of the theater asking, "Why?" or you get MANNA FROM HEAVEN, a delightful comedy from the Burton Sisters, whose mother not only provided inspiration but the script itself, Ursula Burton, who plays Theresa, a nun whose friends and family have always believed she was touched by G-d. From heaven, the clan uses Theresa's faith that money was a gift from heaven to allow all her dreams to come true. Years go by and we find Theresa coming home to her native buffalo. reimbursed and convenes his friends and family, (Oscar winners Shirley Jones, Louise Fletcher and Cloris Leachman) to repay the debt before Easter Sunday. The money has already been spent and all the characters are in financial difficulty. Shirley Jones and Frank Gorshin, is a husband and wife with staff who teaches life's most important lessons, how to dress for the winter in Buffalo and my personal favorite, "they expect you to carry the sack verware" when visiting a restaurant . The audience can only hope that if Theresa really does reach her goal, that person will not run away with the money. The film teaches us that it is not money, but we ourselves realize the dreams of ourselves and others. Every action has a result not just for you but for the community around you. When we look in the mirror, we see ourselves as we would like to be, MANNA FROM HEAVEN, answers the question of how others can see the image we would most like to reflect. The Burtons did a great job, directing the cast out of their grenades and creating new and inventive characters. On a multi-million dollar budget day, this low-budget Indy proves that it's not the money at hand, but the real talent that will attract the loudest laughs. Wendie Malick (The American President, Just Shoot Me) adds a special flavor to this already talented cast.
