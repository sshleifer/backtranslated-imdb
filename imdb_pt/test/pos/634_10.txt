In today's world of advertising, teenage terror and sensationalism, it is very rare to see a movie and nothing about it. Films like Psycho and Blair Witch, despite being great at suspense (both with great hits) are spoiled by the fact that we know all about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them. With Mute Witness, a rare treat, I stumbled into this movie and watched it, scared, in the middle of the night. I was frightened by the threatening Russian environment, the theme of "snuff" and the claustrophobic situation of the dumb, and the fact that the characters (fun, they always take to enjoy) could find the end at any time. As this is a low budget movie and rare, we watched it without any expectation. He also has Fay Ripley in a rare movie role, watch and prepare to be excited, scared and thrilled in totally unexpected ways.
