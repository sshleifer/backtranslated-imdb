Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny tells the fictional tale of the band's Tenacious D and their quest to find the Pick of Destiny, a supernatural reed made from the tooth of Satan himself (played by Dave Grohl). JB (Jack Black) and KG (Kyle Gass), united by destiny, must travel to the Rock N 'Roll Museum and steal the Pick of Destiny to become the biggest band on the planet. The film is hilarious and offers non-stop laughter. Jack Black and Kyle Gass work seamlessly together, having been friends and real-life co-workers for over 20 years. The film is partly a musical. All (or most) of the song was written and performed by The D. All songs are new material and many of them are classic. The soundtrack is definitely worth checking out. This movie will be greatly appreciated by Tenacious D fans, but if you're not a fan of The D, I still think you'll like the movie. If you are a D fan then you should see this movie. The acting is not as bad as you may think, and the laughter and rawness never stop coming. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to take off their socks and laugh as much as they have laughed in a long time. Look out for Dave Grohl's cameos, Ronnie James Dio, Meatloaf, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, Tim Robbins, John C. Reilly and Neil Hamburger. Also, stay tuned for an extra scene after the credits.
