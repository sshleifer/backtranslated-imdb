This is a very cute movie. I had a huge pajama party (girls 10-11) and they absolutely loved this movie. They watched it twice! Do not let the rating fool you. You must be 13 or older to rate a movie on IMDb, which eliminates the intended audience of the movie. If you have a girl (or boy) between 7 and 13, I guarantee they will like this movie. <br /> <br /> Type of genre "Notting Hill" reversed in high school. Aaron Carter plays a famous pop star who is failing in his private lessons. His mother sends him to a "normal" high school with the ultimatum, "pass high school or do not do summer tour". Taking advice from his manager (former pop star David Cassidy), he befriends the smartest girl in school (Alana Austin), with plans to trick her. Look for the humorous and insightful Janitor (another former pop star Lief Garrett).
