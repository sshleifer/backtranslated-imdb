This is a profound and moving work on the creation of art, that which is exclusively human and can not be produced by nature, the cost of genius and the pursuit of transcendence and what ultimately constitutes the family, that is, all of us. I was very moved by Nathaniel's family discussion with his sisters about his father's shortcomings as he was in a beautiful house that seemed to radiate heat that Lou had created. And although Esther seems so cold in her discussion of Lou's inability to make money, you can appreciate how she, at many times in her life, must have been a counterbalance to her impulses. Nathaniel did a great job showing how all the people in Lou's life fit and completed and became part of his work as his own genius. Yes, or perhaps especially, our failures make us who we are. And of course there are buildings. I only knew Lou Kahn by name and did not really call his name to his work, they are evidence of grace. Maybe someday there will be a building where everyone will fit in, and it will certainly resemble a building of Lou Kahn, perhaps the not built temple of Jerusalem. Maybe there's salvation
