The three biggest names for this film are Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg and Julianne Moore. These three feature the strongest performances, but the entire cast does a wonderful job. The film, although on the pornographic industry, does not get lost of control with its own sexual premise. On the other hand, there were many scenes that involved drug use, and while important to understanding the characters' lifestyles, I think there was some exaggeration in that department. Paul Thomas Anderson did not direct much, but he may have been chosen for this film based on his 1988 work, "The Dirk Diggler Story." One thing that was brilliantly portrayed is the family as atmosphere between the characters while they work, live and have fun together. Although not a typical family, they certainly seem to care about each other. The wonderful soundtrack really helps to give an idea of ​​the period during a period when the disco was the rage. There are many disco favorites in it and some other wonderful songs as well. <br /> <br /> The story is about a talented young man named Eddie Adams (Wahlberg) who is invited to the porn industry. He changes his name to Dirk Diggler and becomes an adult movie star almost overnight. Jack Horner (Reynolds) is the director who takes his films very seriously, believing that his work is more than just pornography, but that they are the real art. However, Dirk becomes overly dependent on drugs and soon follows a dangerous road where he is about to lose everything. Although a greater focus is placed on the character Dirk, there are subplots for the other characters and their attempts in life. You will find yourself wanting and hoping that your situations will improve. All in all a well done movie.
