Okay, I think we all agreed that Michael Jackson was the bass. <br /> <br /> And the special effects too. But please bear in mind that this was not a big budget movie, okay? Not every movie has as much budget as Harry Potter or Star Wars. <br /> <br /> However, I found it very funny. B-? Nothing that, in my opinion, was going to waste your time. <br /> <br /> Parodies are always fun to watch, and just because it was not a big budget does not mean it's bad. <br /> <br /> I think this was a good movie, if weak on some points. <br /> <br /> Hope this review helps. ~ Angela
