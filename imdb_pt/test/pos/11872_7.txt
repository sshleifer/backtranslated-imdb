This is a very good black comedy, with a great view of how different people have a different perception of the same situations. The three main characters met a girl named Jewel, played by Liv Tyler, who is a different male fantasy for each of the three men. Each of the three men goes through the same situations, but when they speak of them to others, their perception of the situation is very different from what the other two men say. This is a very good concept, probably not totally original, but it works very well in the film. The plot is very good, very bizarre and extreme, which makes a good black comedy. The acting is equally good, none of the actors seemed out of place or out of their reach. The comedy is very dark, dark in some scenes, and many people will certainly be offended by it, but black comedy fans will probably enjoy it. Overall, this movie is not to everyone's taste, but most people who love black comedy will probably love it as it's definitely one of the best black comedies. 7/10
