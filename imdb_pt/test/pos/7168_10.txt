My first Mamin movie, I saw in the IFC a long time ago, and I LOVED it. It seemed absolutely artistic, original, fun and hilarious. Not a moment in the movie disappointed me or made me bored, and I was laughing a lot or had a smile on my face. I want to say that this movie is really funny. But here's the catch: it's also very artistic and creative - if you do not know Yuri Mamin (probably, unfortunately, because many of his GREAT films are not available here), he has a very original style like no one else's, and for me this is not even my favorite movie of him (now it's the insane ("Saideburns / Bakenbardy").) Also, I have to say like a Russian, this movie is great because you really see how the Russians are. it is possible because this is a true Russian movie for me, NOT a foreign movie trying to be American or trying to appeal, Mamin has not sold (nor has he ever since, Gorko (1998) was as good if not better. which came out of communist social realism. <br /> <br /> If you liked this movie, I think you have a great chance of loving the other Mamin movies, actually I like many of them. I think this is the Your Most Affordable Movie A Movie similar is Fountain, occurring 6 years earlier, during perestroika, he has the same actor in the lead role and more of the regulars of Mamin that you will recognize from Window to Paris; this one has a supernatural touch in the end, but it's mostly a realistic, great comedy. Viva Mamin, hopefully Criterion will connect all of his films one day, he is still working, and his catalog is so good! Watch any of your movies if you can.
