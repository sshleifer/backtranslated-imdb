For starters, this is my favorite ST ST. <br /> <br /> In addition to the critical comments of StuOz, I'm going to launch a few more: getting technical, when the Enterprise fires its photons at a target blind, they would have to be very close to direct hits (I believe) in order of causing any disturbance and much less damage to the Romulan ship with the vacuum of space to face. <br /> <br /> I had a bit of a problem with the Romulan commander questioning his faith in Romulan "protocol" or his leadership, unless it has to do with attacking vulnerable targets (outposts in the neutral zone ) who are not at war. Also, I do not think the commander would fall in love with the basic or simple tactics that Kirk played, such as "play dead", or fall into the maneuver that the subordinate puts on him or not attack the Enterprise when she is Na Enterprise: I am surprised that, after seeing the method of attack of the Romulana boat, Sulu said, "They are surrendering?" when he attacks the Enterprise for the first time. <br /> <br /> Funny how Spock can only repair gun control when the emergency is over. <br /> <br /> Also in the final attack I found that the Romulan ship was hidden for a long time (so long that Spock could run through a few aisles and go back to the weapons room and activate and fire the photon torpedoes. I would have used phasers at this point, but I'm sure it had to do with the technicians and budget). <br /> <br /> On the plus side: It's a good drama played on the Romulan ship, in which we introduce ourselves to the Romulans. Great scenes with Stiles telling a good part of the human knowledge of the Romulans. Also his conflict with Spock is right there. I wanted Stiles' character to stay on the show for a while, if it was not for the energy he added. <br /> <br /> It's just for fun that I point out the negatives and the excuses (I'm sure there's more). But for me this is as good as it sounds! "Balance of Terror" is always what I place at the top of my ranking in ST.
