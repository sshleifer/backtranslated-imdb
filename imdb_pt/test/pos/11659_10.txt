I really liked this movie. He challenged my emotions and beliefs, becoming a true work of art in my book. The performance was unsurpassed. I would never watch this movie with someone I could not cry, I do not think I'm going to cry any more for any movie, maybe because it makes me look at myself, I do not know. You must see.
