I am the first to acknowledge that the Thirst of Chan-wook Park is exceptionally well done, but spending two hours with Tae-joo (OK-vin Kim) is enough for someone to tolerate for so long. Sang-hyeon (Kang-ho Song) is a priest who wishes to volunteer for experimental studies on those willing to undergo rigorous injections of a specific virus that kills infectively. Instead of legitimately dying, Hyeon becomes a vampire, always longing for the sustenance that the blood gives him to fight against an infectious disease that returns causing the symptoms that forced him to begin (.. collisions / wounds, and the body vomits blood) . Sunlight, as it is known in the vampire genre, causes torturing death if exposed to Hyeon for a period of time. Hyeon falls into lust with Tae-joo, the wife of sick childhood friend Kang-woo (Ha-kyun Shin). Tae-joo was greeted by Mrs. Ra (Hae-sook Kim), regarded as a puppy, and practically used as a pet to be tidied around. Ta-joo is unhappy in this situation and begins a torrid affair that instigates Hyeon, then manipulates him to perhaps kill Kang-woo, making him believe she is a victim of abuse. Renouncing his priesthood, Hyeon dives headlong into the relationship with Tae-joo, soon a willing participant in killing Kang-woo. This incident, which Tae-woo contributed to ... (using a boat in the middle of a lake, they both buried him underwater, Tae-woo preventing Kang-woo from resurfacing while he tried to re-enter) (Hyeon got rid of him, where the police would not find his corpse). Soon Mrs. Ra suffers a stroke (though a finger and the ability to blink contribute powerfully as the story progresses, showing that she is more aware of what they are led to believe), and Hyeon gives Tae-joo a special birthday gift ..vampirism In doing so, Hyeon created a monster. Tae-joo admits (although a slip of the tongue) that, in fact, Kang-woo never hurt her, and as she is thirsty for blood, soon realize that to kill for a supply does not bother her morally or psychologically. Tae-joo becomes such a full hand, Hyeon has to take desperate steps if he stops a threat to society including himself. <br /> <br /> I'll say Headquarters is one of the best horror movies I've seen in relation to 2009. It's a methodical approach that Park takes and we're driven down a dark road with Hyeon and Tae-joo, because they commit terrible acts with nothing positive coming from their unholy union. Innocent people die because of Hyeon's love (which was once lust change for an obsessive love to the end) by Tae-joo, and that will cease if he does not make a painful choice. We see inside their heads, their souls, and it is not always beautiful. 2 hours with them can be quite exhausting ... but, credit to the director for not punching in relation to dishonest behavior and how the powers of vampirism can be given to the wrong people. Hyeon, seen as a rather nice soul in the opening, accepts the "hell" for Tae-joo, so one can look at the Thirst as a unique but not exactly healthy love story. <br /> <br /> In relation to violence, while Park has a tendency to move away from extremely graphic details, there is enough sadism involved to perhaps turn the stomach a little. At the very least, the way violence is perpetrated can certainly have a lasting impact. The sexual situations between Hyeon and Tae-joo can be quite heated and erotic, but also sordid and morally reprehensible. The film, I think, is still a fairly complex examination of the lengths that will remain attached to an object of affection (lust).
