I saw this movie at the Telluride Film Festival in 1997, where one of the screenwriters, Jos√© Giovanni, was being honored. It's an excellent noir-crime drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura. The attention given to all the characters and complex psychological portraits, detailing loyalty, betrayal, love and hope, are tremendous. It's an excellent drama, an excellent thriller and an excellent movie. Upstairs with the best of Melville. (The English title "Classify all risks", in French "Class tous risques", is a play on words in "Tourism Class", which means "Tourist Class".
