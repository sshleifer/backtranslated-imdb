Does any company PLEASE make a (good +) DVD of this movie? In addition to being a wonderful movie about relationships and friendships, "Four Friends" is the ONLY movie I've ever seen - and I literally spent * years * of my life watching movies! - This captures the essence of the experience of the 60s (and I was there!): Idealism, hope, freedom, confusion, betrayals and, ultimately, their optimistic but bitter outcome. And all this is accomplished without being a story about any of the numerous uprisings of that era, though many are only touched ... as part of the tapestry. But the story is mostly about the characters and their friendship for about 10 to 15 years ... and that they survived and deepened, despite the tragedies of that turbulent decade. Absolutely a joy and must see the movie ... even if it is not an old hippie !!!
