Who should watch this movie? Anyone who has ever taken acid, read Philip K. Dick, thought that the premise of the Matrix was better than the special effects, has an interest in Philosophy or likes to have their sense of reality confused. I laughed out loud at this movie, just because it was so scandalous and so perfect. This movie is great. This movie is cool. It's better than Matrix by far (I did not fall asleep in Existenz for a kick-off: action movies / special effects made me an idiot, and despite a plausible philosophical brilliance, that's exactly what the Matrix is). Existenz is disgusting, it's disturbing and it's funny. David Cronenberg did some shonky things (Rabid) and some genius works as well (Videodrome is another worth checking out as it is Stephen King's adaptation of The Dead Zone). But this is one of my all time favorites. I can not remember the ending - which is good because it means I can watch it again. Or maybe I've never watched this movie. Maybe it's an implanted memory. Or maybe 'really' happened to me. I do not know. Anyway, it's now perfectly integrated into my general illusion of reality, and I'm happy.
