OK, it's easy not to confuse this with lame movie Stuart Gordon called "Death Bed" which came out a few years ago because this is "The Bed That Eats." And how do I start to describe it? Well, to begin with, there is obviously a bed that eats. This is as a result of tears of demons, which naturally affect most things, I think, in a negative way. The bed is in the rooms of an old servant or something, and has been responsible for the disappearance of some people in his time. We have a narrator, who is a ghost that stands on the wall behind a painting, and collects all the inedible candy (jewelry, etc) that the bed goes through. He died of consumption, one of the few people to lie in bed who was not devoured, probably because he was sick, he theorizes, while we see him cutting blood in handkerchiefs ... love. The thing about this movie is that it has a very strange sense of humor, but everything is very impassive. The movie is divided into several "acts", I think, "Breakfast, lunch, dinner and just desserts". For fans of the unusually strange and bizarre, well, this may just be your alley. All I can say is you have to see this to believe it, it's pretty hard to describe. 8 out of 10 stars.
