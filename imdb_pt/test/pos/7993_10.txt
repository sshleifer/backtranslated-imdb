I've enjoyed this movie since I was a kid and I still do. I also liked Batman forever at that time, but the real difference is that THIS movie did not come out when I grew up. I noticed some scenes in this movie that did not make sense: 'Hmm ... the crowd is angry. Hey! Where did you get these tomatoes? So I thought, 'Who cares? This movie is not 100% serious anyway! 'The original Tim Burton Batman was also great, but it was a little tacky in some parts and I did not like all the actors. This film has improved in almost every respect with a wonderful cast, a more gothic style and no involvement of the Prince. <br /> <br /> Today, many fans of Christopher Nolan's films do not like Burton, claiming that Nolan's films are more serious and therefore more loyal to comics. I do not think this is entirely true: - There was never an adaptation of Batman's original concept, which was a vengeful criminal killer with a gun. -Batman has taken many forms over the years, peering at his foolishness in the 1960s (and a bit with Batman & Robin). A director is free to choose what kind of Batman he will portray as long as it is good. <br /> <br /> My opinion: Batman does not necessarily have to be serious. It's about a man in a rubber suit with pointed ears. Burton was able to strike a perfect balance between the folly and the darkness surrounding the whole idea. <br /> <br /> I recently watched Nolan's movies and also love them (especially the Dark Knight). There's simply something about this movie that interests me the most. Nolan's goal was to give the character a lot more depth and in doing so, he sought an explanation of almost every aspect of Batman. That's a little too much for me, I'm a big fan of the more abstract version of Batman. Burton's films are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> My conclusion is that you should not compare Nolan to the Burton movies. They are just different and it is up to you to decide which one you like best. My respect is for the two directors.
