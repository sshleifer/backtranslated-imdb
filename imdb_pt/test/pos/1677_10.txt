I see a lot of movies in the movies (103 so far this year) and I have to say that this is by far the best movie I've seen this year even though it was released in 1954! <br /> <br /> I was amazed and watched this work of genius and felt a bit embarrassed for never having heard of it before my local art theater decided to show it for a week in what looked like a new print. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole movie has to be the 28 minute break in which there is no speech and no music, just the sound of the men performing the robbery. Pure quality. <br /> <br /> Although very dark in some places, it is illuminated with dry humor. <br /> <br /> There are not many movies that score 10 out of 10, but this also earns a gold star by the effort !! <br /> <br /> If you've ever had a chance to see this movie, please do not hesitate, it's a classic. <br /> <br />
