Plunkett & Macleane fits into my favorite movie genre (comedy action adventure with comedy), which is probably the reason I rate it a lot. <br /> <br /> The action revolves around a robber (Plunkett) and a lay 'gentleman'. who gets involved with him and his schemes (Macleane). This leads to all sorts of adventures and adventures that are all dyed comedy. There is also, of course, a love interest. The rest of the cast is composed of a series of vibrant characters, larger than life, that contribute to the atmosphere of the movie and show the excesses the rich at this time. <br /> <br /> This is a nice movie, with a rather simple but worthwhile storyline that provides lots of entertainment.
