This is a masterpiece. 'The Big Snit' is a crazy, weird, hilarious and possibly moving look at an elderly couple and their quiet life, who discuss about sawing and scrabble while a nuclear war rages outside. Everything in this great animated animation stands out as memorable: the wife's shaking eye, the vacuum cleaner's spree, her husband saw the fetish (keep an eye on those origins!), The very verbal cat, the insane game show, news anchor, the "beautiful" accordion serenade and the poignant and memorable ending. I am so happy to have found 'The Big Snit', which is by far one of the greatest film works ever produced.
