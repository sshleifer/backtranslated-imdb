I caught "On the Run" in the Showroom in New York and was instantly seduced by its true independent spirit. Starring Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia from the cast of The Sopranos, "On the Run" puts us on a wild 24-hour stroll in the city that never sleeps as we follow the intricacies of an introspective sales agent who is suddenly swept away by his long schoolmate, just out of prison. In fact, he escaped and is "fleeing" in search of some action and a glimpse of life in the midst of the great metropolis. Boosted by great performances, this film brings us back to the old feel of the 1970s photos, with the two characters rediscovering themselves as they traverse the city bumping into wild and local events. An elegy for a certain side of New York that seems to be disappearing, "On the Run" exhibits great sensitivity and humor. I predict it to be a cult classic that asks to be discovered: future viewers should definitely surrender to this night trip.
