It's really a great movie (after being able to ignore Blake Edwards Pink Panther's references with which he seems to be obsessed and are extremely bland). Julie is, as always, wonderful - singing and acting brilliantly. I remember seeing him at Odeon Cinema, in Haymarket, London, at his launch. However Julie did not show up at the UK premiere of STAR! was very unhappy and (apparently!) due to filming the aerial shots for Darling Lili over Ireland. A reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these aerial takings, but she did not. Two box office failures ruined his film career for a few years. But Darling Lili, like STAR! Deserves much more public appreciation.
