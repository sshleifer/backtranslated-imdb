When I was younger and today, Mr. Bean is a work of genius. Rowan Atkinson, three times nominated for BAFTA, stars as the almost silent (imitating) human alien on Earth, causing chaos and evil wherever he goes. He tried to take an exam, put his pants on in front of the blind man (he did not know he was blind), went to church, tried to dive into a pool, had lunch on a park bench, saw a scary movie, his car, had a picnic with a nosy fly, spent Christmas with his girlfriend (Matilda Ziegler), cared for a baby in Portsmouth, went to room 426 at the Queens Hotel in Portsmouth, won a pet contest with his Teddy, top of his Mini in a new chair, and even found and knocked over the Queen. Guests included Rudolph Walker, Richard Briers, Angus Deayton, Nick Hancock of They Think It's All Over, Caroline Quentin, Today's Day David Schneider, Richard Wilson, The Quick Show Eryl Maynard, and Roger Lloyd-Pack's Vicar of Dibley. It was named the BAFTAs for Best Comedy Program (Program or Series) and Best Light Entertainment Program. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 in The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 24 in The Comedians' Comedian, and he was number 8 in Britain's Favorite Comedian. Exceptional!
