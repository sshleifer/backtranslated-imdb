Simply one of the biggest movies ever made. Worthy of sitting next to European masterpieces like RULES OF THE GAME, GREAT ILLUSION, NOSTALGHIA, ANDREI ROUBLEV, 8 1/2, WINGS OF DESIRE, VIRIDIANA, NIGHT OF THE STARS, LA STRADA, ORDET, THE PASSION OF JOAN ARC , THE FOUR BLOWS AND MADAME DE ... Both a blessing ... and a near perfect work of art.
