I think this movie is underrated. For me, I felt a sip of fresh air. Some people complain about the implausibility of the plot, excessive sequences and lack of sex (the latter being, I believe, the main reason for "implausibility"; and how come there are no drunk teenagers talking dirty ?!); but this is not their thing, and it is good for them if they can not relate to the story. The performances are great; I really would like to see more actors in other movies. Emotions are genuine. All this unrequited love thing is presented with an unusual subtlety. And it gives you the feeling you expect from a good movie.
