This movie was filled with great acting, great musical sounds that completely surprise the mind. Larenz Tate (Darius Lovehall), "Deep Waist", '06 was a clever cat with the girls and he soon met his Waterloo with Nia Long, (Nina Mosley), "Great Mother's House," 2000. Nina put her heart and soul in this role and when she meets Darius, the sparks fly first and then there is a kind of hate relationship. The entire cast of actors made this a very entertaining film with lots of comedy, drama and lots of love and cheating going on. This is a very realistic film and at the same time shows how everyone finally has their destiny in life and are placed in their corner of this great world. Great movie, have fun!
