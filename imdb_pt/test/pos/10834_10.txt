I've noticed people have asked if anyone has this show. I have all 26 episodes that aired in the US and I will be willing to share them with anyone interested. All I need is for you to supply blank VHS or DVD tapes. I have them in both formats and paid for freight. My email is creator67@pipinternet.net, send me an email and your request, and I will notify you and we can make the preparations. The quality is very good and they are very nice to watch especially if you have not been able to watch them since they aired in the 60's. It was one of my favorite shows as a kid and holds a very special place in my heart because it brings back many memories of my childhood, as well as other programs like Ultraman and Astroboy. Peter
