This photo was released in May 1979, starring Playboy Susan Kiger as Honey Shayne, Playboy Lisa London as O'Hara and Playboy Pamela Jean Bryant as Terri Lynn. In one of the most delightful secondary comedies in drive-in history, a bunch of passionate youngsters get together in a tale of bikinied frat fighters that stop at nothing to find out everything. So what does H.O.T.S really mean? You'll have to watch the movie for the answer. You see, the girls are having problems with the society girls on campus that make them nothing but sex craving for maniacs. So the girls decided to discredit the girls in society, no matter what they have to do to get the job done. Also, hacking into this mess is the college dean who wants to dismantle the group of girls before they grow out of control. I loved this movie especially Lisa London. I thought her acting was fantastic and I'm disappointed she did not have other acting jobs. Based on the three playmates I give this movie 10 stars of ferret.
