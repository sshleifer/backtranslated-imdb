Every face that Liv Tyler finds hangs his head on her, no, of course, without some small encouragement from Liv. Liv is at her best, with Matt Dillon among the lovers. Interesting premise, to tell the story from each naive's perspective, degenerates into sitcom style endings (not unlike Blame It On Rio, with which it has more than a few similarities). Worth watching, though.
