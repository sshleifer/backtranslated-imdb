This movie was better than I expected. I do not think I deserved a R grade, though. I've seen PG-13 movies with worse language and violence. I found this movie fun and enjoyed it. If you are a person who dissects everything, you may find it very wrong with that, but if you consider it as your face value, I think you will find it amusing.
