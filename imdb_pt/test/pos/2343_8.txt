You have to agree that this film and its talented director do not get the applause they deserve. Here you are hoping the DVD will do very well and bring the two to the attention of a wider audience. The actors gave great performances and the plot is great. Maybe the overall film is a bit long, but May Miles seems to like his actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes keeps them in close longer than necessary. Good for the actors, I'm sure, but sometimes, like the public, you're ready to move on with the plot. May Miles Thomas deserves more recognition of the film business as one of our top digital film directors,
