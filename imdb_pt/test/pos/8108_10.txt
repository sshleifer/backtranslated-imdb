I was surprised and impressed to discover that this movie was released in 1940, before the United States entered World War II. On the surface, to satirize something as solemn and horrible as Nazi Germany could be interpreted as reckless. But the brilliance of Chaplin is not limited to making fun of everything. In fact, the seriousness of his message would not have been as valid had it not been for the excellent use of humor in this film, along with the moments of absolute drama blended together. The drama alone would not have had the bite and resonance that this movie did. Laughing at someone (Adenoid Hynkel) may be the best way to attack them, while laughing with someone (the Jewish Barber) may be the best way to love them. In the final speech of the Jewish barber, I forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened over half a century ago. They are words that have meaning now and in any time of war. For this reason, I believe the film did much more good than bad, since it still has the same profound effect today.
