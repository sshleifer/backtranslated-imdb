This is one of the best science fiction series. It involves character development, some really tense moments and reasonable episode scripts. As another commentator said here, it looked like it was a miniseries, not a full series with episodes of fill and low budgets. <br /> <br /> The problem with the program, which in short is a series of Godzilla. , is that it started out really big, with amazing monsters, fantastic science, so it all boiled down to Americans doing things. So the show ended too soon, since the Olympics were coming and hey! a science fiction show is a science fiction show, but half-naked athletes running aimlessly are much more important. So they only made 15 episodes, instead of the 22 expected. The audience was also small, because people did not notice it at 8:00. In the end, the costumes did that. Rely on a marketing plan to destroy anything that looks remotely original and promising. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: You have a show with good special effects, things like huge monsters killing people or destroying boats, then going to genetic engineering, turning people, human clones, end of the world, tsunamis. In addition, the only fillers are scenes with aggressive rednecks or other boring people being killed for their stupidity. The down side is that after 15 episodes that prepare something huge, the show ends. No real ending, no closure, just a bitter taste of cloth as if you'd just swallowed a piece of clothing.
