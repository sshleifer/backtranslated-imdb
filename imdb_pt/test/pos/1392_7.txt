Lieutenant Claude (Claudio Cassinelli) and several prisoners of his wrecked ship land on an island owned by Edmond Rackham (Richard Johnson). After a few random killings of prisoners, Rackham receives Claude and his two remaining prisoners. To everyone's good fortune, Barbara Bach is also on the island! Unfortunately, there are some crazy fishermen who like to kill people. <br /> <br /> This Italian explorer seems to have it all - a touch of BLACK LAKE CREATURE mixed with DR. SORRY with a dash of things from Voodoo and Atlantis from the WHITE ZOMBIE. Despite some hesitant-looking fisherman's suits, the film benefits from a beautiful location photograph and a good turnaround halfway. All the actors are good and Joseph Cotton even appears as a former biologist. Director Sergio Martino behaves well enough, since there is an action of 10 minutes or more. This can not be said for her late accompaniment THE FISH AND HER QUEEN (1995), easily one of the craziest and off-base sequences since HIGHLANDER II.
