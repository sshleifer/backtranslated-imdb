When I was in the United States, I was about 7 or 8 years old, I always woke up early, just to watch it, along with a bunch of other cartoons like HootKloot, The Road Runner Show and The Pink Panther. But this was perhaps one of the most memorable and funny animated works out there, and I still find it very funny today, I will never forget the episodes, like the one in which two Aunts were fighting over the can of chocolate pudding? or one in which the aardvark is trying to reach the island where all the ants are, and my favorite, the one in which the ant, the aardvark and a dog end up in an animal hospital, which would later be the basis of a similar drawing of Looney Toon with Sylvester, Tweety and the Bulldog. This is one of the most memorable cartoons out there that anyone would want to revisit, I would do. An excellent series.
