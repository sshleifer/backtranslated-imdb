Based on John Jake's hit books, "North and South," "Love and War," and "Heaven and Hell," this was a television miniseries from 1985 to 1987. His success was due to his success, "Roots". It was a Civil War / soap opera of similar slavery, televised about a decade before in the 1970s. Patrick Swayze, early in his career and at the time he made films like Dirty Dancing that would make him famous, star as Orry Main, a young man born on the plantation of South Carolina leaving for West Point. Here he meets George Hazard (James Read), who is supposed to be the hated enemy, the Yankee North, but with whom he ties intimately. Soon, the southern nets and dangers of the north became friends, despite the turbulent era that led to civil war. The theme of family, friendship and doing the right thing, even when the nation was crumbling, lies at the heart of this action-packed action novel and novel. Clariss and Ashton (Jean Simmons and Teri Garber) portray sisters who become enemies when one of them marries Yankee Billy Hazard (John Stockwell. Ashber Ashton's villain, seductive, manipulative, ambitious and perverse is fun to watch on the screen. Although the series did not happen) To cover everything in Jakes's novels, what we see is a condensed version of it and they have changed some things to make it a kind of historical novel with history lessons. Virgilia Hazard (Kirstie Alley) loses the love of her life, former slave Grady, Fort Sumter, Vicksburg, Antietam, Gettysburg, Appomatox, and Harper's Ferry. we are abreast of the White House where we see Abraham Lincoln (Hal Halbrook) battle out the war on his conscience, we have gathered all the prominent players including Lee, Grant, Sherman, Jackson and Davis. Gold - Robert Mitchum, Elizabeth Taylor and Olivia De Ha The villand has cameos and it is interesting to see them. This is not historical fact, it is historical fiction and purely dramatized entertainment. But it has endings of suspense and beautiful cinematographies, costumes and locations. It's like watching an epic movie that runs more than Gone With The Wind with war scenes! The script can be bad at times and the acting may not be the best, despite the good cast. Swayze also does this, as does Terri Garber, but some performances such as Kirstie Alley, James Read (as George Hazard) and Leslie Anne Downes as the beautiful and strong Madeline are great performances. They filmed sets and locations in the south. The music is enchanting and this is a movie that makes us feel good, and we twist for the good guys and watch the villains scheme and finally receive their punishment. All fans of Civil War movies and Jake's novels should watch this. It is available on DVD and VHS.
