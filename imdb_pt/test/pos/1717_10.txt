If you've been a long time doctor fan and flinched when you heard they were doing another show, rest assured - more than meets the high expectations of the original. The pace is much faster than the original shows, fitting more often in 50-minute episodes instead of the average 90 minutes. The writing is excellent, the acting is superb. The harder - and better - to get used to the production values ​​of the new series. Compared with the original, it has some now. (Although I always have fond memories of bubble-wrapping monsters and hand puppets.) If you're not a fan, or if you tried the original and could not control it, jump with both feet now! Whatever you really need to know about the doctor, they will tell you how they go along. This series was written with minimal references to the Doctor's enormous history specifically to encourage new viewers. I admit that I'm only seeing the first new series now, as it's being shown on the science fiction channel (in other words, probably cut into strips by time constraints), but I'm looking forward to future episodes on open TV or on DVD. (July 4 can not come soon!)
