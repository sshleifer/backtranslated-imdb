Face it, folks - "DK3" is more challenging, innovative and clever than its predecessor. Challenging - their levels are ridiculously difficult for a considerable time. An especially difficult level is called "Lightning Lookout", in which you can be struck by lightning at any time. Innovative - opened many doors. Too bad the SNES died shortly after that title. And clever - the level of names ranges from trademark plays ("Lake Orangatanga") to witty references that the target audience of the game will not get for many years ("Bleak House"). <br /> <What annoys me about most people's criticism of this game comes down to two words: Kiddy Kong. He is a worthy successor of "little buddy" to Diddy Kong, and certainly does not deserve to be called "that retarded monkey." "DK3" will remain a classic until the end of time.
