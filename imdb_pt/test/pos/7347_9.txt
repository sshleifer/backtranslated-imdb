I really liked this movie. It is rare to find a star who can pull out the physical aspects of any sports / dance themed movie convincingly and also do a first-class job. In this movie you find two stars that stand up for the occasion. Both women provide warm, touching and sometimes humorous performances. The film also touched on a variety of topics, from racial issues to sexual identity. And yet the approach was not burdensome. The production figures were also top quality for a small budget film. I saw this at the Philadelphia Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and came back to see it a second time. It was a great pleasure for everyone. Everyone I talked to seemed to like this movie.
