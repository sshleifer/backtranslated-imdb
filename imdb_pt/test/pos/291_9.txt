This is a classic war movie. One of the best, one glaring fest image of flashing lights, distressing dark backgrounds and helicopter blades turning into ceiling fans. A spectacle filled with stars of immense power. <br /> <br /> Martin Sheen is a mercenary sent upstream to assassinate the general who got lost, a sadistic dictator went beyond the belief of the great Marlon Brando. Also for the tour are Robert Duvall as an over-top DI with a penchant for "napalm in the morning" or at least the smell of it. Dennis Hopper is a nervous photojournalist with a bent over view of the war and its leader. Also in this incredible movie you will see stars like Laurence Fishburne, R. Lee Ermey, Sam Bottoms, Albert Hall and keep an eye on Harrison Ford too ... <br /> <br /> Behind the lens is Francis Ford Coppola delivering a movie with intensity and drama perhaps more than the acclaimed Godfather films, he highlights the war in its most basic form, which for the most part is something you can not see, you can only feel it, as the boat continues upstream the sensation of the war tightening is quite unbearable. The feel of it is a rather claustrophobic feeling and really contributes to the unusual mood of the viewers. Honestly, no movie made me feel that way. <br /> <br /> Criticism is hard to find. The biggest problem for some is that Brando made a lot of money for a ten-minute role, but in all fairness that's unwarranted. It was well-deserved money, a role that physically restricted him, being at the time a sick man and a role that he actually made his own. I can not imagine anyone better for the role. And if you get the version of Apocalypse Now Redux, there are some extra parts of the great man, and I think Redux makes the movie so much better. <br /> <br /> The final impressions are that if you are lucky, Redux Version, then you will be blessed with a completely satisfying film with an extra 49-minute shoot. If not then you still will not be disappointed, this movie is there with the best, and deserves great recognition, and a firm place as one of the top 50 films ever made ...
