At first glance, this movie seems to be some kind of fairy tale about a beautiful and significantly white horse once seen never forgotten. However, seen strictly within the context of history, the implication is that to survive in post-Civil War America, it was necessary to have a horse, not an old horse, but a really great horse. And Eagle's Wing is such a horse. But for a man to be worthy of such a horse is another matter. Who should own? The Native American or the AWOL Soldier? History shows primitivism against civilization. As has been said by other commentators, it is ironic that an English director has noticed this fact, and then develop this simple theme in a Western like no other you can see again. The film is basically about this beast and the wild roughness of the environment and the people who live it. The photography and the soundtrack are excellent. Martin Sheen's performance is a revelation. This film, released in the same year as Sheen's other great performance as Willard in 'Apocalypse Now', suggests her skills that somehow never received such a free rein again. More is worth it. A comparison between the two stories shows the striking similarities between them - not least, that both films plot the journey of a man in his soul in order to find redemption. While Willard is rescued, I let the viewer decide if Pike is eventually. The end is fabulous in the true sense of the word and very moving; be warned. Overall, this is an extraordinary movie.
