Big Fat Liar is what you get when it combines great writing, great production, and an emphasis on clever ideas about teenage pap. The two stars work very close together and - what can I say? Amanda Bynes shines. Putting "Irkel" and Lee Majors in the film were brilliant touches. Watch this movie with your kids. If you do not laugh, you should not be paying attention.
