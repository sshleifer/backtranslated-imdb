I have not really focused on the broader genocidal aspects of the story (though the horrible images at first are very powerful). I was really impressed by the human story of the girl and her family. Imagine living your life without knowing if you have a time bomb running inside you. I was really looking forward to seeing Yasuko being rejected as "contaminated" by the bomb. The image that is closest to me is when Yasuko is in the mirror, combing his hair, silently watching the clumps.
