I do not think I'll include any spoilers, but if I do, I can cover my butt. "The Last American Virgin" came at a time when teenagers of age and sex were the rave. Movies like "Prepies" (1984), "Hot Times" (1974) and the popular "Porky's" (1981) were making a lot of money. However, it is the "Last American Virgin" that actually has a more serious plot amid nudity and sexual situations. It is the often told story of three high school friends who want to lose their virginity. Going to the wrong places (prostitutes), the dangerous (older woman with jealous boyfriend) and the most convenient (attracting their female high school counterparts). The film has many funny moments and although the cast has not produced a single big movie star, it's worth remembering a fantastic 80's soundtrack that includes: Devo, The Cars, Journey and others. To this day standards are audacious and could have achieved an NC-17 rating, but it is a well-told story of how sometimes personal fixation can only bring pain, while love may be right in front of us. It's a little piece of American 80s and worth having in your movie collection.
