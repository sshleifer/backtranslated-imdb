This film is basically a very well made production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on those involved. It's always interesting to see the story on the other side for a change. This film focuses on a group of German soldiers who after fighting in the North African campaign are sent to Stalingrad, Russia, where one of the most notorious and bloody battles of World War II is being fought. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see the other side of this battle, since we almost always see the Germans simply as the "villains." In this movie, these 'villains' receive a human face and voice and this makes you realize that the only true enemy in the war is the war itself and not necessarily those against whom you are fighting. In the beginning, it's kind of hard to focus on the movie, because you always have in mind that the Germans are evil villains. But of course you get used to it quickly and then you adapt the Germans as the main characters of the film and even start to care - and care about them. <br /> <br /> The way this story is told is n however, the best. It is difficult to keep up with the story at times, as it jumps from one sequence and place to another. The film is not always logical in its narrative and presents an excessive number of sequences that remain too vague. Most of the time, it's very difficult to keep the characters apart and see who's who. This does not always make this movie easy to watch but again, on the other hand, there are enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting but not the most consistent around. In this respect, Hollywood films are always better than European films. <br /> <br /> Production figures are high and feature some good-looking scenarios and scenarios, although the film has not even been filmed in Russia itself. This helps to create a good atmosphere of war situation. <br /> <br /> The character is mostly interesting, though perhaps a little bit of formula. But I do not know, for some reason, stereotyped characters always work well in war films and strengthen drama and realism. It also helps that they are being played by well-scaled actors. All the actors are not the best-known actors out there (Thomas Kretschmann was also a very unknown actor at the time), but each of them fit well and gave the characters a unique face and personality. <br /> <br /> All in all not the best or most consistent WW II drama around but definitely worth a look due to its original approach on the German side of the Battle of Stalingrad and its good production values. <br /> <br /> 7/10
