Yes, I felt as if I had been gutted after seeing it for the first time. But only the next day I began to see the true brilliance of this creation. I will not repeat much of what has been said by those who appreciate the film, but there is a new area where I want to play ... ** SPOILERS ** Why exactly did the teacher put the broken glass in the student's room? pocket? Most reviewers noted that this only reflected their cruelty and reaction to unsatisfactory performance. I must disagree. Watch the scene again. Huppert is brought to tears as he watches his student playing on stage. The student is an expressive girl (crying and vocalizing her fears) -exactly the opposite of Huppert's character. There is a scene later in the movie, after the girl is injured, when Huppert discusses the accident with the girl's mother. The mother, visibly annoyed, states, "We gave up everything so she could study piano," and Huppert immediately said "You mean she gave up everything, did not she?" So it was my thought that Huppert was simply saving this young student expressive of his own destiny. She did not want the girl to end up like her, repressed and hardened, condemned to a life of recitals ... gradually killing the soul in the pursuit of perfection. Maybe she'd been on stage years ago, before things got bad. Maybe she wished she'd escaped when she was that age. Is it ruining the student's life, or simply freeing it? <br /> <br /> For me, this perception made all the difference in what I experienced through this movie. Bright.
