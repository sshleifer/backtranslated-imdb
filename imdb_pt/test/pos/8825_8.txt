Watching this PPV, I had high expectations, since Smackdown is the best show of WWE, this is a very good PPV as it is the last before Wrestlemania. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH-HARDY BOYS & CHRIS BENOIT VS. MVP & MNM W / MELINA IN A MAN'S GAME 6 TEAM TEAM TEAM Good way to start the game. It started a bit slow at first but then the pace picked up and the game got more exciting and fun. Benoit rolls and makes Joey Mercury go out to win the Hardy Boys himself. 6/10 <br /> <br /> SECOND MATCH-GREGORY HELMS {CHAMPION} VS. SHANNON MOORE VS. FUNAKI VS. CHAVO GUERRERO VS. DAIVAIRI VS. SCOTTY 2 HOTTY VS. JAMIE NOBLE VS. JIMMY WANG YANG ON A CONVENTIONAL SET CRUISERWEIGHT OPEN FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP CRUISERWEIGHT I'm a big fan of Cruiserweights, and I'm never disappointed to watch them, especially in this game here. Chavo Guerrero nails the Frog Splash on Jimmy Wang Yang to get the win and become the new WWE Cruiserweight Champion. 5/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD PHOSPHORUS - FINAL AND SMALL BASTARD VS. BOOGEYMAN & LITTLE BOOGEYMAN This was not really a wrestling match, it was more like a comedy match, although it was not a clear wrestling contest, it still amused me with funny antics. Finlay nails the little bogeyman with the Shillaegh to get the win. Boogeyman does not deserve to be on a PPV, and does not deserve to be in WWE. 4/10 <br /> <br /> QUARTER MATCH- KANE VS. KING BOOKER W / SHARMELL This was a surprisingly good match, I thought it would be mediocre, but it turned out to be a real competitive wrestling championship. Let's take off the hat for both men, pulling a very fun game. Kane wins after a Chokeslam in King Booker. 6/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH MATCH- PAUL London and BRIAN KENDRICK {CHAMPIONS} VS. DEUCE AND DOMINO W / CHERRY FOR THE WWE TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP Not really a good game, Deuce & Domino need more training to fight, and London & Kendrick is the only one who keeps that game fast. The London & Kendrick maintains their titles, after Kendrick has achieved a defeat in one of the men for the win. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SIXTH GAME - BOBBY LASHLEY {CHAMPION} VS. MR. KENNEDY FOR THE ECW CHAMPIONSHIP Mr. Kennedy attacks Lashley from behind before the game starts. It was a good match, but not very good. Lashley and Kennedy have a bit of chemistry, but not enough to get a good game. Kennedy wins for DQ after Lashley wraps him around with a chair and then attacks him with the chair to the entrance. Lashley still holds his title. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SEVENTH GAME - JOHN CENA & SHAWN MICHAELS VS. BATISTA & UNDERTAKER This is probably the best tag team game I've ever seen. Let's take the hat to all these men (yes, even Batista) by getting as close as a classic 5 star main event. All 4 men played very well in the match, since it was a great and fun tag team match. Batista turns his back on Undertaker, tearing him, then leaving the ring, which leads Michaels to Sweet Chin Music, then Cena to get an F-U for the tough win. 7/10 <br /> <br /> I do not know why everyone says that this PPV is not good enough, or it sucks, I just do not understand. It's a great PPV that Smackdown always delivers. Great PPV, in fact. <br /> <br /> Overall I'll give 8/10 and a B +
