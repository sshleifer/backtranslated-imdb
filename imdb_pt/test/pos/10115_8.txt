Radio will make you laugh, cry, feel. This story based on a true story is the perfect movie for a couple to see. There is enough for both. cuba Gooding Jr. displays the title character to perfection. His performance is worthy of a statement to the Academy Award. The compassion of the film is obvious. The film evokes many emotions. I sincerely liked this movie.
