Of all the Star Wars parodies I've seen, this is probably the funniest. Not because of the premise, Star Wars with simple electronics instead of spacecraft, but because of how badly acted it is. This is deliberately exaggerated, and this makes it hilarious, and as everyone knows that it is purposely overblown, no one complains. The special effects were also purposely as horrible as possible, and include a toaster on a visible rope that shoots toast and an egg beater on a rope. This short is funny for any Star Wars fan (which I'm not), or anyone who has 15 minutes to kill. Great short !! <br /> <br /> My rating: *** out of ****. 13 min. Not rated.
