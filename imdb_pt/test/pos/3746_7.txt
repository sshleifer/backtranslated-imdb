Gerald (Richard Carlson) and Kitty (Veronica Hurst) have just celebrated their engagement announcement in France with family and friends when he receives a letter asking him to visit an ancestral castle located in Scotland. Gerald's uncle became ill and asked Gerald, the sole heir, to be present. Gerald goes to Scotland, leaving his future bride behind. A few weeks go by and he does not come back. Concerned, Kitty sends telegrams, but receives no news from her fianc√©. Another four weeks go by and Kitty finally gets a strange response from Gerald, canceling the engagement and telling her to move on with her life. Not ready to give up her relationship and look for answers, Kitty boards an airplane and decides to pay a visit to Gerald. Accompanying her on the journey is her aunt Edith (Katherine Emery, best known for her role in the classic ISLE OF THE DEAD). When Kitty and Edith arrive at the MacTeam estate, they immediately suspect that something strange is happening. To begin with, Gerald seems to have aged twenty years in a matter of weeks. Second, this charming, handsome guy has turned into a complete idiot who repeatedly demands that they leave the castle and never come back. When Edith falls with a light cold, Kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there to try to get to the bottom of things. <br /> <br /> Why is Gerald being so cold and cruel to the woman that he was just about to get married? Why does Gerald object to having company? Why do house rules say that guests should stay locked in their rooms at night? Why are guests barred from entering certain areas of the property, such as Gerald's bedroom and a large maze around? And what are these strange noises crawling on every night? These are just some of the issues that LABYRINTH puts. The film really does a good job of building mystery and intrigue. You genuinely care about what is happening and patiently await resolution to explain the strange events that are taking place. And then it happens ... I definitely do not want to ruin the end of this movie because you'd better not know it, but it takes one of the most unbelievable and amazing twists I've seen in any movie. It's wonderfully ridiculous in a way, but it also takes a very solid little b / w mystery and sends it directly to the Zlock territory. And yet, this end seems so out of place that you probably will not forget it after seeing it. <br /> <br /> Despite the end (or maybe partially, because of the end), I really liked that. strange bird. It's extremely interesting and slow over the runtime, but it managed to keep my interest everywhere. Director William Cameron Menzies (who made the much more famous INVADERS FROM MARS the same year) is best known as a two-time Oscar-winning art director and his scenario projects here are also really interesting. There is almost a silent film sensation at times, with model work for some of the exteriors, some painted scenarios and sparsely decorated interiors with very tall ceilings. As with any good set of castles, there are also secret passages and long staircases. This also throws some rubber batons into strings for good measure. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors are a little rough and awkward, but I liked most of the cast. Hurst is one of those obscure and almost unknown actresses who, unfortunately, never seemed to pick up, despite being beautiful and talented. Emery, who can also play the narrator in framing scenes at the beginning and end of the film, is decent enough as the overly educated and cautious aunt. My favorite, however, was Michael Pate as the sinister gray-haired servant who makes that hilarious zombie walk every time he climbs the stairs. Also on board, in smaller roles, are Hillary Brooke (who played the lead role in the Sherlock Holmes mystery, THE WOMAN IN GREEN) and Lilian Bond (THE OLD DARK HOUSE OF THE WHALE). Of course Carlson also starred in IT CAME FROM EXTER SPACE, CRIATURE FROM BLACK LAGOON and a few other horror films, so you have a pretty decent cast for fans of the genre. I say, check it out!
