This movie is about Viola (Amanda Bynes) and her quest to defeat her team of Cornwell boys after they expelled the girls' team. So she goes to school rival Illaria and joins the boys team, doing so she falls in love with Duke (Channing Tatum) who thinks she's a guy and likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who likes Viola as her brother. <br /> <br /> I was in a version of the play on the 12th night and the beginning was very modern. So I knew the play well. I was really excited to see this movie and when I saw it it exceeded my expectations. He kept many of my favorite lines and I could see great connections to the piece. Although it was like the play, it was not so complicated. It was also more of a girl movie than I expected, but it was good. It was very funny. It pulls you into a lot of love stories and lies. You saw how the viola (Amanda Bynes) mistakenly thought about what the guys thought and about their complications in living in the guys' world. You also see your roommate, Duke (Channing Tatum), impression of that. I really enjoyed seeing the characters being portrayed in a modern way. He also tells the modern theme "Follow Your Dreams", but this time it has a turnaround. I think this movie was a great movie about a girl who loved football and stood out for herself and her family and her dreams. I think this movie will be the great opportunity for many rising stars.
