What can I say? The kid inside has always had great affection for the following ... giant robots, giant monsters and a megalomaniac thug, and this movie succeeds in every way. As an adult, it's easy to point out the many flaws in this movie and say that it's actually just a bunch of episodes taken from a children's TV series. Despite all this, I find the ending very moving and the content surprisingly adult in nature. Tremendous fun if a little pointless at times.
