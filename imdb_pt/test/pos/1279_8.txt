A sloppy man, known as Bill, lives in a dingy little apartment with a Marilyn Monroe poster on the wall and his typewriter as a company. Only man can not think of anything to write. He wanders the streets following people, just to see where they go. Maybe that will give you some inspiration to write. He begins to follow a well-dressed man holding a bag. He follows you for a few days. While in a cafe, the well-dressed man sits at a table on the opposite side of Bill, and asks why Bill is following him. The well-dressed man says his name is Cobb. Cobb then surprisingly informs Bill that he is a thief, and even starts to take Bill with him in houses to steal things; although Cobb insists he does not go into other people's houses just to steal. He says he likes to let people know that he has been there and has interrupted the things they take for granted. He puts panties on another robbery in a man's pants, for example. <br /> <br /> The movie is counted in flashbacks sometimes too. The director used this technique in greater abundance in his recent resource Memento. Bill finally decides to cut his hair and dress in a suit, following Cobb's advice. He meets a blonde lady in a club, who used to date the owner, a balding man, who is very dangerous, she says. We see a scene in which a hammer is used by bald men, so men on the fingers of a man in the Lady's apartment. These are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director shows us, and they will all fit together when we come to the startling conclusion.
