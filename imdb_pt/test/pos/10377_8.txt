This movie was a pretty nice watch for me, I mean it was not great, but it was one of the best horror movies lately. It seems to have been low, almost the size of the state benefit budget, but it has charms like the lovely ladies in it. The atmosphere was good as well (which is what is missing from a hell of a lot of horror movies these days). The acting was his typical low-budget case of the '80s, and in case you do not know, he's "foolish." But this is what Lucio Fulci's movies were full of, they liked this movie had atmosphere they were missing out on plot and money etc. They more than made up for the horror & gore & atmosphere for the movie is Ego. <br /> <br /> It's just a typical low budget horror movie that is watchable, I watched it all the way and I love horror movies. I've seen movies that I just hung up on in 10 to 20 minutes or sat down and moved fast if I was on video, or skip scenes on the DVD. This movie did not make me want to do this, I sat and watched it all the way to the end, not wanting to skip parts. <br /> <br /> I would have liked it, though, if the zombie type folk this was a little scarier because they were as scary as having Freddy Kreuger as a nanny, no. But seriously, if they were a little better, it would have been a low-budget perfection, perhaps. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie was top notch, ideal horror music. I've seen horror movies where the music is good or average, but it could have been better, thank God, although this movie did not have the Metal song. <br /> <br /> I've been a True Metal fan since 1990, but in horror movies, metal music spoils it, the movie loses a lot of atmosphere when any kind of music other than a score is played. So, I'm glad there was no song in this movie beyond its typical score, which was pretty scary, well done. <br /> <br /> She could have used "Profane Grace - Epitaph of Shattered Dreams". As it is keyboard music without guitars, nothing but really "scary" keyboard tracks. As a "Forever Sleep" track you hear the wind blowing all the way through it and some shivers inducing keyboard music that follows it. Never accompany this cd is the same ideal horror song, it is better that it has fit perfectly in this film. <br /> <br /> The only uninteresting girl in the movie for me was the one who was chibada / dead (or we're led to believe) and hung up like a scarecrow, just to get free and try to run away later. All the other women in the movie were really lovely, a big 9 out of 10 for all of them except the one I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> I wish that Hollywood (mainstream side of things) would give money to Romero and the guy who made this movie. How to give them to movies is much better a decision taken than to give a mupp√© named Paul Anderson the "evil resident" pick. Well done guys, not bad, not bad I loved the part in the final credits, when they kept showing clips of them doing the movie (behind the scene). Not many movies do that sort of thing, which I think added a bit to the movie, but also showed you have some outtakes of sorts and that's always a good thing if you ask me. Rating for this movie 8/10, rating for the lovely ladies in the movie 9/10, rating for the atmosphere in the movie 9/10, rating for the movie score 9.5 / 10.
