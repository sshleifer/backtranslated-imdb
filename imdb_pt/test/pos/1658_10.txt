For starters, I did more research on the film. Firslty, Jules Dassin directed and acted in this extremely imaginative and different crime noir film. Secondly, this was a very low budget film, created in the Renaissance of the privileged moment of the film noir. Third, the jewelers in which the robbery was tried are true jewelers. The producers of Rififi have asked them to film, surprisingly, (I quote Jules Dassin in a recent interview on the subject, "surprisingly, for some reason not very obvious, they were delighted with the idea of ​​a crime film being put into their store." ). <br /> <br /> His flawless characters and plot fit so beautifully with his surroundings. To add to my praise I will say this, some may say that this was a typical Hollywood movie, on the contrary, this set the basis for the regular plot of a Hollywood crime film. <br /> <br /> Laslty, I would like to say that I support this new idea of ​​a film in which not only one side wins, and this side does not always have to be the good one. For once, I can say that a movie not predictable! Ten stars!
