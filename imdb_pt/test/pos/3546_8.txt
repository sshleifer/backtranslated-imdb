Definitely worth watching. <br /> <br /> Ten different directors feature a segment based on their favorite opera opera. You do not have to be an opera lover to watch this movie. (Of course, if you hate opera, you're really going to have a hard time with it!) <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, the segments range from brilliant to just honest. Most of the confusion seems to be about Godard's contribution - if you think he's brilliant or pretentious, his segment will not change his mind. <br /> <br /> Some of the pieces have a clear narrative; others are more a montage of connected images. <br /> <br /> Neither party has more than 10 minutes; if you are not satisfied with what is on the screen, wait for the next segment and think about how much culture you are absorbing. <br /> <br /> Keep your eyes open for presentations by Buck Henry, Beverly D. Angelo, Elizabeth Hurley, Brigette Fonda, Tilda Swinton and John Hurt. (The Buck Henry segment is only worth the price of admission). <br /> <br />
