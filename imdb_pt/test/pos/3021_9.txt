A crackling and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist, Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), who is desperately urged by two FBI agents, Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) to use their therapy on Carl Stargher (Vincent D 'Ofornio), a serial killer who (uses strange and horrifying torture tactics) is found in coma by the feds. What Novak wants in return for Deane is the whereabouts of the last victim of Stargher and if she's alive. Once Deane enters the mind of Stargher, who has the look and feel of a colorful combination of David Lynch's "Dune" or "Blue Velvet" and Wes Craven's "A Nightmare on Elm Street," the adventure begins. Deane sees a variety of strange people ranging from young Carl (a lovely Jake Thomas) to a man like Freddy Krueger minus razor claws. I do not want to reveal the ending, but the film is excellent, beyond the dynamite performances, the chilling soundtrack and direction of Howard Shore (from Tarsem, which shows here that he can drive).
