After watching Desperate Living, I was hooked on the John Waters films. I heard about Pink Flamingos and had to watch and boy was it worth it! Believe what you hear, it's crap! It is packed with everything dirty which is really the main plot of this movie. It contains the following: Incest, cannibalism, rape, nudism (as you've never seen before - beware of the animators of the baby's birthday party), poop, fire, trailer trash, perversion, transsexuality, fettish egg, cross dressing. .. you get the picture. Above all, this is a definite obligation! Just be careful with the cheerleader at the birthday party and the Divine wondering about the park!
