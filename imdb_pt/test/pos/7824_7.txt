Sometimes you wake up late at night flipping through the seasons, bored and wanting some lightweight fluffy romantic comedy that does not make you feel bipolar. And that movie fits that exact billing. Of course, the plot was ripped out since the 1930s ... writing as schmaltzy as the legendary poetry of the Hallmark Greeting Card company, and the one-dimensional characters were played by a cast drawn straight from Central Casting - but it was BEAUTIFUL, and exactly the that I needed last night. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly and Costas Mandylor have great chemistry together - I liked it on "Picket Fences", and I'm happy to say they still have it over 10 years later. Costas Mandylor, at 41, is still possibly one of the most handsome men to adorn the canvases since Rudy Valentino kicked the bucket 80 years ago. RRROWRR! Bonus points for casting that funny man who used to be on the skates on that show about the cartoon woman. I always thought it was straight from a Hepburn-Grant comedy. ANGRY! <br /> <br /> Some people will probably say that this was the most mundane movie ever made, and I probably would have to agree - but come on! It's on the Hallmark channel. What were you waiting for? Sit down, relax, have some sesame sticks and watch a little movie with two cute people and a bottle of Zinfandel. Trust me, you will love and accept the schmaltz a lot more, and then you can go to sleep dreaming of Mandylor Costas swimming in a sea of ​​seasoned chocolate feeding you petit fours with fresh mint chocolate coating. YUMMO! <br /> <br /> I really wish the wicked girl had been cast with Rachel Ray, and maybe that nerd Alton Brown as the announcer instead of the scary guy with the beard Van Dyk. Shit! <br /> <br /> That would have made my night. But hey, check out "Desserts Only."
