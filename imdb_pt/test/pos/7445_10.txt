Did not play the game? Do not bother yourself. This is for fans of Final Fantasy VII who have won the game, and no one else will appreciate this rare gem of a movie. Want to watch and love? Buy the game, hit it and watch it. When was the last time you watched a great movie based on a video game? Well that's. <br /> <br /> The story takes place two years after the game and there are short summaries to refresh your memory (although I doubt that many forget), and goes straight to the hour and adventure of forty-one minutes. <br /> <br /> All your favorite characters are there, even Cait Sith. The dubbing is excellent in the Japanese version, each character is cast to perfection. Cloud sounds hard and shocking, Tifa looks kind but strong ... Aeris is also perfect, she sounds exactly as I imagined. Cait Sith sounds less cute than I imagined, but it worked very well. <br /> <br /> The character models are spectacular, great textures and lighting. The environments are breathtaking and battles are choreographed to make the Matrix blush. The astonishing camera work comes in the pursuits of bicycles, for example where your eyes are just screaming in satisfaction and your lungs breathing heavily without consent. <br /> <br /> The music is typical Uematsu quality, which means. Familiar songs are remade to accompany the graphic leap of Advent Children, which combines well with the visual aspects. There is even an internal joke for the fans that involves music, it will make you smile for sure. <br /> <br /> I did not watch with subtitles since I'm kind of Japanese, so I can not say that. the subtitles are good. In Japanese, however, the dialogue is very good and each word sounds as if it came from real living beings, not just actors. Impressive. I will watch again one day with subtitles to see the differences since I played the Japanese and American release of Final Fantasy VII. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Final Fantasy VII, buy this movie the day it comes out or pre-order. If you did not play the game, but want to see this movie very badly, do not waste your time: buy the game, hit it and then come back to this DVD. I will not tell you not to watch but play the game. This will make the experience much better and will not leave you in the dust scratching their heads. <br /> <br /> Come back, old friends - it's time to go back to an adventure with your brave companions!
