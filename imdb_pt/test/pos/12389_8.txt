It kept me on the edge of my seat. It's true that the story has some holes in the plot, but the sheer tension of it, the way the director continues to challenge the premise, is simply fascinating. <br /> <br /> José Coronado and Adriana Ozores are two of the best actors in Spain (see La vida stain and Héctor) and here they appear as a happy middle-class couple. Underneath all, the truth is that Coronado's whole life is a lie. He is not an economist, never went to college or works in the Central Bank Reserve of Spain, as everyone believes. We have some ideas about how he kept up appearances or managed to do it, and although it's not very plausible, it's still somehow believable. <br /> <br /> The internal work of the coup is shown intermittently, but it is credible because the Coronado is a source of self-confidence and assertiveness. He not only believes in fraud, he also believes in the premise of the film, and therefore he carries it. <br /> <br /> Certainly, it tests the belief that a wife would not know the inner workings of a marriage finances for almost 10 years, but again, since he is a brilliant economist. It has been said, in a nationalistic tone, that the film is not "distinctly Spanish," as if this were a decisive test for good. movie. It's true that there are no strange castanets or cabbies in this, just a tense thriller. You'll wonder how this story ends when you start watching.
