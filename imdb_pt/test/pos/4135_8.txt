I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, I do not even remember what made me sit in front of the television, I tuned in to HBO and watched this interesting biopic. What I remember was realizing that it was a (rather) true story about someone who actually lived. I remember the song, great songs that I still love today (I can not believe Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well - What a stud!) So the end came. He died. He was freaking dead. I could not believe it. I had no warning, no prior knowledge like most coming to this movie. She taught me a hard lesson about life and how it does not follow the rules most movies teach us. I just watched the movie again tonight and I was engaged again ... and a little sad. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, but I'll admit a bit of prejudice.
