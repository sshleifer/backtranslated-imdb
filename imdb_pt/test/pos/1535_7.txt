This two-character drama is extremely successful and has a valid message and some truly shocking moments (shocking not because they are graphics, but because you are not prepared for them when they arrive). But eventually it becomes oppressive, just like something similar "A Pure Formality" did. Still, Alan Rickman should have been nominated for an Oscar for his multidimensional performance, no doubt. (** 1/2)
