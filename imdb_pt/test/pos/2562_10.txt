Initially I was put off renting this movie due to the cover art for the DVD. In fact, this stayed true to friends of mine who did not rent it because of the art and mental image they imagined was a movie that had little or no interest for me (or my friends). But, I rented and watched and was really amazed. <br /> <br /> I agree with another user's comments that this movie is not for everyone because of blatant sexual inferences, so it's definitely not something I would like small kids to watch (and I seriously doubt if they would understand it from any form). <br /> <br /> I like movies like that, by which the character's personalities and who they are are genuinely defined in a direct way, without teasers to indicate that they will go wrong. Was the acting done ... acting? Ricci and Jackson did so well that I was drawn to this movie without even realizing they were acting. The same thing with the story ... may seem a little overdone, but it went very, very well. This reminded me of another movie with Mel Gibson, Tim, where each character had limitations, whether mental or circumstantial, so they were well defined. <br /> <br /> I've found a lot of depth in this film with the character involved, so feel that everyone involved (from cameramen to actors) should be commended for a perfect fit / outcome. After watching this movie, I talked to some friends who took a negative approach to watching it as I did, so after hearing my comments, they rented and watched. They were also quite surprised at how good it was. It's a shame that the art of the jacket was made the way it was, since it's a slack. I can see now how the art applies, but I had not heard of this movie before, and art was my first impression ... art sells or destroys DVD sales / rentals. These characters had more depth to them and good time was assigned to give an audience as I time to absorb the "feel" for each one. I felt I could trust that the movie would flow well and that's what happened. So with the art of the jacket aside, I would recommend watching this movie.
