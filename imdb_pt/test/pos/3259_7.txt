I had never heard of this movie, but I like Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown and the story sounded interesting, so I figured I'd try. I found it very enjoyable. Heath Ledger plays a 19-year-old who works a kind of low-quality job and wants to start gaining weight, so he asks for the work of mobster Bryan Brown. I will not go into details, but things go very bad for Ledger and get into big trouble with Bryan Brown. From them, the film gets better and better, with a scene involving Ledger doing a pair of bank robbers. And we can not forget the beautiful Rose Byrne, who interprets Ledger's love interest. I would definitely recommend this movie.
