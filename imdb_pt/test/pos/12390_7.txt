Of course, how could he. He obviously co-opted several aspects of that great film, which was also based on the sensational French case of the self-described "World Health Organization doctor" who murdered his family and himself when he was finally exposed as a fraud. Emilio refers to his son as "monster," he sings to the radio in his car, he stands on park benches, and he is a specialist in investment schemes to defraud his family and friends - all this and more directly raised from " Team". Out ", which came out the previous year" Nobody's Life. "It's very bad because this movie is very good on its own, with good acting and writing. sense of ethics, although he is sometimes transformed into us, the protagonist here seems devoid of any character except for his winning look and charm. Seriously, the part where he used x-rays that show his mother-in-law's cancer to extract more money from his father, then uses a subtle turnaround in the same coup to avoid eviction of his chic home by not paying the rent in time - it is almost too much.The guy has no shame, in fact, he is more like the leader of the "Stepfather" than a poor idiot who is fired and is so humiliated that he can not face the disappointment of his family and friends and feels compelled to invent a brilliant new life for himself as Vincent did in Time Out. Thus, one could feel growing ensemble in "Nobody's Life" and the violent ending coming. One thing that "Nobody's Life" has that "Time Out" definitely lacked was a love interest beyond the confidant wife of the protagonist. It is not difficult to understand how the sexy nanny was able to fascinate and entangle Emile to the point of ignoring the danger of her natural curiosity and allowing her to undress her blow less than carefully constructed. Given the reservations mentioned, this is a very good movie that we find fun. If you yearn for something that touches similar elements, that is deeper and more intellectually and spiritually satisfying, I emphatically suggest "Time Out."
