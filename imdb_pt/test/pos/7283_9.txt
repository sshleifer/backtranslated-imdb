Good movie, all the elements of a good movie were there, story, actors, script and direction. I was on the tip of my seat all the time. <br /> <br /> No doubt about it, it's a low budget movie, but I liked it more than many big budget movies. <br /> <br /> Andres Bagg plays Martin Sanders, who is dealing with his unfaithful wife. Then a voice on the phone and then just fear. <br /> <br /> Virginia Lustig is beautiful and brings powerful performance. She's a great part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked the growing ambiguity near the end, even knowing that the main character might be involved, we kept seeing everything from his point of view and asking: Who is the killer?
