This dramatic turnaround set in Chicago in the early 60's, we followed a group of high school friends who navigate the ups and downs of their lives. The two central characters are Leroy "Preach" Jackson (Turman) and his best friend Richard "Cochise" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs). Both boys have promising futures. Preach is a great writer but a lazy student, and Cochise has just received a scholarship to basketball. When they are not at the local diner playing with their friends, or hanging out at friends' homes or chasing girls, they are jumping school, riding Chicago or going to parties on weekends. /> <br /> Things go wrong when Preach and Cochise make the mistake of getting involved with two hoods and having fun in a stolen car. The police are after them and they are arrested. But thanks to the efforts of a troubled teacher (Garrett Morris of SNL) they are released. But the two chapters are not, and promise to take revenge on Preach and Cochise, thinking that they blamed the whole thing on them. <br /> <br /> This movie is very episodic, but it still works because that's how life is, a series of episodes. Some funny, some sad, some romantic, some bizarre. The movie never gets boring because all the characters are so well touched and realistic, and the situations are all believable and relatable. Like Preach romantically chasing a pretty girl, or a party becoming violent when some asshole decides to start a fight, or deal with a spoiled younger brother. But even when a situation is not personally identifiable, like the guys who pretend to be cops disguised to make money with a prostitute so they could put all their friends in a movie, the sequence is still hilarious. <br /> <br /> 'Cooley High' was the basis for the classic comedy of the '70s' What's Happenin!' which aired on the ABC of 1976-1979. Even though the show is more famous for the character Rerun, he is not in this movie, nor is there any character remotely similar to him. The mood of this show was very broad, but still funny. 'Cooley High' humor is truer to life and therefore more fun. <br /> <br /> In addition, the soundtrack is wonderful. Classical songs from that period by Diana Ross and The Supremes, The Temptations, Martha and Vandellas and Smokey Robinson play throughout the film, increasing the jovial and exuberant tone of the film.
