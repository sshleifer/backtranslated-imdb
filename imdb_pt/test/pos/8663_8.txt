A bus leaves an unnamed man outside a Standard Oil gas station in the middle of nowhere. We never learn where the bus came from, or why it is in it, or who it is. Why is he the only passenger? Is he a prisoner? Is he the "annoying man" referred to in the title of the film? Did he die and went to heaven or to hell? Like our man, we do not stand a chance to stop and think. He is received by a doorman and taken to an indefinite city. From day one, all choices are made for him. An apartment was rented, a job was found, an office was assigned. In fact, your life is not totally different from life in the virtual reality of corporate cubicles and suburban condos. Women are ruthless, dinners are a drag, office jobs suck. But some pieces do not fit the puzzle. Silent mufflers and gray dresses roam the streets. Are they some kind of paramedic or the secret police? And why are there no children? Is the story still in the real world? Whenever we think we are getting some answers, new mysteries unfold. "The Bothersome Man" leaves you relieved that it's over, wanting more. I hope they get into a computer game soon.
