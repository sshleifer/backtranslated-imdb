"The Thing" by John Carpenter is undoubtedly one of the best horror films ever made. Unfortunately, as with most of Carpenter's films, it is also one of the most underrated films being criticized by critics shortly after being released for a reason that is almost pathetic. It seems that at the time people were impressed by the idea of ​​the "good" alien. An idea generated after the success of "I.T." And the very thought that a movie dealing with aliens could deviate from that idea was considered heresy. Human ignorance is really a scary thing, people need to judge the movies by what they are not by what they want them to be. <br /> <br /> "The thing" itself is an interesting study on human paranoia as members of a movie. The North American Antarctic base discovers the presence of an alien being (referenced throughout the film only as a "thing") capable of imitating any form of life. Not knowing who the creature may or may not be, we see how each character reacts to the situation. There is no mass hysteria or panic, only a slow and gradual descent into chaos, as more and more people become ... not completely human. <br /> <br /> Carpenter manages to elevate this movie to something much more than its average Sci-Fi / horror. There is no "what's behind you?" jumping moments here. Instead of relying on an intense atmosphere of pre-apocalyptic mistrust and despair coupled with some well-balanced moments of visual terror, without any small thanks to Rob Bottin's stunning creature effects, he gives us an experience that is not matched by many others horror movies. <br /> <br /> Instead of just playing facts and tangle elements in our face, Carpenter offers us a much more gradual and delicate approach. By implying a sense of mystery, it gives the viewer enough freedom to interpret what happened in certain scenes, while giving enough plot to those who do not like interpretations so much in movies. <br /> <br /> Ennio Morricone works all the way. It is a minimalist and depressing sound that fits perfectly into the overall tone of the film. Although I've always wondered how it would have sounded if Carpenter (he's known to compose all the OSTs of his movies except this one) did that? Characters not yet so deeply developed are still memorable thanks to the good performance of the actors, especially Kurt Russel, who plays the apathetic helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady It is worth noting how his character transforms through the film. From his inconsiderate attitude "do not give a ..." in the beginning, to that of a unifier and leader of the group of men who try to fight "the thing". But even with that being said, there are no fake heroes here, there are no moments of "death laugh" and certainly there is any kind of comic relief, the film retains its atmosphere from the first scene to the last scene. . Speaking of which, here again Carpenter maintains his tradition of creating a powerful end. <br /> <br /> Quarter of a century after its release "The Thing" does not look dated. And with the increasing use of computer-generated effects, it seems even stronger because it shows the work of life and the dedication of humans rather than computers. Combined with its aperture to analyze, it gives the viewer a lot more reasons to watch it for a second, third, fourth or ... time. A work of terror that will never be forgotten.
