I use "Princess Racoon" (to give the film its English title not very accurate) as a test for my friends' sense of humor. Either it leaves them cold and bewildered - as several other commentators have clearly pointed out on this site - or they result in double laughs, incredibly huge smiles and occasional sighs of admiration. <br /> <br /> Laughter comes from the movie. a blend of contemporary-style parodies. The targets include a bouquet of classic Japanese and Western theatrical forms, from Kabuki to Late Shakespearian and Spanish Renaissance Renaissance fantasy; the naive emptiness of the modern American and European musical, as witnessed by a series of random tap and rap songs and some very funny banal lyrics, all choreographed with an amorous "amateur" cliché; Japanese anime and live-action cliché samurais; magnificent Buddhist ritual; and the arrogant sweetness of the Viennese operetta. I have not laughed too loudly with this kind of film since Ken Russell's outrageous musical deconstruction in "The Boyfriend." Smiles come from the clever textual subversion of the Japanese legend, told in a traditional 5-act structure reminiscent of the 17th-century masterpiece Chikamatsu. As in his work, the narrative is advanced in a mixture of music, recitative, high level poetry and low comic relief - here the grimer of the incompetent ninja, ostrich, by peasants under the illusion that he is a tanuki raccoon human appearance. All this somehow holds together, and even more remarkably manages to engage the observer's emotions through the confusion of cultural references. <br /> <br /> In fact, "Princess Racoon" wears her cultural costume with seductive lightness, and that is where the gasps of astonishment enter. Visually - once again, as with Russell's masterpiece - the film is a delight, a profusion of colors with its sceneries scanned from classic Japanese images of canvases and prints, exaggerated costumes and stage sets, mixed with a few sequences of breathtaking live action in summer camps and seashores. You will love it or hate it, but it is no use punishing chalk for being cheese; and "Princess Racoon" represents, above all, a funny and affectionate immorality of our contemporary cultural emptiness, both in the East and in the West. Angry!
