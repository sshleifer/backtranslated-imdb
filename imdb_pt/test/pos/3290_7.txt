Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security company owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton company is in financial trouble because, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to the owner of a rival company (Jim Bacchus). It is not Brian, for he is a loyal and faithful servant and a good inventor. But Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because the beautiful daughter of Norton, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a crush on Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for courting her. However, Brian comes with a great safety device. It's called CHOMPS, which means canine domestic security system. The device, which looks like a dog, is actually a computer-controlled animal with the ability to knock down walls and emit siren sounds to catch thieves. The rival owner sends two spies (one is the Red Buttons) to learn the details of the new invention. Will CHOMPS save Norton security? This is a fun old school family movie good and clean entertainment. CHOMPS is, of course, a true dog, played by the adorable and talented Benji. In fact, Benji has a dueling role, since Brian also has a "real" dog named Rascal. Just watching this puppy in action is sheer joy as he is able to climb walls, pull trucks and operate knobs to catch the bad guys. The human cast is also very good, with all giving lively performances that are contagious. Costumes, scenarios and production values ​​are also good. Although you may have trouble locating the movie, it would be worth the effort to secure a view for your loved ones closer. CHOMPS is a wonderful and healthy diversion from the problems of the world.
