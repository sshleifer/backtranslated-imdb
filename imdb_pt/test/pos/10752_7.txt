For those of you looking for the crazy stunts that characterized a Harold Lloyd comedy, this is not the movie for you. What The Cat-Paw gives us is an interesting and atypical character for Lloyd who was trying to establish himself in the sound. <br /> <br /> For me, the closest match of the movie to Lloyd's character is Peter Sellers in Being There. Despite all the education that Lloyd received in dealing with the world, he could have been raised in isolation as Sellers. <br /> <br /> But where he was educated he was the son of a missionary in China and I do not know how much Christianity he and his family could teach the Chinese, but young Harold learned the wisdom of the Chinese philosopher Lin Po, whom he constantly quotes like a fortune cookie aphorism. It turns out that Lin Po turns out to be a wise guy. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Samuel Lloyd's father, Samuel S. Hinds, decided that his son needs some education in the modern world of 20th century America and sends him back to be the pastor's guest of the local church sponsoring the mission. The pastor there is the perennial candidate of the "reform" movement of that town of Stockport. But as soon as Lloyd arrives and the pastor dies. <br /> <br /> Now the reform movement is a farce and the pastor is a patsy of political bosses who need a straw opponent in every election. They decide that Lloyd can only be a better scapegoat than the guy who just died. <br /> <br /> Of course, as with these types of films, scapegoats are not such an easy proposition. In fact, Lloyd constantly quoting Lin Po, the way Charlie Chan used to dispense wisdom proves that the opponent is very good for the thugs who run Stockport. In addition, Lloy d gains the admiration of Una Merkel, as cynical as Jean Arthur was in Mr. Deeds and Mr. Smith. The Cat's-Paw is still a good political satire, though it has not established Harold Lloyd as a big comedy name, as it was in silent films. A good cast of players was selected by director Sam Taylor led by George Barbier, who plays a political boss who discovers Lloyd and actually proves to have a bit of honesty in him.
