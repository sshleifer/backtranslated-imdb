* This review will probably have SPOILERS !! I checked the box SPOILERS ONLY IN CASE, BUT CAN NOT SPOILERS, BUT BE AWARE OF ANYTHING IF IT SAYS SOMETHING YOU CAN CONSIDER SPOILER AND I DO NOT! * Wow ... best game since Super Mario 64. I have this On the first day it was released, and before I received it, I joined some game sites to see their ratings (yes, they already reviewed it before leaving ), and I was shocked. I was expecting something like Sunshine because lately all Mario games are getting worse and worse. But this totally hit the other games. The scores in this game even beat Halo 3! It's just incredible. <br /> <br /> HISTORY: Not the best, Mario games are never known for their plots, and this is not really a big differential. Bowser once again kidnaps Peach but this time invades the Kingdom of Mushrooms at a festival celebrated once every century and picks up a flying saucer and shoots lasers at the ground and then they put anchors on the ground and pluck the castle and its foundation into space sideral <br /> <br /> GRAPHICS: Absolutely gorgeous, the best graphics on Wii so far. The effects of water are really good too, if you see the water, it seems so real because of the effects they put on it. <br /> <br /> MUSIC: Simply amazing, the music in this game is orchestrated. Not all of this, but even those who are not orchestrated still sound very good. A lot of fun, keeps you wanting to play more and more, and for me, since I usually tend to get very frustrated with games if I die a lot, I mean, I'm definitely not the only one, but this game for me does not have much. Now he still did, but not to the point like Mario 64, where I totally freaked out and ended up shutting down the game because it got me crazy, this one never did it. DIFFICULTY: There are two types of difficulty, because you can technically win the game with only 60 stars, which I think is a bit easy, but to win the game 100%, you have to win 120 , as always, and this mission is much more difficult, but at the same time still very fun. <br /> <br /> DURATION: Good length, definitely not too short. It took me about 15-16 hours to hit with only 60 stars but 120 took me over like 45-50 hours. Now I did not play that much, I played a lot one day first, then the next two days only a few hours a day, then the next two days I played all day. For me, I think the search for 60 stars was a bit short, so if you want a long game, I suggest you get all of them. <br /> <br /> PRESENTATION: Now the cinematic scenes of this film are superb. The way they are, it looks a lot like something I'd watch in theaters. These are the best cinematic scenes in any Mario game so far. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: This game is definitely a great game, and I advise you not to wait until Christmas, get it as fast as possible. This game is also a good mix of old and new, you will have some levels of sidescroller where you move only side by side, or up and down because they will change in gravity, but even the music has some old classics in him. So this game seems to be a masterpiece. For me, it's my all time favorite Mario game, but others may disagree. But it's still a great game. I recommend all players who want to have fun in a game to achieve this.
