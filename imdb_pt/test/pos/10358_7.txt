I saw this black and white noir comedy yesterday at the London Film Festival. Structurally, it has been compared to Pulp Fiction, but perhaps it is closer to the structure of Lovers Dogs and the more relaxed mood of Kevin Smith's Clerks. Four floors intersect at a French motorway restaurant. The first sticker makes Franck (Edouard Baer) get in the way of dinner. The waitress, Suzie (Anna Mouglalis) pays off and tells her story. The second has two incompetent henchmen, Leon (Bouli Lanners) and Paul (Serge Lariviere) lead a teenager from their rich family. Unfortunately for them, she is suicidal and her family does not seem to want her back. The third is a dialogue between two aging rock stars who meet in the restaurant (Alain Bashung and Arno playing). The final part is about four former criminals who smuggled their former partner out of the hospital to visit their old hideout that was already turned into ?? the dinner. An 'epilogue' returns to Franck and Suzie to complete their story (not really an epilogue, another conclusion). <br /> <br /> The structure does not really work. The stories are not sufficiently intertwined like in Pulp Fiction. Dinner is also not crucial to the action of at least two of the stories in the way the car accident was crucial in the four stories of Amores Perros. The quality of individual stories varies. The story of the hideout is a cute idea, with some good jokes, but it does not come out; and the rock star reunion is meaningless and bland. On the other hand, the story of the kidnapping is hilarious, although its connection to the restaurant is tenuous. The most balanced and successful story is that of Franck and Suzie. <br /> <br /> This movie is not totally successful, but it has moments of interest and hilarity. I look forward to seeing more of Samuel Benchetrit's work from the writer / director.
