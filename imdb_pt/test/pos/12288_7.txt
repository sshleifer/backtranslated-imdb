This is not a movie is a clever, witty and often moving film. It's a retrospective of a failed relationship between Michael Connor (Michael Leydon Campbell) and his strange Irish girlfriend Grace Mckenna. Michael in his luck decides to make a documentary repeating his whole relationship and what went wrong. He explores his friendship with an actor he met at the gym Nadia (Nadia Dajani), who he starts playing Grace. The concept of this film is very original. Michaels' relationship is shown at all points, be it high or low. Michael Leydon Campbell takes a fantastic performance that makes you want to help him find Grace. If the fact that most of the characters get great performances, except the puzzles. The puzzles are needed to move the plot along, but it seems very surreal to exist in a cafe. Their monologues are often exaggerated and meaningless. This is proven when he says, "Out of this chaos, we are all trying to create order, and out of order, meaning." But in reality there is no such thing as meaning, something only makes sense if we make it have meaning. > <br /> The comment saves this movie. The comment is made in vain of This is Spinal Tap and Michael and his brother explain the problems they had in making the film. Michael offers a very funny self-conscious comment that makes some very good laughs. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would give this movie a 7/10.
