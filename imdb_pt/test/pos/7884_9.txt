Although I saw this movie about 4 years ago, long before I started commenting on IMDb, I decided to review it now, which is unusual for me, since before I reviewed something right after seeing it. What can I say? Well, the best performance is that of the late Peter Boyle as the title character who, after discovering that a man is killing his daughter's drug dealer boyfriend, wants to relate to himself as a Madison Avenue executive who has not nothing common with conservative Joe, of very low class. In fact, there are lots of funny Joe scenes at this guy's party, making clever comments. Oh, and it should be noted that the actress who plays the daughter they are looking for after she disappeared from the hospital after an overdose of some drugs is none other than Susan Sarandon making her movie debut! This was a pretty blunt film for the time it was made (late 1960s and early 1970s) and it was a compelling work by screenwriter Norman Wexler (later on Saturday Night Fever) and director John G. Avildsen (later Save the Tiger, Rocky and The Karate Kid). Surely the finale is still a blow after all these years! Highly recommended for anyone curious about the counterculture of the time. Q. Among the cultural artifacts seen here are a Raggedy Ann doll, a box of Ritz crackers, a bottle of Heinz ketchup and, unique at the time, a Nixon poster asking, "Would you buy a used car from this man?"
