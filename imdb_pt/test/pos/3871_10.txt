Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he's been to! I love watching it !! I was 10 years old (1979) when I first saw him. I look forward to each and every one in which he will be acting. I hope someday I can see you in person. He is very hypnotic and mysterious and this voice is dominant and strong! he is very attractive, even now at age 65 he is absolutely gorgeous !!!! In my opinion, he's the greatest actor I've ever seen! I loved him in "Dracula" (along with many other girls out there) and in "god created woman", "house of D", "Jason and the Argonauts" and many more. I thought he was great !!!!!! I can not wait to see you in "good night and good luck"
