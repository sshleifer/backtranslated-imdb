Okay, of course, this movie is a bit cheesy. It's hard to catch characters from comic books and put them into movies with some credibility (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, anyone?), But that's very difficult. I've never read comics, but that does not matter, I suppose. I judge a movie primarily because of its merits, not if it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea. (Unless it's a movie based on a true story, it requires at least some attempt at truth and accuracy.) So why would I give this movie a reasonably high rating? Because it tries. He tries very hard. In my book, this makes it a fair attempt at a fun movie. <br /> <br /> Many movies were made with vampire themes being the main focus. It seems that everyone has their opinion on the tradition of vampires, be it the cross, the silver, the garlic, the aversion to the sunlight, whatever. Some of these ideas are included here. The plot is familiar ... a group of vampires conspire to dominate the world, with one person (mostly) in their path. Blade (Wesley Snipes) lives with the sole purpose of destroying the vampire masses, who slowly, but surely, have moved into the world and share with mankind. For the most part, the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist around them. Vampires even picked up family members, people who aspire to be vampires and do the dirty work of vampires to show how they are worthy of being "turned." <br /> <br /> Now that I think about it, there are many elements of this movie similar to the plot of Roddy Piper's movie, They Live. A hidden enemy, a hidden group of people plotting against them, the fight to save mankind ... all of this is present in Blade as well. <br /> <br /> The performance is not the best here. Snipes is, at best, only slightly better than some of his other roles; N'Bushe Wright, a relatively newbie, is not so bad; Kris Kristofferson is forgettable as Blade's helper (he is Blade, which Chip is for the Punisher). Stephen Dorff does the best job of all the cast here, as the vampire "head" you just love to hate. <br /> <br /> I do not know, but I loved the special effects of this movie. From blood-soaked vampire rave to the inevitable fight at the end of the movie, the special effects are not at all bad. Surely there is enough blood and blood to go around, but after all, this is a vampire movie, right? The various forms and types of weaponry that the Blade uses are quite unique, and are generally not used in contemporary action films. Snipes has more talent with an ornate sword than with, say, a machine gun. In addition, there is much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone up. (Unless, of course, you're Indiana Jones.) Overall, this is not the greatest action movie of all time, but it's not bad either. As a bonus, the music track and soundtrack are cool too. Tell me, in what other movies can you hear super drum'n'bass like Source Direct or Photek?! My rating: 8/10
