I tuned in to this movie because there was nothing left to watch. I was immediately sucked in by the characters. <br /> <br /> Robin Tunney is nothing less than spectacular in this movie. Her portrait of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100% believable. Actually, this kind of thing is not easy to do. She pulls it fantastically. <br /> <br /> We know that at the beginning of this movie will end tragically, but you can not take your eyes off it. The characters do stupid things, but unlike most Hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot demands, these people do stupid things because they are not right in the head - and the things they do are completely consistent with their characters. /> <br /> This is just a great example of film making IMHO. Great writing, great acting, great direction. A movie for people who think that movies can be more than meaningless entertainment.
