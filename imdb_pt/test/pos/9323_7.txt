Musical bios are all cut from the same fabric. Hopefuls fight, succeed and finally win the girl, but this - a life of Irish tenor, Chauncey Olcott / Jack Chancellor - is more in favor than the usual pitfalls. It has great charm and great sincerity and is played beautifully by all concerned. Dennis Morgan is well in the lead as Arlene Dahl as his love interest. The supporting performance of Andrea King as Lillian Russell is far better than Alice Faye's biographical performance in the film dedicated to her career. William Frawley is playing as the aging tenor champion, William Scanlon, and Sara Allgood is adorable as Olcott's mother. George Tobias, Ben Blue and Alan Hale give good support. There are more than 25 songs (a real treasure): Come Down My Evening Star; The blue eyes of my Nellie; You tell me your dream; Wait until the sun shines, Nellie; Are you going to love me in December? By The Light Of The Silver Moon; Minstrel Days; Polly Wolly Doodle; Natchez and Robert E. Lee; Miss Lindy Lou; If I'm dreaming; Rose of Killarney; Shake hands; A little girl; A little piece of heaven; Maria; Sweet Innescarren; Tiddely One; When Irish eyes are smiling; Mother Machree; The Kerey Fair; Room in my heart; My Wild Irish Rose. <br /> <br /> Although the film deserved only one title for the Oscar - and deservedly, it also deserved nods for Art Direction and Costume Design - sumptuous and adorable in Technicolor. <br /> <br /> The reasons why this is not in the video may be due to the large amount of time spent inside the Minstrel Show atmosphere - at least a quarter of the film - with a large amount of material politically INCORRECT for the public of today. It is historically accurate, however. <br /> <br /> This is a real gem and worth a look. Leaves one with a warm glow.
