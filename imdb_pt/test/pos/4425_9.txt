Then again, I like Rachael Ray. She's fun, sweet, fresh and a joy to watch. I have to change pretty much everything she does as I'm a vegetarian ... but it's great to see her with a show that shows more of her personality. After all, she's a television personality. I think it's cool that she's so inviting to her fans and still seems to be realistic. The studio audience seems to be quite small, but this only adds to the cozier atmosphere. Some people have posted that the show sucks. I think it depends on your own interpretation of her and hers. If you notice the first episodes of 30 Minute Meals, you will see a personality completely different from that of the last years. I'm sure she'll find her comfort zone with this show too. Good luck Rachael!
