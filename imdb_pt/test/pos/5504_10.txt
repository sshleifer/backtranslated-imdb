I think this movie is the most misunderstood movie in Jerry Lewis's career. It's a bit slow start, but after it starts it's very funny & Jerry's use of irony like never before in his previous films ... ie who's in the store, The Nutty Professor, etc., the idea, is clear, it's a Dirty Dozen hoax, instead of having soldiers on death row do a suicide mission like that movie, you have 4, 4-f's and 2 tag alongs. Including the former Centerfielder all-stars of L.A. Dodgers, Willie Davis as Linc! HILARIOUS! I love this movie!
