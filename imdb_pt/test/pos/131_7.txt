A very interesting look at some characters from India's burgeoning middle class. Although India is rapidly modernizing, its culture is not following. This film involves the patriarchal society, where women are still not truly free citizens. A land of arranged marriages, men who play with lovers with total impunity and women who must tolerate all this will eventually fail. I was impressed by Nandita Das, who was quite attractive, and played her character with total seriousness. But I was even more impressed with Shabana Azmi, who I understand is a long-time Bollywood game. Her quiet beauty and discreet psychic suffering were excellent. The lesbian subtext of this film has never been particularly erotic and never exciting. (Shit!) It pays to look for those interested in very different cultures.
