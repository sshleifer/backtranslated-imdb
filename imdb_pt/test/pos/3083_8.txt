Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody of Mel Brooks. He has the mission to imitate the legacy of Robin Hood and the film that deals with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood. He is looking for some good men who will join him in his quest to bring down the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis). Tracey Ullman co-stars as Prince John's personal witch, Latrine, who has his eye on the sheriff. <br /> <br /> Will Robin find his men happy? How far will the Prince throw his weight in his father's absence? Why does the sheriff hate Robin so much? To find out you will need to watch ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS !! Check out the hilarious cameo of Dom De Luise, who plays the Duke of Jersey. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
