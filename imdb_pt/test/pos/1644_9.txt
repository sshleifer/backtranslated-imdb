A real highlight episode of Season 1 is what Ice is. An articulate location, claustrophobic conditions and an overall sense of paranoia hovering in the freezing air makes this a compulsory episode of the first season. Former occupants of the station Mulder, Scully and four others will kill or kill themselves. A virus is bringing a killer assault and is responsible for causing deadly paranoia and fear. Mulder and Scully actually begin to question each other's sanity. The tension is so high. writers have to get big credit for creating this kind of scenario where the atmosphere is so tense that Mulder and Scully come into conflict in such a direct way
