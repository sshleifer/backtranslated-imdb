No, this is not an Ed Wood movie. "Angora Love" is the last silent film by Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. The end of an era! In the 1920s, Laurel & Hardy left a real mark on the silent film genre with movies that are still popular and are being watched and shown regularly these days. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that this movie is not, though. among the best. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie looks good and is good. The boys join a goat this time, which, of course, leads to problems and for us some hilarious situations to be observed. However, at the same time it is extremely silly and totally unbelievable to see the boys doing comedy stuff with a goat. Most of the movie jokes still work well, but the movie never really gets hilarious or memorable. The comedy and the story really miss sometimes and is mostly simple and predictable. <br /> <br /> Of course it's still good and fun enough to watch the fans, but it's still a bit disappointing at Laurel & Hardy. 7/10
