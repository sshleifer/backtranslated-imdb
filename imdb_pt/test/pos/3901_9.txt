This was a fascinating film, one that really attracted me. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and he does a wonderful performance. His great sympathy, along with how his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself waiting tense for the whole house of cards to collapse around him (and by extension myself, as his confidant and silent witness). It took several minutes for me to relax when the movie ended, I was so caught up in it. <br /> <br /> Good performances around too, not just with Macy. Arkin was very good, just like Cromwell (he was surprisingly ferocious). In short, I recommend this movie to all Macy fans and / or the murder mystery. But you may want to prepare to feel a little guilty.
