My sister, dad and I really enjoyed D & D and one night we were surfing on Netflix looking for a movie to watch when it showed up. We thought about experimenting and I ended up almost laughing. The writing and acting in this movie is so amazing! Smart characters, great interaction and hilarious moments kept us in stitches all the time. I love this movie! It may not make much sense to anyone who does not know Dungeons & Dragons, but it's still a good movie anyway. This only serves to show that films do not need an astronomical budget and that great actors are a success. Check it out if you want a good and clean comedy.
