Reading the other reviews here on IMDB, I had very high expectations before seeing 'Angels of the Universe'. I was not disappointed, and giving the film an 8, I would say I can justify that note. <br /> <br /> The film has an incredible performance, especially by the main person, Pall. Supporting actors are also doing a very good job, such as the patients in the mental institution, the parents and the brothers of Pall. The music also deserves to be mentioned, supporting the film everywhere, giving depth and feeling. <br /> <br /> Although the film is very Scandinavian, it does not leave out some humor and has a kind of objective authorship on the life of Pall. . Still, if you want to see a cheesy comedy or something light, this is not for you. It's a story about people with mental problems, about how they're being treated in society - but most of all, a story about Pall. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all moviegoers. It's one of the best movies ever to come out of Iceland, if not from Scandinavia.
