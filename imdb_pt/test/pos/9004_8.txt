Like most sports movies that have appeared in the past, this movie is similar in terms of respect, which is based on facts. What sets this movie apart is that it's about a rugby team, a sport that many Americans are not familiar with. Leaving this aside, this film is a very satisfying part of the film noir. It reminds me of "We Are Marshall," but with a smaller budget and an independent movie feel. It's a great effort by director Ryan Little to bring us a story about a teenage rebel played by Sean Farris (Never Back Down) as Rick Penning, who finds himself in a strange place, on and off the field. Despite a few holes of plot lines, this movie has heart, rewarding each of its viewers with good characters that we can identify. Also good performances by supporting actors Gary Cole as coach Larry Gelwix and Neal McDonough as coach Penning (Ricks father). I felt going through a lot of different emotions watching movie, in the end, I was left with a sense of faith in humanity and a hope for the future of my children, especially if there are coaches out there like Gelwix.
