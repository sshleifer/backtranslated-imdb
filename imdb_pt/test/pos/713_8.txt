An interesting and involved movie about a "lifer" just trying to live his days peacefully. Elements of the main character appear in the later films of Michael Mann, like Thief (1981), Heat (1995) and so on. You can see this at the UCLA Instructional Media Lab - one of the only places in the country that has copies readily available to the public. It's great!
