After reading more than my fair share of comments to a vast number of different films, I noticed a certain trend, people judge harshly about what is expected to see. I think if you get into an open-minded movie without expecting anything right than you will have better feelings about it then if you try and watch but have pre-created patterns you want to achieve. <br /> <br /> I try not to be hypocritical. I watched this movie with a very clean slate and open mind, and I was very pleased. Since it is not a mainstream or award winning title for this subject I was not quite sure what to expect, but in all truth I liked it a lot more than Ninja Scroll. Lovely animation, deep story and always cheerful ninja hack-n-slashing have combined extremely well with one of my all time favorite animes. <br /> <br /> I'm not promising you'll like it, but just give it a try and you can leave with a pleasant surprise.
