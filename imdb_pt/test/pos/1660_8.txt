American expatriate Jules Dassin makes an award-winning French gangster film. The plot involves Tony the Stephanois, a thug who just got out of jail, who takes his bunch of thieves to a $ 240 million robbery. Unfortunately, his ex-wife's relationship with a notorious gangster named Grutter, an Italian cracker named Cesar with a weakness for women, and the mistakes of his own friend Jo make the victorious assault turn into a bloody race against time while Grutter Stops Jo's son is held hostage by money in the typical "never paid crime" form of tragedy. The rififi of the title is explained in a song that basically means slang for violence and sex, and the full title, "Du rififi chez les hommes" means more or less "Some disobedient in the house of the men, "which is pretty much where the fatal flaw of the characters happens. Leave it to a gangster movie to put most of the emphasis on women's mistakes, but this time Jo's wife has the last laugh (if you could call it laughing) when she predicts, "You're all going to kill each one of them. others." The characters are not the nicest and the women are mostly weak, but Dassin still builds an extremely well-thought-out thriller while they perform an assault that demands maximum silence, hides the products and then tries to survive. which basically becomes a cat-and-mouse cross-country game. In the mix are some amazing photographs and a special attention to detail in the editing, leading to a rhythm and visual experience that exaggerates the generic plot. It's not easy to see why this is a classic, it's also easy to see why he is among the top 250 in IMDb: it's suspenseful, visually magnificent, full of sex and violence, and retains that sleek gangster attitude that we shoot fans like too much .
