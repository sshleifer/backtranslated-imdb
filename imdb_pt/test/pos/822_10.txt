This movie was made with a relatively small budget (10-20 million dollars?), With almost no promotion from its distributors. I only knew about it because I'm a fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme and I always check out his latest movies in the hope that they are at least watchable and with the exception of some real turkeys (Derailed, Second In Command) they are. This movie has an easy-to-follow storyline and Van Damme does a good and comical performance, but the film owes its full credence to the fight scenes involving Van Damme, Scott Adkins and the end of them together. The editing work and camera for most of the movie is pretty awful, but Isaac Florentine can shoot a good fight scene. I'm also happy that Van Damme has been acting better lately (in hell, waking from death, to death), but with good acting came less martial arts. In The Shepherd, Van Damme proves that he still has it.
