If you are interested in learning more about this kind of thing happening in modern civilization, there is an excellent book called "Outlaw Seas" or "The Outlaw Sea", and describes, in story after story, how these things happen. The illegality of the high seas is a reality for several reasons. One, many of the world's freighters are of questionable record (nationality) and it is difficult to enforce international laws when shipowners do not have an office in a real country. Two, many lines of ships employ crews from poor third world countries. Teams are often (as illegal immigrant workers) threatened and intimidated to comply with questionable or illegal practices. Three, there is often a language barrier, not only between officers and crew, but also among the crew themselves. The crew is rewarded for compliance and silence. Four, once committing an illegal act, ships are able to hide in sight with little more than a new coat of paint. Anyway, it's a fascinating read. Horrifying story, great movie. Does anyone else realize how HBO seems to make the best and most important movies? Hollywood has difficulty launching Oscar-nominated films in a given year, so that several of the top 5 nominees usually come from Britain. Jerry Bruckheimer = the end of quality cinema. <br /> <br /> I loved Sean Pertwee's completely evil performance. I, too, as always, loved Omar Epps.
