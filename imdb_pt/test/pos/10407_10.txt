This analysis contains some small, but significant, spoilers. <br /> <br /> <br /> I just saw my copy of Noroi ... <br /> <br />. ..and it was great! This may sound extravagant, but several times during the movie I forgot that it was not real XD The acting is compelling, although the acting of Masafumi Kobayashi (interpreting himself, I think ...) seems a bit cheesy at times. Marika Matsumoto (Yuka in Rinne by Takashi Shimizu) seemed to change levels of credibility throughout the film: sometimes she is REALLY good, so the next moment she is really extravagant (especially in the exorcism of the end and subsequent reopening. <br /> <br /> A character who was ridiculous at first was Mr. Hori, a man covered in aluminum foil believing that "ectoplasmic worms" are coming to eat everyone.It provides unintended comic relief at the beginning (acting like a victim <br /> <br /> The plot was very interesting and really made me think about how everything is linked. There are some things that are not really explained (like a mass suicide in a park in Tokyo and where the boy came Kagutaba reincarnated, but everything else ended up working. The end has been one of the most disconcerting, if not the scariest, sequences that I've had the pleasure of witnessing. <br /> All in all, Noroi is very fu A way to spend 2 hours and the new Hong Kong R3 DVD offers excellent picture and sound (the most important is the English SUBTITLES- Engrish free!) for a great experience in J-Horror. I strongly recommend picking it up.
