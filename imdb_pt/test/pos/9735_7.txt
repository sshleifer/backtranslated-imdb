I do not understand all these bad reviews. I believe this movie was one of the best in the Puppet Master series. Being done with a low budget, one can understand why the special effects and acting were not spectacular, but they were not completely horrible. <br /> <br /> Greg Sestero brought a lot of charisma to the role of Andr√© Toulon. He has a lot of potential and I hope to see him more soon. And although cinematography was not great, and there was a minimum of violence and violence, this movie was a lot of fun. I am a big Puppet Master fan and grew up to expect blood and blood from the films of this series, but I can say that I was never bored during the whole course of watching the Retro Puppet Master. So if you have the opportunity to see this movie, do not automatically consider it unworthy of your time. Give a chance. You may like this.
