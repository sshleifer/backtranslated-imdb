My wife and I love this movie. Smart dialogue, great characters, intelligent plot building. The pace in this movie is non-stop. She could not even get into the kitchen for some snacks. We've never seen Corey Feldman so funny. Taylor Nichols plays a good Fed ... my wife loves him at that HBO show "Married Man". The cast was all strong. The turnaround at the end made us applaud. That's why we give this movie a "Standing O."
