I had the privilege of attending a regional premiere for this, this is one of the funniest British films of all time, the plot is fantastic, focusing on a young girl who involuntarily turns into her ideal man at a computer fair, while also creating a copy of herself that falls in love with him, the film is full of jokes, both visual and auditory, and has a bright and fresh feel, and the acting is of great quality, launched in the UK on 2 July. must go and see !!!
