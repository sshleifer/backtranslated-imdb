I'm like the rest of the fans who love this comedy, I've been waiting for it on DVD. I got this on VHS and got so sick of waiting for a release and worrying that my copy on VHS would ruin the equipment to put it on DVD. The image and sound are excellent to my utter surprise. If anyone wants a copy, send a message to stone_stew@yahoo.co.uk <br /> <br /> and for £ 7.00 I will put it on a DVD, print the DVD and get on the post for you. £ 7.00 just covers my costs and recorded delivery etc with perhaps a little more then I'm not after making money from it, I just like the world to see this gem ignored a comedy. I recently saw a copy of ebay I got over £ 26, amazing. How can they not release this classic? Email for payment details like Check or Paypal etc etc.
