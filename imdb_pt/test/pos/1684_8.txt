Over the many years, there are some movies that go under and hardly anyone sees. <br /> <br /> Choice Conner is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> This little gem played at a few festivals and had a short two-week run in a small theater in West Hollywood, making it all worth around $ 5500. It is now on DVD that I hope many more see it now. <br /> <br /> It is a strange drama of an astute young politician, who influences a very bright person. Boy of 15 years. This politician also has a beautiful nephew (about 17 years old) who befriends the 15 year old boy. <br /> <br /> The paragraph above is a bit vague about what happens, SO is the movie, and this is what I enjoyed, we do not get all the facts, much is left to our own thinking. You will hear the dialogue that makes it logical. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber (Wings) is our politician, his role is somewhat vague, this is another point for the public to ponder <br /> < Alex D.Linz is our 15 year old, He was about 17 years old when they made this movie, but could easily go through the younger ones. He has been in movies and TV since he was a child, He is a very good actor and is quite convincing. <br /> Escher Holloway is the older teenager, this role is his first big part and he is also excellent. <br /> <br /> Now I'm saving the best for the end, the writer / director, <br /> <br /> Luke Eberl is not yet 23 years old. For a first effort a big thumbs up. I hope he as well as our 2 boys have a long career. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (of 4) 86 points (of 100) 8 (of 10)
