For me, North and South (Books I and II) is the last TV series of the 80s. Just seeing all these apparitions was a lot of fun. Gene Kelly, James Stewart, Elisabeth Taylor, Olivia De Havilland, Robert Mitchum and even Johny Cash. No series has come close to this achievement. Have you seen anyone like Lincoln? Dick Smith's prosthesis made Hal Holbrock's performance even stronger. The costumes created, the hang-ups, everything. Of course, nowadays there are excellent and brilliant TV series (Desperate Housewives, Lost, 24), but the North and South was, and still is, one of theirs. Do not miss it. Only David Carradine's portrait of the ultimate villain (you may call him just violent husband) is worth watching. Maybe some characters and situations are too stereotyped, I admit, but the positive sides clearly cast a shadow over them. I'm so happy that it's finally available on DVD in Spain.
