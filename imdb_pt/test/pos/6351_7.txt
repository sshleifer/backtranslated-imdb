A poignant love story reminiscent of "Mood for Love." Drawing heavily on Chinese poetry and how this is used by people from the East to communicate feelings to each other, the story focuses on a teacher who wants both to be a model teacher as well as a good husband and father. A senior student is very attracted to him. As the story unfolds, we see the emotions beneath the surface in their 20-year marriage and how it deals with the moral dilemmas they face. A beautiful and moving story.
