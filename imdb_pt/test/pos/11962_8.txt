Thus begins "One Crazy Summer," the evil twin of "Better off dead ..". How can any movie be bad when the opening lines are sung by David Lee Roth? <br /> <br /> This movie is a total blast. Pairing again John Cusack with Curtis Armstrong, but this time adding Bobcat Goldwaith to the mix has great funny results. Hyperactive Bobcat hits the nerve of everyone around, Curtis "Ak Ak" is the son of a military crazed with pacifist tendencies and Demi Moore (with natural breasts ... wow!) As the love interest, once again, chronically depressed Cusack <br /> <br /> The story is very simple. The laughter is there, but both Savage Steve Holland movies have a certain quality to them ... they're funny, but they're also sweet. The scene in which Curtis finds an exploded doll on the target practice beach and begins to wonder how a little girl could not sleep was stupid, funny, and touching. The animation used is quite surreal. "The Boat" is hysterical (complete with Watsamatta U. sail and plush Odie doll). Overall a fun movie, though not as good as "Best dead ..."
