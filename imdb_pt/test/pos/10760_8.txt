From the opening scenes of FIERCE PEOPLE (an interplay of tribal customs as photographed by the anthropologist father of young narrator Finn Earl, demonstrating why this South American tribe of Ishkanani is so fierce), the direction of the film is nebulous: we are watching a somber comedy about how to compare life on the streets of New York to uncivilized people, or is that a message movie of a more serious intent? But as history unfolds, this fine line between entertainment and philosophical impact becomes ever clearer. Griffin Dunne's directing of Dirk Wittenborn's adaptation of his novel may be somewhat careless at times, since it deviates from the rational development of the plot, but in the end there is a final strong enough impact to repair the holes he has created. <br /> <br /> Our narrator Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) lives with his cocaine-addicted / coca-obsessed mother, Liz (Diane Lane) in New York, waiting for the summer to join her anthropologist father on a (a father he knows only from letters and videos), when a drug craze abruptly changes their lives: one of Liz Ogden Osborne's wealthy clients (Donald Sutherland) rescues the family and takes them to his property. ten acres, the epitome of wealth and power. In exchange for being Osborne's private masseuse, Liz and Finn can live in the mansion with the "filthy and rich" Osbornes - daughter Ms. Langley (Elizabeth Perkins) and grandchildren Bryce (Chris Evans) and Maya (Kristen Stewart). Osborne and his doctor lead Liz on the way to drying and Finn joins Osborne and his grandchildren, and despite the disparity between the poor and the wealthy, the living situation works - for a while. Incidents occur to alter feelings and Finn is attacked and raped by a masked assailant, a turning point for the film and Finn's vision of the Osborne family. Osborne reveals his past to Finn and together they discover the truth about Finn's disturbing incident - and also about the ferocious disease of the wealthy class. <br /> <br /> The film uses many clips of tribal activity during the film, drawing some disturbing parallels to some of the more challenging scenes. For this viewer that works well, but when the director decides to put the tribal guys across the regalia within the context of Osborne's estate, the concept seems artificial, as if the public had to be forced to "catch it." The various subplots between the maid Jilly (Paz de la Huerta) and Finn and the introduction of a retarded and obese chalk artist Whitney (Branden Williams) pressure the credibility to emphasize the line between the rich and the 'lower class', but the Sutherland, Lane and Yelchin's performances are strong enough to make us forgive the film's lapses. It's not a great movie, but one with many decent ideas scattered across the screen of a project that often seems lost in its fight for direction. Grady Harp
