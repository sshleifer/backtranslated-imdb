The inspiration for the films "Naked Gun" launches Leslie Nielsen - who only recently began to make comedy - as the incompetent but heroic Frank Drebin, always having to solve an absurd case. Like "Plane!" and the films based on the series, humor is based on gags in the style of Mel Brooks and silly comments (ie the "yes is" remarks), coupled with the fact that Nielsen remains very serious despite the absurdity around him . And, of course, the final picture, where something keeps moving. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the show has had only six episodes. At least it spawned the movies. You can not go wrong with Leslie Nielsen in these types of roles. I suspect they all had fun filming it. Really funny. Before "Airplane!", Leslie Nielsen starred in films such as "Forbidden Planet", "Harlow" and "The Poseidon Adventure". Still in 1987, he co-starred in "Nuts" opposite Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfuss. But since the first film "Naked Gun" has been all comedy all the time.
