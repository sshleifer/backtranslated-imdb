Even if you are a fan of Jean Rollin's idiosyncratic work, you will be taken aback by this exceptional incursion into the realm of science fiction. For the first time, there is not a single vampire in diaphanous dress in sight! True to tradition, the budget proved too tight to fully realize the director's vision. However, this is amply compensated for by his obvious love of genre film, dedication to his craft, and sheer ingenuity. Jean-Claude Couty's atmospheric cinematography takes full advantage of the presentiment sites and Philippe Bréjean (a / k / a "Gary Sandeur") contributes an astonishing soundtrack that fortunately does not resemble any of the sentimental things he composed for hardcore. Filmed in and around a block of Paris offices before and after work, the film was largely based on pornographies with which Rollin was already quite familiar with his efforts to collect money "Michel Gentle ". The royalty of the British film Brigitte Lahaie in the demanding leadership. Playing Elisabeth (very well, I might add), she was chosen wandering a road next night by Robert (Vincent Gardère), driving home at the end of a long day's work. Barely able to piece together the sequence of events that led her there, Elisabeth seems to lose her memories only moments after the events, even forgetting Robert's name and the role of heroic savior before her night flight comes to an end in her apartment. Before making love, she legitimately describes herself as a virgin (plus a credit to Brigitte's abilities that she can handle the line so convincingly, being at last one of the most active adult actresses of the 1970s) because she does not can remember a single touch preceding his. Because of this clear context, the relatively long sex scene that follows completely avoids the gratuitousness of other "commercial" interludes that Rollin had to include in other work to secure funding. When Robert leaves for work, he is inevitably erased from Elisabeth's weak mind. A mysterious doctor (comedian Bernard Papineau has effectively launched against the guy) and his menacing assistant Solange (porn star Rachel Mhas) approach her during the absence of her protector and take her back to the place she discovered to have escaped. Here we have one of the strongest scenes in the film, she is reintroduced in her roommate Catherine (the late Cathérine Greiner and the hardcore actress Cathy Stewart) in a silent and devastating turn, both girls desperately providing fictitious "shared memories" by the other in an attempt to overcome their inevitable fate. This deterioration is not limited only to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and Catherine is unable to control their movements when trying to eat a spoonful of soup. It is also Catherine who can express the filmmaker's commitment to the demands of commerce by asking Elisabeth to be naked and to hold her, because sex is all that is left now that both the mind and the physical faculties have abandoned them. Several rather explicit sex scenes - if not quite hardcore - make up the middle section of the film and French porn aficionados should recognize the likes of Alain Plumey (a / k / a "Cyril Val"), Jacques Gateau and Elodie Delage, along with Blink of an eye and miss the future porn princess Marilyn Jess, whose rape in the hands, mouth and member of Plumey was only present in the XXX version of FILLES TRAQUEES. The crucial part of Véronique, a girl whom Elisabeth almost seems to remember and with whom she seeks to escape, is beautifully cared for by the exquisite Dominique Journet - in her unforgettable debut - who would continue to play a major role in Franco Zeffirelli's Los Angeles. TRAVIATA The six feet below the end reveal that the deteriorated condition is the result of a nuclear spill, the quarantined "patients" finally leaving an empty shell that barely breathes, unceremoniously discarded in a fiery furnace. The final shot offers a particularly moving variation on Chaplin's MODERN TIMES as Elisabeth, approaching complete disintegration so far, and a wounded Robert stumbles along the railroad bridge, clumsily clutching his outstretched hands.
