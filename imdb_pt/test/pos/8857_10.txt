The fool saying, "You can not touch it" certainly applies here. With all the horror and clone science fiction films being released, along with all the lower remakes, it's hard to find something worthy of 2 hours of your time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared me when I was a preteen. <br /> <br /> THE THING is undoubtedly in my mind, the most grotesque, most glaring, most grotesque. Classic science fiction horror that John Carpenter, or any other director (sorry, even Mr. Spielberg) has done. What really gives him power, however, is not gore (he cries of mud and blood and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of fear, isolation, and mistrust he feeds on the characters and the viewer. <BR> You can not get any further than Antarctica, and in this howl, a freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several Americans, researchers and military are there. One day, they witness a Siberian Husky dog ​​rushing into the lives of Norwegians wielding weapons. Before they know it, the American Outpost is battling a mysterious creature who can imitate any creature he wants. It can turn into disgusting bloody shapes before it's over, but once it's done, if you have not seen it in progress, you can not say that between humans or other normal animals on Earth. Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just some of the best casting. This movie is the reason why horror CAN be a great genre. Actually, it still frightens me. The alien blood "jumping" from the Petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes me jump !!! <br /> <br /> Still the scariest of them all.
