One of the most charming and, at least to me, the most powerful elements of Anthony Minghella's captivating winner of "The English Patient," is that in the mid-1990s, when Hollywood was in its early stages of losing Great new projects have created a film that brought back very powerful remnants of the wonderful majesty that produced such films as "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962) and "The Ten Commandments" (1956). "The English Patient" contains much of what made these films so powerful. It has that glorious feeling, a stretched out time that hardly seems long, and fascinating characters with past and stories. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient," based on a novel by the same name as Michael Ondaatje. , is like "The Godfather Part II" (1974) in the sense of how it is constructed. It is a mixture of two stories: the past and the present, and everything revolves around the titular character: an English patient in the postwar years of World War II. Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient, who was scarred by an airplane crash, and was cared for in a church secluded by a single nurse beautifully played by Juliette Binoche. In addition to relating to his troubled patient in a hoarse voice, Binoche arrives to learn about his past when a stranger (Willem Dafoe) arrives and the two men seem to know each other. <br /> <br /> This is just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this movie. The other, counted in flashback, is the patient's past, before having scars and dying in a bed. The story of the present blended with the patient's past and his love affair that tragically changed his life forever. To be frank, "The English Patient" is a love story mixed with a sweeping epic feel and magnificently blending. What I really admired in the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was how passionate, obsessive, enchanting it was shown on screen. Usually in love stories, like Minghella's "Cold Mountain" (2003), the romantic elements seem much more lustful than obsessive to me. Some of the love scenes feature elements that tend to be associated more with lust than love, but still, because it is so well developed and not rushed and not exploited out of proportion, we may believe that there is a true love between these characters. It reminded me a lot of "Vertigo" (1958) of how well the filmmakers and artists convinced us that these were two human beings who really fell in love with each other. <br /> <br /> Presentations around were great. . I was especially fascinated by the performance of Juliette Binoche, who took Oscar home for her performance the following year. I also enjoyed Willem Dafoe playing the kind of cynical and questionable character he's always par excellence in playing. And of course I can not leave out Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their representations of two very passionate lovers. Despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic, I would be dishonest if I described it as a perfect movie. There are two flaws I can not see. Number one, it's a little too long and the reason for that is my second complaint, there are some unnecessary subplots. I was not charmed or particularly interested in the second love story between Binoche and a bomb expert played by Naveen Andrews. My research led me to suppose that this element of the plot comes from the original book and I'm sure it worked perfectly there, but in the film it seems only a little distracting and the relationship between the two characters does not fascinate me. I was much more interested in Fiennes' character and in his relationships with his two main actresses. <br /> <br /> However, these two failures are easily forgivable, even if they make things a little less. Those left out, "The English Patient" is an extraordinary achievement of film production. For me, it was kind of an insane mix between "Casablanca" (1942) and "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962), two notable and best films, and that effective combination proved to be worth it. It's a shame Anthony Minghella left us. For he was a truly talented filmmaker. This is all the evidence anyone needs.
