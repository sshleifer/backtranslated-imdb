I found the film Judas Kiss excellent. Carla Gugino's performance was extraordinary, probably her best in her career. His facial expressions in many scenes were unbelievably faithful to the character and were exploited to the maximum by director Gutierrez. All the actors and actresses were very good in their performances. Emma Thompson was, as usual, wonderful. Her acting skills are well above what it would take for this character, so she really does that in the film. <br /> <br /> The story, though sometimes intricate, is kept entertained and pointed towards the end. Very very good. A movie not to be missed. A well-woven and brilliantly directed story. Quality of the film, excellent.
