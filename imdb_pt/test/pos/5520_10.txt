Look, this is a low budget horror movie that suffers from all the problems that come with low budget movies. But you should see this just to watch Lisa Erickson as Julie. She is SMOKIN 'hot and a great little actress to boot! These types of horror films often discover a rare gem and The Power gave us Lisa Erickson! Nothing that I enjoy more than sitting in my apartment with a Coke and put in this movie. My friends Bob, Bill and Dennis agree .. Lisa is not just brilliant, she is a hottie. The film itself often creeps and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in this regard. But as soon as Lisa arrives on the screen, things really start to jump. The others are clearly not in your group. This is not the exorcist, but like I said, if you want to see a fun movie with a little hot actress, this is the one to see!
