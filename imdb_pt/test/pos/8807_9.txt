As I sit here, I find myself laughing at certain moments in this film. Go and see this movie. <br /> <br /> If you've ever been to the ballad, go and see this movie. <br /> <br /> If you've always wanted to go to nightclubs, go and see this. I bet the movie was born of an idea while in the club and this is the product of that chance one in a million people remember and have the application to move on. <br /> <br /> In summary, go and see this movie. <br /> <br />
