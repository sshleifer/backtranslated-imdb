Along with the even more underrated, The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite movies. It is a Western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well represented by members of Ford's "stock company" including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond and Harry Carey Jr. Like almost every Ford movie, it is a meditation on freedom and community. It is also noteworthy for a much more positive picture of the Indians than in most Ford films. Ford, for all its faults, remains the supreme poet of American democracy.
