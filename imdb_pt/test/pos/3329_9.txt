Tex Avery's tenure as a director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50 was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. His cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with MANY strange touches that were later celebrated in the movie THE MASK. Jumping eyes when a guy sees a girl, impossible acrobatics and uninterrupted action were the trademarks of these films. <br /> <br /> This is one of several Droopy cartoons for which Avery was responsible and is among the best. Droopy is a Mountie and he is determined to get his man ... although in this case he is a wolf who escaped from prison. Throughout the movie, despite many insane stunts, Droopy keeps up with this villain until eventually the wolf gives up because Droopy is apparently everywhere! Filled with funny jokes and full of laughter, this is a great cartoon.
