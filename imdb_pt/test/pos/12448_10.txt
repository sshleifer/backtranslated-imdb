Slipknot is a hardcore rock band from Des Moines, Iowa. Nine band members who wear custom shoes and personalized homemade masks (eg clown mask # 6, various # 0 gas masks, tattered mannequin mask + torn # 8 with dreadlocks). Music itself seems to run the line between what is sensible and the opposite, but it is performed so brilliantly and psychotically. <br /> <br /> "Welcome to our neighborhood" looks like a generic title, but filming itself is another. Interviews with the band, soundbites from their latest album, 2 live performances and a video clip banned by MTV (a brilliant tribute to Kubrick's classic film "The Shining"), the film does not even come half an hour, but certainly worth it the penalty. It's perfect for introducing any metal / hardcore fan to Slipknot.
