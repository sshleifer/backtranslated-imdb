A very interesting plot of the film based on the novel "Waltz in Darkness" by writer Cornell Woolrich. It's a drama and not a noir movie, which tries to send a message that love changes your own life, that is, your love for anyone and the love you received from him. A rich man really changed his life out of love, while his partner finally understood that he was the only one who loved her. Belmondo played well, as always, while Michel Bouquet, still young, played his eternal role as a detective or police officer. Frankly Bouquet was not as impressive in this movie, but less than that was the performance of Catherine Deneuve. She was not as convincing in her role as a prostitute, then lover / wife of Louis Mah√© (Belmondo). For those who like to visit the world, the film offers the opportunity to see part of the Ascension Island, and also the city of Lyon in France.
