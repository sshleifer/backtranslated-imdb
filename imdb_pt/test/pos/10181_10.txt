While all of Fleischer / Famous Studios' "Superman" cartoons are excellent, Billion Dollar Limited, the third in the series, is probably the best in terms of overall animation, plot and rhythm. Why was not even nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Short of 1942 (Unbelievably, only the first was) inexplicable. <br /> Here, Lois Lane is assigned to cover the transfer of one billion. dollars in gold for the US Mint. Masked gangsters in his superpowered car (for 1942) take off after the train, determined to get that gold. Without much attention, what follows is an exciting ride for both the characters and the audience, with truth, justice, and Superman triumphing in the end. <br /> <br /> As did throughout the Fleischer / Famous Superman Cartoon, Clayton "Bud" Collyer and Joan Alexander, who played Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane on the radio, have the honorable vocals here, and Fleischer's perennial Jack Mercer gets a bit to do as one of the bad guys, too.
