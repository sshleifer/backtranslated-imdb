This is an incredibly fun action / exploration rocker from the '80s. Charles Bronson rules like Paul Kirsey. The villains are hilariously bad. Jimmy Page's soundtrack is ridiculously bad. Alex Winter (Bill & Ted Bill) is great as one of the street punks that is wasted by Bronson and the team. Technical team? Oh, these are the oppressed citizens who join Bronson to regain the streets. The whole movie is enjoyable, with the last half hour exploding in action and clutter non-stop. 9/10
