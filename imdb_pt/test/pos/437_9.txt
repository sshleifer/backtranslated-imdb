Jean Renoir's homage to late-nineteenth-century Paris is beautiful in many respects. Not only does it seem to have been photographed by Toulouse-Lautrec and Mucha, it portrays geographic Paris; the streets accessible only by stairs, the unpleasant end of fleeting popularity and the sexual opportunism of men with a product to sell, in an intransigent image of show business that contrasts with the image painted by Hollywood. There is an obvious comparison to be made with Lloyd Bacon's "42nd Street," which had been made about 20 years earlier, featuring Ruby Keeler as a dance sensation, a young guy who came to New York to enter show business , who saves the show when the star fails - "You're going out there, a chorus boy, but you have to turn a star!" Warner Baxter "Julian Marsh" is a director who suffers for his art and is devalued. Jean Gabin's "Danglard" conflicts with genital politics, but when he talks about the show, he's more like Knute Rockne than Julian Marsh. It's all about the game except - for its pointy thing. He has a new and lucrative venture sewn until his lover becomes jealous of the woman she recognizes as her next lover. His prospects rise and fall with every journey of coitus he takes. Danglard takes lover 1 (Lola de Castro, played by Maria Felix) for a swim, where he sees "Nini" (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) with her boyfriend and first lover, Paulo, the baker, and discovers that she is a witty dancer. He uses her charm and the prospect of money to lure Nini into studying dancing so she can take the stage. The prospect of money and fame enchants Nini, and she becomes the next lover of Danglard, as well as a cancan eligible pupil, whom Danglard dubbed "French Cancan", to meet the current Anglophile trend in dance. <br /> <br /> Both "42nd St" and "French Cancan" are tribute to show business - to modern entertainment - that has its own iconography and its own concept. "42nd St." is centered around Julian Marsh, a great Broadway director of shows, who he organizes with great personal energy and dubious sexual involvement. The juvenile male is a middle-aged twit with low back pain, replaced by Dick Powell, the handsome tenor with secret wealth to hide. Danglard, on the other hand, goes from woman to woman, seducing them with the promise of fame, hooking them with what must have been a very persuasive endowment. There is no doubt that he is heterosexual and quite active. Post-shit scenes are plentiful. Days after seducing Nini away from Paul, he discovered Esther, a Piaf-type, and began to prepare her for the work of singing the theme song of the movie while he played his violin. . This, of course, arouses Nini's jealousy, just as she aroused Lola's jealousy. (And of course Nini had already denied the privilege of being a Czarina!) The whole movie is about how Danglard's lust cost him money, but how even his troubled horniness is subordinate to his love of the show - how the public demands devotion - and it is this potent combination of phallic persuasion and tantalizing fame that makes Danglard the hero, while claiming that a true show lover will never make as much money as men. At the end of the film, Danglard, having outgrown lenders and jealous babies, approaches a new attraction by watching the incredible (and believe it, incredible) cancan performance. "Have you ever thought about being onstage?" He asks, and the curtain goes down. Meanwhile, poor Julian is sitting on the movie fire escape, listening to the new fans of Peggy Sawyer, belittle his contribution to the series' success. (I'm not even going to get in the middle of "42nd Street", "Oh, man, it was really your business!") <br /> <br /> In addition, I will not get caught in the glimpse of the legendary Parisian artists, including a brief vision of Piaf, nor the vision of an urban and rural Paris. Certainly there is a sample of the styles that generated Trenet and Aznavour. But it is the memoir of an assertive and welcome masculinity, something unheard of in any Hollywood musical with which it can be compared, it is a pleasant relief from the 1930s Hollywood musical androgynes (including my beloved Fred Astaire, without mentioning Dick Powell), much less the barf promulgated by MGM in films like the repulsive "American in Paris." All these sources! Let's save the comparison of this turkey with "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and its deconstruction of the American man for another day. This Danglard may have been a hopeful view in postwar France of a kind of hyper-masculine mech that may or may not have existed is virtually irrelevant. That he is man of man, neither John Wayne nor Edward Everett Horton, is perhaps more on target. That he is a man who likes women is never in question. I, for example, would not mind living his life. I wonder if Gabin was so lucky. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this comment, I wanted to talk about Baz Luhrman and what Sinclair Lewis called "boloney." I've never come this far. The Moulin Rouge de Baz ... well, Paris does not put that sort of thing on the Seine anymore.
