This game was one of the main reasons I really have a PS2. I remember playing Soul Edge (sometimes called Soul Blade) in the past and got addicted to it. <br /> <br /> I played the original Soul Calibur, but never got a chance to play it for a huge amount. of time. However, I bought the Gamecube version of Soul Calibur II and that's what really got me hooked on the series and I was ecstatic when I heard about Soul Calibur III. This game still gives us the classic characters like Mitsurugi, Cervantes, Nightmare and Taki. However, it also adds several new characters such as Zasalamel, Tira and the non-playable Night Terror. (The True Boss of Tales of Souls) The strategy based on the "Chronicles of Thes Sword" mode is a new feature that I really like, it can be quite challenging in later chronicles, but it's a nice addition to the series. Soul Arena mode has several missions in which you must fight against a certain enemy under certain circumstances. (The exception is "Final Battle", in which you simply must defeat Night Terror). It's another nice touch that makes the game even more fun. <br /> <br /> In some scenes of Tales of press certain buttons to get a different result, this can be to avoid / block an attack or get a better end. (Each character has two endings) In short, this is an excellent game and I recommend if you are a fan of fighting games.
