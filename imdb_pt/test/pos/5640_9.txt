This depiction of abandoned Japanese forces in the Philippines is a tour de force in the total insignificance of war. It is an effective representation of Japanese pacifist visions after World War II. In the film, Japanese soldiers were left to defend themselves in the jungles of the Philippines. Faced with impending hunger, they resort to cannibalism and gradually lose what little humanity they have left. Calling this depressing movie would be a kind of euphemism. The viewer gets a totally desperate sense of the lost value of life in modern combat. The final scene is almost too nihilistic, but the film is a dignified statement, however. Highly recommended.
