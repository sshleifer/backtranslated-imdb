I remember when the skateboard had its rebirth in the 70s. I begged my parents for money on a second hand skateboard from a friend. It was a piece of garbage, complete with clay wheels and everything. I also remember reading Skateboarder Magazine and was totally impressed and totally terrified of the Dogtown team. Skating has never become a way of life for me, but in some ways it has always been a part of my life, whether it's using a board for transportation or just a bunch of friends skating. <br /> <br /> This film is a brilliant documentary of the true birth of modern skating. Watching this team skating from the boring pastime that was into the vertical lifestyle became gaping for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> It is incredible that there are enough images from this period to create this movie, and I thank God for it. The footage is brilliant. It gave me the feeling of watching an old movie from Buster Keaton: I saw some of the tricks that Keaton has repeated countless times in other movies since then, but when you come back and see the first person performing this trick is amazing that, Not only they were the first person to try it successfully but they lived through it and made it look effortless. This is the feeling that this movie gave me. Yes, I've seen people skating before but observing the FIRST people skating in the pools and inventing the tricks that eventually became the basics of modern skating is like seeing the front of the house fall on Keaton, leaving him standing on the board. from a window. It is absolutely brilliant to watch something that, until that moment, had never been tried before, but since then it has been tried by almost everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie is beautiful to watch and incredible to hear. The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in a movie. This is a movie that will please people, whether they like to skate or not. I talked to some of my friends who made their girlfriends participate in this movie after heavy protests, and everyone said their girlfriends were mesmerized by the end of the movie and they loved it as much as they did. <br /> <br /> As for previous comments on this board, who complain that the film is very self-congratulatory, I think this is unfair nonsense. I enjoyed watching these guys get excited about their past. They created something that influenced their sport and changed forever. They have the right to pat themselves on the back. They were stars to do what they loved to do. Most of these boys / girls have never achieved the impressive success that Tony Hawk enjoys today, but such success was not available to skaters. Of course, they have had some success, but more importantly, they were able to live a life doing what they love to do, and as we see in the end, almost everyone still surfs, skates or works in the surf / skate industry. How many of us can say that we were able to live our lives and succeed by breaking all the rules and doing what we love to do? They can. My hat is for Dogtown and Z-Boys for being themselves and changing the skateboard world forever.
