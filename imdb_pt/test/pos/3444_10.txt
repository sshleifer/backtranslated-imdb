Seeing this film, or rather a set of films in early adolescence, irrevocably changed my idea of ​​the possibilities for human interaction and the scope of potential experience. This monumental exploration of individuals and their historical setting reveals how full and intense each human existence is. People are portrayed as they are to themselves: their experiences from the minor to the greatest internal and external phenomena are detailed with the greatest art and insight. Edgar Reitz shows a fabulous appreciation of human motivations and yearnings. <br /> <br /> When these phenomena counteract the immense time allowed by the duration of the work, one can not fail to grasp the strength and vivacity of happiness, defeat. , lust, love, sadness, melancholy, which each person feels. When I saw these movies, I realized my future experiences, how my life would inevitably twist and waver due to intentional and accidental events. I acquired a sense of longevity of being and what it meant to reflect on past lives, memories, and contexts. A work of art and a revelation. I just wanted the BBC to show it again. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows where I can get a copy, can they contact me?
