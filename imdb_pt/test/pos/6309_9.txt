I was a bit worried about actors and acting in Italy, so "Le triunenze dell'amore" and Toni Servillo came. It's been a long time since I've seen such a charismatic actor onscreen. Paolo Sorrentino wrote a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years. The film is not completely perfect, but "Titta Di Girolamo" will stay with you for a long time after viewing the film. Toni, please continue to act in films, you are the coolest actor of the moment (and not just in Italy, his performance deserves international acclaim). I rate this movie 9/10.
