I just bought An Zhan (no time) on DVD and it was a great movie that I must say. Not too full of action in terms of game weapons, but definitely thrilling and witty. I do not think I've seen Andy Lau in better shape. And the editing of this film was very well executed. Go watch now if you are fan of Lau or HK thiller / action film!
