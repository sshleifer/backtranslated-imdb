It is quite surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, since Hollywood usually had their collective heads in the sand with respect to black and white issues at the time. The film deserves strong praise for having this stand, for having exceptional performances from its lesser-known cast and super-clever script that does not insult the public or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism. Plus, with the movie's modest budget and quick runtime, it does an incredible job! Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the time) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south. The crowd could really care less about the details - they are just engaged in a hanging. And despite his commitment to the law, the only lawyer in the city who has agreed to defend him also assumes that he is guilty and does not really want to know the truth - just postpone the hanging until they can try to convict him and then have a LEGAL suspension! Fortunately, a young white man (Claude Jarmin) begins to wonder about Juano's innocence and begins to seek the truth. At this point, the best character in this wonderful drama is presented - played by Elizabeth Patterson (the old lady who later played Mrs. Trumbull in I LOVE LUCY). She alone steals the show as the white person with not only a conscience, but the will and determination to defend the black man. At a marvelous point in the movie, a crowd is trying to get past it to get to the prisoner to kill it, but it gets very steady and forces them to retreat. There is much more in this complicated but cleverly written story, but I will leave it to you to see for yourself. Watch with your kids if you have a chance - this will open up an incredible dialogue about the extent to which race relations have emerged in the last 50 years. <br /> <br /> By the way, apparently 1949 was a great year for Hollywood finally tackling racial bias head-on, as Twentieth-Century Fox also released "Pinky" - an equally effective and strong film about racism, interracial marriage and even rape! Watch the two movies if you can.
