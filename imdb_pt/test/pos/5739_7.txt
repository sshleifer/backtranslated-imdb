Paul Naschy, as a spooky security guard, is more frightening than most of his werewolf and shoe disguises. The story is not unknown, a lot of kids going to a party in an abandoned school. The thing is, one of these parents of kids did the same thing years ago, but now he's dead, and the last group of kids seems to be reliving an event 23 years ago. This is very well done for such films, and there is an air of mystery to what is happening, because apparently what happened to children before is a mystery and perhaps the truth has not been revealed. So no, not just your default data and slice. This moves very well and does not let you lose interest as many movies do, and the eccentric story is attractive enough to keep you interested too, and there is some suspense that is missing in many movies these days. . The ending is quite abrupt and I suppose it's left to your imagination, but again, it's not welcome either. 7 out of 10, check it out.
