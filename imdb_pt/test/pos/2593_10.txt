In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is hunting, and Daffy tries to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has its own agenda. In addition, "Rabbit Seasoning" makes an interesting use of the order of words and pronouns (warning: you can hilariously and rudely mess up your speech). <br /> <br /> I think probably my favorite aspect of this design is the costumes. used by Bugs and Daffy. One of them looks like it would have been risky for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they do it perfectly, as they always did. All in all, this only serves to show what geniuses the people behind these cartoons were.
