The last bursting movie. Elements of Bogie, Welles & Sinatra will leave you sweating and satisfied. In comparison, it really disturbs the proverbial apple stroller to see recent films such as "Oceans Eleven (remake)", revised in such high regard - especially in Europe. Movies like Rififi must be shown, spoken and kept alive to remind the (pathetic) critics younger than the real classic Noir. <br /> <br /> Criterion should be praised in its flawless and elegant transference.
