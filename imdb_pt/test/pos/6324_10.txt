I've only recently discovered this fantastic series and I just can not get enough of Garner's relaxed PI. The shows continually display an excellent level of writing and suspense episodes. <br /> <br /> This episode, Sleight of Hand, is a bit different. Abandoning his mood in favor of a more serious move to Rockford as he searches for his missing girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The mystery is great and is revealing itself enough. It's based on a book (it does not remember the name) and could have easily been stretched for a long-running episode. Garner stands out here as Rockford gets tough and really means business. This has a noir to feel all the way, dark lighting and general mood echo the great dark thrillers of the 40s and 50s. Really good episode in a class A series. It easily deserves a 10.
