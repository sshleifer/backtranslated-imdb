I do not believe Bostock's Cup is not yet available on an appropriate video or DVD. I only saw it once, in a dishonest copy taken from the TV and although I was not a football fan (not at all), I thought it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The famous sloping field from wherever it was, the bus driver without notion ("Ponty - this, Ponty - that", "I'll take the next exit"), the meaningless plot; All this added to the sore sides. Being stuck in the US, I'm desperate for good British humor, but not enough to spend the value the producer is asking for. Come on, ready on the kosher DVD.
