After visiting the Kimbell Museum in Forth-Worth, Texas, USA, enjoying art and architecture (also the adjacent Museum of Modern Art), and having a pleasant chat with the experienced bookstore, I bought this DVD with a rather high volume. expectations ?? and was not disappointed at all. <br /> <br /> The thematic approach, dramatic tension, revealing interviews, archival footage and impressive architecture also blend into a coherent whole to explore the life of the late iconic Louis I. Khan The documentary begins: plays of contemplative classical music, files are scanned with a reflective shaded face superimposed, letters symbolically blurred referring to a train window passing through a scenery landscape ?? a journey, focus and out of focus, the search eventually culminates in an article in a newspaper. Nathanial Khan reads on the front page of the New York Times, where his father is simultaneously praised as the best American architect alive and his announced death. "When I read this obituary for the first time, I have to admit, I was looking for my own name, it was his son, his only son, I did not know my father very well. my mother and he never lived with us (?) He died when I was eleven. "So, years later, this illegitimate son is still haunted by fragmented and obscure thoughts and feelings about his father who It seems to be a great professional and public figure, but who's secret personal life escapes him and affects him to the point where he intends to do something about it. <br /> <br /> "For years I've struggled to be satisfied with the little bits of my father's life that I'm allowed to see but it was not enough I needed to know him I needed to find out who he really was So I went on a journey, to see his buildings and find what was left of him outside. It would take me to the other side of the world, looking for the man who left me with so many questions. " documentary is two -fold, by a slow systematic discovery of the world-renowned architect, we get to know: 1) his ideas, buildings and architectural perspective and 2) his families, co-workers, people's lives affected and the human perspective < The DVD also provides additional insight with a Q & A with the writer / director and additional images that include such great quotes from Louis I. Khan as "All That Everyone Says Is Truth". It's their truth. It may not be factual. "And" A good idea that does not happen is no idea at all. "<br /> <br /> This film is a journey of discovery, self-discovery and discovery of a man, great man, but human, imperfect like all of us, we can know him through the eyes of an admiring and slightly bitter child, but with the openness and objectivity to actually explore without drawing easy conclusions and without judgment. <br /> <br /> Through key interviews with people who interacted with him in various roles, we slowly put together a few pieces until the final interview with this Bangladeshi man who actually seems to bring him back home with guttural and sensible comments . <br /> <br /> Bright architect, brilliant documentary.
