I remember that old movie. It's a fantastic, creepy, atmospheric horror image of a man moving to a Scottish castle, only to find out that there are strange events in the halls at night. And there are even stranger events going on in the back, in the more familiar labyrinth of Hollywood. Yes, this is the labyrinth you've seen in all feature films that have already involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including "The Enlightened One." But the end of this story is about the last thing you could imagine. I certainly did not see it coming. This is a good example of how good and convincing a movie can be, even when the premise is completely crazy, bordering on laughter. I would recommend it to anyone.
