As you know "The biggest game ever played" is about golf. I used to laugh at the super-dramatic title, but through a great visual display credited to director Bill Paxton (best known for his role in Twister and supporting roles in Aliens and True Lies) we find that this has much more meaning than one. film is about golf, it seems that the sport is just the structure of what is really happening. What is really happening is a story of individuals who say they can not fulfill their dreams, be they age or social status. A conflict between the desires of a child and the demands of the father. An English golf legend looking to take the title home with the country breathing in the neck. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBeouf (Even Stevens) plays Francis Ouimet, a caddy with a God-given talent who was never allowed to play golf in the first place. Despite the resentment of the upper-class "lords," it was undeniable that Francis had a gift. What posed a greater threat was the dismay of his father, played by Elias Koteas (Sugartime, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), who felt that playing a mere game would never improve their precarious living conditions. With the continued support of his mother, Francis finally comes across his idol, golf legend Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane). More impressive than the game itself, it was the movie's cinematic achievement. This proved that the narrative is successful through pure cinema. The whole movie could have been told without dialogue. There are scenes in the film that build strong suspense and powerful thrill with just photos. In a particular scene, Francis Ouimet swings and the whole crowd turns his head to see the ball fly away, all but Harry Vardon's face gazing intently at Ouimet without a retreat. The ways in which golfers visualize the course offer more aesthetic pleasure. <br /> <br /> A nice supporting cast completes the whole. Peyton List plays love interest and seems to be worth playing, and Josh Flitter plays an adorable caddy who keeps Ouimet concentrated while the pressure hinders him. Golf fan or not, you'll enjoy the movie for its beauty and its remembrance that the cinema can be a great way to tell any story.
