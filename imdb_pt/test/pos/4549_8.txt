This movie is hilarious. The laughter never stops. Each scene is packed to the limit with hilarious comedy. Chris Farley is a comic book genius, and Spade plays his character on a T-shirt. Farley was one of the best slap stick comics of all, and in this film (as with all his films), we see how much time and energy he devoted to portraying his character as he saw fit. "Tommy Boy" is a great example of comedy, it always makes me laugh, no matter how many times I've seen it before.
