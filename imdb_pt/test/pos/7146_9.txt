This film was recommended to me by the same person who blessed me with a copy of The Chronicles of Narnia. Shadowlands is one of the most incredible scripts ever written. It is well executed, acted and directed. Cinematography is a bit dark for my taste, but I'm sure it was meant to be. The script is like poetry in parts of the film, throughout the film I found myself pausing to reflect on the comments made on the screen. This is a wonderful piece of film and I can only hope that more people will go through it and add comments. Fair warning though this was a 6-tissue film for me. Very touching. Performances very sincere.
