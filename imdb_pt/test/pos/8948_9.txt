I saw this in a preview and it seems not to have been released in the USA. However, it was one of the nicest little comedies. It concerns the rivalry between two funeral directors in a small British town. The plot [of the film] gets a little out of hand in Act Three, but the characters are very pleasant and memorable. <br /> <br /> The performance is great in every way. Of course to be ignored in the crisis of blockbusters, this is a movie worth seeking out. I know I'll try to get this in theaters again and / or buy the video.
