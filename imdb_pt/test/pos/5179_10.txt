Seeing Gary Busey in a G movie was the first and a good one at that. I do not know much about the director, but he obviously knows how to spend a few dollars and get the most out of them. Where did Jillian Clare come from? My children love it! The only thing I remember Christopher Atkins doing was Blue Lagoon. Disney needs to see this movie and put it to work. The wife thinks he's cute. I liked what he did with his character. He looked so real. What we liked the most was the message that this movie sends. Greed sucks and faith, love and family win! This is the first low-budget DVD we bought and it had a lot on it. The producers did this for children and the kids loved it. They liked the music and all the extras on the DVD. The director probably will not stick with family movies, but I hope he does - because he really knows how to get the most out of kids, animals and stars like Gary Busey. The dog was great and seeing Gary Busey act like a dog was even funnier. There was not much we did not like about it. It's hard to find a family movie without all the gross humor, and Quigley was a wonderful surprise.
