several years ago I saw this movie, without subtitles, on television, and although I did not understand a word of what the characters were saying I still have the general idea, and the mood of the movie did not fascinate me. <br /> <I finally saw it again a few weeks ago. my heart skipped when I saw the photo in the television guide, and for 8 days until the movie was actually shown I told everyone that I knew how to go and see it. the story reminded me a little of Alfred Hitchcock's vertigo. a slow and meditative film about a guy who one day believes he sees the girlfriend who disappeared years earlier. What follows is a wild roller coaster ride of flashbacks, changing perspectives and really inventive twists in the plot, and at the end of the movie I was out of breath. I definitely had not got what I expected (and I'd already seen the movie!). be prepared to be confused. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
