This movie is a great movie, however, as most movies are highly predictable. The biggest highlight of the film is the star Amanda Bynes, who is absolutely beautiful and hilarious. She is one of the few people in the world who can use all of her facial muscles to make the weirdest, most destructive faces ever. It is good for children and contains masculine nudity and suggestive nudity in the end. All in all, they did a good job updating an old classic, and deserve to rest on film support along with O and 10 Things I Hate About You. The other actors also do a great job on many of their first releases.
