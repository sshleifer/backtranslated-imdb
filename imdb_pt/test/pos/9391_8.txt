"Death Bed: The Bed You Eat" is a supremely bizarre horror film that really has to be seen to be believed. There is an old four-poster bed that only likes to eat humans and does it anytime can lure somebody to There is also a long-dead artist trapped behind one of his paintings, which provides a narration. George Barry's first and only film offers some truly surreal moments, like bed absorbing its victims in a mysterious film. sea ​​yellow foam and liquid. The atmosphere is dreamy and there is only a little blood, unfortunately the premise is rather silly and the acting is amateur. Still as an unusual movie fan I enjoyed this low budget quirk. Give it a chance.8 of 10.
