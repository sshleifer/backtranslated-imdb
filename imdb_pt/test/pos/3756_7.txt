I only saw this movie once when it was shown on tv, but I still remember it 15 years later, so I must say something about it. I thought it was a smart look at schooling, friendship, bullying and the influence that this can lead to adulthood. <br /> <br /> The title really refers to how being good or bad in sports can make you the lowest of the lows or you will be tolerated by cliques within the school and even later in adulthood if you is good at it - this is set in a private school in England, but could be anywhere. <br /> <br /> The main character is bad at games, seeks revenge later in life that all culminates in a climax clash on a cricket ground. I must admit that I was destroyed by the end - it was powerful and sad.
