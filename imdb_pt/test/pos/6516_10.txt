I watched this movie a long time ago, but I always loved it. The story is about a young girl, Sally O'Moyne, who discovers at a young age that when she prays to Santa Ana, her prayers are answered, hence the lack of a lunch bucket and an evil neighbor who plays with her and her now that someone should give him a black eye for playing. Well, a minute later, something hits him and he has a black eye. Sally then believes in the power of prayer and decides to use that power for good. She is well known and loved by the neighborhood, as she has notebooks / diaries full of requests from all her friends for St. Anne. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a local kid returns home from college (I believe) and Sally is amazed at how old he is. Sally has a huge crush on him, but she's so shy. Should she use her prayer power to Santa Ana for her own selfish desire or just watch as the most popular girls in school try to fool the man of her dreams? This is a fun-filled movie with a grandfather who is so charming and Irish, brother who is hilariously annoying and a sworn Irish neighbor who fights with the grand-pop every day. He has his own story of wanting to buy O'Moynes Estate, which is a small house in the middle of two huge apartment complexes (his own), in other words, O'Moynes's house is painful for his lovable buildings. . <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worthy of a watch and is good enough and rare enough to add to your movie collection. Hope you like!
