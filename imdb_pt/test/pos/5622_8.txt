Chris Smith is a top filmmaker with the rarely seen talent to discover a good story, and then give it out of his way. Smith's "American Movie," is the actual record of aspiring filmmaker Mark Borchardt, a loser intent on taking money from his elderly uncle to complete his horror. But never, under any circumstances, seek paid employment or support the children he conceived. Such is the skill of producer Smith that Marcos seems more sympathetic than the other way around. Even if he attracts Uncle Bill with fertile dreams and executive producer credits, it is his desperation to be someone, to have his name associated with names like Scorsese and Spielberg touching us. "American" also belongs to that rare sub-genre, often tried but rarely achieved, that mixes hilarity with horror. The humor comes from Ed Wood's belief in Borchardt in his own genius. From his terrible attempts to act, from his replacement by his mother, less than film-savvy, to a disappeared cameraman, to having employed Mike, a sweet friend but with brain problems, whenever he's an actor or team member. <br /> <br /> The horror comes from seeing what Borchardt can not: it's this very American attitude - I want, therefore I'm authorized - that prevents him from seeing how much he has to learn about his chosen craft. He is so confident he can not fail that failure is guaranteed.
