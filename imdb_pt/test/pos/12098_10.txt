I'm going to dance Herr Hacke f√ºr den Movie. Mein Deutsch ist nicht gut. Enschuldigen Sie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I did not know how diverse the sound of Istanbul, despite living in Turkey. Faith Akin and Alexander Hacke took a different approach to Turkish music. Seeing Istanbul and Istanbul Music of a foreign aspect gave the true meaning of the music itself. <br /> <br /> In this film I discovered how different our (Turkish) culture is, how interesting our artists are, and how much respect they deserve. Unfortunately, no one was able to serve this kind of documentary before.
