During the civil war, a wounded union soldier hides in an isolated confederate women's school; where the principal and schoolteacher decide to take care of him and keep him until the problem begins to form among lonely and sexually frustrated women and girls. The soldier decides to take advantage of this situation, but everything has a price in the end. "Dirty Harry (1971)" (which was made around the same time as "The Beguiled") may be my favorite collaboration between Eastwood and Siegel, but after seeing this, I tend to think that this is the best work of the couple together. A very atypical, clever and stylish vehicle for Eastwood is always on the move with Don Siegel's richly controlled direction and an astonishing soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin. Standing out strongly is his somber and somber nature that is intrusively planted in the psychological makeup of the film and manipulative strangulation maintained in sexual depravity. It is assiduously thrown away and causes more melancholy and blood to itch when those random shocks and spicy intentions take over the exciting tension. The way Siegel illustrates the bold and slow script of John B Sherry and Grimes Grice (drawn from Thomas Cullinan's novel) is effectively done through strong emotions and the lyrical and rigid context of the script. Siegel's strong direction captures the idyllic Victorian ambience of the south with such a potently garnished photograph and he creates some strangely penetrating images with great clarity and restraint. <br /> <br /> While the performances are truly praiseworthy and high quality. Clint Eastwood as the gentle and sweet soldier of the Chameleon's Union is very impressionable and delightfully assured. A profoundly eminent Geraldine Page steals the photo as the hardened head lover and the elegant Elizabeth Hartman adds a delicate sincerity to his innocent character. Mae Mercer is heavily adapted as the black maid and Jo Ann Harris is the pick of young students' pick with her seductively cunning personality. <br /> <br /> Honestly, while Eastwood's charismatic character plays on the pitch for his own selfish needs, there are still petty intentions that what is being played (where rivalry among women hints) is no better than the guest. at the end. Everywhere there is a perversely obscure sense of humor and an ironic twist on material. What is shown here is simply more than your basic small-minded shock, but one that is densely covered by intrigue and a sense of realism that is hard to shake. This also holds for the extremely frightening title and closing music. <br /> <br /> An effectively refreshing and understated item that is hard not to be tempted by hospitality.
