No, this has nothing to do with the sitcom "Seinfeld" or his eccentric and hilarious character Cosmo Kramer. In fact, "Kramer vs. Kramer" is a great drama film, arguably one of the best of its kind and one of the greatest films of all time. I'm glad you won more Oscar than Apocalypse Now because you really deserved such a glory. "Kramer vs. Kramer" is an excellent film, so well done and so perfectly balanced that I change anything about it anyway. There is nothing wrong with the movie. It is to make films of the highest quality. And it's also the test of time. Not only does it not seem dated, but its cultural impact is long-lasting and its realistic story remains as significant as it was when it was released in 1979. A timeless classic. They do not make movies like this today. <br /> <br /> This movie is dramatic, realistic, simple, but brilliant, intense, powerful, sweet and even tragic and depressing at times. However, he has a good mood too. It has no special effects, but who cares? This is not the movie or place to discuss such a thing. For a film like this, such a thing would be useless and absolutely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. The chemistry of the actors is just perfect. All the actors are great, but the top 3 are the best. Dustin Hoffman, a brilliant actor, has his best ever performance as the amiable and distant workaholic Ted Kramer. Meryl Streep is great as Ted's wife, Joanna. And the cuddly Justin Henry is fantastic as the loving but sometimes stubborn Billy, son of Ted and Joanna. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is instrumental and wonderful. The opening song (by guitarist Frederic Hand) is brilliant. The rest of the soundtrack is mostly classical music by Antonio Vivaldi and is simply stunning. <br /> <br /> This movie also has an incredible development of the characters. See the character Ted Kramer: a workaholic who becomes an incredible father after having no choice but to take care of his son, trying to adjust these new responsibilities with his work after being left by his wife Joanna. With this, Ted learns about the most beautiful things in life, but also realizes what life is like, with the problems in his work and the return of Joanna, who wants the custody of his son. But even Joanna changes for the better and the ending is an unexpected surprise when someone first sees it. <br /> <br /> This movie also has some things, like court scenes where Ted and Joanna face a brutal character. murders triggered by lawyers. Another thing to see is when poor Billy falls from a junkyard with his toy (a plane) and gets seriously injured in his face. But again, the scene is very well done and what comes next is very intense: his father runs quickly and crosses several blocks, ignoring the traffic to take his son to the hospital. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a movie that is a good life lesson. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be in the Top 250.
