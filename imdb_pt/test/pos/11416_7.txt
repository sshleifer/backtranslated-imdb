I'm a big horror fan and I really enjoyed this remake. With all these remakes of terror floating, I think this is one of the best attempts. I watched with my two little sisters and I think it got even better, since they were quite scared. Also with the screams on the screen "Do not do it!", "It's not like that!", Etc. I thought there were some good bouncing moments and that built tension well. <br /> <br /> Camilla Belle is absolutely stunning in the lead role and a very good actress - so she keeps her attention well. <br /> <br /> Overall, a decent movie.
