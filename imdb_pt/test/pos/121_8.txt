Now I understand that this movie was not made as an indictment against all Indians, but it's an incredible movie because it dares to investigate the hypocrisy that some Indians have regarding their women and sexuality. I have known for some time that sexism is very common in this society (with women being murdered because the husband's family does not want them after their death or because they have had a small dowry, as well as the frequent death of female fetuses because they are seen as a curse instead of a blessing). I also realize that some of this culture will be very offended by the film, but the main point is that there is some truth to the subject - even though the film was so heavily attacked when it debuted in India a decade ago. As a result of extreme misogyny in the film, most members of the Western public will be shocked or at least emotionally drawn to the suffering of women in this film. <br /> <br /> Although I am a man, I am not angrily feminist and I am straight, the film had a strong positive impact on me and it is not an agenda film that can only be enjoyed by lesbians and "men who hate ". In fact, I do not think the film is promoting male hatred or homosexuality, but rather gives convincing arguments as to how, in the case of these two women, that was the only reasonable alternative because of their evil husbands. Yes, I use the word "bad" and I mean, since both husbands living in this large family are intensely selfish and have no regard for the sexuality of their spouses. In many traditional societies this is indeed the case and women are condemned to an empty emotional existence. <br /> <br /> A husband married a lively young woman, Sita, out of family obligation. This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for both, but in the beginning Sita makes an attempt to connect with her moody husband. However, he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about Sita - and he still has an affair with a liberal Chinese. To make matters worse, he did nothing to hide the case and did not apologize. In their dead marriage, sex was purely meant to bear children and there was no way Sita could have her sexual or emotional needs met. And, unfortunately, he could have cared less. <br /> <br /> Another husband was married to an infertile lady (Radha). Strangely, after initially trying to have children, they spent the next 13 years without any sexual contact! It is because this man has decided to become an ascetic (ie in Hinduism, a person who gives up the pleasures of the world to gain inner illumination). Now his willingness to do this was very good, if he was no longer married and had obligations for his wife. However, being married, this was an incredibly selfish act and, like his brother, he assumed that his wife had no sexual feelings nor did he seem to care. The closest he allowed her to sexually was to sleep beside him - how to have her beside him helped him teach himself to "overcome the desires of the flesh." That must have brought nothing but frustration to her. <br /> <br /> So, you have two neglected and normal women living in the same house who yearn for emotional connection as well as an outlet for your sexual needs. Eventually, these needs unite these in-laws - at first, only emotionally, but then sexually as well. The film was brilliant as it took me to look at and understand how, in some cases, homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy, compared to a life of emotional desolation. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, when the intensity of their sexuality the relationship is discovered, it leads to a not wholly unexpected reaction from the "enlightened" husband of Radha - a man who seeks religious discernment and peace, but is so wrapped up in himself that true perception and growth is impossible. <br /> <br /> This is a very challenging and adult movie. Although there is very little nudity, the subject is very adult and this is not a movie to show to your kids. Very disturbing, in fact, is a minor character who masturbates in front of a paralyzed old lady - as I said, this is not a movie to let your kids watch. However, for a mature audience, this is an excellent and highly erotic movie that will make you think. <br /> <br /> The film features good acting, complex characters, excellent writing, lovely humor music and a slow pace that may bother some, but I found it rewarding. The only serious denial that I can not blame the film itself, but the idiots who threw it on videotape. This is because, although the film is in English, the accents are quite strong at times and it is not always easy to understand what is being said. BUT, and this is the worst part, there are no closed or open captions - including them is a must for the western audience. If you watch this movie, see if you can find it on DVD or hopefully a new video release will have subtitles - mine certainly did not. <br /> <br /> By the way, director Deepa Mehta (the popular female director) has made several other wonderful films, such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD / Hollywood. A consistent theme in her films is the conflict between Indian traditional culture and expectations and Westernism - with a strong emphasis on female characters. Not surprisingly, this lady who thinks of the West makes her live in Canada and is divorced - a really unusual woman, to say the least. For a similar film that explores traditional culture and Western culture, try another Canadian gem, EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN.
