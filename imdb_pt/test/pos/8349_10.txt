Since I saw the trailer on the DVD "The Little Mermaid II: Return To The Sea", I had the feeling that this movie would be great because I'm a big fan of Disney. And guess what? I am right! This film is a very decent successor to the original classic "Lady and the Tramp". <br /> <br /> Tell the story of Scamp, the naughty son of Lady and Tramp, who wants to be wild and free instead of living a shelter life. Although the film may not be as good as the first, it has a great moral that you would not find anywhere else until you watched it. <br /> <br /> I admit that the movie is not for everyone, but those of you who hate, all I can say is that you do not have a spirit for this and I suggest you do not go see it again . But hey! It really is an incredible story filled with brilliant animation, music and star-studded voice talents with Scott Wolf (Party of Five) and Alyssa Milano (Charmed). So if you have not seen the movie, why stay there? Go and get the copy !!!
