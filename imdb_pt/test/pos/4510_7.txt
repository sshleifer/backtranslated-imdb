In the 1970s in Afghanistan, Pushtun boy Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi) and boy Hazara Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), who is his loyal friend and son of his servant Hazara Ali (Nabi Tanha), are raised together in Amir's paternal home , playing and playing on the streets of a peaceful Kabul. Amir feels that his wise and good father Baba (Homayoun Ershadi) blames him for the death of his mother in childbirth, and also that his father loves and prefers Hassam to him. In return, Amir feels a great respect for the best friend of his father, Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub), who supports his intention to become a writer. After Amir won a kitting contest, Hassam races to take a kite to Amir, but he is beaten and raped by the brutal Assef (Elham Ehsas) on an empty street to protect Amir's kite; the coward Amir witnesses the robbery, but does not help the faithful Hassam. The day after his birthday party, Amir hides his new watch on Hassam's bed to frame the boy as a thief and force his father to fire Ali, freeing his conscience from recalling his cowardice and betrayal. In 1979, the Russians invaded Afghanistan and Baba and Amir escaped to Pakistan. In 1988, they have a simple life in Fremont, California, when Amir graduates from a public college because of Baba's pride and joy. Later, Amir meets his compatriot Soraya (Atossa Leoni) and they get married. In 2000, after Baba's death, Amir is a famous novelist and receives a phone call from the Rahim Khan terminal, which reveals secrets about his family, forcing Amir to return to Peshawar, Pakistan, on a journey of redemption. I'm not familiar with Afghan culture and have not read this novel despite my daughter's recommendation, and yesterday I decided to watch this movie on DVD. I found a good story of loyalty, cowardice, betrayal, and redemption, with a brief insight into Afghanistan's recent history, from a period of peace in the 1970s to the present day with the Taliban. Actors and actresses have great performances, giving credibility to the realistic story. The arid places in China are reminiscent of the images we see on television in Afghanistan. In the end, I found "The Kite Runner" a good movie. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title: "The Pipe Hunter"
