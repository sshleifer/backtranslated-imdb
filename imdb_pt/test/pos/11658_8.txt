I read the book before watching the movie, and the film is one of the best adaptations out there. Very true and faithful to the book. Sean Penn and Sarandon are incredible. Robbins is a talented filmaker and I would like him to add more to his repertoire. He made the film very scary and intentionally slow to add depth. A little special filmaking was the reflection of the victims appearing on the glass of the execution room at the end.
