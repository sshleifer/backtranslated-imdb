If Western Union is not exactly the true story of building the Transcontinental Telegraph, it certainly captures the spirit and dedication of the people involved with the project. <br /> <br /> Dean Jagger is the man in charge and one fine day he is thrown off a horse and holds up some fractured ribs. A fugitive thug, Randolph Scott, finds Jagger and is ready to steal his horse, but changes his mind and brings Jagger to help. Later, he is hired by Western Union and works for Jagger. <br /> <br /> Jagger also hires an Eastern teenager played by Robert Young, who is an engineer. Young is making one of his few films borrowed from MGM for 20th Century Fox. Both Young and Scott become friends but rivals Jagger's sister, Virginia Gilmore. <br /> <br /> Western Union has plenty of action, enough to satisfy any western fan. The telegraph crew have to deal with the criminals, Indians and their labor problems in the garden. <br /> <br /> Slim Summerville as the timid cook and Victor Killian as the designated border character to guard it has some of the funniest scenes. Both provide good comic relief. <br /> <br /> Fritz Lang got good performances from his cast and kept the film moving. Western Union is a solid western entertainment.
