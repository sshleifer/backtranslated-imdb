It does not look like it was from a fantasy movie. The film is dark, with dark tones. The soundtrack was very exciting to the point of meddling in the visuals. I'm sure they were aiming at something militant, but it just did not work out. The scene in which Astin is trying to escape is a perfect example. Why does it sound like the Goonies? There's no comedy, there's no glow about it !! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is great, and the acting is very good too. I liked everyone's performances. It is available in the Netflix online view. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing, but write your own soundtrack !!
