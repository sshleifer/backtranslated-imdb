I saw this when it was first shown, so I'm not very objective about it. He really managed to scare me, partly because it was so late at night, but partly because of all this feeling of a videotaped suspense story (the same thing that helped Dark Shadows himself). And the cast was so right. I barely know Shane Briant of anything else, so it may not be so sure to call him "well-done," but to me, he is Dorian Gray. And for the other male actors, the one who fit so well was Nigel Davenport (who is as good at characters "bigger than life") than Sir Henry. And John Karlen, a kind of "repertoire" of Dan Curtis at the time, because of Dark Shadows. As a poster points out, this version manages to include the engagements with the men, in a rather subtle way. The scene in which Dorian recites a list of men's names for John Karlen's character as a way to blackmail him, and the expression on Karlen's face, have been very well done. (If that scene were made now, it would probably be done in a TOO-OBVIOUS way, and it would be bad in comparison.) I saw when "Dorian Gray" was just a name for me, let alone more so than even the famous version of 1945 (which is justly famous), this is the version for me.
