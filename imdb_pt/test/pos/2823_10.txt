This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for other people. Her physically aggressive behavior is more common in men than in women, so I felt even more uncomfortable in seeing the behavior of the leading actress. I think women can think about this behavior, but I do not think they act on it. The dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfactory solution, but that did not happen. Maybe that's more realistic. Life seems to run in the same direction instead of creating a new riverbed up the hill.
