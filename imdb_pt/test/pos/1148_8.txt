<br /> <br /> Medium adventure movie that took a serious story and "Holywood" it. The weakened effect made particularly for the common script has taken the place of this film as a classic solid. Why dilute such a great plot? Probably because it deals with "sensitive" colonial issues and producers do not want to create political warmth, only quick profits thank. The direction, cinematography and soundtrack and acting was good. The script was Connery's charm made up for his wrong Arabic accent and all scenes with President T. Roosevelt were masterpieces. The costumes / settings here were very good. Too bad, we have not had a serious historical drama anymore, since what the story requires. Just for big fans of the main actors or fans of exotic films Romance / Adventure Holywood .....
