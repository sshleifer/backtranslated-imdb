Empire of Passion begins deceptively - that is, if you are expecting it to be a horror movie. It's like a riff on the Postman Always Touches by James M. Cain Twice, first: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is the mother of two children and an obedient, hard-working wife in Rickshaw Gisaburo driver (Takahiro Tamura). But when he's not around, and she's at home with the baby, Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) arrives to bring some gifts to Seki ... and a little more. They are soon sleeping together, but after he does something to her (let's just say a "shave"), he knows he will find out, and immediately proposes that they kill Gisaburo. They drink him, strangle him, and then throw him into the pit. Of course, this will come back to haunt them - but that's literally at least for them (at first Seki super-terrified and only later Toyoji skeptic), changes the gears to the 'Kaidan', a Japanese ghost story < br. /> <br /> This is a movie in which horror does not come simply from "oh, ghost, ah", but from the total fear that builds itself for the characters. In a way there is the mechanics of a film-noir in the whole work, if only vaguely translated through a Japanese village of the 19th century, as opposed to an American city or small town (ie the snooping cop, the "evidence" possibly found by another, word getting around, suspicions aroused, etc). It's convincing because Seiko really was against the plan from the start, manipulated by lascivious but ill-prepared Toyoji, and her reactions to the re-apparitions of Gisaburo are astonishing to her. Take what comes closest to the poetry: the ghost of Gisaburo, the light blue face and, most of all, the cold and silent look, causes Seiko to enter the rickshaw. She reluctantly does, and he pushes her on a road she does not know, in the first hours before dawn, surrounded by smoke. Most Japanese ghost stories want to make them have a harrowing atmosphere. <br /> <br /> While this is getting hysterical to the end, there is so much here that director Oshima manages to make this a different job. After hitting him in the world of international cinema with In the Realm of the Senses (which, ironically, was banished in his own country), he did something that, he said, was even bolder as 'Senses'. Maybe he was right; Empire of the Passion has less graphic sexual content than its predecessor (also starring Tatsuya Fuji, a magnificently physical actor with a huge range of range), but his bold lies in crafting a world of dread. You can believe in ghosts in this story, but you also have to believe how far your two lovebirds will go. The detective espionage or the gossiping town people are the least of your worries. The fate of their souls is at stake <br /> <br /> And Oshima takes what in other hands could be merely juicy pulp (sadly, it would not surprise me if an American remake already in the works was) and craft shot after gorgeous shot, with the repetition working their way to mis-en-sc√®ne (ie the shots of Seiko and Toyoji walking on the road, the camera to a Dutch angle, the world tilted and surround them in a somber blue tone ) as well as some moves that affect that will stay with me long after I finish writing this (ie, Toyoji throwing the leaves by a hand in the pit in slow motion, or as Seiko The naked body is revealed after it stays blind). It is to dare to lie in connecting at one level of the spirit - not to be confused with the spiritual, although there may be something to it as well - about the connections of life and death with one another, inextricably. It's a classic waiting to be discovered.
