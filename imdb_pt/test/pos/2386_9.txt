I saw some Fred Carpenter movies on Showtime, Pay Per View and Video / DVD and I enjoyed most of these movies especially with a few beers, (Carpenter knows how to entertain) "EDDIE MONROE" and "DEAD INNOCENCE" are my favorites. I recently saw a DVD of "EDDIE MONROE" and everything from the cast to the plot and direction, everything worked fine. (Doug Brown's score was sensational.) I liked seeing Frank Sivero ("Goodfellas", "New York, New York" and "The Wedding Singer"), he's an incredible and very underrated actor. But I especially liked the performance of Paul Vario, who played Uncle Benny, I looked at his acting credits on IMDb and discovered that this was his first lead role. Where this guy was! Give Fred Carpenter credit for discovering the Great New Talent, it's only a matter of time you'll see this guy with Pacino and DeNiro. As I mentioned Carpenter knows how to entertain you and when you're working on a limited budget, it's amazing what Carpenter can produce (I read the interview MAGAZINE VENT and Carpenter never made a movie for over $ 400,000.00 dollars) Before I watch "EDDIE MONROE" I saw "Rocky Balboa" and "The Good Shepherd" both great movies. "Eddie Monroe" took me to an amazing ending because of a very good script, good performances from the entire cast (Craig Morris is a movie star waiting to happen and actress Jessica Tsunis was hot!) Great Cinematography, Direction and Sheet Music by Doug Brown. As I stated recently I saw "Rocky Balboa" and "The Good Shepherd" if I were to write a commentary on these two films I would be saying some of the same things I have said about "EDDIE MONROE", the only thing that those two films very good ones do not have in common with "Eddie Monroe", they do not cost a few hundred thousand. Great movie and I did not even drink a beer.
