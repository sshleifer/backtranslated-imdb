This movie was probably the best "scary movie" I've seen in years. refrigeration may be a more accurate description. the ending was unexpected and so caught me by surprise. if it has any flaws, it would be the excessive use of the whole meaning of the concept of life. since no one really knows this answer, you definitely navigate in murky waters when you incorporate this concept into a movie. let it go and the film is very nice. Pope Carly must emerge as one of the next bright young stars of the film industry. the rest of the cast was a bit unstable, however, since the focus was on sara novak (Pope Carly), her performance anchored the film. the acting skills of his co-stars were not a problem at times, since it was not his performances that fueled this film. (thankfully). watch this movie you should have fun. <br /> <br />
