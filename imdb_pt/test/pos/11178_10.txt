Intended to be a classic before even being conceptualized. This game deserves all the recognition it deserves. At a time when first-person shooters such as the Quake III Arena and Unreal Tournament are attracting all the attention of computer gamers, graphic adventures are an endangered breed. With great pun and humor, The Curse of Monkey Island is a game that people of all age groups could enjoy. Life can only improve after playing The Curse of Monkey Island. * prediction * the sequel Escape from Monkey Island is already destined to be a classic as well. I guarantee that.
