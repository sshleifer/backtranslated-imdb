I've seen this movie more than once. It's not the best science fiction movie I've ever seen, but it's not a bad movie. The acting is good and the characters are more "real" than most in low-budget science fiction. (At least it's not full of idiot bimbos like so many other low budget scifi.) I especially like Elizabeth Pena. She is a good actress and worries single mom, just like any other and better than some. <br /> <br /> Do not let non-liars make you run away. See for yourself and judge for yourself.
