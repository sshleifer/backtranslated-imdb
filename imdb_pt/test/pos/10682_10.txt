Gerry Anderson's first live action foray into a great movie that benefits from the incredible work of the FX model and a great soundtrack from Barry Gray. Analog coil-to-reel computers in the distant year "2069" (I think Anderson really wanted a safe date 100 years later!) They are a joke to see, just like the fashion of guru's jackets, but easily accuse 2001 of same violations, but no one could predict some things as they result. This movie was the stepping stone for the UFO series the following year, and in fact not only had the same FX people, and producers, but many of the cast were regular on this show. <br /> <br /> It always comes out as a future of "alternative history" more than anything else - the "Apollo-like" rocket used on takeoff, it always seems like this is actually another planet than Earth. Given the "alternating earth" plot, one could assume that it was the feeling they wanted. We end up with an ending that raises more questions than answers. This is because the "other land" exists all movement, event and thing said is duplicated as is happening in the two worlds. Because of this, and the sun in the middle, the two versions of the same person (in this case, Glenn Ross, astronaut) will never be able to meet. A complete accident discovered the planet in the first place, when it would probably have been kept secret forever. <br /> <br /> Shot mostly in Portugal with the FX work in England, it's a must-own for any fan of Gerry Anderson. I have the bare bones DVD image a few years ago now out of print, but it is hoped that Universal will re-release it with, perhaps extras and even a commentary by Gerry Anderson.
