I always wanted to see this movie and the first three rooms proved that I had not waited in vain. But what the hell happened in the end? I mean, do not get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie. It definitely left me nostalgic for the real and unique NYC of the 80's that we lost thanks to Giuliani. But it's another half hour!
