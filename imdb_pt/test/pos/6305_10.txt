Maybe my rating should have been 9, but the movie surprised me when I first watched and my last showing confirmed my initial belief. Sleek indeed, each scene has sculpted scope visions, formidable angles with a perfect sounding side that accompanies them. <br /> <br /> Put on top great performance especially Toni Servillo, garner this with one of the most beautiful and charming women in Olivia Magnani, and a good plot and you will end up seeing this little masterpiece over and over. <br /> <br /> Paulo Sorrentinos next film "L'Amico De Famiglia", which is in competition at the Cannes Film Festival this year, will be eagerly awaited.
