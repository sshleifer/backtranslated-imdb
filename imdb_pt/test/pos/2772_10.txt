I love this movie. is in the air anymore? What can I do to get back on the air because I miss this movie when this movie is broadcast again? I really love this movie. Anyone know how long it's been since it was the last one at Disney? It's been a long, long time and I'm so tired of waiting! I want to see Susie Q again. I swear, they take all the good movies out of the air and play new stupid gays who are fake and retarded. I miss this movie, I wish for a star, Kazaam with Shaquille O'neil and more. Where have all the good movies gone? I want them back. I miss all the good movies and they do not have them anymore. If anyone finds out if Susie Q or any other old Disney movie come out, please let me know, my email is girlygirl148@aol.com girlygirl (no blank) 148. thank you and hope you want this movie back also. Have a great day
