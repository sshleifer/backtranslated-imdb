Not being a fan of the Coen brothers or George Clooney, anyone can see the skepticism I took to the theater. Once again, someone in Hollywood dares to create something different. This time it was these zanie (for a temporary lack of a better word) Coens doing "their things" with one of the great works of literary history. Who would have thought Homer had this in mind? I do not know where this movie will fit into the Hollywood history books, but it will be in mine and in many other DVD or VHS libraries. It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over. The story is brilliantly written. Clean and fun with a pair of Gumpesque brushes with fame, great performances by Clooney, Turturro, Nelson and a brief but hilarious, Holly Hunter. Born in Mississippi and raised in other parts of the South, I wish more people would mock us like that. They even invoke a soundtrack appropriate to the rural south. You're not doing anything better this weekend, go see this movie! <br /> <br />
