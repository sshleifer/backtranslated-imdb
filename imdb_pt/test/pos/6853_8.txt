(spoilers?) <br /> <br /> I've heard some complaints about special effects. But that should hurt the movie. The movie is a thriller. And you're very good at it. So, from this point of view, this movie rocks. Franke rocks. Enjoy the contents of plastic hearts. So there are no complaints for this movie. Unless you watch the English dub, that's a total fake. Creates the illusion that it's a B movie. <br /> <br /> One complaint I have is the music video on the DVD. It does not say who sings. I would love to know. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 5/10
