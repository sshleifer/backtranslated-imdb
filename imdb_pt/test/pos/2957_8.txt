Clayton Moore made his last official screen appearance as the Masked Man in director Lesley Selander's epic adventure "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold," co-starring Jay Silverheels as his faithful Indian scout Tonto. Selander was a veteran of directing Western movies during his 40 years in movies and television, with more than 100 faroens to his credit as a director. This fast-paced horse opera has embraced a revisionist perspective in its portrayal of Native Americans who have gradually gained acceptance since 1950 in Hollywood oysters after director Delmar Daves pioneered James Stewart's Western "Broken Arrow." Racial intolerance figures as the main theme in the script by Robert Schaefer and Eric Freiwald. Having written 13 episodes of the television series "The Lone Ranger", Schaefer and Freiwald were completely familiar with the formula, but they increased the stakes for this theatrical tour. Our vigilant heroes ride to the rescue of the Indians being murdered by white men hooded for no apparent reason. The mystery about the identities of these killers and the reason behind their homicidal behavior is revealed very early, so you do not have to guess what is happening. <br /> <br /> Although the violence in this Selander saga seems to be docile contemporary standards, the fact that the Lone Ranger shoots a villain to kill in a scene instead of wounded and that a vile dame kills a double accomplice passing by when he threw an ax that sank into his back between his shoulder blades was quite audacious. The television series never got to that size, and when the Lone Ranger wielded its six-piston gun, it fired the weapon from the villain's fist instead of throwing it away. The other discrepancy here is that the Indians lynch one of the invaders and torture him for information, but they are never accused of kidnapping that henchman. Douglas Kennedy did not have the villainous Lyle Bettger statue that threatened the Masked Man in director Stuart Heisler's "The Lone Ranger", but he acquits himself enough as a cowardly outlaw who kills one of his unscrupulous henchmen when the thug threatens to divulge his name and the identities of his cronies to a band of vengeful Indians. <br /> <br /> "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold" opens with a recap of the origins of the masked protagonist as a Texas Ambushed Ranger and his transformation into the Lone Ranger with Tonto serving as his helper. This two-minute opening update is a great way to get a series-oriented character so everyone, including non-Lone Ranger fans, are on an equal footing. The main plot about a gang wearing white relentless hoods and not surprisingly called the hooded attackers begins with them killing Indians and stealing used medallions around their necks. Lone Ranger and Tonto arrive too late to intervene, but they find a baby hidden nearby. Taking the baby and the dead Indian, they ride to a nearby Spanish mission, overseen by Father Vincente Esteban (Ralph Moody, from "The Outsider"), and take the baby and body to him. Initially, Father has to secure an Indian maiden, Paviva (Lisa Montell from "Gaby"), that the masked man does them no harm and is his friend. Father sends Tonto to the city to get the doctor, Dr. James Rolfe (Dean Fredericks of "Gun Fever"), and Tonto quickly gets into trouble in the shape of the city sheriff, Sheriff Oscar Matthison (Charles Watts of "Giant "), which abhors the Indians. Tonto tries to see the doctor who is treating prisoners in the sheriff's prison, and Matthison's men begin to assault him when Rolfe intervenes and returns to the mission. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the Lone Ranger and Tonto are able to capture one of the Hooded Raiders, but an Indian Redbird (Maurice Jara of "Drum Beat"), and his brave companions will kidnap the henchmen and take him back to your village. They stab him and shoot arrows at him to loosen his tongue. Chief villain Ross Brady (Douglas Kennedy of "Hell's Crossroads") and his group William (Lane Bradford of "Devil's Canyon") ride to the village and Brady uses his Winchester to kill his captured henchman. Little Brady knows that his henchman spoke. The Lone Ranger and the Fool arrive shortly afterwards and rebuke Redbird for his treachery. Redbird tells them what the man said before he died and Lone Ranger decides to adopt a cover so he can learn more. He disguises himself as a bounty hunter gentleman with mustache and fake Southern accent. <br /> <br /> Despite its concise 83-minute runtime, "The Lonely Rider and the Lost City of Gold" has no excitement or surprises. Selander keeps the action going at full gallop. The dialogue is largely expository and not memorable, as Schaefer and Freiwald push the plot forward more often than spring surprises, but there is a big surprise that relates to the good Indian theme. There is also a scene in which the Lone Ranger pushes its own creed over the justice available to everyone under the law at a time when Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren embarked on the historic decisions of the High Court that recognized and mitigated the conditions of racial segregation , civil rights, separation of church and state, and police detention proceedings in the United States. One thing that differentiates "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold" from its predecessor is its epic scale with flashbacks from the era of Spanish conquistadors, with a bit of science fiction involved in the form of a destructive meteor. Generally, the Lone Ranger stories are limited to the 19th century without dragging in European history. No, the Lone Ranger was not the first film to deal with the Spanish conquerors. "The Seven Golden Cities" (1955) by Robert D. Webb concerned the Spaniards who searched the southwest for the homonymous places, but Selander's western hit Gordon Douglas's "Gold of the Seven Saints" (1961) on the screen .
