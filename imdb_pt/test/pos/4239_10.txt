GREAT MOVIE! Chucky is by far the funniest character in a movie. Jennifer Tilly (Tiffany) makes this movie even better! Long before Chucky died, Tiffany and he were together. But as ten years later, Tiffany gets Chucky back (like a doll) and brings him back to life. It was a great movie! Creepy and definitely funny (just because Chucky!)
