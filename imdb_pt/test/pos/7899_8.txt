let's face it, you know what to expect when you tune into a post-1990 film Corey Feldman, there are probably breasts, guns and cars. Saying this, there is more to this film than just naked women (sorry to say) because it is mainly people being killed in a variety of unusual things, and as the name suggests, often 'mystical'. I love low quality horror, and I love this movie. If you do not, you probably will not. but I think it's worth most people to take a chance, it's not too bad it's going to ruin your weekend or something. All in all, if your good irrational fun, a bit of corpse love and an 80's childhood superstar you're in the mood for, then you've come to the right place. It's a cracker !!!!
