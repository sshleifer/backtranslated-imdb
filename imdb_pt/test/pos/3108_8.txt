Both Jackie and Candice are great in this movie. They are suitable for their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular, the way Candice utters the words "Puerto Rican" is very funny, since she is kind but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie, called "Old Acquaintance," starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They supposedly did not get along, so because the film is about female friendship, this may have been a problem. Here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other. Hart Bochner and Meg Ryan have supporting parts and are excellent, in particular Bochner, who has never had many decent parts in movies, as far as I'm concerned. George Cukor did not make another movie after that, so it was a good time to leave.
