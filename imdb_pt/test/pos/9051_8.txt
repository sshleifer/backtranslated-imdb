This 60-minute film shows how much fun the movie can be. It's all very entertaining, since it's an unrestricted comedy attack on the Star Trek genre. In "Hick Trek - The Moovie," a group of good boys are on a mission to prevent a group of renegade cats from destroying the entire Redneck Federation. <br /> <br /> Can Captain Jerk stop the Fluffy villain? with the power of the Bovine RSS and is Cow Ray ?? She may have nine lives, but he has ten bullets! This cult classic (formerly seen only in science fiction conventions) is a party favorite. Many funny moments!
