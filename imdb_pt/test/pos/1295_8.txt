Having seen other Bollywood movies with Salman Khan, I can say that this is my favorite of the latest. The songs are a lot of fun, especially "The Priya Priya," which seems to have a good mix of Beatles, Indian music and (I dare say) a little Prince. Love stories are a bit more believable than, say, Chal Mere Bhai. The occasional focus on alcohol use by Prem is sometimes troublesome, as it does not seem to make much sense to me, but it is well touched by Khan - though his voice becomes raucous when he is portraying drunkenness.
