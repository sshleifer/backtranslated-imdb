A Fool wounded alone to protect three innocent lives. A dishonest woman plotting a deadly plot. Racial tension. Intelligent Indians. <br /> <br /> These are things we rarely see in the TV series, but this movie adds them all to the mix. While this is certainly a Lone Ranger movie, it mixes the formula just enough so that those who get tired of the series probably still like it. Definitely recommended for any fan.
