Typical Spanish production - slow, but with great sensuality and sexuality that flows from the main actress Paz Vega. (Watch it in "Spanglish"). Great sets, lots of color - you get to see Cordoba, Seville, mountains and Spanish countryside. The plot tends to meander here and there, but if you follow closely (I did it, even if the film is in Spanish), you get the gist of it. <br /> <br /> It's about how much a young and sensual gypsy woman, Carmen, uses her feminine wiles to entice men to do what she wants. Carmen is being taken to jail after assaulting a colleague of cigarettes at the cigar factory where she works. She persuades Joseph, the soldier to take her to prison, to let her escape. Jose succumbs to his charms because he speaks Basque (he is Navarrese and speaks the same language). Jose is punished for 1 month in prison and relegated to infantry soldier. Later, he meets Carmen at a party and they end up becoming lovers. But Carmen refuses to commit to him and continues her lascivious and seductive lifestyle. In an envious rage, José kills a fellow soldier who was with Carmen. They then have to leave the city. Life on the run turns Joseph into a thug. Carmen, however, remains the same, a wildly promiscuous woman. In the end, José loses his head and ends up killing Carmen. <br /> <br /> The story is told by Joseph in jail, waiting to be executed. The person to whom he tells the story is Prospero Merrime, French writer and anthropologist, whose fancy clock (he plays Beethoven's Fur Elise) was stolen by both Carmen and Jose. <br /> <br /> It is worth watching sets and the delicious Paz Vega.
