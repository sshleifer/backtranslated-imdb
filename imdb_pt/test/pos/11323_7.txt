The BBC and HBO teamed up to create "Dirty War," a 90-minute TV movie about a "dirty bomb" terror attack in London. The film starts working quickly as it involves both the terrorist and the government's anti-terrorist efforts in the film, leaving little room for human-interest subplots. On the terrorist side, we followed the bomb from the smuggling of radioactive materials to assembly and detonation. On the government side, we see PR and training exercises, intelligence gathering and analysis, interdiction, post-detonation response, and follow-up. The film also gives an idea of ​​how Al-Qaeda-type terrorist cells are organized, radical Islamic terrorist mentality and terrorist strategies. A sort of anatomy of a "dirty bomb" incident, "Dirty War" will answer many questions lurking from an increasingly aware audience of this insidious threat. (B)
