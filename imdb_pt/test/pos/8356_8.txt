Where do I start? Walt Disney's happiest movie, "Lady and the Tramp," is one of, if not possibly, my favorite in the theatrical canon of Disney animation. The sequel, however, is ... to say the least, pleasant. I had fun all through the movie. It was, (shield against flames!) Adorable! The Broadway style of the songs and the movie worked, and I was humming the songs for the rest of the night. I can, if you asked me, still sing all the songs. <br /> <br /> But where the movie was (really) good for me, it was bad in many other places. The animation was kind of scary at times. Every time there was a close-up of someone's face, I do not know ... it seemed scary to me. Besides, where the hell was Lady? She stands as two lines of dialogue and just hugs Doggy Scamp at the end. She gets 0% interaction with the plot and her only son! <br /> <br /> But, after all, I liked it. Compared to the original, does it hold? No. The songs are not so good (although they are catchy), the plot was much less complicated, Lady had almost nothing to do with it, and is not as cute as the first. But if you enter with an open mind, you'll have fun and maybe "choke"! I like that?
