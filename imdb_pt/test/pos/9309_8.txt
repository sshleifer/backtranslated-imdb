It's rare that a film covers both the problem-solving process and a fantastically comprehensive moral dilemma. And be a reasonably accurate historical film, but Fat Man and Little Boy take that trick. <br /> <br /> History of the Manhattan Project - the WWII effort to build the atomic bomb, told as the conflict between the two men who made it happen, Gen. Leslie Groves and Robert Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> Historical figures are a great study of opposites: military vs. civil, practical versus idealistic, emotional versus scientific, brute force versus consensus-based solution of problems, immediacy vs. long-term vision. A fictional character, played by John Cusack, is added as a sort of synthesis of the two historical figures, to show humanity that strangely escapes the real people (and, of course, obligatory love interest, played by Laura Dern). One looking for a straightforward documentary may criticize the lapses of melodrama (and occasional looseness with the facts, but that's Hollywood for you), but the purpose of fiction is to synthesize and galvanize events into more universal truths, so I think it can to be forgiven <br /> <br /> One of the great visuals of the film is when Oppenheimer witnesses the first atomic explosion: it is made entirely through his reaction, and considering the impressive visuals inherent in an atomic explosion, he is a brave and fully effective . way to describe in a single moment the ambivalent effect in humans of releasing such power (the sort of thing lost in the typical version of Hollywood's history). The use of the song is particularly excellent in the last third of the film. <br /> <br /> Quite accessible and highly recommended as a historical film and drama of the highest order.
