Based on a true story, Charlie Wilson's War tells the story of a Texas congressman and a CIA agent working to secure secret support for the Mujaheddin in Afghanistan in the 1980s after the invasion of the country by the USSR . This conflict played an important role in the final years of the Cold War between the US and the USSR. <br /> <br /> In terms of film production, Charlie Wilson's War is a definite winner. It's well written, well acted and well filmed. While most of the attention was given to Tom Hanks for another good performance, I was even more impressed by the turn of Philip Seymour Hoffman as CIA agent Gust Avrakotos. Scenes of Soviet attacks on demotivated villages and the refugee camp effectively provoke the heart. The film also takes a good look behind the scenes of the direction and negotiation Congressman Wilson must make to secure the desired funding. <br /> <br /> There are, however, two complaints I have about the film. The first is that there is a subplot involving a scandal investigation that is not well developed and as such serves only as a minor distraction to the plot. The second complaint is that the film does not have a bit of the context of the war. The film makes the Mujaheddin seem innocent victims and, despite suffering heavy civilian casualties, the Mujaheddin were actually rebels who were trying to overthrow the Afghan government. This government, entirely ignored in the film, did not surprisingly struggle to suppress the rebellion, later appealing to the Soviet Union for support in its effort. The film also ignores that the US was helping the Mujaheddin before the Soviet deployment in Afghanistan. The film suggested the unintended consequences of our secret actions - consequences we are still feeling today - but it seems that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Mike Nichols were willing to sacrifice some historical context to provide a cohesive narrative. (Not having read the book, I do not know if George Crile made the same commitment.) Despite these complaints, I enjoyed watching the Charlie Wilson War and I commend it. I would prefer a film that more accurately portrays the complexities of the situation, as Stephen Gaghan did in Syriana, but the audience connected better with the cohesive narrative of Charlie Wilson's War than with the ambiguities present in Syriana.
