I took the first showing of Driving Lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival. Rupert Grint shows that he can act beyond Harry Potter. Laura Linney is amazing as the dominating mother. Julie Walters is hilarious as Dame Evie Walton, with a mouth worse than a sailor. I hope this film is chosen by an American distributor so that everyone can see it. This movie is not just about driving lessons but life lessons. Ben (Rupert Grint) is torn between wanting to obey his mother and father vicar and wanting to live his own life. It's an incredible movie, from an incredible director, who took his own life and put it on the screen for everyone to see, and everyone who can, should.
