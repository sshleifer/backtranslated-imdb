The first time I saw this movie I was a kid. I was ten when it was released, but since my family never went to the movies, I saw it on Rede TV. I remember watching on my own and crying later. It was only the second film that illegitimated this response (Rocky was the first) and there have not been many since. I can not say exactly why; Larry "Rain" Murphy did not deserve to win more than Rocky Balboa or anyone else. I know I admired Murphy, not so much for what he did, but for the way he did his time. Stoic. He did not need a timer or freedom to find dignity. He ran because he could. He did not need another reason. I have a rule today, that when I watch this movie late at night on cable television (the only time most will come across this) I need to watch it no matter what I have to do the next morning. Fortunately, he does not play as Shawshank Redemption or other favorites, so I still sleep a lot and never get tired of the history of imprisonment and the unrepentant personal victory of a man.
