My skateboarding career ended in 1974, when my two-in-four skate with steel roller wheels hit a rock and I fell, for days, on the sidewalk outside my parents' house in Boston. When the cast left my arm, the summer is gone. <br /> <br /> But I've always admired the types of X-games and surfers, especially. I think I spent the first month after I moved to Southern California, on the beaches and piers, watching the surfers, lamenting the fact that I lost my call. It's the kind of thing you should learn young, before the awful feelings of self-preservation and self-awareness creep in. Or at best, you'll be so worried about not getting hurt or laughing, like a trained bear. <br /> <br /> I always admired how a good surfer seems to care about nothing beyond that moment, this wave, that experience. In one with the forces of nature. A good surfer makes it appear that there is nothing besides this wave right there, and the way you interact with it. There is a lot of Zen for me. <br /> <br /> This documentary describes how some young people adopted the concepts of surfing and extended them to skateboarding. Ramps, downgrades, low curves while interacting with the waves of cement beneath your feet. In its day and time, all this was new. radical. Before the Zephyr Skate team, the idea was apparently to go as fast as possible in a straight line on a skateboard, so my long "Evel Knievel at Caesers Palace" as if it were falling forward. <br /> <br /> This film is a retrospective over time, to an America before EVERYTHING was labeled, marketed, marketed and forced to swallow our throat as "Extreme." (Seriously, what's so "extreme" about an "extreme value meal" at Taco Bell? Apart from the fact that it's an extreme danger to your colon ...) Watch this movie and watch the movie. birth of 'extreme sports'. Before there was an X-games, before the Boom-boom Huck-Jam, before Crusty Demons, before the ASA ... there were these young street urchins who created "extreme sports" without really trying. They were just doing it for purity, the sheer pleasure of skateboarding in the sun with friends. <br /> <br /> I hope they have a slice of 'extreme' money out there. God knows they do not get the credit they deserve. Maybe this movie can fix this. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie with a great soundtrack, a picture of a Southern California, actually an America, which no longer exists. <br /> <br /> I do not know. take care of Sean Penn, but he does a decent job narrating.
