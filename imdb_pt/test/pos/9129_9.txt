Just like in Rififi, the most appealing scene in the movie is the perfect silence of stealing jewelry. The scene is masterful in its execution, each of the thieves having their own skilled work to perform, each successfully matching his own unique talent towards the goal, and each of them, until a month before, complete strangers. <br /> Many scenes unfold very slowly. In fact, the opening scene is a long character introduction to Corey and Vogel while we see Corey being released from prison and Vogel escaping from capture on his way to prison. The two characters are then meticulously gathered through the destination at a roadside restaurant while Vogel hides inside the trunk of Corey's automobile. From this unlikely breakup, the two strangers agree to become partners to commit a perfect and precise jewel stroke. <br /> <br /> However, to pull this assault they must include the help of a third man named Jansen. Jansen is hired as the right man. Their inclusion in the mix was an interesting and desperate choice. At the time of his hiring, Jansen is in a complete battle with DT and spent most of the day in his crib hallucinating about lizards, snakes and spiders. His transition from the disheveled and hallucinatory world of William S. Burroughs' dream to the firm and sober shooter is very fast and perhaps the only true false moment in the movie, but that's just me being extremely picky. </ P> <p> Another slightly false statement was that of police inspector Mattei. At times he seemed to be brilliant at putting the right people together or gathering information and waiting for his prisoner to escape to make his move. At other times he seemed to have spent ten years of retirement, especially at the beginning, during Vogel's escape through the forest. <br /> <br /> I wonder if I have much hidden meaning since the beginning of the movie. At the beginning of the film, as the police car is speeding through the city, the first image we see is that of a red light. My first thought was that this may be the 'red circle' and that if I want to find a deeper meaning in the movie, maybe it's that car, or rather the people inside it going through the red light, it will be the ones that go ' stop "the theft of jewelry. Hmmmm <br /> <br /> Maybe the red circle refers to the triumvirate thieving ring? Maybe it was the sled on fire? Does not matter. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but it does not look like that. The ending is a little disappointing. He seemed very rushed for a movie that looked like a slow burn so delicious. 9/10 <br /> <br /> Clark Richards
