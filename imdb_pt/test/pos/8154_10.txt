I watched this movie on television LOGO today. I was absolutely delighted with the powerful messages and plot within this movie. I do not want to ruin everything. I'll say it, I related to Aaron's inner struggle and his upbringing. As a gay man growing up in a small town, I related very well to the "big secret" and the choices I made. This movie made a huge impact on me and I plan to buy a copy of it in the very near future for my personal library. I no more than finished the movie and started calling my friends to recommend it. This had a profound effect on me. For those who read this review. WATCH THAT. Try to have as little distraction as possible. Also, keep an open mind. This is not a movie that can be seen as a Disney movie or the movie of the week. Instead, take the time to actively watch and listen to the dialogue as well as read between the lines and get involved in the plot. You may find yourself in tears. Not since "Steel Magnolias" have I been tearfully taken for a movie. This did just that. Thanks to the cast, writer and staff for producing an emotionally charged romantic movie about homosexuality and religion. You're too late.
