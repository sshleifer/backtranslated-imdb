Ah, Batman Returns, is it possible to have a sequel almost as good as the original? With Batman Returns, it came very close! We have great actors and a great plot with the dark knight and two new villains, Catwoman and The Penguin. We have Michael Keaton back as Batman and he is still amazing than ever. Michelle Pfieffer, the perfect choice for Catwoman and was perfectly placed in place. As much as I love and is such an amazing actress Annette Benning, she could not have been Catwoman, she really does not have the look. Danny DeVito, who could imagine him as the penguin? He was terrific and terrifying! <br /> <br /> Batman returns with a more loving community of Gotham City, they are celebrating Christmas with Max Shrek, played by a creepy Christopher Walken. The perfect villain who mistreats his lovely secretary, Selina, who happens to hear a lot in his office, causing him to push her out of the window in the hope that she will die and never reveal the information of knowing the Penguin and the attempt to do loved him. Gotham When she survives and is awakened by cats, she wants revenge and is ready to attack with her cats! But there is also another active villain, the penguin who is in search of his parents who abandoned him and now he is looking to be the new mayor of Gotham City! Can Batman be able to prevent both super villains from creating their abominable acts and prevent the mayor from destroying the city as well? <br /> <br /> You'll have to see! Batman Returns is as good as the original Batman, despite the first being the real classic, this still takes you for a ride. And come on, I mean we have Michelle in leather! Your classic time to meet Batman and The Penguin "Meow" is classic! There are memorable characters, lines and sets! You're going to have a blast! Trust me! <br /> <br /> 9/10
