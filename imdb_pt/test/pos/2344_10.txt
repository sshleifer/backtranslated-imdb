I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a festival last year and a half I expected it to be released. The fact that it was filmed on a digital camcorder certainly inhibited its success, but as I understand it, it was never the filmmaker's intention to make him look like FILM, in the first place, it was more about the story of the characters and their filming . relationships. Is not that what movies should be? But it had a quality in the texture of its visual appearance that suggests that May Thomas is on something we should pay attention to. For independent filmmakers and producers who have the talent and do not have money and disposition, much can be learned watching this film, technically it has everything for that, the use of light, music, etc. far outweighs that of any other digital film I have ever seen and therefore is worthy of much praise. The performances of the actors are believable to some extent, if not a little less played, I felt that there was much more there, more depth, particularly the male protagonist John Paul Clarke. But one thing that really bothers me, as a filmmaker, is the film being black and white a necessity to cover up a multitude of sins than if it were color? Do we have more to learn in the progression of digital technology? Or is this the future of producing wonderful and accessible films?
