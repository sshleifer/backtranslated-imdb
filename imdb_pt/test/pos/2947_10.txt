Fantastic documentary. A movie inside a movie. I'm so happy that Block forged after his mother's death. It makes a wonder about the time and money spent on therapy. What could have happened if she did not have that exit? Did the therapist help you or did you just create a dependency that kept your bank account flushed? The public needs to understand that divorce was less an option in those days. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or for professional training. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation. I wonder if the therapist ever tried to get her to think about what she might have done to change her situation and break free? Meanwhile, wife # 2 was the exact opposite. She was out there, working with his father; finished his bad marriage, supported himself and seems to be a very confident and generous person. Whatever the state of marriage, the Blocks did something right in raising 3 children who could see the story of their parents, agree and share with us, and perhaps lead us to start conversations with our parents and spouses.
