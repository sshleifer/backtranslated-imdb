I agree with Aussie's comments for the most part. However, there id seems to be a rather decent if not original plot. Christina (Kelli McCarty) inherits a rural property that she intends to open a mountain hut. She meets up with Chip (Bobby Johnston) whom she knew when she was growing up inside. The plot thickens when James (Paul Logan) arrives with his new friend stripper, Shene (Devinn Lane) because Christina had been James's stripper friend in years past, and the implication is that James did it somehow wrong. To add interest to the film Sophia Linn (Monique Parent), a novelist appears as a guest at the hotel, as well as Eric (Sebastien Guy) and Linda (Flower), the city's lawyers. James socks the local building code inspector on Christina's business as one of his dirty tricks to close it. So the question is, "How far will James go to sabotage the store and will he succeed?" <br /> <br /> Pay attention to Devinn Lane here and Beauty Betrayed. She seems to be making a transition from the hard core business to the "R" world. Another notable one is Samantha McConnell, playing the role of "Bait", clearly the name of the most scandalous character in the movies!
