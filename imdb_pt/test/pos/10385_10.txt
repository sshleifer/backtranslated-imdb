it looks like the betting movie I've seen. not much for intelligent perception but so rich for sensitive perception. Antonioni is comparatively sensible with his film. Malkovich's so organic roles are so true that situations are so real. I changed my worldview after this movie. I am a beginner in Russia - country of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky - and I am sure that seeing Antonioni is good and amusing for Russkies, because I and we understand his point of view. so I do not understand your least ratings on IMDb. I'm sure, speaking of Russia and our people, we like Antonioni because of his romantic soul and positive sense of surrounding reality
