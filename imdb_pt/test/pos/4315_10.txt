The show starts with the boat. Desmond was me. So they went to try to save Walt. And blocking the things that the pushing button is a big joke at the same time Desmond discovered that he is the one who fell on the plane. Eko tries to open the door that John locked him, and Charlie helped him find the bomb. While Sayid and Jack plan this, Sasyid is to find others first and see who and what others are. And find out if there are weapons and weapons. <br /> <br /> Micheal takes Jack, Swayer, Kate and Hugo into a trap. And they get caught. <br /> <br /> After the show, there were more questions than answers, but what made the program great. And I can not wait until Season 3
