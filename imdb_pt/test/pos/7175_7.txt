How important is the director, anyway? In this film, made in the politically tumultuous times of the late 1960s, where social organization issues were prime conflicts, he asks this question by making a film that pushes the camera away from action and only begs to reveal director William Greaves. It is an important work, because it shows that no other film shows the difficulties in blocking, organizing and defining the scene; reveals the role of the crew, something that most directors, quite frankly, would like to disappear completely and that invisibility is essential to suspend disbelief; and also takes into account the role of performance and script and how they combine / do not match reality and what it has to say about how the director ends up influencing reality (if at all). <br /> <br /> Documentary, or pseudo-documentary, or fictional narrative (which you prefer, through your interpretations of the themes) has your brain in the super-educated, over-intellectual crew, your guts to the lost artists struggling to understand the vague and ambiguous directions and his heart in the director, who remains as the desire to portray, represent, express without any idea how to do any of these things or why he wants to do it. It's a movie that purposely repeats banalities just to see if they can become more than banalities. It is a film that sometimes shows the various shots simultaneously, only to leave the issue to the public and also reveal how disturbingly different scenes change perspective. <br /> <br /> It's an important job, and something that everyone interested in the industry and the film production process must observe and understand. He, like many experimental films, has no real mass audience appeal - it's not for them. It's for the industry, and it's for the 60's, asking what to do with a group effort medium that still relies on a single "voice" and "author." <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
