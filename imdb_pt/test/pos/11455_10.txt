This movie caught me by surprise. The opening credit sequence features well-made animation. After that, we are immersed in a semi-tacky production, betraying its low budget. The characters, typical American teenagers, are introduced slowly, with more personal details than is usually found in movies like this. At the moment the shlitz hits the fan, we know each of the characters and like or hate them according to their different personalities. It is a slow climb, like the ascent of a very high roller coaster. Luckily, once the action kicks in, it's the old school HORROR! The makeup effects of Steve Johnson are incredible. Equality in quality to much larger budgeted films. And the scares are shaken. Kevin Tenney makes his best movie ever, with breathtaking surprises and chilling suspenseful scenarios. The ironic humor, sometimes extravagant, marks this film as a pure terror of the 80's, as opposed to the somber tone of previous genres like "The Night of the Living Dead" or "Hills Have Eyes." But for true horror fans, it's worth checking out here. Play as the first entry in a double account with the 1999 remake of "House on the Haunted Hill." The set-up and dynamics of the characters are so alike that you really have to wonder what movie they were really remaking?
