The breeding team that brought us the Police Station - and the Naked Gun derived from it - said in an interview that it was informed by their network contact that the show would be canceled after the first episode was delivered. Basically, the show never had any chance. Typical Hollywood. The contact apparently told the crew that the problem with the show was that for the show to be funny, the viewer really would need to watch it; most of the shows are shown on TV with the understanding that the viewer needs to get up and waste a few minutes while getting food, or going to the bathroom, etc. The mood of the program is extremely dry (no laughing), and the universe the characters inhabit is where everything can happen, regardless of logic, as long as it's totally unbelievable; So, for example, in one episode, a surgeon has to bribe an informant on the street in order to get a hint on heart surgery. <br /> <br /> Those who are familiar with Naked Gun movies should be warned that there are a number. of interesting disjunctions between the show and the movies. In films, Nielsen developed a specific "take" approach - that is, wide-eyed when faced with the unexpected. That does not happen at the show, where Nielsen's Drebin is the center around which the rest of the universe revolves - nothing is unexpected to him. In addition, there are no romances on the show and no parodies on MTV. Finally, the show takes certain risks that movies avoid; in the first episode, Drebin, to "re-enact crime," has a squad of homicide detectives firing at each other from several different angles - ballistics the hard way. This is really a bit risky in humor, as we must accept that it is perfectly normal for cops to kill each other while investigating a crime, for no other reason than experimentation. That sort of thing rarely happens in movies. <br/> <br/> Taken individually, each episode is actually funnier than any of the Naked Gun movies, as both are more compact (more happens in a shorter time). -frame), even more quietly paced (there is no hurry to a punch-line as sometimes happens in the movies). There are some inconsistencies that occur in movies (especially "2" and "3") that never occur in the short run of the series. <br /> <br /> Of course there is no doubt that Naked Gun (the first film) is one of the great comedies of theater theatrical. And if you watch the TV show episode after episode in one session, the dry quality of humor can wear off someone's tolerance. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it would be useful to have a DVD about this, and Watch one episode a day for a few weeks - If laughter has, as some claim, medicinal value, watching this show is good for health .
