This is a wonderful movie ... it's funny, obscure, touching, thought-provoking, innocently naughty and generally fun around. I do not know what I've seen before ... "The Rapture," or maybe one of Todd Solondz's "black-as-night" comedies or even the recent movie "Teeth" comes to mind ... but those are all little bitter and unpleasant buds. "Franklins", despite the darkness around the edges, manages to have a completely sincere and pure heart. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to John Waters' "Low Down Dirty Shame", but this movie differs in that regard. in fact, has a story and something to say too, plus the youthful message of "Sex is not dirty (giggling, nudging)". A conservative and repressed family undergoes a drastic change as a result of a car accident and suddenly it is not so conservative anymore ... in fact, they are really happy, probably the only people in their city (or perhaps the whole world) . ) who is it. Talking about why this is the case would ruin the movie; In other words, everyone should see, although, of course, only people who are already sold on the optimistic and hopeful philosophy of the film. The acting is great - just that realistic enough to prevent the procedures from getting too heavy ... Teresa Willis performs a particularly memorable and courageous performance as a tense mother who appears like a butterfly when she is released. Both she and Robertson Dean deserve praise for their sincerely heartfelt performances (not to mention the frequent and extensive scenes of nudity and sex); they transform what could have been an indecent joke involving a "deviant sexual practice" in a touching, believable and enjoyable moment. Aviva as the daughter is a standout and someone to watch, capturing perfectly the attitude, the patterns of anguish and speech of a girl her age. Vince Pavia as the brother "himbo" with a secret is handsome and functional, although his story and how everyone react to it is more gratifying than his real acting. Mari Blackwell as the best friend in conflict with Mother Franklin is wonderfully cold, confused and even compassionate in a role that could have been exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film looks fantastic, all bright and wide colors. -open locales ... it looks like it may have been filmed Hi-def ... if so, the line got too thin, looks a lot like film. There are a lot of conversations and a lot of it philosophical, which gets a little boring (more so, I imagine for a viewer who disagrees with the politics of the film), but this film says many things that need to be said. If only people were not afraid to listen and think. The arguments that occur are clever and well thought out, first of all refusing to demonize religious or non-religious parties. <br /> <br /> The ending is on the ambiguous side, which I found a bit more disappointment somehow ... I think it would have worked better if the author (as Jay Floyd is since he produced, wrote and directed) given a more viable outcome, some sort of solution, but again, there probably is not one when it comes to putting people with different beliefs against each other. Even so, it was a memorable and exciting final image that stifled me - a success. Meanwhile, I'm very happy Mr. Floyd has made this movie and eager to share it with as many people as possible.
