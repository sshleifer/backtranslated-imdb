This is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's great to watch in groups, I guess. Also great for any fan of Alan Rickman, he does such a wonderful job. It's captivating, fun, very surprising ... you have to watch it twice, at least. I did not watch who did not like it or at least I thought it was worth it.
