It may be difficult to explain how, but this film is a masterpiece. Maybe because I never imagined that a plot like this or a movie with so few words would convey all this poetry. The true poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsessions. Bogard is incredible and needless to say that Venice is used as a perfect setting: dark, sinking and sad as the soul of Bogard. And classical music is more than a simple background escort for human feelings. In my opinion, a classic masterpiece of European cinema.
