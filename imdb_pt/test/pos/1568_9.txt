This is a very amazing movie! The characters seemed so realistic to me, it was hard to believe they were not real people. Being from the south, I thought Judith Ivey's character seemed especially real, and as everyone else has mentioned, she does an excellent job of acting. The characters are not beautiful and do not look anything like ordinary Hollywood stars - their bodies and imperfect personalities seem much more natural and real. One reviewer mentioned that the main character, Alice, had no good reason to run away from home, which is true - she had no moral reason to run away, such as running away from the child. abuse, etc. I thought she was fed up with dead-end jobs in a working-class life and wanted to escape to Florida, where her friend lived the attractive and privileged life of a college student in Miami. The actress shows that Alice's confusion, uncertainty and questioning turn into determination and willingness to take control of her life with stunning naturalness. The film also shows how Alice is trapped in seemingly unseen situations, making her panic, acting and asking for help. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, the grainy shooting style made me think that it was a very cheap or homemade film, but in fact it is very well done. The quality of the home movie really makes you feel like you're there with the characters, a part of your RV travel across the country. This is definitely a movie worthy of being seen, although I do not quite understand all the descriptions of it as a ripening tale of the heart. It is quite vulgar and disturbing at times, even if it is not completely sad at the end.
