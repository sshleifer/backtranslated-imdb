Hooray for Korean cinema! Last year I saw "Chungyang" and "Nowhere to hide", now I come across the premiere in the direction of Hur Jin-ho "Christmas in august". The variety of themes and levels of achievement speak volumes of a mature national cinema for discovery. The main themes of this film are death and love. The graceful and thoughtful form of Jung Won (Han Suk-kyu) deals with his impending death and the sublimation of his desires towards Darim (Shim Eun-Ha) out of true love for her. I was deeply moved by his careful management of behavior and emotions, protecting Darim from unnecessary pain without rejecting it. <br /> <br /> The success of this type of film is based on the skill of the actors. Han and Shim stand out, both being quite expressive, but naturalistic. A number of secondary characters, Jung Won's relatives, friends and clients are quickly drawn to enrich the story without undermining its main focus. To live is to love, but all things must pass. The pain disappears. Life goes on.
