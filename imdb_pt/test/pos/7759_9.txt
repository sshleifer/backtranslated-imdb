Good animation, good character design and a light story make Suzumiya Haruhi in the pleasant Yuutsu to watch. <br /> <br /> After my first performance, I thought this anime was very good, but it was much better for a second time. <br /> <br /> This is because it is made out of chronological order, and once you watch it in the correct order you realize connections that you have not seen before. (Or you may see a second meaning for some events you have not noticed before.) You may want to read Tanigawa Nagaru's original novels (not manga) before / after seeing this. The anime is very good at seeing all the details in the stories it shows. <br /> <br /> However, there are some short stories from the book that are not animated, but are referenced to. in episode 14) Overall, this anime is actually quite good once after a brief review of the plot (reading the book improves as well). It's a good break from the shounen-jump anime that seems to be taking over.
