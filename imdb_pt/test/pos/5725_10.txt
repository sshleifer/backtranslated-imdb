Following my personal research on the 2012 "end cycle" pending time presented by the Mayan calendar system, I believe this movie should be viewed as much as "What The Bleep We Know?" While some may believe that high-level science subjects should only be communicated at doctoral-level "talking," "The Elegant Universe" breaks such barriers. The visual and selection dialog facilitates the understanding of this tour through the history of physics. There are numerous messages in this film, the least of which is that academic science should always be ready to review what is being taught. It is true that the pure science of discovery is beautiful, for there is always something additional and exciting to bring to the surface if we have the courage to seek it in the face of "established" science.
