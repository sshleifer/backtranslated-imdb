This has to be one of the best movies we have seen and is highly recommended for exposing the injustices of fanaticism. Billy Wirth is an incomparable and truly incredible actor like Corby / White Wolf. However, he felt that the story would have been enhanced if his character had more scenes. This is a movie that can be seen over and over without getting tired.
