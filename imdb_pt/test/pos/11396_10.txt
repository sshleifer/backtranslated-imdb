The brilliance of this story offers at least one cleverly crafted message for each viewer in the audience. This story is about success, it's about failure. It's about the choices you make in life and the choices that others make for you. History deals with self-realization and determination on such a scale that no camera angle could cover it. Within the scope of each scene is an element marked for representation in your imagination. Keep this in mind while watching the movie; is more than an eye drop. The sexually suggestive and rarely explicit scenes serve only to distract him and entertain him during the tedious process of character development.
