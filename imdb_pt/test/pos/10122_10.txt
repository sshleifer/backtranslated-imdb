As someone who often goes to the movies, I have to say that this was one of the most impressive movies I've seen this year. Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. gave excellent performances, allowing viewers to get lost in the various emotions and really feel for the characters. It is good to occasionally see a film that does not depend entirely on special effects, but allows the characters in the story to touch the human psyche on many levels. I wish Hollywood would produce more movies of that caliber.
