I've never seen such a powerful history film. I discovered a city, a country, a lost revolution and even a Nobel Prize winner thanks to this film masterpiece. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, you can not say you saw anything. <br /> <br /> A great lesson in courage, humility and life. <br /> <br /> I have not seen anything so good since. <br /> <br /> TE Saturday, January 9, 1999
