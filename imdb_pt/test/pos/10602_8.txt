When I first heard about this movie, I was slightly interested. The plot seemed like an opportunity for joy and Bam Margera as an actor and director seemed something that could be good. When I discovered that the movie starred Ryan Dunn, I was even more interested (I was a Homewrecker fan when I was connected ... Yes, I'm so lame). However, I do not have much faith in being good. When I sat down to watch, I was afraid I was wasting my time. <br /> <br /> But even in just five minutes, it became apparent that I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I thought the comedy in this movie was deliciously idiotic and definitely not suitable for all kinds of people. The acting was very good, much better than my expectations. I thought it was fairly easy to relate to Ryan's character, which gave the film a center that was believable. This is critical in such an outrageous film like this (and that's probably why I was not a fan of Borat). <br /> <br /> The movie is not suitable for younger people, DUH, and will certainly create more than just fair share of turtles if attended with parents. But it's a good one for you and your friends on a movie night.
