I agree that this is ONE of the best episodes in the whole series - my only drawdown would be the somewhat dissonant appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan commander. My reasoning is this: if you were not around for the first installment of this episode then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the 2nd generation of Trekkie (or Trekker - your preference), you leave the scene initially. However, he is an excellent commander as well as the opposite to our captain and this episode is strongly written and well represented by all. There are excellent points made by both sides about the cost of the war against the price of peace and certainly reminiscent of one of the best films of World War II and later. These are not my favorite genre, but I would certainly recommend such a fan to see this episode through that filter. You will see that this holds true. I will never understand why Sci-Fi has so little respect - the best drama comes from putting ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.
