I've been a long time fan of Luc Besson's work, and since I know your name, I've also been looking for this movie. I've tried looking for this movie across California for over four years. Last summer I made a trip to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie. long story short, I bought and watched in France! I was impressed, it made my trip and I finally feel glad to have seen the first work of Luc Besson. development of absolutely amazing character, a lot of thought provoking, great acting and the final concept film. If you are a fan of cinema concept, this is one of the most original and classic. I feel like it's a rare pleasure to watch a movie like this, its risky, its unorthodox, and, after all, it's just original. if you are a fan of Luc Besson, you really must see, however, whether or not you are a Besson fan, it is definitely an important job, overall a great contribution to the immortal art of cinema.
