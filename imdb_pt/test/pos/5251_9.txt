Reading some of the other comments, I must agree that some of the (very few) shortcomings found in this brilliant documentary on one of the 20th century divas (upstairs with Billie Holliday, Bessie Smith, Edith Piaf, Judy Garland and Mercedes de Sosa). ) are justified. Because it was originally a 6-hour television documentary about his career ("STRANGE FORM OF LIFE" (V) 1995/1999). Much more comprehensive and with greater insight into the inner world of Amália. As for the subtitling of your songs, I'm all for it! Although music, voice and performance can be - are! - universal, there is so much poetry in words that only beg to be translated. I think this was a conscious choice for the producers. They targeted 200 million Portuguese speakers in Brazil, Portugal, Mozambique, France, East Timor, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Canada, USA, South Africa, Sao Tome and Principe, Goa, Damão, Diu, Venezuela, Luxembourg , Germany and the rest of the Portuguese-speaking diaspora around the world. As for Lady herself, she did not live to see this shortened DVD version of the documentary, but she received a preview of "Strange Way of Life." And it seems to have been to his liking. Very much.
