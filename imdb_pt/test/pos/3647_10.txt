In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester goes from collecting trash cans to a clandestine on a cruise ship carrying a certain canary bird - and Grandma, his owner. Uh-Oh! Once again, Tweety and Granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to catch the bird. Sylvester also gets seasick several times too. And the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the spot on the ship that has something that cures its illnesses, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can blow up fire! I stop here and say that this is another great cartoon directed by Friz Freling starring the popular cat-and-bird duo. Tweety's S.O.S is highly recommended.
