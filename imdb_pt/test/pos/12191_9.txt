The film, although not faithful to the original novels, manages to create a modern vision of Gothic vampires. Someone tried to insult QotD by calling it a 1.5h music video clip. In fact, it is a complement. The ever-present gothic music combined with the shots of a music clip made the film so melancholic - and "Queen of the Damned" is a humorous story. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the more difficult fans who complain about the modifications of the story. The plot has been modified to be less confusing for viewers who do not know the novels. The number of characters has decreased and I have no problem changing the creator of Lestat or ignoring the character of Mekare. The biggest change - the romance of Lestat and Jesse - seemed to me an excellent addition. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think a faithful adaptation would be a complete failure. The slow, dark climate, perfect for the anguish of nineteenth-century New Orleans and Louis, did not suit Lestat's rebellion and his music. And while the book may be slow, descriptive and combining several elements, but transmitting them well, the film simply can not do it without becoming chaotic. "Vampire Lestat" and "Queen of the Damned" can be divided into at least three films - the creators had to choose something. <br /> <br /> Some of the special effects like flying or getting out of the flames. was the only thing I really did not like in this movie. But Akasha's death was very good. The cast was good, Stuard Townsend was convincing as Lestat, especially in the concert, but I preferred Banderas as Armand. I loved Jesse, Maharet and Marius. And of course Aaliyah was perfect with her ancient quasi-Egyptian accent. <br /> <br /> So if you like gothic music and vampire dilemmas of solitude and eternity (and you do not consider books as movie sets) "Queen of the Damned" is one of the few movies that show vampires as something more than blood-sucking monsters. But please do not compare this to the movie "Interview." It has a completely different style, just as different as Louis and Lestat were different. Personally I find it exciting to first observe the existence of a vampire from the standpoint of Louis's "bottled hunger," and then switch to a morally devoid but surprisingly extrovert to a vampire, Lestat. <br /> <br /> d give "Queen" 8 out of 10 because it had some technical flaws but I decided to give 9 as it is greatly underestimated by people who hate it simply because it does not match their view of the books which can be clearly seen by looking at the breakdown of votes.
