This HTV series is beautiful. I strongly recommend watching the movie. It has everything it should: remarkable road map, strong characters, beautiful scenery and exceptional atmosphere. Add a little scoring from Clannad's environment and you'll get an unforgettable photo. I love every HTV adventure movie I've seen: Return To Treasure Island, smuggler, adventurer, but Sherwood's Robin beats them all. I would like to thank the entire HTV production team and Richard Carpenter in particular for giving me lots of adventures and excitement. I have the DVD release in my small collection of movies. I'm really sorry movies like these are not made anymore.
