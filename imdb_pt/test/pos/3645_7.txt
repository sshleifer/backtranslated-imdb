Like I said before, I'm not a Tweety fan. It is so aggravating that I would like Sylvester to eat it and end soon. <br /> <br /> In this drawing, Sly is homeless once again and goes back to feeding on garbage cans. He sees a cruise ship leaving the nearby port and decides to board when he says Tweety is one of the passengers. <br /> <br /> The ship provides a suitable stage for the following maneuvers and Sly desperately tries to catch the boring bird and avoid seasickness. If at least once he can chew and swallow, he will end the annoying canary forever. But like the cartoons starring Tweety, this one is very nice, but it's all thanks to this brilliant cat.
