I saw the Lonely Dove, the Walk of the Dead Man and the Streets of Laredo, and now The Return to the Lonely Dove. If you are hungry for more after watching Lonesome Dove, this will fill your tummy. Great cast, great story. Most definitely a second close to Lonesome Dove. I will buy this movie to add to my collection. This is the best, or at least my favorite performance by Jon Voight. He's Captain Call. Lou Gossett Jr. playing Isom Pickett is not somebody I would fiddle with, he's an idiot with perspective. William Peterson also does a great job. Rick Schroder is back as Newt with an anguished performance that reminds me of his passing through the NYPD Blue. My only problem with this movie (and it's really getting nits) is that I got the impression that Call wanted to be "the first man to graze cattle in Montana", and it's obvious that Dunnigan had been there for some time. A bit inconsistent, but easily overlooked as you get lost in the fantastic tale. I particularly adore the apparent character growth of Jasper Fant and July Johnson. I've watched this movie several times and I'm ready for another sequel.
