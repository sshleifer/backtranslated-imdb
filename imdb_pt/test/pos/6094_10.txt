In a style reminiscent of David Lean's best, this romantic love story crosses the screen with epic proportions equal to the vast desert regions it encounters. It is a film that says that one does not choose love, but rather that it is the love that chooses, regardless of who, where or when; and furthermore, that it is a question of the heart often dependent on prevailing conditions and circumstances. And so is the situation in "The English Patient," directed by Anthony Minghella, the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most inopportune places and places, proving that when it is predestined, love will find a way. <br /> <br /> It's the Second World War; flying above the African desert, Hungarian Earl Laszlo of Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) is shot down, his biplane mistaken for an enemy aircraft. And although he survives the accident, he is severely burned. To his great luck, however, he is rescued by a tribe of nomads and ends up in a hospital. But the existing conditions are governed by war circumstances, and Almasy soon becomes one of many patients being transported by train to a different facility. Upon arriving in Italy, he is too weak and ill to continue, and a Canadian nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), offers to stay with him in an abandoned monastery. <br /> <br /> Hana soon discovers that her accusation is a kind of mystery man, since Almasy remembers nothing of his past and not even his own name. Thought to be English, the only clues that point to who he is are contained in a book found in his possession after the accident, but even they are as enigmatic as the patient of Hana. Slowly, however, at Hana's suggestion, Almasy begins to remember bits of his life, and his story begins to unfold. And his memory is aided even more by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who suspects that Almasy is the man he is looking for - a man with whom he wants to settle accounts. But, burnt beyond recognition, Almasy may or may not be this man. Meanwhile, Almasy's memories continue to appear; memories of a woman he loved, Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) - as well as memories of Katherine's husband, Geoffrey (Colin Firth). And, crippled in mind and body as it is, these memories become the only thing left to which he can cling to any hope, even when his life seems to be moving away every time he passes. <br /> <br /> In addition to directing, Anthony Minghella also wrote the screenplay for this film, which he adapted from Michael Ondaatje's novel. The result is an epic saga presented in Lean's "Doctor Jivago" and "Lawrence of Arabia" tradition; a magnificent film that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented grandeur and beauty. Simply put, Minghella's film is genialized; crafted and delivered with poetic perfection, watching is like watching a Monet come to life. From the opening frames, Minghella casts a hypnotic spell on her audience that is binding and transporter, with a story that has an emotional beauty that equals the stunningly stunning and vibrant images brought to life by John Seale's remarkable cinematography; images that almost fill the screen, as well as the soul of the viewer. In every sense, it is a rare eloquence film with an impressive emotional capacity that facilitates a truly transcendental experience. Nominated in twelve categories, it received deservedly nine Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actress (Binoche) and Cinematography. <br /> <br /> If someone had to choose a single word to describe the 'essence' of this film, it would be 'excellence'. Even an extraordinary film, however, does not receive nine Oscars without extraordinary performances; and the performances given by Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas here transcend the term "Oscar-worthy." Appearing for Best Actor for his portrayal of Almasy (Geoffrey Rush received the gold for 'Shine'), Fiennes has never been better, reaching an emotional depth with his character that is almost palpable. Private and introspective, Almasy is not, by his very nature, an individual to whom the public will be able to form an intimate connection; Fiennes, however, finds a way to open that emotional door enough to let him in, enough for you to experience the sincere passion that flows within him. And this works. Almasy does not seek his friendship; he will, however, gain his compassion. Kristen Scott Thomas also received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress (Frances McDormand received the "Fargo" award) for her portrayal of Katherine, a woman whose stoic countenance masks the emotional conflict raging inside of her, born of the forbidden passion that enslaves her, and yet to which she voluntarily surrenders, rejecting her fetters of repression to embrace a love so strong that it threatens to consume it. The reserve that Katherine must maintain evokes public empathy, while Scott Thomas successfully exploits the emotional depths of his character with the greatest possible effect. It's the kind of performance that attracts you and the quick assurance, taking you as it is beyond the curtain of hypocrisy that dictates what it should be, at least in the name of appearances, and allows you to experience a true sense of unbridled passion. Understated and subtly shaded, it's a great job done by Kristin Scott Thomas. <br /> <br /> Binoche also performs impressive and affected performance, such as the kindly nurse Hana; it is his humanity, in fact, that defines love in its purest sense and offers a balanced perspective of it in the context of the film. His relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) gives us a glimpse of passion of another kind, which contrasts effectively with the intensity of those between Almasy and Katherine. 'The English Patient' is a movie that will excite and thrill you; one you will not want to see end. 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
