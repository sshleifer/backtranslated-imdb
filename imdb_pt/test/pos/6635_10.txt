This film reluctantly and anger is against not only the war in which it was made, but the whole war. No matter what the war is. It may be the most engaging emotional experience I've ever had with Ingmar Bergman's work. There are no sides to the two main characters in this shocking drama, which does not intimate a point in any ceremonial symbolism as usual of Bergman, but clearly shows people and their lives and exercises what Bergman has already proven to understand about the reaction of a person Os its habitual Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow interpret an internalizing pair, but quarrelsome, that already was musician of orchestra. Now they live in a farmhouse on an island. Part of the frustration of the building we grew to share with these two people fertilizes in the details that nothing in their house seems to work. They are not intellectual inmates either. They are a family marriage that has resigned more or less to life and is essentially apolitical; they only hear of distant rumors of a war that has been going on forever. Ullmann is worried about the danger to their lives and their desire to have children. Her husband, Von Sydow, shrugs the war for them. His serenity is interrupted by screaming warplanes flying low over his house, the death of a parachuting aviator, the arrival of dubious troops, his inquisition and eventually his capture by what appears to be the local side, but loyalties there long fragmented. <br /> <br /> They are sent back home, witness the gratuitous destruction and suffer the vengeful consequences of a marriage so agonizingly suspicious. This, one of my main favorite endeavors of Bergman, is a study of a shaken couple of their lives safely disregarded and violated by a manipulative desperation, testing both to reveal who they really are. She lacks compassion to some degree, too selfish and restless to have any patience for her whimsical collapses in crying. Their repressed emotional problems led to repression of the initiative and enthusiasm that attracted them to begin with. The immense last twenty minutes, sporadically interrupted by images of the crushing gray sky, are among the closest to the real emotion that Bergman filmed. <br /> <br /> All systems of dogma and faith are the antagonists in this essential and quiet portrait. The basically clear personalities of the characters of Ullmann and Von Sydow are cast into the degenerate world of war because they are accused of being "sympathetic," but the film, filmed on the small island of Bergman in Faro, does not give any information about where or when it is defined, who are the two sides and what are they fighting for. For an uninvolved civilian involved, the knowledge base is likely to be quite similar. Ullmann and Von Sydow are not sympathizers of the apparent enemy, but are supporters of who apparently is their side. This reactive allegory of 1968 could be about ordinary non-combatant citizens of Iraq, Kosovo, Vietnam, Israel, Palestine or ...
