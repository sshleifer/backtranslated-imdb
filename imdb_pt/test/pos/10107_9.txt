I love horror movies, but I think they work so much better when they hide a dramatic impact from behind (The Devil's Backbone, The Exorcist, for example). This is the kind of movie, and it's not just scary and scary when it has to be, it's also very cute. A tale of two sisters begins very slowly, so if you're in a hurry to see ghosts in the first 20 minutes, you'll be disappointed. In fact, this is not a ghost story, although there are some. It's something more complex, and it's done in such a way that beats Ringu and The Grudge out of the ring without sweat. A story?? is a much smarter film than those great cultural hits, because he really cares about his characters, and the direction is impeccable. Every detail in this movie will blow your mind if you are the kind of person who likes to pay attention to detail while watching a movie. The acting is excellent, especially of the stepmother and the main girl. These two are worth the price of the ticket alone. Do yourself a favor and watch this amazing movie.
