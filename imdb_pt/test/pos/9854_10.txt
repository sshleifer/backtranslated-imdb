This documentary is not only one of the best documentaries I have ever seen, but it is also one of the most touching and unobtrusively beautiful films I have ever seen. It follows the lives of two young Sudanese, Peter and Santino, as they try to enter American culture. Peter and Santino are friends at first, but gradually move away, while Peter goes to Kansas City, and Santino stays in Houston ("a land called Houston"). Santino's beauty is in his eyes. He takes people on his back, he supports an apartment full of other Sudanese, paying rent, doing everything for other people. He is a quiet sufferer. Peter takes care of himself, getting a high school degree while playing basketball and making Christian friends. It seems director Megan Mylan did not know what she was getting into with the beauty of this tale. Peter and Santino are incredible characters that move you. But the real strength in this film is in his commentary on American society. You're not judging. It shows the strengths and weaknesses of our world and how difficult it can be for outsiders. I suggest you find this movie, and look at America through the life of these two fascinating and beautiful people. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10
