In fact, I admit that I am a political junkie, so it resonated with me, but the erratic nature of Miss. Green (yes, I know what they did to her), but the ending was so despicable and totally inconsistent with the movie. <br /> <br /> Why can not Barry L and the team let us wonder what he would do? Let's discuss this. <br /> <br /> Instead, they have this nonsense end "oh, I'm not worthy" and this shows that when the chips fall, it is better to leave the table instead of folding. Stop the end of Disney and tie a tie in it. Life is not easy, they should have had the guts to give the main character some backbone. <br /> <br /> We had to listen to the rhetoric of the whole movie ... and then it turned to whining and the stupid, inane behavior by Ms. Green (when the crap was out of her system) just made for an end ridiculous of the movie that was on top of the cake.
