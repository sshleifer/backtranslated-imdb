Recap: Based on the true story of Charlie Wilson, an American congressman who (according to this film) was instrumental in the US secret war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Comments: A pretty funny movie about not-so-funny things, especially because they were real. But focusing on the film, Hanks performs very well as a hearty congressman with a good heart who becomes the champion of the secret war in Afghanistan. Hanks, and the whole film, especially Philip Seymor Hoffman, has a humorous tone. So much so that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate. But the story that counts, and maybe the ending, is really serious. <br /> <br /> A story of what happened to some questions about what might have been. So the movie works like a comedy if you want one, and a lot more serious if you want to. Something for everyone? 7/10
