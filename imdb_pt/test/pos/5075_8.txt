Most of this political thriller presented as a mill movie with a slightly better development of many of the main characters, was greatly appreciated, until the great turnaround and powerful climax that recalled twists experienced in "Silence of the Lambs." or "The Sixth Sense." Reese Witherspoon as the disturbed wife of the missing Egyptian husband and Yigal Naor as the strong-arm interrogator offer strong performances. Unfortunately, Jake Gyllenhaal has a more two-dimensional character and has to contend with a stereotypical presentation of the emotionally divided CIA analyst who has often been featured in other films. Early on, there's the beautiful scene with an explosion that resembles a scene at the end of "The Rescue of Private Ryan," the silent scene that was used so effectively to reflect a consequence of violence. The script also provides a bit more glimpse of the "enemy" mentality, but it still does not allow the audience to really understand much, once again allowing the audience to immerse themselves in the stereotypical characterization. Cinematography and photography are also a bit disappointing, because unlike "Jarhead," or "Blackhawk Down," the crisp, visceral presentation is lacking, not allowing the audience to actually be present in the film, there is a distance that keeps the audience to realize the intensity of the emotions that occur on the screen. Overall, however, the film redeems itself to the end, giving the public a measured look at the complexity of using surrender by the United States and the possible complications and consequences that may occur with its use. Eight of ten stars.
