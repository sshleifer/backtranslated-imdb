A teenage girl receives the horse of her dreams and is trained by a former Jockey to attend the Grand National Steeplechase in London. A beautiful adaptation of the classic children's book, with an excellent performance of Taylor, as the energetic but educated young man. Rooney is very much like his coach, although he has some overly melodramatic moments. Crisp and Revere are very good as Taylor's loving parents. Filmed in Technicolor, it looks gorgeous. The problems are that there are tacky elements, nothing very interesting happens, and creeps a bit too much. The race is exciting but could have been much more.
