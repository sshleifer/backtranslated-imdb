As the superb series "Prime Suspect" reaches the fourth part, there is no loss of momentum, which is already a considerable achievement. The First Suspect IV: The Lost Boy 'has the solid cast of support we take for granted in these British dramas, but of course the beautiful Helen Mirren dominates easily; our eyes never leave her while she's on the screen. The quest for the missing title child takes Superintendent Jane Tennison's CID team to a prime suspect who turns out to be a convicted pedophile who now lives with a single mother and her two small daughters. The insight given to us in the workings of your mind is one of the emotional highlights of this miniseries, but it may be too strong for many stomachs. <br /> <br /> The action sequences are brilliantly hand-drawn. we hold the camera pushing us right in the middle of the excitement and there is an exciting tension during the climax siege. <br /> <br /> In all, this is another magnificent police procedural drama.
