Alistair Simms is a marvel at it. He makes a good director. The role given here to George Cole was made for him. So the casting work on this film was perfect. I think it was one of those rare occasions when everything clicked. the plot was good, the comic book a scream and the mayor's older girls a delight !! Each character you are loved, even the villains. Why can not we make movies like that anymore? Basically, this is a very English comedy with good handling and fluency.
