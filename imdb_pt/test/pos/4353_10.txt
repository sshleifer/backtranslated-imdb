The questions and answers of the human spirit are all here in this masterfully crafted historical documentary. The biting beauty and horror of a man's life are revealed in their totality. Dieter and Herzog are combined and connected through a mental labyrinth that has been transformed into a single straight corridor whose walls have been covered by images created by the very characterization of itself by the vibrations of its own vocal chords. This film, for about 80 minutes, has discovered a new dimension of narrative. As I call this seemingly new meaning. God knows, after all, is not a miracle something that God does for us, but choose to remain ANONYMOUS? <br /> <br /> This is a requirement to be seen. If you enjoy experiencing the lovely horror of war, this documentary will wipe your soul to the core.
