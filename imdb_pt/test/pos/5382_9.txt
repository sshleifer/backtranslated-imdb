Men! I remember this show with nostalgia ... I actually dug Bravestarr because he was not the conventional hero. He was more than a futuristic cowboy from Texas. The man had the strength of a bear, the sight of a walk, and the agility of a ... I can not remember that. <br /> <br /> The action sequences were great! I remember that Bravestarr always wore his bazookah called SARAJUANA (translated into Spanish) whenever he was in big trouble. <br /> <br /> This was a quality action drawing. I loved the characters, the dialogues, the music and, of course, the sequence of opening credits! Bravestarr! live for it. A cult classic in my opinion and a must see.
