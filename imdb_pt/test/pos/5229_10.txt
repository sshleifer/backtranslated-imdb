I saw this movie for the first time in video form. Even on a television screen, the views were stunning. Seen on the big screen in all its glory, it must have taken people away. <br /> <br /> As one or two other comments pointed out, the history of the early pioneers and how they bypassed the problems of the terrain. etc. on the road to Oregon is as authentic as any movie can be. Therefore, it shows that it is totally unnecessary to take liberties with the truth - something that today's filmmakers must take care of - the reality is enough. <br /> <br /> The plot relies on man's struggle against the elements and hostility. natives. Subframes are few and simple. But the basic plot is enough. Elsewhere I reviewed the Paramount rival for the great track, Fighting Caravans. Despite having a more sophisticated plot, and having better actors, the Fighting Caravans do not have the breathtaking scenes. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail must be seen compulsorily.
