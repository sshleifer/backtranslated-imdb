I saw it when it first came out and I have seen it several times since. I have the DVD. It's one of Drew Barrymore's best works and one that's worth seeing more than once. <br /> <br /> Not being popular at school was one of the things in the movie that I could relate to. I was not as tortured as Josie (during her high school days) or as Aldys, but I was also never the type of majority party. The prom scene was the three popular girls who fell victim to their own joke as Josie pushes the way. Aldys (the victim) is my favorite scene and I applauded when I saw her for the first time. <br /> <br /> I can still watch this movie today. it is excellent.
