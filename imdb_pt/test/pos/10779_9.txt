Eric Bogosian gives as good a performance as you'll see in an Oliver Stone movie. His character Barry is an assault rifle disguised as a man and he chases away anyone in or out of the air who offends him. Adapted from Bogosian's play, "Talk Radio" is a vicious and scary ride that will not let you out until it's too late. Until then, you have familiarized yourself with the fringe of racists, rapists, paranoid, would-be killers and mere listeners who listen, speak and lurk in the dark of Dallas nights. Stone behaves, if at all, by letting Bogosian dominate all the scenes, from the humble beginnings of Barry to the turning point when his radio program can reach the national distribution. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent as lovers and / or co-workers who have all been used and discarded by Barry in common. <br /> <br /> The only thing I would change is recurring theme song, "Bad To The Bone". I would have used Bachman's "No Fragile" Turner Overdrive. A better song, one I have not heard in a movie so far, and a relentless tune, whose sinister riff is like the real soundtrack to Barry's life. <br /> <br /> Listen if you dare!
