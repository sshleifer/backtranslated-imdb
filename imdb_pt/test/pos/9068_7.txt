The story of this film is quite implausible, but the script asked for a queer guy to take the lead role, and in 1940 that meant Peter Lorre. And Peter is in his most frightening place in this, as the island's owner, Stephen Danel, who takes prisoners on probation to work at his diamond mine on the island. When they arrive, the Parolees discover that they are slaves miners who can be beaten or killed at Danel's whim. <br /> <br /> Only two things seem to get worse than the slaves; Danel's wife and monkeys. The monkeys attack him so much that their violence toward them probably leads to the only flesh that slaves receive. <br /> <br /> Lorre is perfect in his role here, and climbs the screen with industrial strength. Although the script is not from Casablanca, the edition is very restricted and there are no wasted scenes. This is a very watchable story, but I do not know which niche this movie filled. Too long for a short subject, and too short for a feature film, I do not know how it was marketed in theaters. <br /> <br /> I just caught this for the first time in an early morning / early morning TCM showing. Lorre fans will not want to lose this if they have not seen it.
