Until I saw this movie, "life is beautiful" was my favorite movie of all time. This movie is all that a great movie should be. Great script, unsurpassed acting and direction that neither addresses the sentimentality that the subject tries or leaves without the emotional impact he demands. This film contains the taste that could not come from Hollywood and does not have the pretension that would come from France. A wonderful film even above the caliber that I have been waiting for when I see the handmade movies logo appear. I do not need to go into detail as the previous posts cover everything because this movie has to be seen by everyone on this planet.
