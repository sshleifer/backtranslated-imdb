I was very curious to see the original six-hour miniseries that Steven Soderbergh's latest film was based on, and now that I am, I'm happy to say that one is not better than the other. Both are intelligent, engaging and extremely fun. The only real advantage the miniseries has about the movie is that it's three and a half hours longer, so we know the characters more deeply. <br /> <br /> There is not a fake note to be had in this production, one that you definitely should have time for when PBS re-broadcast this miniseries sometime in 2001. You will not regret it.
