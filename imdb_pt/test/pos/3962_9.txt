This is a funny and clever movie and worth your time. In my opinion, it's way better than American Pie and other movies of the same genre that seem to be wiped out all the time. I had not heard of this movie so I guess it did not get very impressed, which is a shame. It does not take itself too seriously, but at the same time it conveys a serious message to people about life and life experiences and what is important ... Unlike a movie about a bunch of desperate guys trying to get laid for the first time and a guy tossing his d ** k into a pie, but in the end everyone lies down and kills-and-does ... One thing that struck me was that the soundtrack was pretty cool and not the usual American pop-punk ... They really had a real punk from the past like the Ramones ... That alone made the movie better! To be honest, I was not expecting much from this movie and I was pleasantly surprised by the good comedy that it is.
