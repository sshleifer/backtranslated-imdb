This was the third time I tried to watch this movie. In the previous two times, I found the beginning so sickly sweet and "weird" that I stopped watching. However, now that I am a little older and more compulsive, I forced myself to watch the whole movie and was very surprised to see that I really enjoyed it a little. So I look at the movie the same way I would look to swim in the ocean when the water temperature is 70 degrees (which is about 21-22 degrees Celsius for all those lovers of metrics out there). Of course, the water is terribly cold and shocking at first, but if you force yourself to stay in the water, you will get used to it - so resist the urge to jump out immediately! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a long exchange between Flynn and his daughter, played by Patti Brady. Some may find that there are very cute and engaging conversations, although others may find them a bit difficult to accept, since those moments are so sweet! In a way, it was an incredible performance from Flynn because it's hard to picture him in real life having kids or acting at home, especially that he wanted to be faithful to a woman in this movie - now that's acting! NEVER SAY GOODBYE concerns the divorced couple, Flynn and Parker, and their mutual desire to remarry. Since they both love each other as much as their boy, it seems an inevitable conclusion that they will tie up the knot again. However, there are some serious problems that stand in his way: Lucille Watson (who plays his usual father-in-law and controller character), Flynn's girlfriend (after all, he is Errol Flynn and he is divorced, so you have to expect him to have a girl SOMEWHERE) and a Marine (played by Forrest Tucker). <br /> <br /> Not unexpectedly, all this is resolved to the end and everyone lives happily ever after. However, despite being stereotyped and predictable, the film is a winner because it's so much fun to watch. Flynn, despite his reputation as a hero of action and adventure, is very good at comedy-romance and it's so much fun to watch him. In addition, the film has the scene always chewing Cuddles Sakall - he is so cute and sweet that is perfect in this kind of movie. And despite the sweetness, the film is well written. The main point is that the movie is FUN. <br /> <br /> So, my recommendation is that you watch this movie and force yourself not to vomit on the sweetly sweet aspects of the movie. Once you've gotten over it, the rest of the movie is an image that is well worth your time.
