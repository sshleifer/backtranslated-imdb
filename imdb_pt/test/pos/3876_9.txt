Team A is still repeating every day on Dutch television (RTL7, around 6pm) and I still watch! I do not like A-Team ... I absolutely love them !! It's great to see Justin chasing former A-Team members. Brings back memories of the old days when I was young and sweet. I would have given him a 10 per excellent, but Justin looks like he's chasing former A-Team members by himself. Of course, that's the only bad thing in this documentary. Too bad Justin is not looking for Melinda Culea ("Amy A. Allen"). But it's great to see Mr. T. back in action. Too bad for him, he does not show up at the party in the end. But this party is too short to laugh again and see everyone in action again.
