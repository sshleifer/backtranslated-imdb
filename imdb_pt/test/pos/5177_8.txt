Living just below Georgetown Hwy, Co ... I remember this movie well and I thought it was great! The story looks like something John would do in real life, but there's something I'll always remember more about the film. For those of you who do not live in Denver ... every Christmas, the City of Denver, Co, displays a fabulous display of lights and decorations at the Civic Center in downtown Denver. Well ... as it happened, during the filming of this film, a crib was needed. So ... it was borrowed from the Civic Center exhibit ... with permission, by the way! Someone had forgotten to advise the powers and was robbed! A frantic search began with law enforcement for a few days. Finally, someone spoke and remembered lending to the film crew in Georgetown! It was returned and put back where it belonged! As it turned out ... it was not presented so much in the movie ... you can barely see it during the Christmas show with the kids. He created a disturbance though ...
