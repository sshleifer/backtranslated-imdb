Perhaps the best film ever made by director Kevin Tenney (well, his Witchboard is not at the top of my all time horror list), this is a strange and fascinating mix between Pin and Child's Play, both better than this one but not is better. Of course, the plot is artificial and perhaps predictable too, but the actors are good, Rosalind Allen is very pleasing to the eye (and so is Candance McKenzie - God Bless her to the shower scene!), The child actress is very good at interpreting the disturbed daughter and the puppet of Pinocchio are scary enough to give her some thrills. For a B movie it's not bad at all.
