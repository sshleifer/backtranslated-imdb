Being an American, I have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you were disappointed. I have nothing to compare. I found no pleasure in the idiot humor of American teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar kind of humor, I could not stop laughing. I almost never laugh out loud at a movie. And usually a movie has some funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over. I'm really going to buy this on DVD when I find it.
