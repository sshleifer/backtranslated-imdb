I totally disagree with the other reviews! I also saw this movie on an initial screening and found it very enjoyable. Robin Williams is in top form. It's true that the tone is familiar, but it's Williams from Good Morning Vietnam: clever, funny, on point. After many dark corners, Williams is finally back to what he does best. The supporting actors give great performances, especially Laura Linney and Chris Walken. Chris interprets himself as usual, but as the "agent" for the next president, he was a delight every time on the screen. Lewis Black basically touches himself, but it's wonderfully well used here. There is also a fun by Jeff Goldblum. The film is more than the trailer suggests as well. The movie is funny, but it's not a pure comedy as suggested. There is a little suspense line, which everyone should seriously consider, especially if you pay attention to the newspaper.
