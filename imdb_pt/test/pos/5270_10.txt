I consider this film as one of the most interesting and funny movies of all time. He has very clever thoughts on him, that anyone who thinks the film is horrible could not and can not recognize really deep philosophical themes that are in him (in all 3 Schneider films), no doubt. Several universities in Germany and throughout Europe have studied the way Schneider sees things. By the way, Helge Schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and the Jazz-musicions in Germany (perhaps in Europe). It is inspired mainly by the great M.Davis and T. Monk. So if you do not like it, that's fine, but please do not try to convince others that it can be stupid, cheap, boring or not funny. Because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and if you were willing to really look at H. Schneider's art, you would have to "surrender."
