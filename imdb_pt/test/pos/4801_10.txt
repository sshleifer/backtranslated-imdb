Octavio Paz, Mexican poet, writer and diplomat, who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990, said of "Nazarin": "Nazarin follows the great tradition of crazy Spaniards originated by Cervantes, his madness is to take great ideas seriously and try live according ". A humble and spiritual priest (Francisco Rabal in a wonderful performance) tries to live up to the principles of Christianity, but is expelled from his church by helping a local prostitute, giving him a shelter after she committed a murder. Nazarin wanders the rural roads of the turn of the twentieth century in Mexico, offering help to the poor and begging for food. His two followers, a murderous prostitute Andara and his sister Beatrice, who is a failed suicide in desperate search for love, consider it holy, but that does not stop him from the hatred and humiliation of the church and the people he encounters on the road. He ends up beaten in prison and starts questioning his faith for not being able to forgive his abuser. <br /> <br /> Bunuel tells the story of a form of Christian parable combining masterly and uniquely admiration and irony for the main character and strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy. The film is simple and profound, as well as beautiful, ironic and moving. <br /> <br /> I consider Bunuel one of the best filmmakers of all time. I've seen twenty of his films and they all belong to the different periods of his life, but they have in common his magical touch, the masterful combination of brave realism and surrealism, his curiosity, his inquisitive mind, his sense of humor and his somber fantasies and bright. With great pleasure I'm adding little-seen and almost unknown but incredibly sincere and moving surrealistic tragic comedy "Nazarin" to the list of my favorite movies.
