There are only a few movies that can be called "must see" and SHEPHERED is one of those films. In many ways, it was ahead of its time (and you can say it was a source of inspiration for several well-known films). Copied by many, matched by none, this is really a great movie. <br /> <br /> The story is complex, but unfolds as a tense, yet often entertaining, thriller and a highly instigating exploration of the nature of mankind. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where people must live underground and chaos will reign. C. Thomas Howell is a pastor who protects the population of various religious leaders, killing all unfit members of society. The whole idea made me think about our society. It's really a brilliant social commentary, which is more than I can say for some recent blockbusters of science fiction and action. MATRIX RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS did not make sense that some real innovation was taking place, just video game effects. But SHEPHERD scores on the action scale too ... <br /> <br /> Not once does this movie let the viewer catch his breath. Peter Hayman proves to be one of the few brilliant directors of action. We are talking about 100%, high grade, home fighting kung fu! It was excellent. Really good special effects, shootings, somber-futuristic cyber-punk noir style ?? the movie really has its own elements. <br /> <br /> When it comes to SHEPHERD, it's impossible not to mention how much style he has. The sight of this city is really impressive. He recalls footage of Tim Burton's memorable vision of Gotham in Batman. And these images are photographed by Graeme Mears with a degree of skill that leaves Gordon Willis and Conrad Hall ashamed. Even the special effects were amazing. Undoubtedly, the scenes in which the fight takes place are milestones throughout the cinema. This movie is an amazing visual display ballet. <br /> <br /> Still, at the base of it all, there is an interesting story, performed by a strong cast. The acting (especially Rowdy Piper) and plot are great and excellently directed. In contrast to the loads of futuristic films made with a strong artificial flavor, the characters are believable and the dialogue is natural and full of intelligence. I'm always proud to see a great movie like SHEPHERD appear. It's a shame that you did not receive good distribution and did not do anything at the box office. It's a rarity worth looking for. This movie will impress you and make you feel 10 times cooler by having seen it!
