Great show! About the time a reality TV show comes along, it closes generation gaps. Competitors vary in ages, some seem to be old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out. And others, they looked so young that maybe parents or teachers would deliver the film in the hope that it would touch their lives the way it once touched them. Grease has truly become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate. "You are what we want" is sure to gain even more followers of grease. The only thing I wish there was more character story, then again, it's good to leave some of that to the nostalgic imagination of the 50's. I can not wait to watch the next show ... and then Broadway !!!
