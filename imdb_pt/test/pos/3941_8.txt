Are you crazy or what? this movie has talent that you are to criticize a movie that was made by famous directors and producers? I mean, you must be watching some low-quality version, because if you had a proper version, you would not find some low resolution game graphics. <br /> <br /> This movie is for people who enjoy Hong Kong cinema on the other side. what Asian people like to watch .. you are a success ... the cinema of hong kong is totally different from that of hollywood, hk cinema is of its own class ... <br /> <br /> if you do not enjoy it watching movies from hongkong producers do not go and ramble about as it is a waste of time to watch .. just let other people enjoy the movie .. and personally I saw this movie and I love its history and the way it was done.
