Having known and loved this book since I was eleven, I was terrified to see it coming like a movie - what if they had made a terrible mess? In case I did not have to worry. Everyone was very well-scaled and the acting is great, she followed the story very well, except for the strange addition of the prison scene, which for me did not add anything. However, it is really the most beautiful love story and I am so happy to have filmed so I can watch it again and again. My only complaint is - why did not they give Kester a green vest "that made him such a handsome man"? Such a simple thing, when they tried so hard for everything else. If you have the chance, look at this, it's great.
