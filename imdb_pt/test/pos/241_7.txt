Rita Hayworth illuminates the screen in this fun, extravagant and delightful musical starring Gene Kelly. Rita plays nightclub dancer Rusty Parker, who dreams of being a successful Broadway star. Unfortunately, his career is not getting to where in Danny McGuire's Night Club. When one of her fellow dancers says she's going to enter a Cover Girl contest, she decides to follow her dreams and walks in. She remembers her grandmother's publishing house, which he was deeply in love with for many years. But when she finds this success, her boyfriend is not happy about it. <br /> <br /> I've never seen Rita before, and I'm so glad I did it! She has a stage presence and is a great actress. There are some good numbers here, not the best of any musical, but they are melodic and good to listen to. One thing I did not like was Gene Kelly's character. He should have supported his girlfriend! But anyway, this is perhaps the only criticism I have about this movie. Cover Girl is a glorious, fluffy film - perfect escapism. Not everyone is the ideal movie, but a wonderful movie, however, due to the star power of Rita Hayworth. Great movie, truly impressed.
