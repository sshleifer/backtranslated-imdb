OK, now at first I thought this would be another tacky romantic comedy that contained the comedy, but it was not. I mean, how could it have been with the fabulous Amanda Bynes looking at her! She was amazing, very funny and still impressive! The boys were also extremely fit, one of the main reasons girls go! The plot is strongly based on Shakespeare's play 'Twelfth Night', as it was extremely similar, there was even a spider called malvolio, which belonged to the character malvolio. The script was very well written and collected and was very witty. The football skills were also incredible, even made me think of playing football myself! Anyway, to summarize this is a lightweight movie about the young romance, which gets very confusing! Go and see!
