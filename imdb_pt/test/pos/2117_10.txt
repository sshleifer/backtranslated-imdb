My mother and I went to the premiere of Ft Worth primarily to see George Strait, but we ended up getting a chance to see the first movie in Bass Hall. What a wonderful and beautiful film that not only portrays the beautiful landscape of Texas, but also a great plot to feel good. It was well written, directed and produced and my mom and I loved it from start to finish!. Thank you Jay for giving us the opportunity to be part of the premiere of this wonderful movie. It was a night we will never forget. As if seeing the film was not enough, we were also lucky enough to be seated 4 queues in front of my favorite singer, George Strait !! Thank you, thank you, thank you!! Keep up the great work and, again, thank you! <br /> <br /> Debbie McClendon & Maureen Daugherty Ft. Worth, TX
