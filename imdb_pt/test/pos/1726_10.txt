Unlike most people who have commented, I was born after the last episode of Sylvester Mccoy and so could not have compared the two centuries of doctor that at first. I liked it a lot when Christopher Eccleston took control of TARDIS and the continuation of the series. I have since seen episodes of old Doctor Who and some of them great, but like the doctor, the series needed to regenerate to continue. The twenty-first-century doctor who looks great, I thought Martha was great, almost a combination for the doctor, and if Jack's appearance was anything, she would be brilliant when she appeared in series 4 or 5. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Jack, the spin of Torchwood is also brilliant and you should watch both programs (although this is definitely more suitable for children). However, if you insist that this is not the same and it is not just Doctor Who, please stay in your basement. <br /> <br /> 10/10
