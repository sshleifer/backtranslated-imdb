This film, as my Chinese girlfriend informed me, features two famous Hong Kong pop stars. While this may make the film a mere marketing ploy, I found the acting acceptable, and they are both cute. <br /> <br /> The story is very bad overall. The vampiric traits and weaknesses are, however, used humorously, and created some unique bits of entertainment. The quarrel between the two girls made me laugh, and it worked out well with the well-executed action scenes to create a fun movie.
