The German-born Turkish director Faith Akin captures in his film the endless variety of different styles of music and songs in Istanbul, a city that is a bridge between East and West, a city uniquely located on both sides of the Bosphorus. Europe and Asia. Kurdish singers represented by Aynur, who performs his own brand of Kurdish, passionate and melodic gospel music. We are introduced to instrumental romanis, Orhan Gencebay, who has been called Elvis of Arabesque music - music sounds are heard throughout the city as Faith Akin takes us to underground clubs, street performers and recording sessions. German bassist Alexander Hacke, who comes to Istanbul to play and learn about Turkish music, cites Confucius: "To understand the place, you have to listen to the music you play." Akin's great documentary does just that - it gives us 90 minutes of music that helps bridge the bridges. For me, watching the movie was especially interesting because I recently visited Istanbul as part of my holiday and spent four days there. The city fascinated me with its images, colors, crowds, vibrancy and visual beauty. Now, I can add the sounds of music to the ever-changing portrait of Istanbul.
