this movie made me stuck in this endless cycle of thinking about it days later ... I'm not the snob in the movie that some people around here seem to be, but I thought this was incredibly well-intentioned, and a powerful creation, if lacking a little subtlety in the execution. By chance I admire movies that can effectively recreate the feeling of watching a play, this creates a disharmonious eeriness that works well with this movie. I'm also a big fan of Alan Rickman, so that may be my prejudice. personally, I found the lack of spatial landmarks a good thing - in fact, this could be anywhere and probably is. I say it's easy to have a powerful experience for me and probably for anyone involved in any kind of political activity.
