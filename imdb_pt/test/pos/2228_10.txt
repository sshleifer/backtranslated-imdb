I remember watching this movie in its late teens or early twenties on TV - probably on HBO. I watched with my parents, a brother and some friends. Since it was about 30 years ago, I do not remember much of the story. I remember that the whole group that watched agreed that this was the funniest movie we've ever seen. When it was over, our bellies ached so much to laugh. My father worked in a hospital, which made everything even better. <br /> <br /> Every time I see The Party on the TV charts, I look to see if it's there too. To my amazement, it never is. Although I loved the party, I feel this is funnier. Peter Sellers was great as a corrupt hospital administrator. Why it was never released on video is a mystery to me. It's a classic, but it seems like no one under 35 or 40 was allowed to see it. I would buy in a second if they were released on DVD.
