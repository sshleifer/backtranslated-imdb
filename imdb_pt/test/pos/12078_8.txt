This has to be the best girl movie of all time. We recorded the tape in the years before and I watched it about 30 times over the years. I had not seen him in 12 years and recently watched this movie. I'm not lying, I cried from the opening credits to the final credits. This movie really rips your heart out even if you do not have kids.
