I agree with BigAlC - this film really set me up for many of the cultural and practical differences before going to live in Japan for a year in 1993. Tom Selleck does a fantastic job here as always and the film is very humorous and educational . I'm a big fan of Tom Selleck, and he blesses that part with his usual charisma and charisma for that part, bringing the film to life in a way that I can not imagine any other actor being able to achieve. <br /> <br /> This film featured some first-rate Japanese actors, and it was great fun watching them while they interacted with Selleck - I can imagine the fun he had during the actual filming of the movie - Japan is an incredible place to go, if you want to party, see the view or just try to take everything inside
