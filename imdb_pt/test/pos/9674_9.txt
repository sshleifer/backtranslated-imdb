This is a great show, it makes me wonder why it was taken off the air so many times. But I believe you're here to stay now! This show can not be compared to any other, before the Simpsons were well "on the edge" and that came Family Guy, and they are struggling to get off the edge. The things that this show takes is incredible. Fully work the watch! If you like the Simpsons you will love the family guy!
