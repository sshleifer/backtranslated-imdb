Three zany couples, all SIX OF A KIND, get entangled in a mad search for stolen loot. <br /> <br /> This is a cheerful, hilarious comedy with six stars - Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland, WC Fields & Alison Skipworth, George Burns and Gracie Allen - all committed to doing what they did best: getting giggles . <br /> <br /> Ruggles and Boland make another film appearance as husband and wife - this time more loving than usual. They were a perfect team - she the raucous lioness, he the nervous rabbit - and they dominate most of the time on the screen here. From start to finish, they are a delight. <br /> <br /> Burns & Allen continue the idea that originated in Vaudeville, perfected in the radio and ended up going to the television, with George, the perpetual hetero and Gracie, the eternal idiot. . Sometimes in the movie, it tends to be a little overdone, but it's hard not to like it. His heart was obviously made of solid gold. <br /> <br /> While Skipworth gets a rather short look - only fragments of his formidable personality pass by - Fields is in his element as the disgraced sheriff of Nuggetville, Nevada. Whether explaining how he earned the nickname "Honest John" or sneaking into the night looking for the missing moola, he is never less than wonderful. Best of all, he manages to execute all of his classic pool routine, preserving it forever for a grateful posterity. Finally, he performs the miracle almost miraculously - he makes Gracie shut up. <br /> <br /> Paramount was so pleased with the success of SIX OF A KIND that they wanted to rush the protagonists into another comedy. Only Fields refused. He felt he had now reached the point where he no longer needed to share a movie with other celebrity comic books. The studio finally agreed and began the preparation of Fields' first solo feature, YOU'RE TELLING ME (1934).
