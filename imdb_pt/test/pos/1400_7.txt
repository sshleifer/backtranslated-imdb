I finally got a chance to settle down and compare the two versions of this movie - First, the good old scandalous Embassy VHS movie called SCREAMERS, and then a new Italian DVD totally restored by the new media company everyone's favorite No shame Italy. <br /> <br /> The American ads about "men turned inside out" is as everyone says, totally misleading, and indicative of an interpretation of Roger Cormanized about what otherwise would be a superior thriller of adventure and fantasy. adults. The complete Italian version is somewhat extensive, well-designed and deliberately rhythmic on "Dr. Moreau's Island," and there is nothing wrong with that. It's a sumptuous and beautiful Euro Horror ride with a brain, good plot, character development, rental of photos, costumes and scenarios, etc. <br /> <br /> But I must admit that the 14-year-old pufferfish is still on the prowl. somewhere inside me I get a bigger kick from Roger Corman's more hoarse, sloppy, sloppy version, which has a bit more good gore, a flamboyant but absurd opening segment, and then the bulk of Martino's original film , though somewhat abbreviated to make room for Roger's idea of ​​entertainment. The pace was a little faster, the shock gets closer, and you see both the fantastic form of Bach and the Italian version. <br /> <br /> I still do not have much. idea about what the specific story is about: there are several twists and turns that were difficult to keep up with. A local voodoo subplot did not help much, and it's funny how it all culminates in just one more fight between the noble castaway prisoner and the mad scientist ... Maybe some more visions are in order. I'll say this: Film fans should benefit from one of these PAL imports and take a look at what a film really is, rather than just another old homemade video - the widescreen compositions reveal once again that Martino had an eye for filling your screen with interesting things. Nobody gets ripped out like the SCREAMERS picture, but it's still interesting, and once again proves that although their standards may have been practically confined in the area around the gutter, Roger Corman had a great time when he made it, and side by side these are really better movies than they had to be. <br /> <br /> 7/10
