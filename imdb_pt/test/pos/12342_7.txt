This is a horror movie from the early 1980s, in which a young girl (Meg Tilly) wants to take her picture of "two shoes" and becomes part of a gang of girls called The Sisters. His initiation to her consists in spending the night in a mausoleum. Too bad that the mausoleum is the "final" resting place of some Russian psychic psychic and he is still not dead. It looks like this guy was found in his apartment with lots of things stuck on the walls of his kinetic tele-training, and there's a pile of young dead girls in the closet. All proof that the hitchhiker ride can be dangerous, so listen to the girls. The daughter of this man (Reymar) is very disturbed by the death of his father and is confronted by a man who said that he knew Reymar and gave a tape to listen also. Her husband (Adam West, of the fame of Batman) is there to laugh and mock, and not much more. But it seems that Reymar's daughter may also have some skills she does not realize. Anyway, after depositing their unfortunate promise in the mausoleum, the rest of the Sisters go out to get things (like masks, sheets, etc.) to come back and scare her, but they do not suspect what is happening. they get more than their fucking fear. For even in death, Reymar is a busy guy and is reviving many corpses for entertainment. And it also looks like he has something for bait jail. Overall, this is an acceptable horror, nothing too intense, but not terrible. The Media Blasters DVD also contains another version of the movie that is a hard cut, I think, I just watched a bit of it, so I do not know how different the theatrical version is, but from what I saw I think it's a " warts and everything "presentation. 7 out of 10.
