Someone considered this film as a "waste of time" because he expected "the beautiful landscape of Brazil and Portugal", but then everything seemed "faded" or somber, or something like that. I believe that person has lost all part of the film. This is reality. The purpose of this film is to show that life is not, in fact, ideal, and to show what people spend in their lives for family, love and survival. A young man leaves his favela in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, to go to Portugal to visit his mother's home country after his death. He discovers that not everything is free, and that the Brazilians are despised by the natives of Portugal. He finally finds a life, a love, but the story does not end as expected and this is not a "fairy tale" story. The part that won me the most was the final song, "Zeca Bailero (Honey Baby)" by Gal Costa. He fit in so well with the film; especially the end.
