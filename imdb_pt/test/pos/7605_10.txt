'Never Been Kissed' is a really good movie. If you have not seen it yet, rent it. I'll buy it when it's released because I love it. Drew Barrymore is great again, she plays her part well. I felt that I could relate to this movie because of the school days I had were so bad. I thought the plot was well written, there was comedy and romance that are the kind of movies that I love. I loved the ending because even knowing what will happen, still leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting - anticipating !!
