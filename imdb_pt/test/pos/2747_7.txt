Many of the previous reviews are certain about the money, but some, well, not so much. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie 'B' ... it is well produced, the live flight sequences are really excellent. and the sequences of the model are first order. It is not cheap". <br /> <br /> Ricard Barthelmess is very good at it, and does a good job for "Only Angels Have Wings". <br /> <br /> If you want to find John Wayne, point J. Carrol Naish first, they end up together. Tom Browne is rather young (and a little annoying), but when they put him in the most pathetic pencil whiskers in Hollywood history, it makes his character even less credible. Sally Eilers is much more. As for later influences, this is Wellman in the Airliner-in-Distress zone ... the opening sequence of this movie, with the Air Operations guy coming to "Grand Central Airport" would have fit very well in "The High and the Mighty" ... imagine Regis Toomey ... and a 1955 Buick.
