Thursday is clearly derived from the "new wave" of crime films released since Quentin Tarantino, who took the genre to the stormy with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction in the early nineties, but has enough ideas to ensure it remains a small interesting movie. . Thursday uses some characters mainly within a single location. It works because each character is quirky enough to be memorable, and when together what you have is a very entertaining thriller. There is little substance to be found within the plot, but it does not matter, because no one enters into this kind of movie expecting a life-affirming experience. The plot follows Casey; a former drug dealer who went straight and is now living as a successful suburban architect with his wife. The pair wants to adopt a child, but things go wrong when Casey receives a visit from her former partner in the crime, Nick, who brought with her a case of heroin and a load of money stolen from the police. Thursday will be a very interesting day for our ex-criminal ... <br /> <br /> The first scene sets the movie very well and ensures that we know what to expect. We see a coffee order go wrong, which turns into a murder scene that the culprits readily cover up when a police officer comes in to freshen up. The scene is drenched in black humor and witty dialogue, and it happens throughout the rest of the film. Thursday is a very funny movie, and scenes like those that see the adoption visitor show up at a strange time guarantee that the film is hard to dislike. It is true that the film brings nothing new to the table, cinematically or in terms of plot, but the fact that it is happy to wallow in its derision ensures that there is more time for the absurd situation to hoard around the central characters. The acting is decent enough, with the whole cast clearly amused by this plot. Thomas Jane performs well in the lead role, while entertaining portraits of James LeGros, Paulina Porizkova, Michael Jeter, Glenn Plummer and Mickey Rourke all support him well. This movie is unlikely to impress the more experienced fans, but if you just want a fun little movie with some nice twists and turns; Thursday is likely to be enough.
