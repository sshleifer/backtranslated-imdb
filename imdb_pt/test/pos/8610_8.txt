This movie is a fascinating drama about making a movie. The actor and the actress really do not support each other, but we've created a scene where they are going to have sex - for the first time, by script. The actress shows little emotion on or off the camera in the plot, besides being freezing in the first scenes on a beach. The actor is self-absorbed and increasingly challenges the director's direction, Jeanne. I could not help but get involved in the drama of "how can these two possibly go their way through a sex scene?" This drama itself becomes more exciting than the nudity and the real preliminaries made for the cameras. Not that Roxane Mesquida is not adorable and worth seeing naked! However, there is a very young stage hand that walks through some scenes as an extra. I think it's her on the left end of one of the photos (2 of 9) here on IMDb. I do not even know if this girl is credited, but when she goes through (completely dressed, of course) in confident indifference with her short blonde hair - SHE is sexy! WHO IS THIS GIRL ??
