Film noir at its best. Defined in the aftermath of World War II (1946), "Crossfire" portrays the good, the evil and the ugly of that time. Monty Montgomery kills Sam because Sam is a Jew and therefore automatically perceived through Monty's narrow lens because he was a lazy man who left fighting in the war. Monty does not like people like that. The truth is that Sam was also a soldier, but the truth is something that disappears when you are feeling good about the ideologies of hatred that you have been immersed and the world is full of dirty things. brand of "cleaning". <br /> <br /> Monty is a sadist in gaining soldier clothes. The losers of World War II had more than their share, as did hate-biased leaders and soldiers. Some of them were hanged for war crimes, such as starting a "war of aggression." <br /> <br /> This movie left its creators in trouble when that other sadistic American cleaner, Joe McCarthy, had his audiences in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> See "Crossfire," just for see how good the actor Robert Ryan was. The real Robert Ryan was not Monty. He was a great actor, if underestimated, used. <br /> <br /> See "Crossfire" and prove the dark side of post-World War II America. See it for a taste of the good side of the late 1940s in America as well. Robert Mitchim and Robert Young also play leading roles. Mitchim could have played the role of Ryan, in fact, when he played the psychopath in "Cape Fear."
