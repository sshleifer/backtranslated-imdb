When I saw this movie for the first time in mid-January (2005), I did not like it. I found it very strange and thought that some parts that the main star, Judith Light, acted were so different from her. (Which of course is true) And then I watched bits of it the next day when it aired and felt pretty much the same. Then I watched again two Sundays ago (March 20, 2005) and I started to really enjoy it and this time I recorded the whole thing. I even cried the first two times, but mostly because the actress was crying and I'm a big fan of her. <br /> <br /> It's a very well represented TV movie. Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a great job in this movie! I keep watching it over and over again. It's a sad movie, but very good. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it! It's not usually my kind of movie, but I liked that! A +++
