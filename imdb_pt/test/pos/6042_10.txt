I have not seen this movie in 50 years, but I'm coming in on a comment about it anyway. Although the JACK WEBB movie was undoubtedly conceived of as entertainment only - showing basic naval training on Parris Island in realistic terms as a hard character-building exercise - it was said that the military feared that the film would discourage recruitment. It did not work that way. The film showed that getting into the Marines was a bigger challenge than most young people ever realized, and (guess what?) Being offered a life-size challenge was exactly what many guys wanted. I personally met many guys who joined the Marines shortly after seeing THE DI. The ranks in the recruitment centers were so long that the Marines had more recruits than they could bear. <br /> <br /> So go. America will always have young people seeking to become the best - while the lazy and those who are born losers run to nothing. <br /> <br /> What we do not have in 2007 is any movie that inspires patriotism, devotion to duties of any kind, positive values, et cetera. What we have are films that inspire wind-heads to be wind-heads, beer drinkers to consume beer, other negative values. The first exposure is that the transvestite teenager and SUPERBAD beer is now in 81st place on the All Time Great Films list. Values ​​What do you mean by values?
