First, there is a detective story: "légitime défense," by Belgian Stanislas André Steeman, whose "l'assassin habite au 21" Clouzot had already been transferred to the screen in 1942 with Pierre Fresnay and the same actress Suzy Delair . on the adaptation of Clouzot for both films. The 1942 film was excellent, but the "detective story" side was kept, so why complain? As for "Quai des orfèvres," Clouzot was now in a new phase of his brilliant career. having driven "le corbeau" and been blacklisted, he had much more to say than a simple whodunit. The director essentially complained about the end of the detective, which I will not reveal of course, but Clouzot focused on the social vignettes, the characters of his character. psychology, and he did not give a damn about Agatha Christie's riddle. In doing so, he becomes the genuine predecessor of CLaude Chabrol, who has always been closer to him than to Alfred Hitchcock, whom he admires greatly. Suzy Delair has a great screen presence, and you'll love the song she really sings (she was also a singer) "avec son tralala" .Bernard Blier gives, as always, a performance of gestures and words, and he really takes it Two characters are particularly interesting and disturbing: the first, Dora, the photographer: she takes pictures of female models, and Clouzot, through subtle touches, reveals to us that she is a lesbian. Of course, the word is never spoken. be in 1947?) The police chief (fabulous Louis Jouvet) tells her, "You and I, we are not lucky with women." The picture of this policeman is very detailed: we learned a lot of things about him, not necessary connected with the Delair / Blier plot: he is a widower, with a son he adores and who faces scholastic difficulties, particularly in geometry. So we know all the characters in depth. One of the most important manifestos of post-war French cinema. .
