I'm not to like these anime cartoons (eg. Pokemon, Dragonball Z, Naruto), but Zatch Bell is different in my opinion. Zatch Bell is more exciting, has better characters, and does not focus so much on a kind of Gun or Mamodo as much as the episodes I've seen, as he episodes "Big Brother Kanchome", "Zatch vs. Kiyo". Zatch Bell really focuses on the life of the strange Zatch, the clever Kiyo, The Clueless Suzy, and the Weiter Ponygon.Zatch Bell is probably my Fav Cartoon for now, but I encourage others to watch his 1 Episode, you'll probably like it! <br /> <br /> -Robbie H.
