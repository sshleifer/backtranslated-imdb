As many of today's movies are guilty, the plot is not exactly stellar, the movie does not move anyone, and certainly this does not guarantee any prize (out of Blockbusters' maybe) ... but again, who really Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro come together to produce a very funny movie, sometimes hilarious, which I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner also played their small parts. Dude, I hope in the future my wife will age as well as Miss. Renee. <br /> <br /> Moving on, this little movie makes a lot of laughs in a reasonable amount of time. The movie is nice enough to avoid waiting for the video / DVD release and instead go ahead and take a look. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy is in his best shape and is absolutely delightful to watch. De Niro fit that type of paper perfectly. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie and I think any movie fan who needs a good movie or just a good laugh will really enjoy Showtime. <Br /> High Performance: Murphy. Hilarious. Enough said. Direction: Nice. Nice action scenes, used Murphy and De Niro together as a charm, Russian fed himself on a good supporting job. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 7 out 10. Will not move you or anything ... but it's an extremely nice movie. <br /> <br /> It's Showtime ... it was a big hit.
