One of the best horror / suspense movies I've seen in a long time. Wow, it was a big surprise and amazing how good this movie was, sometimes a jewel like this will pop up, but it's rare. I expected a popcorn monster movie and a slightly fun way to spend a night, but instead a very well made and directed film, with great acting and done with passion and heart. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that makes you feel for the characters and what happens to them, and it's filmed as if you were there and it's really happening. I know some people in other reviews compare to "Open Water", but I disagree because I thought Open Water was very boring and mediocre, while this movie was the opposite, although superficially they are filmed in the same "realistic" style. The actors are unknown, at least to me, but all are very effective and convey the terrible situation with scary intensity and realism. The story is well made and flows smoothly, the plot is logical and seems to be something that could happen, all the actions and thoughts of the characters are exactly what a person would do and would think. Very believable and this makes the movie more real because of it. <br /> <br /> I had tears in the eyes in the end. I must say that a movie rarely has that effect on me, it's how powerful and emotional this movie was made and I'm impressed with the director and the actors in this great film.
