2:37 can admirably show us what Australian teenagers feel and do not say. These are the stories of real children and I think it would be naive to think otherwise. The only new thing that 2:37 really brings us is an Australian point of view. We often watch troubled American children, but we often fail to link the same problems to our own teens. Performed with clever and ingenious cinematography, however (with the immediate recognition of the disappointing final song) I found the musical direction lacking in sophistication. I applaud the fabulous casting of this movie. These are the regular-looking Australian children who invite a lot of sympathy for this. Great performances everywhere and you can not beat Gary Sweet, this movie reminded me why sometimes high school is a drug and unless you are picky, or you like to get out with heat and fuzzies, go see 2:37.
