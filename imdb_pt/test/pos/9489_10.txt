Zeppelin is my favorite band, so when I heard that this double dvd was coming out, I was understandably excited. I'll get right to the point here, and say that if you are any fan of Zeppelin, you should run away and buy this right away! It is absolutely spectacular! He blows 'The Song Remains The Same' completely out of the water. Why this stuff has never been released before is beyond me. The footage shown here shows Zep at the height of his game, which I never really felt that 'Song' really did. Jimmy Page is the best of all, no doubt, and these performances make Jimi Hendrix look like an idiot! Keep an eye on the live 'White Summer' jam ... huh! <br /> <br /> Long live Jimmy Page! <br /> <br /> Viva Led Zeppelin! <br /> <br /> 11 out of 10
