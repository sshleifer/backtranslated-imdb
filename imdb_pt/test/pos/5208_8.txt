The movie is about the Battle of Stalingrad. For those of you who know nothing about it, it was the worst battle in World War II. More than 1 million people died in the course of the battle. This is the only movie I've seen that seems to have really captured how bad things were in the war between Russia and Germany. What I really liked is that the two ideologies (Nazism and Communism) were not in the film. Unlike most American films, the Germans are not seen as bloodthirsty killers, but what the average German soldier was, a person. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad. They were moved to try to take over the city. The film follows these men from August 1942 to early 1943. During this period they learn about the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, one feels the despair of the whole battle. Unlike "Enemy at the Gates," the filmmakers did not try to put a love story or dress real facts of the battle. This movie may be fiction, but it conveys what happened in the bloodiest battle of World War II.
