Film about two Australian girls - Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight) - and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfers. <br /> <br /> I caught it at an art theater here in America. in 1981. Technically I was still a teenager (I was 19), so I was interested in seeing how Australian teenagers acted. Script wise there is nothing new here. It shows the usual adolescent adventures dealing with dating, sex, suicide, etc. etc. I always knew what was going to happen before but I was never bored. What I found interesting was, despite the accent and some changes in clothes and hair, these teens are not much different from American teenagers. They had many of the same difficulties and difficulties. Also this was based on a book by a real surfer and his real-life adventures and (I heard it) was a faithful adaptation of it. The acting was just OK, but the actors were attractive and this was well done and very interesting. So this is not an unknown masterpiece, but a pretty accurate picture of what it is to be a teenager and try to be with the popular kids. I give a 7.
