I really liked this movie. He was nervous without being sociopathic. Vin Diesel brought the Riddick character to life and made you feel good and bad about him on different levels. <br /> <br /> I also saw Iron Giant and Vin is perfect. (The snowmobile movie - oh yes, it's called "Triple-X" or "xXx" -was a weak example of his work.) In Pitch Black he plays an anti-hero to the fullest. I do not think you can go wrong when Vin stars in a movie. Unfortunately, Hollowood can type it as an action-adventure star - wrong! I think the script for "XXX" was weak for which Vin could not act on it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Pitch Black is a great scifi - check this out! <br /> <br /> - Zafoid
