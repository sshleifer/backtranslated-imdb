Rock Star is a "cool" movie. Everyone is cool. Even the guys who should not be cool are cool. Chris is a cool guy who learns a life lesson. He returns to his girlfriend Emily, who is also cool. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie, despite all the gentleness. Maybe I'm used to all the angst of X Gen's music. In a way, the movie was a caricature of Rock Stars and not strong enough to be believable. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg's performance is very good. Jennifer Aniston played her role well, but it was uncomplicated. She was a nice girl. <br /> <br /> Go and see. If you've ever been to a rock show or seen Spinal Tap, go see.
