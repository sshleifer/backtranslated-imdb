Police officer Dirk Hendricks (Jamie Bartlett) files an amnesty request to Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofor). <br /> <br /> A member of the South African parliament who does not remember the torture he once faced as a captive political activist. Sarah Barcant (Hilary Swank), meanwhile, returns to her homeland to represent Mpondo. Like Steve Sizela, Mpondo's friend who was arrested with him, and I never heard of it again. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best films on the South African regime of Aparthied in the past. <br /> <br /> Everyone should watch it.
