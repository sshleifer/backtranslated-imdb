I just saw this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and I must say I found it incredible. The combination of humor and sincerity really made the movie worth it. The film was about a seventeen-year-old boy whose mother and father are very religious. Ben, age seventeen, decides to work for a retired actress who teaches him about girls, direction and life. It is very comic and touching. I honestly have to say that now is one of my favorite movies. I recommend this movie to everyone. If you have not watched one of the screenings at the film festival, it should appear in theaters later this year. Please go and see! It's a great movie.
