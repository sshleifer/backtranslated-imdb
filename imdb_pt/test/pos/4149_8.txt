This review is in response to the presentation asking how factually correct the film was ... <br /> <br /> I saw this movie last year and found it inspiring that hopeful immigrants, like my Italian grandparents who came across Ellis Island in the At the turn of the last century, it would be subjected to all kinds of invasive inspection only to enter America. <br /> <br /> Certainly it was an opportunity for the eyes, since my grandmothers never spoke of anything terrible while they were there. My grandmother was 5 and my grandfather was 18 when they arrived. <br /> I just came back from a trip to New York where I had the pleasure of visiting Ellis Island and the museum really drives you through immigration. The filmmaker obviously did his research, up to the medical examinations and equipment, questions and puzzles. They are all there in the museum. Even the wedding photos and the board room review - Correctly correct! Anyone who has immigrant grandparents should see this movie. Inspired to say the least.
