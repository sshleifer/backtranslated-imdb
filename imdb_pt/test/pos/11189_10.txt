This movie means entertanment. It's the funniest movie I've ever seen. The lines, the acting. And the clothes, wow, talk about 70: s. If you have ever seen this little gem, buy it. It's worth every penny. By the way, the opening song is incredible. If anyone knows where I can find. Please, send me an e-mail.
