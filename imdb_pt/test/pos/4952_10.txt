Lou Gossett, Jr. is great as 'Chappy Sinclair', a super US Air Force pilot who comes to the rescue of a good but unruly 'Doug Masters' (Jason Gedrick), the son of a captured pilot who is determined to borrow a pair of F-16 fighters to use in an attempt to save his father from a dictator (David Suchet) from an enemy country abroad. Better than 'Top Gun', this Air Force aviation flick has zest and explosions - you know, all the cool things you want from a contemporary military adventure film. <br /> <br /> Cool music including Twisted Sister's Dee Snider singing 'We're Not Gonna Take It' and 'Never Say Die' by King Cobra. <br /> <br /> Aim High! Air force!
