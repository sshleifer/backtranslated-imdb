if you watch this at home on DVD or Bluray! Make sure you have a great sound system. The soundtrack through that is what moves you through the movie. I watched the movie several times and thought it was great, but after just up-grading my home theater sound system, what a difference. I will watch this movie many, many times. <br /> <br /> If you do not have a great sound system. find a friend to do and watch there. <br /> <br /> see also the extra stories and the accompanying extra backstage (the BR or DVD.) the Quimet interview in the 1960s talks about your background scholarship ... but for those moments just boys understood. today I hope some of them are for girls ...
