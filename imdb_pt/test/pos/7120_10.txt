There are few movies that deal with things that I would consider myself an expert, this is it. <br /> <br /> After a few years of fantasy RPG we parted, I do not leave without a feeling of shame than I You've become an idiot. See, these things are really canonical, it happens to everyone. <br /> <br /> First you create a character fairly and he dies after the first attack. <br /> <br /> So you help a little with the constitution, and while you are at it, why not help with strength, intelligence, intuition, charisma and dexterity as well? This, in turn, frustrates the game master who does not know how to deal with this invincible gang. And after a while annoying the players too, then they begin to create increasingly exotic combinations of racing professions, no matter how ridiculous it may be. <br /> <br /> I've created a druedain warrior monk, yeah, not so far. And that's not all to be said about the destructiveness of the dynamics inherent in this diabolical game (think of the quest for experience points), but only watch the movie, it shows everything - and of course, the stupidity of its most basic premises. <br /> <br /> To this end, in turn, there is no better profession than the bard. I do not understand exactly why the bard has become a character in the first place, after all, the blacksmith is none at all. But once it became one, it had to be mapped out in the flow of the game, that is: it had to be made lethal, at least indirectly. The joke with this never comes to an end and rightly so. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not exactly a professional production, but I have not seen a better satire for centuries.
