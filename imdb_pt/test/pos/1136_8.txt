When I first heard about "Greek", I realized I would watch it because it sounded ridiculous. Another of ABC Family's such bad programs are almost good. But getting in tune with a college friend found us enjoying the pilot episode much more than we expected. <br /> <br /> As a member of a Greek society, I can say that many of the stereotypes that are mentioned here are those that come up almost every time someone starts talking about brotherhoods and fraternities on a campus. And they are also very fun to play, they are just for watching a TV screen. The opening scene referred to a only slightly dramatized version of preparation for a formal race in some sororities and continued thereafter. <br /> <br /> This is not a show for the super-sensitive Greeks. If you are offended even with jokes about things that are not so good about Greek life, then you will spend the entire first episode, and probably many others, shrinking and screaming. But everyone should have a lot of fun watching. It's nothing new, but when it comes to college, nothing is.
