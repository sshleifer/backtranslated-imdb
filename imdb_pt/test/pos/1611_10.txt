Are the places by the sea sad and sad places that are always represented in movies and novels? Certainly this film, along with the quasi-contemporary "Do not Look Now", portrays Venice as a particularly squalid and decadent tourist trap (for a more laid-back approach, see "Just Married" with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy). Having never been to Venice, I can not say for sure, but it is a perfect setting for this sombre but sumptuous spectacle of Luchino Visconti, one of the great designers of world cinema. Having seen the film, now I would like to have read the novel by Thomas Mann on which it is based (which also inspired an opera by Sir Benjamin Britten). As I do not know the background story and the film has little plot or exposure, I think about Aschenbach's (Dirk Bogarde) obsession with young Tadzio. Is he homosexual? A pedophile? Or is his desire for beautiful youth something more innocent? Maybe Tadzio reminds him of what he might have been and now he knows he will never be. Those who complain about the slow pace of this movie should stick to car accidents and kung-fu: at 2 o'clock and 15 minutes is not particularly long, and moves at a leisurely pace, but hardly slow. The film benefits from the rapturous music of Gustave Mahler, about whom Aschenbach's character is clearly based. Dirk Bogarde makes a moving presentation, and the film is graced by the presence of Silvana Mangano, one of the great beauties of Italy, as the mother of Tadzio.
