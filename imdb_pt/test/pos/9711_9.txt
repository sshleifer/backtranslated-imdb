Where do I start? I sat ready to laugh a little and I was delighted! This movie is just perfect, it's indescribable. Jackass Number Two in all honesty was coarser, more obscene, funnier, and more fun than the first. That was exactly what I needed tonight. <br /> <br /> There are so many scenes in this movie that will make you say "Oh My! No Way!" or "Oh!" Perfectly mastered and assembled, every event and scene was coordinated before and therefore even more perfect. Loved every minute! I will only say that there was even a scene where it was necessary to censor specific scenes to avoid an NC-17 classification! It was so much fun that they had to put it anyway! Surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> 9/10. Incredibly funny, do not miss it!
