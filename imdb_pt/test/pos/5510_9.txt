This thriller is one of the few (movie) surprises I've had in a while. Everyone - and I mean EVERYONE - I said when I was in theaters I said it was horrible ... but then I started to think ... none of these people really understands horror / suspense movies or metal rock - so WHY DO I I listen to them in the first place ????? This movie kicks ass - but ONLY if you are able to understand and enjoy this type of entertainment. In short (too late) - watch with an open mind and this can simply open your mind. ... great soundtracks too ...
