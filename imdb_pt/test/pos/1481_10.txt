I really liked this movie. My only problem is that I thought the actor who plays the villain was a Michael Ironside with a low income. Of Corse Ironside is just a low rent Jack Nicholson. I think Mike was busy that year with "Highlander 2: The Quickening". Unfortunately, "Beastmaster 2" would have been a much better career move. It's certainly the best of the Beastmaster series and, in many ways, reminiscent of that big-screen classic "Masters of the Universe." Not only starring the incomparable Mark Singer, he also features an incredible supporting cast, specifically the second girl from "Sliders," Uncle Phil's "Fresh Prince of Belair" and the evil "Superman 2" girl. It has shaken my world and is certainly a must see for those who do not have social or physical outlets. BEASTMASTER FOREVER !!! ROCK N ROLL !!!
