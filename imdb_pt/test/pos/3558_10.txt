Based to some extent on writers, David Croft and Jimmy Perry, own experiences as artists of Butlins Holiday Camp in the UK during the same time scale as the program follows, "Hi-De-Hi!" sums up postwar post-war "clowning, postcard humor". Situated in the fictional seaside town of Crimpton-on-Sea, "Hi-De-Hi" chronicles the comic happenings within the Maplins Holiday Camp - one of the many scattered the British coast owned by the mega-rich but never seen (on screen) Joe Maplin. <br /> <br /> Although the actual show began in 1980 with the pilot episode and ran until 1988, when the BBC considered it very docile for the avant-garde comedy department, seasons 1 to 5 focused on 1959 while the seasons 6 to 9 lit up 1960 - a time when the old Holiday Holiday Camp began to fall: during the first 5 seasons, Jeffrey Fairbrother (brilliantly late, great Simon Cadell) was the entertainment manager of the camp, a former well- intentional, though somewhat thoughtful, freeing himself from his upper class and venturing into the "real" world to lead his entertainment team which was in contrast to his own relaxed personality. from 6, Fairbrother was replaced by Clive Dempster (played by David Griffin when Cadell left the show at the height of his popularity), a former RAF war hero who in many ways was similar to Cadell's character in second flat, but more a bastard than a gentleman. <br /> <br /> However, the real "Hi-De-Hi" stars over the nine seasons were Ted Bovis (played superbly by Paul Shane), a stereotypical working class, drinking beer, obscene comics - someone who could never resist an opportunity to rape the campers; Gladys Pugh (played by Ruth Madoc who is currently making a comeback with appearances on the BBC Comedy hit "Little Britain"), head of Yellowcoat (which the entertainment team was called because of their yellow jackets) and sports organizer - but more importantly, the one person who saved Jeffrey Fairbrother and Clive Dempster from embarrassment by covering up his inexperience in running a vacation camp; Peggy Ollerenshaw (Su Pollard), the discreet yet lovable cottage maid with a fiery ambition to become a Yellowcoat, and Ted's protected innocent Spike Dixon (Jeffrey Holland), learning more about show business than he expected. <BR> <BR> As usual with a Croft & Perry production, the cast of characters was a lot of misfits thrown out superbly by the actors involved. Mr. Partridge (played by the late Leslie Dwyer, who was in his 70s when he left the program), the childish artist who hates alcoholic children; Fred Quilly (Felix Bowness), a former champion jockey with a dubious past; Yvonne and Barry Stuart-Hargreaves (Dianne Holland and Barry Howard), the snobbish former ballroom dance champions who were in the twilight of their careers; and Sylvia and Betty (Nikki Kelly and Rikki Howard), the two main girls, Yellowcoats, who were always looking for the kind of fun Joe Maplin would never allow in one of their fields. "Hi-De-Oi" typified the slapstick era of the late 1950s with its cheeky, and to some extent, vulgar "ironic" humor (jokes about people sitting in bathrooms and anecdotes about " women with big knockers "were the order of the public). day). But despite the scent of "Carry On," it was always so innocent and it became something of the family recommended in the 80's. Of course critics of the program noted that the show exceeded the expectation for good years, but I disagree. While the early seasons focused mainly on obscene humor and slapstick, the latest series of "Hi-De-Hi" put more thought into the scripts and the main characters (especially Spike Dixon & Gladys Pugh) were able to grow with a more sensitive story lines . That being said, there were some criticisms of the program. Clive Dempster was not Jeffrey Fairbrother, and the former did not have on-screen chemistry with Gladys like Jeffrey (I personally think it would be more believable if Gladys married Jeff); five seasons dedicated to 1959 and four to 1960 caused more than just a few continuity errors (the disappearance of old faces and the introduction of new characters were not adequately explained, especially with the Yellowcoats who entered and left very regularly, Gladys Pugh, who in the pilot episode was a free-devouring man who was suddenly turned into a naive virgin as a character! Also to speak rather pedantically, most of the 1959 holiday season was covered in season one, stretching the rest of the year in five more shows was unbelievable. "Still, the show was not meant to be meticulously seen, and comedy more than surpassed its flaws. In all," Hi "De-Hi" was probably one of the last comedies of the BBC's Golden Age, and even though it has never rivaled such British comic mainstays as "Only Fools & Horses", "Porridge" or even "The Summer Wine "," Hi De Hi "Will Be Bes I do not remember it as a comedy that the whole family could enjoy. If you have not yet checked out, I beg you to do so.
