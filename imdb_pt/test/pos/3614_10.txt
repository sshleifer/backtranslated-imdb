A beautiful and sensitive film that brings home the futility and cruelty of wars, no matter what the so-called reasons. The performance of Cage and Cross was quite impressive, but it is for the older Greek characters who are the highest praise. Irene Papas is as beautiful as ever! Although some scenes seem a bit long, this movie will be a strong candidate for the Oscars.
