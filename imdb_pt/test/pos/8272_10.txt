I'm so glad I recorded it on VHS tape when it showed up at the Master Piece Theater. This is a movie that I can watch again and again. Since living in the early 1800's in England is not difficult enough, Prue is born with a "hare lip" and has been marginalized since birth. The people in her village accept her a little, but always fear that she is "the devil's forge" and be quick to turn it on. Especially when much bad luck falls on your family. She is strong and brave but escapes from Kester Woodseaves, a traveling weaver who catches her eye. Partly because she fears rejection and also because she thinks he is so manly that he should have a wife as lovely as a lily. Kester is a modern man who does not believe in the superstitions of the time and speaks his mind and follows his heart. The film remains true to the original story of Mary Webb and is fascinating from beginning to end.
