This is a good episode, but it's not my favorite. A lot of people love it and the creative level is brilliant. Most of the episode has no dialogue, which is such a cool idea and "Hush" deals very well with the silence. In addition, this episode features Tara, whom I really like. But I do not like Riely or Initative or Maggie Walsh and they seem to have a lot of screen time in "Hush". Besides, I do not think the Gentlemen are so scary and I got tired of seeing the car around Sunnydale. I know I'm in the minority, but I tend to advance parts of "Hush." Of course, there are other parts of the episode that I think are great, so if you're watching on DVD, I'd recommend watching this episode. It's really a classic. <br /> <br /> "Hush" revolves around the entire city losing their voices. Skelatal looking demon-guys called the lords arrive to gather seven hearts of human victims, but if they hear a human cry, they die. So they steal the voices of everyone in town. Buffy and the Scoobies try to figure out what's going on, while the Starter also begins to investigate. Meanwhile, Xander notices how much Anya means to him and Willow meets a witch named Tara. Buffy and Riely finally come face to face while fighting the Gentlemen. Both are shocked at what they learn ... He is a command and she is Slayer. In the end, Buffy saves the day, but now she has to deal with her new knowledge of Riely's secret life. <br /> <br /> Actually, the creativity of "Hush" can not be seen in a basic outline of its history. plot. It is the overwhelming silence of the episode, which makes it so good. The characters try to communicate in different ways (white boards, pantomime, obscene gestures with the fingers, etc ...) and everything works very well. After a while, you forget that there is no dialogue because they are all so good at expressing themselves. During the "talk" parts of the episode, there are many references to the importance of actually "listening" to each other. Anya claims that Xander will not actually talk to her. Giles ignores Spike and Xander's protests and urges Spike to move to Xander's apartment. Buffy quickly replaces the word "oil" with "patrol" when she talks to Riely so she does not have to explain her call. And in the end, when Buffy and Riely actually learn the truth over each other, they stand there with nothing to say. It's all very cool. <br /> <br /> There are many good parts in this episode. I love that people keep forgetting that they can not talk. Buffy and Xander try to use the phone. Riley can not use voice recognition in the Starter elevator. People try to scream. It's basically what everyone would really do if they suddenly had no speech. And I think it's hilarious that Spike moved in with Xander. (They will also share an apartment for a little while in Season Seven.) Xander and Spike have a childlike fun that is hilarious. I also like the beginning of Tara and Willow's relationship. Tara plays an important role for the rest of the show and she and Willow are very cute together. It's good to see them just getting started. <br /> <br /> On the downside, I do not understand how gentlemen are choosing their victims. They seem to float in dorms and pick random people. Besides, I do not like Riely. I've never liked him, but from "Hush" I'm practically waiting for Angel to go back to town and beat him up. Finally, what about Olivia after that? It seems we just met her, she and Giles have a relationship, everything is going well ... and then she suddenly fell. I did not understand. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the episode: "Who are the Gentlemen?", De Giles. talk for the Scoobies. The whole scene is wonderful and their heads are just hilarious. He does some similar flashcards in the "First Encounter" of Season Seven. Just about any time Giles starts to draw monsters, it's just going to be fun.
