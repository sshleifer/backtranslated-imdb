I never expected that such an old movie was as impressive as this 1930's western turned out to be. The scenes of the pioneers heading west in their covered wagons, encountering storms and mud, river crossings, Indian attacks, and all sorts of judgment and danger, are astonishing in their rustic credibility. Much of the film was filmed outdoors, and the film has a truly epic feel about it. Actors must have experienced the same conditions as the original pioneers and the results are astounding. The carts, the clothes, all the details look and look right. The characters are simple but believable, with a direct storyline that travels like the wagon to the destination. <br /> <br /> John Wayne is slim and young in one of his early roles, as the scout leads the wagons, and he does a good job as the idealistic frontier boy. He faces a trio of wonderfully scurvy villains, including Ian Keith as a crafty player, Charles Stevens as a Mexican helper, and Tyrone Power, Senior as a bear-like hunter. The bearded, snarling portrait, bigger than life is comical and menacing. I keep imagining him with a bandanna, a gold-plated hoop earring and black eye patch, with a parrot on his shoulder as he growls and growls at various threats and insults. Your character could easily be transferred to a pirate ship without any difficulty. He almost steals the whole picture. <br /> <br /> Tully Marshall is charming as a cunning veteran who is Wayne's best friend. The lovely Marguerite Churchill creates a witty heroine, whose initial encounter with Wayne is a hilarious mess, resulting in a long-lasting affair consisting of insults and feigned indifference on her part to prevent her persistence. The results are humorous and it is a pleasure to see them finally meet in the end. <br /> <br /> The scenery is incredible, with the wagons crossing royal prairies and having to be lowered by ropes on cliffs. Indians who are clearly the genuine article, not white actors in makeup, appear as friends and enemies, and are treated with dignity. Wayne's character tells an admired group of boys that the Indians are his friends, who taught him everything he knows about survival in the desert. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is an uncomplicated tale told by a talented cast and technical team. It will probably look naive to many modern viewers, but there is a quiet dignity about it that never lets it become tacky. There's a lot of intentional humor, including a noisy rogue from a pioneer, that makes sounds of noisy animals hide, every time good player Ian Keith tries to convince the beautiful heroine to marry him. His flowery speeches about the plantation he is supposed to possess are interrupted by very realistic imitations of howling and goofy cats, making the seducer look around, annoyed by the invisible creatures. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, both for western fans and lovers of old movies in general. This is truly a classic movie for ages.
