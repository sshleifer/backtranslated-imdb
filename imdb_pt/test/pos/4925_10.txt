You do not have to be a cartoon fan to enjoy this movie. I first watched when I was nine, having been a fan of the TV show, and my parents laughed as much as I did. It's made in the classic style of Bugs Bunny's drawings of yesterday, and considering today's vulgar cartoons, I think anyone would appreciate a cartoon movie that depended more on "nonsense" than on vulgarity, for some laughter.
