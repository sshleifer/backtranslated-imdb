I could not believe the Adult Swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot, I think I'll stay for a few more episodes. Assy is very funny and the whole police team show characters close by but Assy is hard to fathom and this was a bit frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally an ass riding with nothing but legs that sport socks with leagues and feet with traditional wing tips. Assy drinks too much and "plays by his own rules," as you may have guessed. The only other funny moments are Assy shooting at many people and spending time at home - in the bathroom. It's not funny Squidbillies, but it's worth taking a look.
