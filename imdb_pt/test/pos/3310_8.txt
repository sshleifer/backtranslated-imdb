It is interesting to see how the society of 1950 is portrayed in this film. Men are ravenous, addicted to smoking with something on their mind (time has not changed men much, but "sexual harassment") and women are in the workplace just passing the time until they find a husband and settle down. Some of the dialogues are worthy of embarrassment, but they are charming in an innocent and outmoded way. I love opening credits that show a romantic and exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing "The Best Of Everything" on the soundtrack. I want to go straight to some scenes, shot on NY streets around 1959 and experience a time I've only seen in movies and in photographs. Some scenes from this movie reminded me of "Working Girl" by Melanie Griffith. Especially when Hope Lange (which is a cross between Grace Kelly and Dolores Hart) is bombarded in Stephen Boyd's beautiful apartment, he fucks her and just watches her sleep (as Melanie, she wants to know if "something" happened between them in the day Following ). Joan Crawford is definitely comparable to Sigourney Weaver's lousy female boss, except for being outwardly unpleasant (with a soft core), but Sigourney's character was sweet on the outside and awful on the inside. I found it distressing how the character of Suzy Parker (Gregg) started out as an independent woman with career goals to be an actress who supposedly did not need a man to complete it, it turned out. She becomes a stalker / lunatic / crazy when she leaves the man that she falls in love with his bananas after he breaks up with her. I loved the character Mary Agnes, the office gossip, with her strong New Yawk accent. If you like movies like "Doll's Valley", you'll also like it.
