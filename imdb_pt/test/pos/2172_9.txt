This is a classic unfortunately not recognized. <br /> <br /> The look is superb, the design, the costumes, etc. are impeccable, scenes of battles and the charge of cavalry are both chilling and exciting. <br /> <br /> The characters are vivid and really human. Ardent is right and Fabrice Luchini as the lawyer Derville steals the film with his intelligent pedantic performance, enjoying the ups and downs of the misfortunes of others. Depardieu is good, but maybe a very big presence for that role. <br /> <br /> The place where the film really stands out is the story and also its changes from Balzac's novel. These changes are editorials in which Balzac has a lot of discussion about society and this movie breathes with characters. However, Yves Angelo has retained the key ingredient, not just the missing man trying to regain his place in society, but every character has to find his place in society: Comte Ferraud is trying to buy a nobility, his wife (Ardent) comes from a humble birth and when she was married to Colonel Chabert, they reached their position in the turbulence of post-revolutionary France. Everyone has something to lose in terms of status and this contributes to good drama, as their goals are in conflict. It also feels very modern: money is critical to buy status to achieve power, but someone can descend as quickly as they rise. Derville likes the strategy, he saw the worst of people he says to Chabert when he takes the case. The original place of this speech is at the end of the novel as Balzac summarizes the human comedy with enormous irony.
