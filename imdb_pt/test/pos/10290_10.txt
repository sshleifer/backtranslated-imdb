I just saw this movie again, I believe for the sixth time. I will no doubt see many other times. This is one of the most brilliant French films ever made. Although the film is mysterious, even more mysterious is what happened to writer and director Gilles Mimouni. For ten years he did not make another movie, and this was his only. The story and the execution of this ingenious film are perfect, and it is clearly a continuous tribute to Hitchcock and Buster Keaton. Fractional timing of movements is as carefully controlled as the scene in which the side of a house falls on Keaton in "Steamboat Bill Junior," and he is not killed by inches. In that movie, people lower themselves, turn around, and if they were a second off, they would have collided. The plot, therefore, walks a tightrope of random events to such a degree that you can not take your eyes off the screen for a millisecond, or you lose something crucial. Peter Chase's astonishingly repetitive music recalls Hitchcock's "Vertigo," and the whole movie has the same mysterious quality, but Hitchcock had a woman and two women, Mimouni has two women as a woman, thus reversing the structure of plot. There are cross-references to other Hitchcock films, but it's "Vertigo," which is key to the inspiration of this movie. The theme may seem superficially to be obsessive love, but the film is really about the magic of everyday events, the invisible threads behind the tapestry, the ineffable. Everything is hyper-charged with passionate love and desire, but desire transcends its object and strives for something behind and beyond the object. That is why it is so easily transferable from Lisa to Alice, when it is realized that it is Alice who is more mysterious than Lisa, and it is Alice who truly embodies the Eternal Mystery. The film is finally 'made' by Romane Bohringer. She is so fascinating that she overcomes Monica Bellucci, which is really something to stand out, considering that Bellucci is a knockout beauty, while Bohringer is what the English call 'simple'. However, Romane Bohringer even had earlier dominated the art of "personality dominance," whereby pretty girls get in the way and are not noticed because Romane is being so fascinating that you can not take your eyes off her for a long time. even looks at the beautiful girls, and you end up thinking only of her. Most of us remember, I'm sure, her father, Richard Bohringer, lying in a tub listening to opera in the movie 'Diva' many years ago. I'd rather watch Romane than Richard lying in a bathtub, but there seems to be some genetic secret to be fascinating, because Richard Bohringer is also fascinating, and he's not even a woman. Romane looks like she could turn into Anna Magnani when she's much older, and that means she'll get an Oscar if anyone can just write another 'Rose Tattoo' for her. The girl has a lot of passion inside her, she could put the Seine on fire. Would not it be wonderful if she and Julie Delpy would join? This movie made wonderful use of places in Paris. But where is this 'square in Luxembourg'? It looked like the Place Furstenburg to me. Maybe I missed something. I need to watch the movie six more times, just to study the timing accuracy, who passes by who and makes sure I'm right. The whole thing is like ten gigantic simultaneous chess games, thrown blindfolded by a great master. How exciting is everything! Romane, you can look out my window anytime! Mimouni, come on, let's discuss impossibilities, unpredictability, coincidence, synchronicity, everything that is happening is invisible and how it affects the visible. And again, here we have the spirit of Breton's novel "Nadja" embodied in a great French masterpiece. More! More! More!
