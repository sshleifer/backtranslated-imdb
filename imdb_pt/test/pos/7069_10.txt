<br /> <br /> The kind of movie that demands a lot from the audience, but that disappoints most of them. I think of the Mexican people who (either in an attempt to support Mexican films or wanting to see a movie casting the main Mexican stars) saw, half of the people left the theater when I went to watch, it's definitely not the kind of movie you would expect. I also think of people from other countries who dared to spend 2 hours seeing until the end, "what crap." To understand Chronica de un desayuno, you must be Mexican, and you must be familiar with the lower middle classes (or, better yet, be part of them). There is nothing accidental in this movie, the family is and has what many families, at least in Mexico, share. You need to see it with an open mind to accept it entirely, it's not the kind of movie you fully understand after watching it. The older brother would not let anyone sit on his RED couch, the sister stays, no matter how much she wants to leave, the younger brother goes on a tour, and all that matters is the yellow radio, the mother has to prepare the breakfast for the family, no matter how tense and unbearable the situation is. The father returned after who knows for how long, allowing the mother to live a night of passion that somehow ends up being momentary, and ends up repeating all the actions of her children ... The stories around the house are surreal (and so is the film), a transvestite looking for his penis, a factory worker and his suicide attempt, overwhelmed by the kisses of his girlfriend, a fat man riding a bicycle after an interesting conversation about homosexuals with his sister? wife? mom? ... The music does not pretend much, but it reaches a lot, no more than a snare drum, a cymbal, some strings. A good movie like this was made and released. <br /> <br /> One of the best Mexican films of all time, and one of the least understood, even by the Mexicans themselves, no matter how identified. . <br /> <br />
