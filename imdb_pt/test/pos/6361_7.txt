Dan Ackroyd in his top stars as Johgn Burns, an asylum mental refugee who presents himself as his own psychiatrist to travel to La La Land and host a popular radio talk show while the regular host (Charle Grodin in his growling cousin) takes a vacation. Along the way, Ackroyd joins Walter Matthau, a crazy colleague, and the rest is pure joy. Ackroyd and Matthau play very well in each other. Ackroyd's stunning real life wife, Donna Dixon, is together for the ride as yet another psychiatrist. The ending seems a bit rushed and planned, which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this movie my best rating, a 8. A lost gem of the 80's.
