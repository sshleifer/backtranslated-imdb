ALEXANDER NEVSKY is nothing short of a great movie on a grand scale. The film opens a window to a world and culture that most Americans will never know. And much has been said and written about the veiled patriotism of the film in the face of impending war with the German Nazis. <br /> <br /> By US standards, acting is a bit forced. The script is short on words and great on visuals and action. And while the action can become tiring, the visuals are amazing. The direction is incredible. <br /> <br /> On another note, fans of Ralph Bakshi's animation may realize that he stole many of his images for WIZARDS directly from a copy of ALEXANDER NEVSKY.
