As I jumped from film to film at the SXSW Film Festival, this debut night movie stayed with me. Curious, because it's a dark comedy with a rather absurd premise. <br /> <br /> A family of hyper-stressed fundamentalists in a small community of like-minded people is changed by a car accident. Three of the four have the same near-death experience as they are fully open, as each of them receives a reversal of the concept of original sin (I will not spoil this scene with the specific details). The fourth, a high school cheerleader, is not only the only one to be physically injured but also remains unchanged and now witnesses what has become her seemingly spiritually bankrupt, crazy family. Each new moment brings new indignation as they become innocently naked and frank in every way, horrifying her and then the community. <br /> <br /> Forgive the Franklins has the most beautiful scene of sexual arousal between husband and wife that I have ever seen, to Sarah Brightman's song "Deliver Me," a song that can now bring tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> The cast is fantastic. Robertson Dean as the father, Vince Pavia as the son and Aviva as the cheerleader's daughter are excellent, Mari Blackwell plays Peggy, the questioning neighbor and mother's best friend perfectly, a much more nuanced, real character than she could have been (everyone in the middle of America knows a Peggy). And Theresa Willis shines positively as Betty, the mother. There are many risks taken by the actors interpreting the three altered characters, and these risks compensate. <br /> <br /> I hope this film has a wide release - if so, plan to see it again. <Br /> Very accurate review at: http://www.fosteronfilm.com/phil/forgiving.htm
