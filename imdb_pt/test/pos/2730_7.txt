I must say it was a let down. Overall, it's great to see the way Aparna Sen dealt with the issue of schizophrenia, I'm not very knowledgeable about it, and I got what was described in A Brilliant Mind, and here too his interesting picture. <br /> <br /> But the thing that caused me disappointment was the artificial dialogues and the overuse of English. It is true that a new class is being formed / was formed in India, which speaks in English at home, but I am sure it is not as formal as in the film. In addition, Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable speaking everything in English. Charu's dialogue in Bihari's tone was apparently much more realistic and digestible. <br /> <br /> The second thing, is about the abstract flavor that she tried to give the movie. I usually like open ended movies, but here there were lots of loose ends. Your cut pieces are put together to make the movie. There also did not seem to be a central theme for the film. Schizophrenia, of course, was the main line, but blending sister-sister, mother-daughter, adding physician-azmi relationship, no real brother use, Bose-Bose wife relations ... all this was not necessary and let the free audience what she actually tried to portray. <br /> <br /> Overall, a watch for people who enjoy off-beat movies, one should avoid for those who only see movies as an entertainment tool.
