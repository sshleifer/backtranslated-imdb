LA ANTENA (Esteban Sapir - Argentina, 2005). <br /> <br /> A completely original version of the silent film in this fairy tale story of Esteban Sapir, beautifully shot in black and white and practically without dialogue "La Antena" is a feast for the eyes and an obligation for the lovers of the German expressionist cinema, with most nods to the works of Fritz Lang and Friedrich Murnau. "The City without a voice", "The City without Voice", is governed by Mr. TV. He captured the voices of the locals and has full control of all spoken words and images, forcing everyone to eat their own brand of TV food. Mr. TV is not only a monopolist, he is the embodiment of evil and totalitarianism, even the swastika appears as a symbol several times. He secretly works on a hypnotizing device to control all the minds of citizens through his television broadcasts. For this purpose, he kidnaps the only one left with The Voice, a beautiful singer, but a TV technician witnesses the kidnapping and runs off to an old TV antenna in the mountains to stop the evil TV plans. <br /> <br /> The production design is impressive with beautiful scenery and images. Although filmed mainly with the basic language of silent movies, Esteban Sapir also adds several new techniques, such as a combination of typographic and animation techniques. Everyone talks to each other through text balloons (usually floating near their mouths), the louder they talk, the bigger the characters. The texts themselves can be removed or crushed. Following the opening, we see a book entitled "La Antena", which opens and a paper city in the pages. There are almost no references to Argentina. It's constantly snowing, which gives the film a little arginine feel, while the surreal scenario suggests any big city in the northern hemisphere, with just a few of the songs revealing the film's Argentine background. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is fast and there is so much happening on the screen, it is difficult to keep up with the film's surreal narrative. Not just breathtaking, we also get some messages about media monopolies, corruption and totalitarianism, but they are well packaged. One of the most original films I've seen in years. A delight. <br /> <br /> The film was shown as opening film at IFF Rotterdam 2007. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
