The episode begins with scenes of a dead woman on the beach, an abandoned Jim strolling along the beach lost in daydreams and a night stroll that ends in murder and mystery. Yes, this is a small atmospheric number with a super twist at the end. Jim does well to unravel what is, a priori, an unexplained case of a missing woman 20 seconds after she enters your home. To be sure, the final explanation is a bit exaggerated. Why, for example, going to the extreme of replacing a woman in the middle of a car journey, when simply rubbing her and her companions off would have been so easy and left less trace. However, those little things aside, it's a memorable episode of TRF full of inventions, even if YET AGAIN Jim is put on the board by an ever-suspicious Police Department. I mean, have the ungrateful guy already sitting and counting. how many of your files have been resolved by dear olbo Jimbo?
