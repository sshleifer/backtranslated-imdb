It's a shame that House Calls is no longer known. Perhaps the romantics are middle-aged, worn-out and timid rather than over-sexed male stars? It could be. If you are over 35, you probably have this comedy. If you're over 45, you're really going to get this comedy. If you are 25 years old, wait until you get older to see it. <br /> <br /> Matthau and Jackson's improbable pair works precisely because it is very unlikely. There's a wonderful line from Matthau that sums up what's going on between the two - "I like old people because you do not have to explain who Ronald Coleman is." (If this is not the exact line, it's close ...) <br /> <br /> The premise of a below average hospital run by incompetent people is true. Art Carney's portrait of a senile chief surgeon is absolutely brilliant. It is impossible not to laugh out loud at your delivery. Subplots, if you can call them that, are fun too, as between Matthau and Jackson's teenage son. Everything beats exactly in the right tone. <br /> <br /> Ok, there's the part where Matthau has to wear women's clothes that are a little overdone and easy. But still - it's Walter Matthau in the drag! It is funny!
