I love this film in the first place because Mark Wahlberg is in it and secondly because the end justifies the means. There is something about this movie that sucks you and lets you feel all the emotions the characters are feeling. Jen Aniston is great as the girlfriend in this movie. Take a look at the Rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers have lived in the past (maybe those days got a little smarter). It takes through a rainbow of emotions and has many subtle facets to allow the passage of light. Like a diamond, this movie shines. You will not waste your popcorn on this one. Cat movie, but my husband liked it too. There are some laughs as well.
