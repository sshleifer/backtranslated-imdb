I saw this movie in the early 90's when it was on VHS for a while. At the time, I found it interesting, and I was especially impressed with the segment of Ken Russell, with the visions of the accident victim in sorting and surgery. <br /> <br /> Last night in a second run of the Indiana Jones movie, John Hurt's vision provoked an unexpected flashback to "Aria," which I had not thought of in years, and Sudden memory of Russell's play itself was enough to cause an outburst of tears for a bit. If I can make that observation, I note with interest the reaction of love and hate that people expressed to Russell's segment, and discovered this interesting difference in other films that plunge into a deep trauma. and its after effects. Some GET, some not, interesting. <br /> <br /> I see from comments and ratings that general work has hit people in many ways. This is how it affects me and affects me.
