No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we ask ourselves is: is he an insane genius? So many people hated this movie! I am usually the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrific recent film 'L'Enfant' and the useless and offensive 'Feux Rouges'). But oddly enough, I really think 'Pola X' is an incredible film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft, and containing remarkable performances. The movie carries melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I've seen on screen before. But then, Carax is extreme, that we know. The film also contains what I consider about Trotskyist or anarchist fantasies and damp dreams, with a mysterious group of young men training to fire submachine guns at the bourgeoisie between playing the fascinating music of Scott Walker in a band that has their recording sessions in one abandoned warehouse full of squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels. Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a ch√¢teau (whose stepmother is Catherine Deneuve, and he enters her bathroom while she is naked in the bath, by the way). But all of a sudden, he "breaks down" completely when he discovers that his late father, a famous diplomat, was the father of an illegitimate daughter who was effectively dismissed by Deneuve as an inconvenience. This is because the sister suddenly appears as a sort of Romanian refugee with disheveled hair, expressionless face and little ability to speak French coherently. Depardieu then becomes a "left class" class hero and wants to kill or destroy his family for his hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in poverty and extreme poverty, despising a vast inheritance. He then begins an incestuous sexual relationship with his half sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene that offended many people, though I have no objection to it, as I find people are very hysterical about sex, especially in America , where apparently this never happens. The intensity of the acting and the filming make this scenario unlikely an experience of powerful, though depressing, hyper-melodrama. The differences between Carax making an extreme movie like this and the countless extreme French films that I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously trying to exploit a meaningful film, even though distressing extreme emotional condition, in which a human being disintegrates and turns against his past. Many would say that the extreme elements of this movie were free, but I do not agree. I believe Carax was genuine and was not making an image of exploitation. It is very difficult to defend a man who goes so far and who, as far as I know, can be a complete madman, but I believe he deserves to defend himself for this remarkable film achievement.
