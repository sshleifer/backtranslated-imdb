I was half dozing while watching a nightly selection of short films - but I sat erect from the first pictures of "I Shout Love" and could not take my eyes off its full, brief, perfect length. With incredibly guaranteed rhythms and performances, this film retains its funny / sad / insightful tone throughout. The credits at the end were so quick and in such a small kind, I had to go online to find out the person responsible for this master job. What a pleasant surprise to see the name of Sarah Polley, an important actress who is rarely seen. <br /> <br /> Kristen Thomsen (Tessa) and Matthew Ferguson (Bobby) perform rich and exciting performances as a couple in the spasms of separation. As they work through a replay of Tessa's favorite moments of their time together, both actors reveal their characters' dimensions and relationship in ways that bring nothing but honor to their talents - and the skills of the director / writer. The film creates a touching narrative, with moments of laughter and a breathtaking sadness. <br /> <br /> "I Shout Love" is unquestionably one of the biggest and most memorable shorts I hope to see. It has wit, heart and impressive originality. It matters.
