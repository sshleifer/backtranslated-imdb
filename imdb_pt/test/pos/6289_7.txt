This is the only Pauly Shore movie you should see. O.K., it's the only one I've ever seen, and I think I made good choices. I usually think Shore's shtick is a bit tired, but he's very funny in this movie. Actually, the script is pretty funny, and Shore does not overload the other actors with your ... what do you call it? Tomfoolery? Anyway, this is a funny movie, if that's forgettable. --Frink-3
