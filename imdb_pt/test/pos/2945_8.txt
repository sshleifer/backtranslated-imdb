I saw this movie at the Philadelphia Film Festival today and enjoyed it overall. It is an interesting and competent analysis of the very common revelation that our parents' marriage was more flawed and difficult than we imagined. In addition, this film is an excellent example of the process of uncovering truths about our parents' lives after their death and the problems associated with it. However, I found the sound quality (recording and editing) relatively weak and irritating. *** It may well have been related to the specific conditions of theater and projection *** I am not a filmmaker / student or anything and I do not claim a real understanding of the sound production process, but as a consumer, I found the audio part of the movie distracts. Specifically, I heard very unpleasant noises on my lips (especially a long interview with the younger sister) of the film, and often the background noise level was larger in volume than the voices of the people (eg scene in which is a small group of mothers' roles). someone saw this movie, noticed something about the sound ... thanks
