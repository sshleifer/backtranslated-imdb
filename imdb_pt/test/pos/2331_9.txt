Surprisingly good and insightful adventure that characterizes Kelsey Grammer (supposedly in his first leading role in a feature) as an unconventional sub commander of the Navy, who wants to perform a nuclear sub of his own, however; he won by competing against the US Navy in a series of war games with a crew of untested, questionable and amiable men (and a woman as well). Director David S. Ward ("Major League" and his writers have created an intelligent and upbeat comedy that tries to make the film easy to understand, which they do very well. Grammer, most of the crew provides some or much of the humor of the movie, which is treated like a double-edged sword. Three Supporting Cast Members - Harland Williams, Toby Huss and Rob Schneider provide the funniest scenes, which include strange gestures , imitations and, well, their personalities. <br /> <br /> "Down Periscope" is more than a Navy version of "Police Academy" or "The Dirty Dozen." What the film does is do the job the right way and I liked it.
