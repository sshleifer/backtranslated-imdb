After reading some of these comments, it is clear that some have missed the point. What's great about this movie (here comes the point), what's amazing about this movie, what's amazing about this movie is that there is no proselytizing. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. Life goes on. It is a masterpiece in letting a public think for its collective self. These are just kids doing what kids do - without awareness. We all went to school with children like these. We are being anesthetized by reality / invention based on fiction- / movie- / tv- / news. <br /> <br /> Feck's girlfriend (Dennis Hopper, the great) alone and his relationship with her is worth the price of renting the movie. <br /> <br /> There have been few movies before or since that correspond to the intelligence of this movie. AMEN. <br /> <br />
