A competent comedy that offers the laughs to the fans of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. I suppose this movie was made for those who liked the two GRUMPY OLD MEN movies as there seemed to be a lot of these teammates highlighting the comic duo in their twilight years. The idea is certain: Matthau, a bumbling gambler who has thousands of dollars in debt, conjures his unsuspecting friend Lemmon to take a free cruise with him, where they can meet rich old ladies; The catch is that they signed as Dance Hosts and Matthau does not know how to dance. OUT TO SEA is a funny movie, and not all laughter is courtesy of Lemmon and Matthau. I found Brent Spiner (better known as STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION) very humorous as the snobbish dance-busting dance coordinator. As the proud chief of the two elderly actors, he manages to combine them in the laughter department. Although the film does not need any, there are also one or two love stories that can be found here, involving Dyan Cannon (who looks very good for his years).
