Watching this weird adventure movie, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who brought us high-quality classics like Mrs. Wardh's Strange Addiction and The Scorpion's Tail Case, but it has to be said that, low quality production values, Island of the Fish Men is a fun ride and it certainly deserves more praise than it is getting. Like many Italian films of the seventies, this is a movie of a successful American film, this time being the island of Dr. Moreau. Sergio Martino's film takes ideas like mutation, greed and adventure and shapes it into a slightly appealing film that makes up for what's lacking in coherence and logic with a load of intriguing ideas. The central plot follows a boat that falls on a small island. It soon becomes apparent that not everything in this place is normal, and one soon realizes that half the population has been transformed into "man-fish" - a cross between a man and a fish, which exist for purely selfish reasons ... <br /> The truth about this movie is that it's so much more fun if you ignore the useless production values. The central monsters look completely ridiculous, and much of the film happens in sets that seem to cost someone a few cents - but the film is well filmed though, with underwater photography being a special highlight and rhythm of the film. film is well done in that the film never gets boring. The way the storyline joins is not exactly a genius, but it involves a lot of ideas and I've seen movies made in tangles with much less thought than this. The biggest highlight of the place in the movie is definitely the lost city of Atlantis. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of adventure films and so I do not see this lost city being mentioned - but it's always good to see it in a movie. The island's central location is good as it provides a suitable setting for the story and also provides the film with the right amount of mystery, since Martino makes good use of the voodoo theme. Overall, this is not exactly a classic and there are certainly far worse worthless adventure films out there than this one.
