In 1974, teenager Martha Moxley (Maggie Grace) moves to the high-class Belle Haven area in Greenwich, Connecticut. On Halloween night, she was murdered in the backyard of her house and her murder remained unsolved. Twenty-two years later, writer Mark Fuhrman (Christopher Meloni), a former Los Angeles detective who fell disgraced by perjury in OJ Simpson's trial and moved to Idaho, decides to investigate the case with his partner Stephen Weeks (Andrew Mitchell ) for the purpose of writing a book. Locals squirm and do not receive them, but with the support of retired detective Steve Carroll (Robert Forster) who was in charge of the investigation in the 1970s, they discover the criminal and a network of power and money to cover the murder. "Murder in Greenwich" is a good TV movie with the true story of a murder of a fifteen-year-old girl committed by a wealthy teenager whose mother was a Kennedy. The powerful and wealthy family used their influence to cover the murder for more than twenty years. However, a snoopy detective and condemned perjurer in disgrace was able to disclose how the heinous crime was committed. The script shows Marta's investigation and Marta's last days in parallel, but the drama's lack of emotion is lacking. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
