Someone once defined what is the definition of an INTELLECTUAL as being: "A person who can hear" The William Tell Overture "without thinking of the LONE RANGER!" In this, we wholeheartedly agree! Certainly it would be a difficult task to achieve this, and that Leopold Stokowski, Arturo Toscanini or Leonard Bernstein would be almost impossible to do. <br /> <br /> And there is no disgrace in this. The radio series and television series, along with a number of feature films, feature films, newspapers and comic books, did their part to make "the masked man of the plains and his faithful Indian companion, Tonto" a deeply sown element. of our collective psyche and of our literary folklore. <br /> <br /> As with most legends, it all began gradually, first with a series of radio plays, written for local use in Detroit through the WXYZ radio station. The Creator was a certain George W. Trendle and the Chief Writer of the Series was Mr. Trendle's brother-in-law, Fran Striker. The year was 1933 when the Ranger first departed for "the early western plains of the United States!" The Lone Ranger, Tonto, and Radio Series successfully led the Americans from the Depression Era through the mid to late 1930s to the Second World War. But the postwar era found the country in the midst of a super-new explosion of invention and technology. There was a new means of communicating on the wings, but unable to go until both EV and VJ Day had been reached. Once these were accomplished and the World and America were ready to settle for both Peace and Prosperity. The "New Technology" was, of course, the TELEVISION! And we certainly need something other than "Roller Derby" and "Wrestling From Marigold Arena" to fill in the broadcast hours. And while in the beginning, the time when a TV channel had something, except that picture of that mohawk boss (pattern, Schultz!) Soon, in a hurry, networks began to explore their existing natural resources, their existing programming ! Practically everything would be ready to be adapted for the TV Screen. So the people at Lone Ranger Incorporated became very interested when producers Jack Chertok, Harry Poppe, Sherman Harris and Jack Wrather approached them. an agreement to put the Masked and Dumb Man on the television as well as Radio. <br /> <br /> Immediately they went to work and gave us the first season, which made use of the considerable background record of the radio. Dramas, all potentially adaptable to TV dramas. They founded Clayton Moore, an outstanding supporting actor in many films, and with about twelve years of experience. He had also done some work on Serials at Republic Pictures' Thrill Factory, which would be an invaluable experience in making "THE LONE RANGER". Cast as his "faithful Indian companion" and partner in bringing Justice to various parts of the Frontier, we had perfection in Supporting Actor character Jay Silverheels. ** We should mention that there was this break in about '53, when Clayton Moore walked and was replaced by John Hart. After a season, more or less, Mr. Moore was back. Now, back to our story !! The early years of filming gave the episodes their own look and sound. They made good use of Narrator, which gave these programs a sense of authenticity and an individual, standing out as a series. The employed actors were all veterans of the late-silent films during the 1930s and 1940s. Many of them were almost exclusively Cowboy Movie players. A good example of this is the cast of Glenn Strange (Bartender Sam in "GUNSMOKE") as the evil and murderous gang leader, Butch Cavandish. And it was the Texas Rangers' Cavendish mob massacre that led to John Reid's origin (thought to have been killed with the other Texas Rangers) as the "Lone Ranger". <br /> <br /> In addition to the old veterans in the cast, you'll find a lot of new and emerging talent (then) in the cast. We see people like Phyllis Coates, Dwayne Hickman, Denver Pyle and others in the cast from week to week. All this, along with one always asking for fair-play, justice and peace in a Western world. <br /> <br /> The last two seasons have brought some major changes. First was the use of Color Filming. That made no difference, since color TV was still far from our house. The second was a new set of themes and musical queues. (Beyond Rossini's Finale of "U NO Wutt!") The new song has never been a big deal for us since we prefer the stock footage of "Ancient Radio". During this period, THE LONE RANGER (Warner Brothers, 1956) and THE LONE RANGER AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD (United Artists, 1958), the character stayed permanently and indelibly impressed on our identity as a people, us Americans!
