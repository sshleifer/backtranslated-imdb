I went to see this movie in a signature book in Lexington, Ky last night. After a wonderful evening that consisted of a few brief words with Mr. Bruce Campbell (you have to say it all, not just Bruce or Mr. Campbell; D), friends while the books were being signed, and a QnA session with our favorite deadite killer the lights went out. <br /> <br /> In order not to ruin anything, I will not go into detail ... but I loved the movie! Mr. Bruce Campbell did a wonderful job maintaining the classic feel of the movie b. The characters were 'b' classic characters, the place was refreshing (what do you know about the films that are based in Bulgaria?) And the setting was almost original and fun! In addition, the humor that is distributed throughout the film kept the audience laughing for much of the film. <br /> <br /> Although this film does not have as general an appeal to people as some, it is a lighthouse of fun and laughter in a season of (as Bruce Campbell put it) "b-movies" that are listed as "movies "(Witch, Dukes of Risk, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? Come on, guys!)
