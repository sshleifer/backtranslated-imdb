Usually, movies stay out of the "domestic drama," and for good reason: who wants to intentionally seek entertainment from a story about what they or those close to them have to deal with in real life? Divorce harms an incredible percentage of American families of all classes and custody battles are ugly and necessary parts of it. This is not escapism - the number one reason the average person turns to the movies - that is a sad reality. Normally, divorce or custody is simply part of a larger story and affects the way we understand or relate to its characters. "Kramer vs. Kramer" focuses on him and asks us to understand why we do this and why it makes him so disturbing. This is a challenge for both this film and its audience: to turn something so real into something that can capture our attention and then make us not feel spiteful while the mirror is stuck in our face. Writer / director Robert Benton definitely hits both and impressively in the adaptation of this novel by Avery Corman. The story, as one would expect, is quite simple: Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman), a big-time advertising entrepreneur comes home and finds that his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) is leaving him and his son 7, Billy (Justin Henry). Ted must then quickly learn to be an active parent in the boys' lives and as soon as he does, Joanna brings him a custody suit for him. <br /> <br /> To make an Oscar-winning drama about something so generic and particularly dialogue-heavy first takes tremendous acting talent. You do not get much better than Hoffman and Streep. Hoffman is at his peak in this role: his first Oscar win after three other notable nominations. He creates a complete character whose self-centered, quick-tempered ways clearly change as he learns to be a better parent and sole caregiver. Streep wins her first Oscar in only the second major role of her career as a woman who does not receive much time on the screen but must communicate both the inner torment in her decision to leave and the renewed sense of identity when she returns to stay in custody . Streep does it effortlessly. The young boy, Justin Henry, who at the age was the youngest candidate in the competitive category in the history of the Oscars, performs exceptionally well the personification of all children of 7 years. <br /> <br /> Performances to the level where we look deeper into the problems of this family than ourselves and therefore reconsider our thoughts about love and raise a family. Benton's previous notable credits ("Bonnie & Clyde" and "Superman") would not indicate a strong mastery of family drama, but man can simply write. Numerous scenes give us strong visuals that show us much more than the typical familiar scenarios they describe. The first morning Joanna is gone and Ted's French Billy Toast is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent that comes into this movie in a scene that takes place in the American kitchens every morning. <br /> <br /> You rarely see a story as direct as "Kramer vs. Kramer" did better. There are no surprises at the end or twists that will keep us desperately glued to the screen. The film then has to rely on their talents and they are all safe, providing a new understanding of a subject that is so familiar.
