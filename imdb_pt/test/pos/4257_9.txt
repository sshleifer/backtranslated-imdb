I can not say how many times a line has made me laugh or how many times I have described this scene to people who are not familiar with this movie. I saw it the year it was released, I was 19 years old. I do not think there were a dozen people in that East Village theater that night. For years I thought we were the only ones who saw this. It is good to see here that others have found this as hysterical as I do, and I see that it is a lasting value in spite of the past tense. Rent it, buy it or steal it .... a must see.
