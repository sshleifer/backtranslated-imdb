20 years later and this movie still has echoes of its floating greatness. Never has a movie surpassed the incredible soundtrack of Valley Girl. The film completely encapsulated the 1980s to such a perfect degree that it could only be realized many years later. Nicolas Cage at his best. A movie that has so much character, it makes you realize just how sad Hollywood has become (as far as quality is). The special edition DVD is loaded with tons of extras and is worth buying as you will have plenty of material to sift through. For sure.
