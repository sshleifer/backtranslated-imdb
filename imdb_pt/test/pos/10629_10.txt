At the end of my Cache analysis, I wrote that I was intrigued by Haneke as a filmmaker. That's what got me to get the La Pianiste DVD, which I just watched half an hour ago. Everything has been expressed here in IMDb and in many of the external critiques - the ranting Distorted Pathology that would "create" an individual like Huppert's Erika who still tries, after years and years, to please mother, at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life, starting with herself. She repressed everything that would free her from her self-imposed slavery, including, of course, her sexuality, which literally imploded, to the point of madness, where she can no longer begin to understand what a genuine love drive would feel. This is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional cripple, someone who has never found the strength to leave his childhood situation and become a functional adult. I think this subject is related to all of us - we are all struggling for autonomy, but there are needs, so many conflicting needs, most of which are not even on the conscious level. He also deals brilliantly with the contrast between what he imagines, sexually, and the reality of these fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share sexual fantasies with another human being. Huppert's character gets what she asks for throughout the film, and it is hardly the emancipatory experience she imagined it to be. <br /> <br /> About the much discussed scene in the bathroom: I really appreciated how this sequence had all the erotic charge possible (for the viewer, I mean) sucked because of the previous scene where she put the glass in the girl's pocket. By the time she is acting out of her scenario to see if this guy is worthy in the bathroom, we have already discovered that she is dangerously disturbed and so it is not a turnaround, her small session of domination with our poor I think another achievement The incredible thing about this movie is how, in the middle of the process, I completely forgot that it was not in English and that I was reading subtitles. This has never happened before, in any foreign film, and I've seen many. <br /> <br /> In this movie, like the Cache, the end is not all wrapped up in a cute little bow, but unlike the Cache, at least we have some sense of purpose, despite the fact that not even know for sure if the Huppert character is alive or dead. After experiencing La Pianiste, when it comes to Michael Haneke, I am, needless to say, more than a little intrigued.
