This is at least very close to a perfect video publication. The messianic metal group, the rock n 'roll dinosaurs, the world's biggest and most influential heavy band, plays their hits and recalls the band's past - what else do we need? <br /> <br /> The video begins with "War pigs" and ends with "Paranoid" and in the middle are included the biggest and most significant classics of the original formation: "Funeral electric", "Sweet leaf", "After "Iron Man", "Sons of the Grave" ... and of course my personal favorite "In the Void", I'm glad they did not let it out. Well, how could they? <br /> <br /> Still, this video is more than just music. Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward analyze the group's colorful story. The only thing that bothers me is when a live song is interrupted with excerpts from the interview. For example, you need to enter how the song "N.I.B." has his name right in the middle of it - one on top of the other? I doubt it. It's still a small flaw so it's no big deal. <br /> <br /> The band members also sit in chairs and talk together: nice stuff for a Saturday fan! I admit I have trouble following what Ozzy Osbourne is muttering, but it's fun. I was privileged to attend when "The Last Dinner Tour" entered Finland, and for me personally, this video is an ideal way to remember this magnificent show.
