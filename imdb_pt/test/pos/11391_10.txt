Boogie Nights was undoubtedly the best movie of 1997. I have been able to watch this movie several times and still love it. I'm not in a hurry to watch this epic romance epic / Titanic disaster again. The fact that Boogie Nights does not even get a nomination for Best Picture serves to prove just how predictable and narrow the Academy is. Only Atom Egoyan The Sweet Hereafter and Robert Zemeckis's Contact came close to being as good as Boogie Nights. No other filmmaker in recent years has even come close to making a movie as good as Tarantino's Pulp Fiction - so far. Paul Thomas Anderson rose to the challenge and succeeded. Just as Tarantino gave John Travolta, P.T. Anderson gave Burt Reynolds the shot his career needs. Boogie Nights will also undoubtedly make stars of Don Cheadle, Heather Graham and John Reilly. Overall a wonderful movie. The best since Pulp Fiction. Maybe even better.
