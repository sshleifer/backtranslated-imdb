How would you feel if you had only a few weeks to live? This movie helps you to know through the eyes of a guy who is faced with this situation. It is told with sympathy and without much emotion. Some may find it a bit slow - but I think that increases the realism of the movie. Some may see this as a love story, but I think this is secondary to seeing their last days through their eyes. The loves of your life are part of the end of your life and give more impact. Low key and gentle, the film unfolds the story as much as life. No cliches and unexpected events in a passing scenario. If you like your kindly emotionally realistic movies, this may be for you.
