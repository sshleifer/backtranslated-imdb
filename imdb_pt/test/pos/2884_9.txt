In dramatizing Wilde's novel, John Osborne condensed events, eliminated several characters, and generally suggested, instead of showing, Dorian's essential malice. If you want a more explicit rendition, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived almost the same time period, but they were certainly very different men and writers. This story really addresses a theme similar to Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy while the RLS followed the scientific route. Both protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil, with evil winning in the end. The actors in this BBC film take a different path, too, from those in the 1945 movie. John Gielgud says all the same caustic and cynical jokes as George Sanders in his role actually designing Wilde himself , but with a subtle difference. You will suspect that Sanders really believed what he was saying, but Gielgud may be saying what is expected of him, instead of what he sincerely believes. Peter Firth also shows both sides of his character in a contained way, but we could not see as many of his escapades as Hurd Hatfield had a chance to show. <br /> <br /> It is very good production, with the drama reflecting the foundations of the novel, if not all its ramifications.
