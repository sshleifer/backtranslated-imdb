I saw it last night and I was laughing out loud for the second half of the movie. The whole public was gone. Bruce Campbell made a very funny movie! I do not want to give anything, but when the movie turns and goes crazy, it gets very crazy. Just one funny scene after another. My compliments to Mr. Campbell and to the crew for achieving this with such a small budget. Bruce was there to present the film and do a Q and A, which was a treat. Many of the questions people were asking were pretty bad, but Bruce turned around and it was all sarcastic. It was great! Anyway, I loved the movie. I'll be looking forward to seeing this on DVD later this year. Be sure to check it out on the Sci-Fi channel this fall. I highly recommend this.
