No film could ever do justice to Faulkner's command in the English language. but they did a good job here. Lucas Beauchamp is just like I imagined him in the book, just like Chick. What the film could not really do was how Beauchamp was not liked by the black people either, because he was equally stubborn. Not that this is a bad thing, but from my opinion about the book that was his attitude towards the world (yet, I felt that it was the racism of the white society that began and spread through black society until it became his attitude The best part of the movie is that you can see Yoknapatawpha County (actually, Oxford, Mississippi) just as Faulkner wrote about it (the film was made when Faulkner was alive and writing). It does not look very different today because of it, the film is worth considering considering it is filmed in Faulkner's backyard, a true must see for Faulkner fans.
