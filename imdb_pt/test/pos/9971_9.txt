I just saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival in the beautiful Elgin Theater. I was impressed by the beautiful cinematography, the brilliant adaptation of a very complicated piece and last but not least, the brave performance of Al Pacino, who was born to play this role, which was perfectly balanced by an equally strong performance of Jeremy Irons . The film cleverly explores the themes of love versus loyalty, law versus justice, and passion versus reason. Some may protest that the content is inherently anti-Semitic, however, they must consider the historical context of the story, and the delicate and differentiated manner as told in this adaptation. <br /> <br /> 9/10
