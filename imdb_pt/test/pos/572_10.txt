You know, before seeing this movie, I had little sympathy for those involved in criminal cases. I mean, if they were arrested and charged, "they must have been guilty," I reasoned. <br /> <br /> I formed this opinion for a few years. You see a good friend of mine once you've worked as a detective in some of Sydney's most troublesome areas. He frequently complained that his policing efforts were wasted due to lawyers and magistrates of the "bleeding heart." He would "beat up the bad guys in the morning and they would be" back on the street at noon. "He had his price ... they used him down.He gave up. <br /> <br /> He has argued since, not without reason I thought, that collecting creative evidence, to keep the bad guys "where they belong", was ... well ... "acceptable." My arguments about rights of innocent people were not "What are the chances of you being arrested and charged with a serious crime?", he would argue, and being a law-abiding citizen, the weight of his argument convinced me that he was right. , or my family or friends, to be charged with murder or a felony was zero to none, I thought. <br /> <br /> Well, as mentioned earlier, seeing this wonderfully enlightening documentary changed all that. I'm sending a copy to him.
