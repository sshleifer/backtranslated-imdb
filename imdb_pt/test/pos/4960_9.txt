I really wanted to write a title for this review that did not seem so tacky or gory, but I still described my feelings for that show. I can see now that this is not possible. "American Family" is one of the best shows I've ever had the pleasure of watching on television. Several critics here on IMDb mentioned the word "beautiful" in describing this program. Never a word was more appropriate. The cinematography for this show is impressive. Every scene and shot looks like a work of art. The lighting, the camera moves, the composition of the scene and the colors ... I have to remember that I'm watching a TV show and not a Motion Picture masterpiece. The score of Lee Holdridge and Nathan Wang brings tears to my eyes. And most importantly, the incredible cast's acting is honest and sincere. I do not feel like I'm watching performances ... I feel like I'm watching real life. If only real life could be so beautiful. <br /> <br /> The "American Family" has really raised the level of quality entertainment on television. I highly recommend this show to anyone who is willing to attend. I could easily censor CBS for broadcasting this show, but I have to say that it does not matter to me who's on the air. I'm glad it's out there for everyone to see. So I thank PBS for not allowing this show to disappear into nowhere. <br /> <br /> I have to give special recognition to how the end of each season has ended. The first was pure creative brilliance and led me to tears. I was hoping to see if the second season would also end creatively, and it sure did. Again, tears. <br /> <br /> My thanks to all involved. You really did a special work of art with this show, and I honestly mean it. It's a shame we only had two seasons, but a miracle we got anything.
