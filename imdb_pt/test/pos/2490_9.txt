They say that this movie has been or has been banned in the US since it was released. Since there is no information about the IMDb, I must rely on my other sources and believe it. If this is really true, the film is even more painful and scary and it is anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie is a so-called mockumentary, although I think the topic is very serious, call it that. It creates a scenario in which America is like a military state and all revolutionary objects are immediately detained without evidence. After a mandatory court, they have to decide whether to go to jail for a few years or choose the punishment park. In that, they have to walk through the desert for three days to reach an American flag, posted 50 miles ahead, while they are followed by police and army troops. <br /> <br /> The film itself pretends to be a documentary on these incidents and follows both the courts and the desert hunting, filmed by European film crews. All the facts are explained, the interviewers ask questions and film everything. People look directly at the camera, shouting at her. It seems very, very real. To speak of realism here is nonsense. This movie is not about making a realistic film, it's about how such a film would look like if it were real. And it certainly would. If it were filmed anyway. In a "utopian" state like this, there certainly would not be a European film crew authorized to film these things. <br /> <br /> There are many things that scare us. The defendants are people of all walks of life. Political leaders, musicians, authors, philosophers, the unemployed, etc. They seem hopeless, rebellious, or frightened. They are not heroes. They talk a lot in court, knowing it leads to nothing, saying, however, everything they said in speeches and books and songs before. One says he is not afraid to die. That's true? Well, he does not have to run through the desert hunted by the police. The defendants have no chance, or at least their only chance, the decision between the prison park and punishment, is not a chance indeed. The way they decide, in the end, and how the film ends, makes it clear that this type of heroism is suicide. <br /> <br /> These courts remind us of many courts in the Third Reich. Employees use the same kind of idealistic speech, ignoring all the defendants' arguments, beginning to yell at them and then saying they should be quiet. They warn those accused of "seeing their language" and insult them much more. They ask questions, the defendants can not answer, but it is never to be expected that they should. These scenes are a statement about what we call justice. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the desert are on a different level. When we see the prisoners for the first time, we realize that they realize they have no chance. Seeing the desert and the mountains, feeling the sun and the thirst, they have no idea how they should endure those free days. The film crew follows them and talks to them as they try to escape this madness. They argue, should they play the game, or escape, or revolt? Everything leads to the same and no one is surprised. Some will question whether such parks actually exist in such a state? Why not? It empties the prisons and allows the government to punish the revolutionaries as they wish. It is not a gas chamber, but the Nazis killed Jews before the construction of concentration camps. The comparison is fair, since there is no real difference. <br /> <br /> The movie is scary and depressing. The problems that are spoken sound familiar to be ignored. This is not science fiction. Talking about poverty, unemployment and crime is not utopian. The film shows us that government and democracy, as presented to us, are not only useless but also dangerous. It also shows us that revolution is definitely not the solution. The defendants seem confused because they do not know how to fight it. They do things, but for nothing. Even that does not offer us a solution, it's still a statement. <br /> <br /> For me, the most frightening thing is the banning of the movie. Here we have a movie that accuses the loss of freedom, morals and peace. However, it accuses the government, a fictitious government, of being dangerous and inhumane. And such a movie is forbidden. Think about it when you see the American flag next time.
