THE GOLDEN DOOR (NUOVOMONDO) is for this viewer the best movie of the year until today. It is a masterpiece of concept, writing, directing, acting and cinematography. More importantly, this radiantly beautiful film is a much-needed reflective mirror to look at the history of immigration of "outsiders" to America, at a time when the very mention of the word "borders" is a political fuse. Writer / director Emanuele Crialese gave us not only a deeply moving story, it also provided a touchstone for viewers to revisit the history of each of our origins: with the exception of the Native Americans, we all entered America as 'foreigners' at some point in our stories, and it is humiliating to see this movie with that fact in mind. The film opens at the turn of the century Sicily as a widow of affected poverty Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) and his brother Angelo (Francesco Casisa) climb a rocky hill to present their chips to the cross to ask for a sign of who must continue fighting for existence on the island or go to America, the land of dreams. The deaf mute son of Mancuso, Pietro (Filippo Pucillo), runs up to the top of the hill with postcards he found with images of America (money growing on trees, fruits and vegetables larger than people, etc.), and Salvatore accepts this as the sign that he should move his family to America. After convincing his reluctant mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) and his sisters Rita (Federica De Cola) and Rosa (Isabella Ragonese) to make the trip, he sells his only possessions (two donkeys, goats and rabbits) and the man with the boat . arranges his trip, giving his family's shoes, appropriate clothing, and instructions to board a transatlantic as third-class passengers. As the Mancuso family prepares to embark, they ask for a photograph and as they pose behind a painted set, an Englishwoman Lucy / Luce (Charlotte Gainsbourg) enters the picture as if she were part of the peasant family. Lucy can not board the boat to America without a male escort. The journey begins and Luce, in her gentle way, identifies with the Mancuso family, finally solidifying their safe passage, proposing to Salvatore to marry her 'for convenience, not for love' when they arrive at America. Through a violent storm and living conditions that are terribly poor, the throng of third-class passengers survive, bond, and eventually arrive on Ellis Island, believing their dream of America has been fulfilled. But everyone must undergo severe physical tests, de-stress, and even do intelligence tests to determine if they can enter America: officials report that America does not want genetically inferior people to enter the new world! Each woman must be chosen by a man to get married on Ellis Island before they can be admitted. The way in which the Mancuso family remains united to a somewhat surprising end is the closing of the tale. Few of us understand the rigid rules and severe treatment that immigrants face (or at least faced at the turn of the century) on Ellis Island, and if we do, we decide to submerge that information. The GOLDEN GATE presents the case for immigrant struggles in a way that not only touches our hearts, but also challenges our acceptance of current immigration legislation. But all political issues aside, THE GOLDEN DOOR is first of all a film of enormous beauty, exquisite photography, performances deeply felt by a huge cast and a very sensibly written and directed story. O is a film that deserves wide distribution, a film that is a must see for everyone. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
