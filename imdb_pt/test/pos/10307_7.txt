The subject of the film is touching and very real. It happened. One can debate some artistic freedoms taken by the director and scriptwriter. The subject is what makes the movie work - nothing more. I first saw the movie after the real Phoolan, shot dead in New Delhi and served for several years as an elected member of Parliament in India. In fact, she was not the first untouchable elected to Parliament, as some analysts said. The so-called "untouchables" were elected to the Indian Parliament for decades in reserved constituencies. <br /> <br /> Although Shekhar Kapur as a director is a hero to many in India because he made commercially accepted international films - "Bandit Queen" and "Elizabeth" (and a tolerable children's film called "Mister India" which was accepted by the average Indian audience) - and I even have Oscar nominations for Elizabeth, I do not put him as a top-of-the-line film director from India. He fails in every department as director, except, perhaps, for achieving some above-average performances from his actors. Subtlety, subtlety, charm are not easy to find in your movies - the melodrama overflows them. His idea of ​​using Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's vocal composition of music in the early parts of the movie was perhaps his only major achievement in the indistinguishable "Bandit Queen" soundtrack. And then maybe the creaking doors during the collective rape sequence. Otherwise, the movie looked like a spaghetti western with sex and violence minus the great music that associates with them. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good Indian film director to make international quality movies - it is not the Shekhar Kapur movies you should see; are the later works of three Indian filmmakers, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Mrinal Sen and Girish Karnad, and, of course, "Umrao Jaan" by Muzaffar Ali. It is unfortunate that none of these directors had the financial support Kapur had to give them and their films an international audience. For example, Tel's "Oka oorie katha" in Telugu, or Satyajit Ray's "Sadgati" based on Munshi Prem Chand's "Kafan" are more complete as films for an intelligent spectator who deals with the state of the untouchables in India. Sen did not have to resort to explicit sex and violence, but only suggested them. Of course, Sen's nugget did not make the headlines, while Kapur's effort disrupted them. <br /> <br /> To Kapur's credit, he is articulated and used his limited talent and modest resources in the Mumbai film industry to take his products beyond home. audiences. For this effort, I greet Kapur. But "Queen Bandit" will continue to be a great subject waiting for a accomplished director to handle this.
