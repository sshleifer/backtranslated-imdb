The 13th and final RKO Falcon film begins with Tom Conway's mutual injunction as Tom Lawrence, in fact, the Falcon and Ed Brophy as Goldie's "No dames!" while they prepare to go on vacation. While you are still wondering what they are going on a vacation since they have not had a job since the beginning of the first movie in 1941 (with Sanders as Gay though and Jenkins as Goldie) they come across a woman and are dragged away. They promise to help her when her uncle is murdered by taking an envelope containing the details of a formula to have industrial diamonds replaced by her co-worker in Miami. I suspect everyone here except the cops here who are after Lawrence? and Goldie for the murder. To console herself, Goldie continues to paraphrase travel brochures: "On a colder day, you can always enjoy the warmth of a beautiful cozy electric chair." Some pleasant, languid scenes of nightclubs mingle with some of the bad behavior of the bad guys. Favorite bit: the decent game of hide and seek / thimble hunting the undisturbed and gentle Lawrence with the villains on the sleeping train. Less favorite: the most embarrassing scene in the entire series in the alligator fighting hut? Definitely played for kids! <br /> <br /> All in all not the best of the series but still another entertainment ride with a satisfying global conspiracy and many episodes even in this one that makes me wish they could have gone in for just a few more years as Columbia did with Boston Blackie, though RKO was shaking it faster. There is absolutely no sex, not much violence (not at all by today's high standards), and positively no message makes this kind of film an anathema to serious people who can only regard film as an art form that depends on these three pillars. <br /> <br /> Three Diet Falcon's were made later with John Calvert in the title role, I do not care about them, but I never managed to count them in the main series, which Tom Conway did on his own. Time. Sad also that it was all downhill after that to Conway, who moved to the TV, overcame the voice and even played Norman Conquest at Park Plaza 605 very well in 1953. He also developed serious eye and alcohol problems? I do not know if they were connected? ended poverty and after a period in the hospital in 1967 was found dead in his girlfriend's bed. For us, people who want to at least still have their 10 fun falcons, plus a host of other decent RKO movies, even classics, from 1942 to 1946, which he remembered.
