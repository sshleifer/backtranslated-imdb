This landmark film can now be seen in two different versions at the launch of Grapevine Video, which also includes the English translation of the novel by Selma Lagerlof, which she based on a popular Swedish tale. The first version is the Swedish edition under the title of THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE. The second version is a reconstruction of the way it was shown in the United States under the title of THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT, released by Metro (before being M-G-M). The US release has long since disappeared, but a detailed review in The New York Times lets us know how the scenes were reordered for domestic release - and both are fascinating to see. Each version of this film was presented at The Organ Loft in Salt Lake City with live theater organ sheet music provided by artist Blaine Gale. A live recording was made of these performances and are included on the Grapevine DVD along with the novel and notes on the two versions. While THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE follows the order of Lagerlof's novel, THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT is somewhat easier to follow. Seeing the two different issues is an education of how silent films could be effectively changed to be released in different countries. <br /> <br /> Some viewers look at this movie as a horror movie that it certainly is not. This is a morality game with supernatural shadows used to achieve your yelling message. The leadership and leadership performance of the great Victor Sjostrom was far ahead of his time. It's easy to see why M-G-M took him to Hollywood to direct films like Lillian Gish in THE SCARLET LETTER and THE WIND, as well as Lon Chaney in HE WHO GETS SLAPPED. In America, he was known as Victor Seastrom. He also starred in the lead role of Ingmar Bergman's WILD STRIBRIES, giving a masterful performance. Bergman was heavily influenced by KORKARLEN or THE GHOST CAR in its early days. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful movie that is worth spending some time to discover and study. The launch of Grapevine Video is a great way to do this.
