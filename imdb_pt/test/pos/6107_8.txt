With the title of the sickest movie ever made, PINK FLAMINGOS is an indisputable classic. Of course, camera work is unstable and decentralized, the story is confusing and slow, and every character in the film is disgusting and despicable, but PINK FLAMINGOS has a certain playful charm and a brilliant satirical wit that no other film can match. While this movie is really offensive, reading descriptions of what goes on in the movie is far worse than actually seeing it. Only John Waters can succeed in raping, murder, sadism, cannibalism, coprophagy, and any other form of human debauchery known to man seems absolutely hilarious. This film must be seen to be believed.
