Kennedy-Miller could hardly have done a better job in facing a very challenging exercise: making dry political events work as a human drama and providing an unbiased representation of an explosively controversial subject. <br /> <br /> The key to his success on the first count is a brilliant performance, though I have been less impressed by Max Phipps' performance as Gough Whitlam than some other commentators here. The clear highlights for my money were John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter as Rex Connor. The latter must have been one of the easiest casting choices in history - Hunter could not have been more perfect for the role. In the second count, the series avoids the trap of the "myth of objectivity" through a narrator who articulates the director's sympathies (Phillip Noyce, who most recently demonstrated his leftist credentials in Rabbit Proof Fence), though he is carefully impartial and sympathetic in his dramatic portrait of all parties. Adherence to the Lady Kerr / Lady Macbeth theme, popular among Labor Party supporters, may have been somewhat biased, though not ruinous. In particular, the credit is due to the sympathy shown to Kerr and the extraordinarily difficult position in which he was placed, whatever may be thought of his actions. <br /> <br /> However, there is a bitter note to which producers were perhaps not entirely guilty - the Jim Cairns / Juni Morosi case picture. Those who attend the series without any background for these events will get the impression that Cairns and Morosi were the innocent victims of a slanderous campaign by a gruesome and lecherous press. The producers may have been restricted in this respect by Australia's defamation laws, and the recently demonstrated willingness of Cairns and Morosi to use them against those who suggested that their relationship was sexual (which Cairns would eventually admit a year before his death) . However, more might have been done in the bizarre way in which Morosi managed the Cairns office as Treasurer. Speaking of defamation, there are some disorienting occasions when dialogue is overshadowed by injunctions taken by offended people. main - by a beep on one occasion, and a very loud phone on another. Another curiosity: the DVD release draws a line from the comic relief scene where a customs official (played by the late Paul Chubb) serves Tirath Khemlani on his arrival at Sydney Airport. The next in line is a shaggy-looking hippie, who now gets only one look of disapproval from Chubb when he presents his paperwork. In the original version, Chubb said something along the lines: "Drug seizure in Bali, eh?". Obviously, this line is no longer true following the Corby Schapelle case, which dramatically illustrated that drug detainees in Bali can expect much worse than deportation.
