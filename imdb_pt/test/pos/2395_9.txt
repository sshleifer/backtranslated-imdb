Eddie Monroe is the Hooooot. He's a great actor and I could be your girl anytime. He is so well. I was so sad in the end. I will not ruin the end, but wow. Girls are so cruel. Your girl was wrong. If Eddie were my man, I would never disrespect him. Those mobsters were scary. The moral of the story is Trust Nobody. Your friends will hurt you if they can. Oh and Eddie tell your girlfriend that you are mine, she must move eggs! I would suggest seeing the movie. Because? Becasur I said that. I kept my eyes on the screen. My sister loved it too so I'll see it again because now my friends want to see it and it's worth seeing twice. Peace, Happy New Year!
