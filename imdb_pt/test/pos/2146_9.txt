'Heaven's Gate' is not a masterpiece, which was apparently what it needed to be in the first release to justify its great cost, and, most importantly, Hollywood's continuing uncomfortable confidence in Auteur's film production model. Still 'Heaven's Gate', seen today finally on DVD in a cut of 229 minutes, is a great movie. It's a lethargic touch in rhythm. But at least it is stimulated. Regardless of the incompetence of the construction that marks many films nowadays, there have been many films that, deliberately in shape, have been severely damaged by being carelessly cut with rhythm, so that the films become misshapen and confused. In addition, criticism of the film has become retrospectively quite ridiculous. If the good guys and villains are very obviously pronounced for a serious movie, rather Sam Waterston's mustache and mustache villain villain is a comic opera (and not in the multi-leveled way of Bill The Butcher's' Gangs of New York ')), and yes, the townspeople seem to occasionally tap a' Fiddler On The Roof 'tap, then dozens of serious movies ever since, including' Titanic 'and the graceless' Cold Mountain' (which has certain similarities and is a notable failure in compelling qualities compared to this movie) can be punished for exactly the same reason. <br /> <br /> Despite the accusations, the film has a plot, a rather well-written plot. It simply does not bow to "epic" quality in a standardized way, providing titanic heroes, rafts of sub-plots, and confusion. He tries to narrate more similarly to smaller, modest movies, with moments of interaction of carefully captured characters and explosions of community action, such as the Harvard inauguration and, most especially, the marvelous scene. where Johnson County folk, following the example of a brilliantly physical violinist, make celebrations on skates. "The deer hunter" was a critical and commercial success, but abandoned the first half inspired, in mosaic. and I think in a manner similar to the critique of Robert Penn's Warren novel "All The King's Men" and his dictionary of Jacobin acrobatics, if Cimino did not have such a strong understanding of the conventions of the Hollywood epics, he could have made a rare work of art based on the honest visualization of people within their environment. In contrast, Heaven's Gate manages to bolt its narrative momentum and strain it into a slow expanding arc until the end explodes without abandoning the tiled approach. <br /> <br /> The central romantic triangle, for example, resists standard inflections; James Averill (Kris Kristofferson) competes with young shooter Nate Champion (Christopher Walken) by the hand of a young Madame, Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert); there is no arrogance in bed, no slaps in the face, recriminations or typical moments of sad-bag, but more a sad and distant decision of Ella to choose the younger man whom she loves less because he is ready to make the commitment. Ella emerges as the true hero of the film (Huppert's performance, though awkward initially, is really excellent, balancing a debauched emotionalism with a hammered spirit), trying first to rescue Nate and then to gather the resistance of the immigrants in an enterprising defense. Subsequently, Averill is put into action when friends die. In fact, in the process of overcoming so many clich√© and style traps, 'Heaven's Gate' successfully and intentionally overthrows the grace note of so many renegade heroes from the late '70s and portrays an eventual, vigorous and joyful game of heroes. for a committed but still appreciated victory. <br /> <br /> The social conflict of so many westerns of the 70's finally becomes a real war; where the capital tries an overwhelming final victory over the cheaters who are on their way, they suddenly find a mass army and more powerful, led by the man who represented the completely destroyed Billy the Kid a decade earlier. This is what led the film to be described as the first Western Marxist, but in fact simply deflates a theme of the genre existing well before the 60's. Such old and classic works as William Wyler's "The Westerner" and even " Shane, "tell very similar stories. It is simply here that the romantic myth of the gunslinger has been replaced by the romantic myth of the popular revolt. At a spectacular, exciting, but realistic and therefore chaotic end, the Cattlemen camp is attacked, surrounded by dust clouds punctuated by fallen horses, squirming bodies and shots. Averill puts his classical education to work by finally stealing a Roman trick and bringing the Cattlemen to the brink of annihilation before they are rescued by the Cavalry (another distinctly seditious but certainly not so offensive after the tireless impersonation of the native's Little Big Man American massacres). Indeed, it is hard to think of a more heroically American view of popular resistance. The only real dead-end of the film is an unnecessary coda that indicates the eventual relapse of Averill, a rather potted tragedy. <br /> <br /> Despite certain flaws and a slow mid-section, 'Heaven's Gate' is a supreme work, a genuine attempt to create a contemporary western and a new type of epic. If anyone still has to join the chorus that thinks Cimino was absurd in his behavior on set and spent, it's unfortunate. When, today, such failures as "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" and "K-19 - The Widowmaker" amount to almost a hundred million dollars, and yet a label of infamy still hangs over this film, one of them ponders exactly the somber death meant . The attempt at original style, obscene sexuality, the hard-won sense of detail, the dazzling rigor of film production, and what is filmed all contrast with what is lacking in so many contemporary Hollywood products.
