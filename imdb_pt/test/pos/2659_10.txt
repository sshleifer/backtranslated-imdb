As a Circle around the human condition, 2001 begins at the beginning, jumps to the middle and proceeds to the end, exactly where we begin. Looking at the weakness of words in comparison to the image (s), Kubrick wisely dispenses dialogue, preferring the power and essence of the setting, and allowing the public's intelligence to decipher. Or not, depending on the audience. <br /> <br /> A monolith in film history, 2001 is a high point of direction, execution and conquest. If we consider the ambition of the film (a film about everything), and the measure of success that the film achieved for that purpose, a very solid argument for this being the greatest of all films can be made. <br /> <br />
