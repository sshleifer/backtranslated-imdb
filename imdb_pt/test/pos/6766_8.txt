This film is a mix of a dark comedy and a drama, about two guys who worked in a butcher's shop and wanted to build their own. When they finally realized this dream, they faced a new problem: there were no customers! One day, by accident, a guy dies in the refrigerator room, and a new type of butcher business begins? Do they start selling human flesh by telling customers it's just chicken? and their business begins to improve: human flesh sells well! Oh! Did I forget to say something? These guys are not normal! There's really something missing in their brains! <br /> <br /> The film has some scenes of dark humor, but it is, in my opinion, a drama. One that shows us what's inside a psychopath's head, what are his motivations for what he does. I must confess that I was a bit surprised by the end of the movie because I never expected they could do it without being discovered, but this is probably because I see many Hollywood movies? What I mean by that is that in Hollywood movies we always expect punishment from the guys who do the "bad stuff". Is there always a morality protecting "good values", even though we all know that in "real life" this does not happen so often? And I liked that movie mainly because of that, because it fits into a kind of cinema that is true, frontal, without false morals, and that "sees" what is on the other side, behind "conventional morality"? It only happens in independent cinema (especially in European)! <br /> <br /> In addition, there are excellent performances by Nikolaj Lie Kass and Mads Mikkelsen (especially the first) in the roles of "disturbed guys" ?? <br /> <br /> Very good Danish film!
