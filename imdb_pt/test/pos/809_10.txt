In a better civilization, this and many other David Suchet films would be released in theaters. The plots are fabulous (no, I had no idea who had done it, but the clues were all there if I was more imaginative - the best kind of mystery), the awesome production values, acting (by Edward Fox, Sarah Miles, Lysette Anthony, Megan Dodds and of course David Suchet as Hercule Poirot) simply perfect, wonderful dialogue, music and sensations of suspense and tension are wonderful things. <br /> <br /> One of the pleasures of these Hercule Poirot movies for a man is how many beautiful women star! Here are two - the sinuous sexy Megan Doods and the gorgeous Lysette Anthony. <br /> <br /> You really can not go wrong by renting these - they are simply wonderful - like the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine - your mind working constantly because everything is there and you fight, but keeping your mind constantly thinking can keep up with everything - and the beautiful settings. <br /> <br /> I can not think of movies that stimulate thinking more than these Hercule Poirot / David Suchet films. It is impossible to praise them - and I had never seen one before, a few months ago, nor read an Agatha Christie.
