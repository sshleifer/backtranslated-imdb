Released as KING BOXER in the UK <br /> <br /> This film was essentially the first kung fu film to be released in the UK. Many of us had gone through Kurosawa's surprisingly violent and engaging dramas and were accustomed to Oriental movies. being beautifully filmed and illuminated, with a somewhat restrained rhythm, all like flipping through an album of still very fine photographs that happened to be moving. <br /> <br /> Along comes Run Run Shaw and co. with its production values ​​of widescreen "home movies" and surprising dubbing of mature parodies and all the rules have changed. KIng Boxer was the first to enter through the door, leaving a clearly marked trail for the others to follow with their feet firmly planted on the burning steps. <br /> <br /> Despite the hokey plots, pantomime acting, cheesecake-cuts and western-style spaghetti snap-stepped zooms, this movie was wonderful. Gorgeous without being opulent and with the brightest fight choreography of all time to grace a screen. We love unhealthy violence, anguish, testosterone. The martial artists among us have found some of the fascinating, yet extravagant and often silly techniques. It was very different from the Japanese things we all knew, and it had a lovely acrobatic grace that perfectly complemented the unhealthy violence and blood-stained floor. Delicious. <br /> <br /> The "KING Lear" scene was, at the time, a big landmark in schlock "You are cruel bastards ... my dick !!" Now it's far less shocking, but still a bit boring. <br /> <br /> We did not notice that females in full view were absolutely one-dimensional. After seeing more movies of the genre, now stands out as a sore thumb, but at the time did not matter. <br /> <br /> This film defined what would quickly become the cliché of the kung-fu movie. All of them. Watch and remember that until it exploded on the Western screens, there were no genres for that. It was unique and incredible. It was the first kung fu movie and it is still, for me and for many others, the best.
