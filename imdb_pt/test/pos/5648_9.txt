An inflexible descent into psychological and physical oblivion that will undoubtedly burn images of the true brutality and suffering of war in your cerebral cortex in a way that many other films will not. In fact, there is simply no other war film like this. <br /> <br /> Director Kon Ichikawa witnessed the unthinkable horror of Hiroshima firsthand just 10 days after the fall of the bomb. He said that from that day on it would always be his mission to express the useless and empty violence that humans inflict on each other and on themselves. Mr. Ichikawa shows us that there are no winners in the war ... for the paths to victory and defeat are paved with the same soldiers who march peripherally along roads that only have death and destruction in their end. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa manages to convey his message to the world through this astounding piece of cinema.
