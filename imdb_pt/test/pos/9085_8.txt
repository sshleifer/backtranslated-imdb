Nelson is a medical professor who wants his four students to kill him and then bring him back to life, so he can prove that there is an afterlife. So they do and soon all medical students want to know if there is life after death. The afterlife is not about pearl gates and lights at the end of the tunnel, but something more sinister. <br /> <br /> Ghosts come back to haunt them and surely this movie will haunt anyone. There are some pretty scary moments that can translate into real life and make people think a little about what happens when you die. It's a good movie to see when it's raining and you're feeling down. It's also a little weird. <br /> <br /> Look with a haunted past.
