I'm a big fan of Rupert Everett. I love Kathy Bates so when I saw this available I decided to take a look. The synopsis did not tell him much. In parts, it was silly, touching and in others some parts were quite hysterical. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is a big fan of a personality of any kind will find some small traces of identification with the main character. (Of course there are many that they will not, but that's the point) <br /> <br /> If you like any of the actors give a watch, but do not look at anything too dramatic is good fun. <br /> <br /> I can also mention that you can see how Rupert is. I mean, I knew he had 6'4 ", but he looks even more so in this movie. He still seemed to lean a bit because of the height of the other characters in this. you Rupert fans there is a naked chest scene ... WONDERFUL!
