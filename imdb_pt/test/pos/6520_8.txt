Dan Dailey gives a sincere and colorful performance as the great Dizzy Dean. His manner of dealing with the character is very true to life and captures the flavor of Dean's history and limited education. The film, of course, centers around Dizzy Deans to fame and his sudden trip to the bank with an injury that he has chosen to ignore, much to his regret. His wife is splendidly portrayed by Joanna Dru, who gives a very realistic quality to the woman he loved and supported the prom player who rose to a "dizzying height" so quickly. The portrait of Dizzy's later career as a sportsman is honest and unyielding, reflecting his problems stemming from his precarious upbringing and his colorful language both in and out of thin air. Dizzy was a character and the Daily gave life to his story with admirable skill. If you liked this movie, I recommend the comedy "Kid from Left Field" (1953), in which Daily plays a baseball player idolized by his son (Billy Chapin). Every day, once again, the ballplayer is played in a completely satisfactory manner. I highly recommend the pride of St. Louis for baseball fans everywhere.
