This film is a reference in the history of non-mainstream cinema. The use of the montage represents a quantum leap from Strike's relatively simple juxtapositions (Eisenstein's first film). Take the scene on the steps and watch the soldiers' repeated shot coming down to reiterate the point of the horrors that really happened! A highly intelligent monumental film, a must-see for all film students!
