While I was sitting in the movies almost crying to myself, discouraged by the atrocity that Ron Howard and Tom Hanks call the Da Vinci Code, I could not see the light at the end of the tunnel that is Angels and Demons. <br /> <br /> Hanks and Company are back to the Angels and Demons of Sequel-Prequel, and they have learned the lesson. <br /> <br /> Acting, everyone is much better. Aylet Zurer is very good as Vittoria Vetra, and better than the girl who played Sophie Neveau. Tom Hanks is very good as ever, he's better at it because he works harder at giving the film the feeling that it's a thriller. I think Ewan McGregor does the best job of any of the actors. It may even merit an indication in March, but dubious. He convinced me to the end. He is dynamic and faithful but rational, and realizes that the Church needs to put its past behind. The smaller actors also do very good jobs. <br /> <br /> Technically and visually the film is greatly improved. Cinematography is very ... much better, and the visual effects are excellent. The final sequence of the explosion at the end is excellent. Howard does a masterful job, guiding you on a tour in Rome. Riding around, Ron Howard does an incredible job this time keeping the story going, not boring us with a history lesson denouncing Christianity. The movie also makes you feel more at risk. In our fragile minds, finding out whether Jesus had children or not, is not so high on the list, compared to a cataclysmic outburst that killed thousands, including the Roman Catholic Church. Part of the reason I think the story is so fast is because of the excellent score. I can not say enough about the punctuation. It was epic at times, as something of the Lord of the Rings, but sometimes it looked like a Bourne movie, which is a good mix. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about this movie is that it's ridiculously far. sought. The chances of Carmelengo being someone from the time of Ewan McGregors are highly unlikely, and the chances of a cardinal with a foster child being elected pope are even more ridiculous. Not to mention the whole Antimatter thing, which has not yet been created, and Dan Brown wrote the book in 2003 ... <br /> <br /> Angels and Demons in general is much stronger, faster, more exciting and film more important than the Da Vinci Code. This is must see suspense for anyone who loves history and mystery combined into one.
