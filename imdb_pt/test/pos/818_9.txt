This film essentially contains all the elements of a great 1970s exploration film, except that it was made in the late 1980s for the direct video market. <br /> <br /> You have a young couple in love, but the whole world they are involved in crack trafficking or gang violence. When the boyfriend goes to jail, the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals, who are all in this movie, except for the cops. First she gets addicted to crack by a dealer, and then because he owes the money from the dealer Jim Brown, she becomes the property of Brown. So she's basically enslaved in a military-style house that the movie got the name. As if that was not enough reason to see this movie, you also have Anthony Geary acting as a seemingly conservative guidance counselor. , but he really is a great crack dealer. In a despicable and hilarious scene, he demands heroin's sexual favors because she has no money to repair. In a previous scene, it has been established that he is your advisor. That scene and another where Jim Brown forced her to take a hot shower because she stinks hysterically. Actress Cheryl Kay was very good at this movie. Tarantino, bring her back. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising to me that anyone mentioned in another comment that Tarantino is a big fan of it. It has the right blend of comedy, action, sex, romance, and yes, a central message to stay away from drugs. Jim Brown's vile firefly deserves to be mentioned at the same time as another great 80s villain, Wings Hauser in Vice Squad. Sometimes I think there should be an Oscar for films in which such performances could be recognized. Meanwhile, let's hope that modern directors of DVD movies learn to learn to use that same type of language in cheek humor.
