He's upstairs with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. He memorizes the New York City mentality of the period, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, squealed by his own firecracker, and finally retreating to the bed of his adoptive parents. Totally absurd, it's the life you see through the magic glasses, seeing things as they really are ... I do not think this is ever shown again. If so, surely someone would take the thing and put it out there. A kidnapping goes wrong: mixed in a rainstorm, coming in and out of stores, our hero throws a raincoat over his prey and throws it in his ice-cream cart and drives her to his basement apartment. He is amazed, surprised and incredibly disappointed when the wrapping leaves: instead of a lustful lady, he captures a suburban housewife of the Middle Ages who speaks, speaks and speaks. The film is full of vignettes of travelers' lives, suburban life, city authorities, and all the attitudes they so lovingly maintained. It pushes the boundaries of comedy, as magical reality can propel a drama, just as Daffy Duck is able to draw in imaginative scenes to demonstrate his difficulties or desires, all at the limit of plausibility. All this is funny, no one is bad.
