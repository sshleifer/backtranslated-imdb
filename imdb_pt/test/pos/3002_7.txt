The medical team of husband and wife Carole and Niles Nelson are doing very modestly in their careers, but Niles has a gambling problem. His luck changes when he (unknowingly) saves the life of a gangster from Joe Gurney's mob and gets a big bonus from the gangster himself. Loving his change of fortune (and new apartment), Niles continues to receive payments to repair other injured members of the gang. Unfortunately, his obscure business comes to the fore in a police raid, which puts a shadow on his wife's career as well. <br /> <br /> At this point, the plot comes into focus, as Carole Nelson has to rescue her career before her license is suspended. This involves taking the gang to justice more or less alone. <br /> <br /> This is not a gangster picture but a plot that could have been comfortable on a show like MATLOCK or MURDER SHE WROTE. There is some tension, but humor is kept in check by Bogart's ironic acting of an idiot gangster who calls himself the "Napoleon of Crime." His other gang members also function more as lackeys than as ruffians. And there are some dialogues between Bogart and Francis, especially when she's treating her wounds in her hiding place. Of course, like in all the gangster movies, there is a great end to the dispute, but with a humorous touch. This is a good short film showing Bogart on his rise to stardom.
