Despite the previous critic's speech, this is a very rhythmic and engaging documentary with many classic 1950s science fiction movie clips that have influenced Spielberg, Lucas and others in their most recent efforts. I agree that Spielberg's films are not even on the same level as the films discussed here, such as William Cameron Menzies' brilliant INVADERS FROM MARS, to cite only one of the many titles examined, but this is still a remarkably good view of the 1950s. paranoid science fiction. Yes, it turns into a commercial for the warm remake of WORLD WAR for the last fifteen minutes; you can turn it off. The rest is surprisingly good, and it's good to see contemporary filmmakers remember the films that inspired them, even if they can not begin to match the originals.
