I did not expect much when I decided to watch this movie, so I was surprised to see myself enjoying myself. Some scenes made me laugh almost uncontrollably. The characters were involved (no pun intended); however, the story is predictable. The fun of it is watching Crawl (the character of Shore), a Californian guy that a college student brings home on Thanksgiving, trying in his awkward (but captivating) way to fit into his lifestyle. I was also surprised that in all this there was a message. If you have a chance, check out this movie!
