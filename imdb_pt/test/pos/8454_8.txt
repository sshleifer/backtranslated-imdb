Bridges' drama about a reporter who discovers some flaws in safety precautions taken at a nuclear power plant is well-directed and a very interesting film from the late 1970s. It's not amazing, but it's solid, the acting is very good, especially Jack lemmon, but Douglas and Fonda were good too. It was a very good script and Bridges' direction was solid and adequate. This is definitely not one of the best films of the '70s, but it's one of the best. A good movie Michael Douglas early and Lemmon at his peak .--- IMDb Rating: 7.2, my rating: then, in simple words, solid, but not incredible ... that's what this movie is, solid but not Amazing 8/10
