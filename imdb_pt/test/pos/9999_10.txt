Although I'm not a fan of golf, I watched a preview of this movie and absolutely loved it. The historical configurations, the flagrant distinctions of class, and seeing good and evil on both sides of the dividing line occupied my full attention. The actors and their characterizations were all mesmerizing. And I was on the edge of my seat during the golfing segments, which were not only dramatic and exciting, but easy to follow. Near the end of this movie, "Seabiscuit" came strongly to mind, although "The Greatest Game Ever Played" is a much less complex story than the film. In both cases, the fact that the events actually happened deepened my interest.
