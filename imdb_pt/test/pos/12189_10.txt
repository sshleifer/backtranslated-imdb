After sleeping in pure solitude, Lestat awakens from a 100-year sleep to the sound of a new song he wants to be part of and the band "The Vampire Lestat" is born. His desire to end his loneliness and his attitude of "living in the light" along with his music, irritate his fellow vampires and awaken an evil that has been dormant for thousands of years. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for those looking for a true adaptation from book to film. Those who have read the books and expect to see it on screen are in for a big disappointment. This movie will appeal to those who really liked the movie "Interview with the Vampire". <br /> <br /> There are some holes and incongruities, but as a whole, this movie was satisfying. Stuart Townsend portrays Lestat with a lackluster sensuality and sensuality in the previous film. The relationships portrayed in the film were very sexy and sizzling. <br /> <br /> Like a movie, history attracts you and attracts you. Casting is wonderful. I loved this story and movie. If you like sensuality and sexual tension, you'll love this movie!
