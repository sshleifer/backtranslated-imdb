The problem with this series is that it is very real. I'm watching on Amazon "Unbox" and having just finished episode 2 I hate it, absolutely hate it, Fark, the cell leader. I can not remember any television series having that emotional impact. Remember the old slogan for horror movies "Just keep telling yourself it's just a movie"? Well, I see myself repeatedly reminding myself that it's your "only TV". But of course it's not just TV, is it? The possibility of a cell like the one that appears here operating in the United States is certainly within the range of plausibility. This is what gives this program its vicious authenticity. And that's why I hate it so much.
