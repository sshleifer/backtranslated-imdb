It's good to see a romantic comedy that does not have the lead man, this has a solid performance of both the male protagonists and also the female lead, and although the story is a bit long and a bit clich√©, you can not help but like it . I think the story was a bit rushed in the end, but extending that would have made the story even longer. Superior to other romantic comedies, like 100 days with Mr. Cocky, and possibly tied up with my tutor friend. <br /> <br /> It would be an interesting introduction to Korean cinema, not as big as my cheeky but still good girl.
