This movie is my family's favorite Christmas movie because it is a beautiful picture of what Christmas really is. Nowadays living in a big city that I hate, I love watching movies about life that I have always dreamed of having. The city in which this film takes place is my dream come true for the life I always wanted and the true sense of community that has been lost in today's society. I really do not feel the true spirit of Christmas anymore, but watching this movie helps find that feeling again. My family recorded this movie a long time ago from TV and now our copy is sold out, so I would really like to buy some DVD copies for my family and for me, if anyone can tell me where I can buy some copies, please post the information here and I'll keep checking. Thank you.
