This show was very good in many ways, although certainly an atypical Western with the hero (?) Riding a motorcycle instead of a horse, due to the 1914 scenario, very "late" for a Westerner, which usually tend to be set between 1866 and 1890. I remember some controversy over his cancellation at the time but did not really watch it during his time on NBC. When I came to see and love it was a decade later when I was in the Army in Germany and was shown every week from the beginning on the Armed Forces Television. Until then, Margot Kidder was famous as Lois Lane, but I also always think of her as Nichols' girlfriend. In many ways, Nichols was very much like Maverick; both were much more attracted to enriching with little effort than they were fighting. It was in the small TV magazine that they distributed on PX (not exactly an authoritative edition of the TV Guide but made it look as close as possible without getting into copyright issues) that I learned the true story behind of cancellation. I really wonder what the next season with the most violent twin would have been if they had actually done it as planned. Of course, by the time this program was completed, TV's "western era" was in decline for about a decade; some day I hope to be able to write that the "age of reality" has been in decline for so long! While "Gunsmoke" and "Bonanza" were still running, the two were coming to an end and it had been years since a new Western actually picked it up; I think this trend did a lot to hold Nichols back, and that was the main reason that NBC executives doubted they'd ever meet a large audience. But for me, a good western, unlike a show set in the contemporary, is a bit timeless, as are other "period" shows; changing fashions and things like that does nothing to make them seem more "dated" than they should be, and I think watching that show, 10 years after it was produced, is what brought me this point of view. In addition, this show is an early pairing of Garner and Stuart Margolin, who is really one of the great companions of all time, not just in Westerns.
