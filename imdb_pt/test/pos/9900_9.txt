Morris and Reba Applebaum were the toast of Broadway in its heyday. At ninety, Morris is a widower. He summons his children - the psychotherapist and the BMW car dealer - and his daughter, the television writer / producer - to attend a party in his honor, after which he will sacrifice himself. Creatures of literal mind that are, they take what it says by its apparent value. He leads them, his grandchildren and a few others, including an African-American-Jewish psychiatrist who resembles Godfrey Cambridge in a joyous chase through Manhattan while they try to stop him or dissuade him. <br /> <br /> Comedy is totally work. The performances are excellent. Peter Falk is in top form. This film does more than deserve an audience: it deserves popular success.
