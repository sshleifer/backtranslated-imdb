This movie was a sweet, fluffy romantic comedy, just the kind of movie I do not usually like, but it was cute enough to make me interested. It was very funny at one point (probably because I liked it) and then so serious in the next. Besides, there was Ellen and I always had a crush on her. <br/> <br/> Basically, the owner of a bookstore, Helen (Kate Capshaw) finds a love letter in one of the old ones. sofas in your store. She thinks it's for her and drives her crazy trying to figure out who sent her. She's sort of isolated herself from the world, so that really throws her in for a spin. Eventually, almost everyone connected with her finds this letter and they are all getting mixed signals that create some really funny moments. <br /> <br /> Like I said, I'm not usually one for this kind of movie, but I really hurt. having fun and highly recommend it.
