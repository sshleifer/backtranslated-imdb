Great "documentary" of how scientists believed dinosaurs behaved, captured with some of the most spectacular CGI since "Jurassic Park." Done quite seriously, like a prehistoric episode of "Nation Geographic." Grab your attention from the first frame and never let go. My favorite part was when the Diplodocus fights the Allosauros. <br /> <br /> 10 stars. This is what science is all about.
