Congratulations to all the wonderful fans of this movie who not only saw and appreciate but (based on the many literate comments), actually, GET IT! I have at least always considered Paul Mazursky's "The Tempest," a reflection on Shakespeare's play of the same name, as has been observed in some of the other reviews here. On the other hand, if you are looking for a more direct adaptation of the piece, you should look elsewhere. As an experiment, however, it only achieves spectacularly. Charming, moving, funny, sad, dramatic ... it's all that and more. Cast, locations, script, music are simply fantastic. Cassavetes and Rowland have never been better. The turn of Susan Sarandon more than suggested the great work that will come from her in the future. Molly Ringwald makes her movie debut memorable and you just have to love the performance of Raul Julia ... he steals the show in several scenes. Plus the always great Cassavetes was confident and safe enough to have left! A study on what the thematic elements of Shakespeare's classic could be life upgraded in more "modern times", Mazursky's "Tempest" burns brightly!
