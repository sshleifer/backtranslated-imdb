When it arrives at any movie that was made in or about the South, the characters are labeled racist or Hillbillies or even worse than horrible term RACIST "Rednecks". This movie was a murder mystery, simple and simple. It was a great murder mystery and demonstrated some of the human feelings about each other's race. The same kind of remarks made by black actors in relation to today's films. Before watching this movie, one must get the "MISSISSIPPI BURNING" chip from Ones' shoulder and enjoy the plot, wonderful action and scenes reminiscent of simpler times that, although they have disappeared, will not be forgotten. Mr.Faulkner made his hometown of OXFORD, Miss. Justice for having this movie filmed there. The producer noticed while filming the film there, his stereotypical perception of whites was misinterpreted and he observed white and black city dwellers and locals joining each other in the same way. So sit back and enjoy one of Mr. Faulkner's great classics & try to find out who the killer really is ...
