Richard Abernethie, a very wealthy man, died and his relatives gathered for his funeral. Included at the funeral party is Abernathie's younger sister, Cora Galaccio. While none of the family has seen Cora in at least 20 years, everyone agrees that Cora has always been a little different. So when Cora says something about Abemethie having been murdered, most of them amuse themselves as one of Cora's eccentricities. But someone is obviously taking Cora seriously. The next day, Cora is found dead in her bed having been beaten violently. Is there a connection between the two deaths? It is up to Hercule Poirot to find a murderer. <br /> <br /> After the Funeral, one of the most well-rounded episodes of the entire Poirot series. I've always been a fan of this particular book by Agatha Christie and, as I recall, the film is as true to Christie's source material as any of Poirot's appearances. The mystery is top notch, with many clues, suspects and red herrings. And as I wrote before, I always enjoy a story from Christie where Hercule Poirot gathers everyone in a living room for the ultimate revelation. It may be old fashioned, but that's how I like it. Go beyond the plot, technically and artistically After the Funeral be a winner. Sets, editing, directing and cinematography are as good as you'll find in one of these movies. The acting is equally impressive. I have been expecting a nice performance from David Suchet as Poirot and he does not disappoint here. The rest of the cast is as strong as Monica Dolan, giving a particularly remarkable performance. Other than a small problem with how fast the characters are introduced, I have no real complaints. It's a good show all around.
