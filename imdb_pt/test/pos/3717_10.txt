Recall that this came before the First Gulf War, which gave us "Lessons of Darkness" by Werner Herzog. <br /> <br /> Le Dernier Combat is not "Sci Fi". It's more like a judgment. I watched it at least a dozen times. He is indeed a fitting companion to Herzog's Lessons of Darkness: "And in that time men shall seek death, but shall not find it; for death shall flee from them." <br /> <br /> That someday, unfortunately, can be today, in Iraq. <br /> <br /> But back to Le Dernier Combat, be sure to watch the last second of the movie. I would not call this "surprise ending," but it is something you will lose if you just assume that the end will not be more than what you have already seen.
