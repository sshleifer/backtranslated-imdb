I can not imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than that of Quentin Tarantino. (At least in his films) Inglourious Basterds is no different. We all know Tarantino, the guy who exploded on the scene in the early 1990s with cult classics such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since then, it has been a disappointment to some. Well, I'm relieved to say that Tarantino did not lose touch. He brings us his best since Pulp Fiction and fortunately so. <br /> <br /> We know the story, a tale of World War II told only as Tarantino can. (Fictional of course) A war movie was not made like this before. Brad Pitt as Lieutenant Aldo Raine leads the Bastards in Nazi-occupied France. Your goal - kill the Nazis. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other side. He is known as the "Jewish Hunter" and looks after his business as ruthlessly as any other. The third sub-story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who witnesses the massacre of her family. And she, of course, wants revenge on the Germans for her devastating loss. In fact, there are three stories here intertwined and connected together. If you know anything about Tarantino or his films, that's nothing new to him. <br /> <br /> The war has never been so fun. The Basterds are amazing, but at the same time, very funny, sometimes even hilarious. The dark comedy aspect looks great on this, as in many other Tarantino films. Entertainment and joy are led by Brad Pitt. I found it extremely funny and amusing. I could not wait to see it on the screen again. Even with his crazy accent, he works on this kind of film. Also making great impressions were MÃ©lanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who were tremendous. The film was filled with remarkable performances. <br /> <br /> The story itself has so many historical inaccuracies to tell, but so what? It's not supposed to be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun, as we should. The film department deserves great props with beautiful vibrant colors highlighting the film. You really have to love the last line of the movie ... but Pulp Fiction remains your masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino, among all other things, is an artist. World War II, is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino somehow manages to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a fun movie, it's tremendously entertaining, shocking, dramatic, full of suspense and funny at the same time. Jam packed with everything you are looking for in a movie, done with that certain Tarantino style, it pays to be checked. It's time to experience for yourself how war is through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino.
