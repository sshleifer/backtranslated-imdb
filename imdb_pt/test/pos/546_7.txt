This movie is about a single mom who is happy and lucky enough to be almost irresponsible, and her sensitive teenage daughter who is going through teen turbulence. <br /> <br /> "Anywhere But Here" is an engaging movie from Beginning to the End. Both Ann and Adele are described very early on, so we know how different their personalities are. Clashes inevitably happen and they are presented in an engaging way. I feel so drawn to your state of mind and your circumstances. It's like I'm living their lives, feeling what they're feeling. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon gives another excellent performance in "Anywhere But Here". She is charismatic, happy goes lucky, hedonistic, warm and loving all at once. I've always liked Susan Sarandon, and I think she's grossly underestimated. <br /> <br /> "Anywhere But Here" is a captivating emotional journey.
