The Universal Studios version of "Flipper" (1996) is a great thrilling movie for the whole family with good values ​​and sentimentality. It's the story of Sandy Ricks, a Chicago teenager who reluctantly spends his vacation with his Uncle Porter Ricks in the Bahamas. This ends up changing the lives of teenagers and it grows in the process. Learn to appreciate nature and respect the environment. I grew up in the 1960s and the NBC television show "Flipper" was my favorite childhood program. Elijah Wood is perfectly cast as Sandy Ricks in the 90's and gives an excellent performance. As much as I enjoyed the NBC television show and MGM theatrical movies with Luke Halpin as Sandy in the 1960s, I liked that feature the best! I feel that Elijah Wood is the best Sandy Ricks. With regard to Luke Halpin, I feel that Elijah Wood has more of a variety of talents in acting and more emotions as an actor, which makes his performance excellent and more believable. I think Elijah Wood is the best young actor working on movies today. Director Alan Shapiro also wrote the script and did an excellent job as writer and director of this film. Paul Hogan makes a comical and enjoyable presentation as Sandy's uncle, Porter Ricks. Mr. Hogan's performance perfectly compensates for Elijah's role as Sandy. I'm a big fan of underwater movies. This film was beautifully filmed in the Bahamas as "Thunderball" (1965 UA) was. The director of photography was Bill Butler A.S.C. who filmed the movie "Shark" in 1975. Mr. Butler is a very talented director of photography. The underwater director of photography was Pete Romano. He did an excellent job with underwater cinematography. I liked the soundtrack of Joel McNeely's movie. This good soundtrack featured Crosby, Stills and Nash among other talented artists. This film was filmed on Panavision as "Thunderball" at the ratio of 2.35: 1 If possible, try to see this movie in a version of the telescope as originally framed and viewed by Alan Shapiro and Bill Butler. Another cool thing is that Mr. Shapiro gave Sandy "original" Ricks (Luke Halpin) a small part in this remake. He played Bounty Fisherman # 3 in this movie. This was a very kind gesture from Mr. Shapiro! As you can tell I'm a true fan of this movie. Unfortunately this beautiful film was received with harsh words by most movie critics. I originally saw this movie on my birthday, May 31, 1996 at a movie theater. It meant a lot to me. I have this in multiple video versions. The VHS versions are in "pan and scan". The laserdisc version is "letterboxed" 2.35: 1! I even have a VCD in 2.35: 1 from Hong Kong which is "letterboxed". But my most valuable asset is an "original" 16mm theatrical print that I'll keep for the rest of my life! Thank you Mr. Shapiro, Elijah Wood, Paul Hogan and everyone involved for making this a memorable movie for me to enjoy! <br /> <br /> I must add that the quality of Universal DVD is superb! It is the best DVD as far as quality I have ever seen. The color and resolution are spectacular. The soundtrack is great. I think Universal should have used the same transfer to the DVD that they did for the laserdisc version. The 35mm print is "mint" and Alan's film really looks wonderful. A great homage to a wonderful movie! The resolution of the DVD is even higher than the quality of the CD! It's simply spectacular! Thank you Universal Home Video for great quality control and transfer. Thank you so much for doing a great job on this wonderful family movie. Also many thanks to you Alan for all your extreme kindness to me !!! It's a real honor to meet you !!! (Revised / updated June 27, 2005)
