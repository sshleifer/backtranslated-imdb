<br /> <br /> SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW <br /> <br /> The Long Kiss Goodnight is another excellent example of a common affliction of many modern films; It starts with a very interesting concept - a trained killer whose memory has been erased recovers self-awareness - and the initial setup is engaging, but then it seems that the writers do not quite know where to go next and everything disappears more and more paths confusing and / or futile, leaving the disappointing taste of something that was OK, but promised to be much better. The bad guys are extraordinarily normal, and even Jackson's supporting role looks more like something from his pre-Pulp Fiction days; it seems that Harlin, as on Cutthroat Island, made every effort to prevent anyone else from overshadowing his then wife. Your character is by far the best in the movie and it only makes you feel even more frustrated that you can not do something better with him. <br /> <br /> However, there is still something about this movie. which, to me, sets it apart from ordinary Dutch action and puts it above average, if only. It is a very subtle thing that I can not put my finger on; is a disturbing, cold, somber, even unhealthy sensation, a nightmare and unreal sensation, a decadent air, an evil trace, which continues to emerge in various ways. It is in the dark and reddish photograph and the almost permanent night that the characters inhabit, it is in Samantha's dreams in front of the mirror, in her evil eyes and smile whenever she is about to kill a man or when she announces how she will like watching his enemy die with his daughter listening, he's on Mitch's return at the wheel of a car while he's squirting so much blood out of his mouth that he can barely speak ... I do not know, it's an atmosphere, something I can not define, but what? gives me creeps (a little) and that makes this movie still strangely intriguing to me.
