I did not have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn. I do not know why I keep buying these horror movies when I know it's always the same thing. Maybe I'm a bit masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, there's nothing original. Yes, it's about a small group of teenagers going into the woods to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they are killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic! It's one of the best experiences I've seen in a horror movie. The places where it is filmed are so wonderful. You see mountains, waterfalls, rocky mountains. It's just incredible. It takes a lot of time (except for the opening scene) before the killer starts killing, but I do not care! It was nice to watch enough not to care. What I mean is you're not going to sit around waiting for the murders to start, because whatever happens is fun because of the beauty of the movie itself. The ending is a bit strange, but I will not tell you anything else about it. You will know what I mean. Another thing I liked: you care about the characters. They are not just a bunch of idiots who spend time complaining to each other. Of course, they are pure stereotypes of the usual slasher characters, but there is something special about them. Anyway, it's a great horror movie and I hope you have a good time watching it because I really did!
