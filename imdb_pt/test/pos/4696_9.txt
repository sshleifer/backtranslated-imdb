This is one of my favorite series, all categories, all the time. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate to have a series from the VHS series a few years ago. I loved it when I saw her back on -91 -92, when I was about 12 years old. I love this, or more, today, which is remarkable, considering my (hopefully) improved skills of appreciation and film criticism. Most of the movies I liked at that time I do not really like today, besides the nostalgia factor. This factor is present here as well, but there is much more to Robin of Sherwood than nostalgia. <br /> <br /> There are only a few bad things about this series. First, the quality of the image and the sound is like this, at least in the first episodes. Fortunately, it gets better. Secondly, you might have wanted a bit more blood and realism in the fight scenes, though I know it was not an option in this case. <br /> <br /> So for the good things! And there are a lot of them. First of all, Michael Praed is Robin Hood. I do not think I've seen him in a single role since then, which only strengthens that fact for me. It offers such a believable performance as Robin. Jason Connery had an impossible task to replace him. The fact that Michael Praed does not become a bigger name as an actor is unbelievable. Or maybe that was his destiny, to make a perfect role and then disappear. <br /> <br /> I love Nickolas Graces, Sheriff of Nottingham. He's not really a complex character, but totally rotten. The relationship between him and Gisburne is simply hilarious. In fact, just looking at De Rainault sitting on his throne, bored, screaming, makes me laugh even before saying anything. Another actor who deserves extra praise is Ray Winstone as Will Scarlet. You can really feel the sorrow within him, as well as his hatred for the soldiers who killed his wife. Winstone is an actor who finally got his deserved Hollywood achievement (in films like The Departed and Beowulf). There are many other great actors here as well. <br /> <br /> I love the portrait of Robin's gang. They are having fun, joking, laughing, you really feel the camaraderie between them, the closeness that comes from a limited group like this. These bonding scenes are so important. <br /> <br /> I think being produced in the UK with British actors really improved, compared to for example the movie version -92 with Kevin Costner, which looks fake, false fake (Christian Slater as Will Scarlet, let's there ..) The cast being able to speak English with British accent makes it more believable, and I get the feeling that the actors as well as the director and the writers behind the series can put much more into the skin of the gang Robin Hood than an American crew could have. The music is wonderful, Clannad is perfect for the feel of the show. Music is another of those things they just picked up. <br /> <br /> An exciting addition is also the fantasy and magical seasoning that is put there. It's not over, but it's believable and just makes the whole thing better and more interesting. I also love how well the mix of comedy, adventure and drama is mixed. <br /> <br /> These are some of the things that make this series so vivid and genuine. It's by far the best version of Robin Hood I've ever seen. I will not end with the quote from "Nothing's forgotten." But one thing that will never be forgotten, to me, is this fantastic Robin Hood story. Look.
