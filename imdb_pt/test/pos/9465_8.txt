I have to be honest, I really enjoyed watching She's the Man. Despite being a typical teen comedy or if you want to change the sex movie, it had some pretty decent laughs that I think anyone could have. Adults and teenagers would enjoy this movie at the same time. Amanda Bynes is the typical rebellious teenager who dresses and acts like a guy, and when she is rejected to try on the boy's football team, she decides to take on the appearance of her brother to prove she is worthy of being on the boy's soccer team. Of course, love shows when she meets another guy who thinks she's his brother. She also has a girl who is running after her. Well, the slogan says it all. <br /> <br /> This is a fun teen drama that I think will be remembered for a while. Amanda Bynes has proven something in the movie, it's really hard acting like a guy. : D Well, it's true! <br /> <br /> 8/10
