This is the real story of the great jazz pianist / singer / legend Ray Charles (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winner Jamie Foxx). He was born in a poor African-American city and became blind at age 7, but with his touch and hearing skills, that would later lead him to stardom. In the 1960s, he realized his dream, selling albums in millions and leading the charts with songs and albums. But the story also showed his downfall, including the separation of his wife and son, because of his affair with a band member, his use of drugs and alcohol, and going to jail because of that.
