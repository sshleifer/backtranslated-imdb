Hard Justice is a great action movie! The whole movie is nothing but shots and fights, but it has a very good vampire plot! For people who say they do not shoot ups and fight with movies like they usually do. Well, this one is really hard-core! Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is excellent and his character is very cool in the movie. Nicholas Guest was very kind and he will undoubtedly steal the show! He really presents himself as a fantastic villain! Melanie Smith was also good. I think this pretty actress is very underestimated. Michael Cavanaugh was good. It was really cool to see Vince Murdocco in this movie! As for the action, it's really amazing with all the fights of weapons and the super cool fight scenes. The fight in this photo is really one of the biggest I've ever seen! There is so much that happens at runtime of 86 minutes. For action fans, you'll be delighted with all the firepower and superb fighting this movie has to offer! Night Hunter is a movie that is not easy to locate and if you are in a video store and see it for sale, buy it because this movie is great guardian and more the box is cool! There is a ton of action that has to be seen to be believed! See and see if you can find some good deals on Ebay, Half.com, Z-Shops from Amazon.com and market vendors! In my opinion Night Hunter is one of the biggest fighting movies I've ever watched and the characters are so cool. If you like Don 'The Dragon' Wilson and want to see Nicholas Guest perform well, I highly recommend that any fan of action films that loves movies, vampire movies and vampire movies, has been disappointed with other films that have a look at a real non stop action move but can not deliver it to buy Night Hunter today!
