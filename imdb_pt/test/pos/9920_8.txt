Opera opens with a photo very close to the eye of a bird, and so begins one of the most bizarre and pleasant features of Argento (my second favorite, in fact, behind Deep Red). Granted, sometimes the movie is quite absurd (the real lack of concern after murders, the bird attack, the dummy burned, it ends ??), but this is the fantastic world of Argento and once you get to a deal with it, you find it works. I do not want to completely ignore these flaws, but rather that the art of the film is more than compensating. For example, the bird attack mentioned above is completely exaggerated in theory, but see the wonderful execution of it; crows flying in the chaos, adding their enraged scream to the rock beat, the panicked crowd, seen through the camera work in panoramic view and then the focused attack; ter of terror, in fact. The incredible and fluent cinematography of Argento is in full display at the Opera, and clearly one of the highlights of the film. I also liked the soundtrack of operatic themes and rock music, a good contrast of music with each one used effectively (the rock comes into play with the murders at the perfect moment and gives the scenes a very frenetic feeling). The sound effects deserve a nod as well, stabbing, scissors, beaks and everything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " I think it's foolish to use movies as a guide to reality, you do not inspector? "Inspector Alan Santini:" It depends on what you mean by reality. " <br /> <br /> Since this is a giallo, stylish murders are a must and Dario does not disappoint (the "bullet through the door" scene is possibly one of the biggest killings ever, if you'll forgive the pun). The killer in black gloves, deep and pulsing voice (cold shots!) It is cold and brutal, and having him with pins under the eyes of our heroine, so that she was forced to watch the murders was a nice touch. That said, like a giallo, Opera does not have a mystery as good as it should. The killer is kept secret from the audience well enough, but there is little effort in the film dedicated to actually solving the murders. That and the odd ending could have used more work. Despite these problems, Opera still manages to be a useful and satisfying horror film. <br /> <br /> One final note: it was good to see a movie, for once, show the correct view through binoculars (just a circle, not two circles together)! Good eye for detail, Dario!
