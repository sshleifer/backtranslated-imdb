Warning, contains spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Italian films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot has a teenager interested in occultism and has supernatural powers. . His mother is a member of the Satanic group and is afraid of influences that will have on the girl. No need to worry, the girl knows exactly what to do and there is no return, she belongs to Satan .. <br /> <During the movie, strange things happen in a typical way, there is not much logic, but that's just a good thing. It's amazing how funny these movies are. In the final battle, we see her and her mother fighting each other. of course) and by doing some mysterious rituals, you can guess who wins ... The final photos of the movies leave your mouth open and wandering why there can not be more movies like this? <br /> <br /> There is great music throughout the movie and the actors are very good, better than usual in these types of movies.
