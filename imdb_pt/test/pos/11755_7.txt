This movie will likely be very sentimental for many viewers, especially for the contemporary audience. However, I enjoyed this film thanks mainly to the realistic charm of William Holden, one of my favorite stars, and the stunning beauty of Jennifer Jones. There are some really exciting scenes between the couple and the talent of these two actors rescues what, in smaller hands, could have been trivial lines. The cinematography of Hong Kong from the filming period is another highlight of this film. All in all, a romantic drama better than average, 7/10.
