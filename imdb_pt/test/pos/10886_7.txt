This game has cartoon graphics, not much violence and really short levels - so why do people say it's so brilliant?!? Because it always holds your attention, captivates you and refuses to let go! You'll try for hours trying to find that damn flight recorder, trying to figure out how to get into the room without alerting the guards, etc! The levels are short only when you know what to do - until, you will spend hours trying to figure out where to find matches, where to find helicopters and so on! And you're going to have fun all the time doing it! It's worth renting!
