John Huston made many memorable and memorable films. The most frequently and easily remembered were released long before his death in 1987. It was this year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game, as evidenced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novel The Dead. "A long time ago, a very wise man named Doc asked me," Does not the Dead seem remarkably livelier and brighter than any other story in Dubliners? "I usually think it is. story as the film contains some comments and criticism from Joyce's society, but most often paint a warm and loving portrait of an Irishman, Joyce, who often criticized him and soon left. Huston's behavior of the protagonist Gabriel Conroy, who realizes that the world sees him as nothing more than an illusion, is simply remarkable. To say that the film has no plot is to lose the point.As with any of the Dubliners of Joyce , the plot - though certainly present - is not the focus.The plot is merely a tool for transporting the epiphany of the protagonist.In addition to an apparent lack of action, there is frankly little dialogue in Joyce's story for the director to lean on. Huston capacity of translating what Joyce puts into words into pictures is possibly the greatest triumph of the film. Feelings, thoughts ... The discomfort of Gabriel during the dance ... all these intangible elements give life and are within reach of the viewer in the portrait of Huston. <br /> <br /> To claim that Huston slowed down his writer's criticism of society, he missed the mark. While "The Dead" can be painted with a cheerful tone, the complacency and pretension of the characters in the film is only a comment on society on a smaller scale: we are the old aunts; the embarrassing drunk; the tenor with sore throat; the wife with the sad, rain-soaked secret; even the self-deceived middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> But "The Dead" belies the title. It's not a dark story. It's not even that sad. Forget for a moment the snow falling on the living and the dead and the symbolism inherent in it; forget the chaos of a life that Gabriel awakens at the end of the film: it is only with the destruction of Gabriel's illusions of himself and his world that he can really move on. This is the central point of the film. This is the central point of our lives.
