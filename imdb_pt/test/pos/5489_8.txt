Wolfgang Peterson's film, In the Line of Fire, is astute and sometimes a truly white ride, even if once or twice we feel like we have walked similar roads before. How could anyone not when Clint Eastwood, shortly after (supposedly) closing the book on his Western legacy, probably closes the one in his detective pictures (do not count Blood Work there). But there's more to it than this, because Eastwood's character here, a hard-working, butler-hardened, hard-and-nail-like agent, has a rather charming side to him, to the most romantic side never seen in the photos in which he gushed his trademark lines. There are some complexities going on here that do not just depend on the usual arrogance, and it's noteworthy how a possibly planned later story (which did not save Kennedy from being murdered in '63) is made a little believable in the middle of the rest. of his persona, which more than likely hides his wounds most of the time. Eastwood goes to the city to become a major presence in the film, however, and under the circumstances, the character seems tailor made for him. <br /> <br /> But there is a risk that your participation in the film may be slightly conventional (we still make the 'Harry' scenes more intelligent of him - and as clever as everyone else in the room, and being scolded and sent back by the upper echelons, here a team leader), including here protecting a president who (wisely) never really sees or knows. Even the romantic sub-plot, which is kind of undercooked if there were laughter of machismo, would make the image a little below average if Harry's other quasi-dirty look did not come on the scene: an indelible villain. This time around, there's some extra suspense from Hollywood, no matter how clever the suspense (almost smarter than the rest of the film deserves), with the character "John Booth", played by John Malkovich as Oscar nominee, as someone described like a predator. than a murderer. There are ways that this can go wrong with the character of Eastwood, but Malkovich possibly defeats some of his old villains being extremely cool and uncollected (there is that devastating scene where he kills the bank teller and his roommate), and as his past is revealed, there's still that "what the hell with this guy" element that keeps the audience and Eastwood's agent guessing and paranoid too. It is a classic performance of Malkovich, quintessentially scary and always measured on the level of insanity and professionalism. <br /> <br /> It is also, in addition to the conventional spots, just a well made photo of Peterson and company, and they come in very well. close to Don Siegel's courageous pulp realism. But Peterson also has a couple of cinematic tricks up his sleeve that made me smile at times; whenever someone does such a striking but exciting homage to Vertigo - jumping from roof to roof, the hero hanging at the edge, the 'twist' - this still causes shivers down the spine. There are also phone conversations between Eastwood and Malkovich, where we see the depths of the game of cat and mouse, probably another kick in the ribs for Hithcock. But in the end, even with all the brutal excitement and danger and crisp formalism in the climax, it is also an image of characters in some respects, and everything is reasonably accomplished to give the public a fair amount to ponder on, at least in the direction of the film of suspense. Eastwod is a great protagonist, Russian interprets the possible sincere and mature female love interest, and Malkovich is the best of pops. There are also some noteworthy supporting roles as well, and a good score in the studio. One of the best films of 1993.
