This movie was well done, but it also made me feel very down sometimes as well. For anyone who is considering show business this is a must see as it shows the brute deal in what goes on for these workers struggling. The soundtrack was definitely cool and the acting and dancing complemented very well. Some of the students' attitudes may have been a bit exaggerated like Leroy's, especially since I'm sure someone like that would have been kicked out immediately for refusing to read and such, if that was the real High School for Performing Arts. The Coco screen test is difficult to watch for anyone out there with weak stomachs, please heed my warning. Although it's very brave, I know it's the truth about what happens, so in that regard, the movie is right. Overall, it's fun and, although some parts crawl, most go very fast. <br /> <br /> Ultimate Clustering: <br /> <br /> Movies: Probably would have skipped that. <br /> <br /> Buy on DVD: It's not something I need to see again and again. <br /> <br /> Rent: It pays to rent at least once in your life!
