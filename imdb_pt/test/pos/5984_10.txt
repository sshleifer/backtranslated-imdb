This is one of my favorite movies; a delightful comedy; so I was thrilled to learn that it's about to be released on DVD in the UK in September 2007. <br /> <br /> Romuald, played by Daniel Auteuil is a wealthy president of a dairy company. Juliette, played by the excellent Firmine Richard, is a cleaner of the company's offices in Paris. Juliette, the black mother of several children, discovers a plot against Romuald, who initially ignores his attempts to warn him. Slowly he realizes what this charming lady of the Parisian lower class has been trying to tell him. 'he seeks shelter in his crowded apartment when his marriage and career collapses. An unlikely love blossoms. Cultures collide with what is a cheerful and truly delicious comedy.
