A teen movie about anguish, friendship, loyalty and growth? but this is not a happy ride on your part due to the circumstances and dilemmas that change life around the premise. What happens is very numbing, haunting and downright cold. However, I was expecting something a bit more powerful and effective and, while engaging and unforgettable, did not arouse much in terms of emotions. The performances are reasonably a mixed bag, but there is a brutal honesty for all of them. Dennis Hopper and especially Daniel Roebuck are awesome ?? Crispin Glover's eccentric does this, and Keanu Reeves, killed as a wooden turn, seems to compensate in his role of negligent. Joshua John Millar is very good and Ione Skye too. Jim Metzler gives a short but highly engaging presentation. The story is dramatically confrontational, cluttered by characters and distressing in its final collapse, where it infuses a coarse and painful punch. The soundtrack of JÃ¼rgen Knieper is boiling with anxiety, tension and admiration as morals and compromises are tested and learned.
