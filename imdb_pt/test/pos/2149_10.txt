I saw this movie in Santa Monica on August 23rd and it stayed with me. I want to thank the filmmakers for investigating the details of Harry's enigmatic and eccentric life. And also by showing the flaws and failures of Nilsson, the man. Thanks for showing you what's good and bad, the ups and downs, and for discovering that amazing footage from the BBC. The film is also a great showcase of a lot of Nilsson songs, nicely placed throughout the film. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes good documentaries, especially if you are interested in Harry Nilsson or the early 70s music scene. A reviewer of the Is not It Cool website wrote that this was the best movie they saw in Santa Barbara Film Festival, and I believe that. The film is informative, funny, sad, touching and full of incredible music. He is successful on all levels. Really very good.
