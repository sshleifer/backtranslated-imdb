Although Disney has been the animation studio of the last 70 years, there have always been rivals in its supremacy. When that review was written in 2009, for example, companies like Dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) Warner Brothers and Ardman were releasing animated films that could challenge Disney's dominance. Back in the beginning, in the late 1930s and early '40s, when Disney was serving film banquets like Snow White, Dumbo and Fantasia, the competition was hosted by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer. Despite launching two highly commendable films, have they never cornered the market? Many attribute its downfall to the commercial failure of Bug Goes To Town, released the same week of the attack on Pearl Harbor (which gave the American public something more important to think than going to the movies to watch a cartoon!). the film faded into relative obscurity is a scam. <br /> <br /> In a piece of bush-covered garden in the city, a lot of insects are in extreme danger. Humans use the land as a shortcut, discarding litter and cigars, and other dangers, right on top of insect houses as they go. The honey shop owner, Mr. Bumble (voiced by Jack Mercer) fears that the future is bleak, and wonders how he could raise his daughter Honey (dubbed by Pauline Loth) in a safer environment. A highly unscrupulous creature, Bagley C. Beetle (dubbed by Tedd Pierce), offers her a safer place to live if she accepts his hand in marriage, but Honey is much more interested in her childhood love, the everlasting joy and optimistic. Hoppity (voiced by Stan Freed). Hoppity believes that everything is about to be solved for the better, but it seems foolish when Bagley Beetle and his pair of comic helpers manipulate the crisis to their own dishonest end. Just in the end, as the patch becomes the basis for a huge new skyscraper, insects switch loyalty back to Hoppity as they seek to take them to a safe new home away from the destructive influence of beings humans. > <br /> What really works in this movie is the delightful characterization? All bugs are cleverly developed and designed for maximum public appeal. The clumsy villains Swat the fly and Smack the Mosquito (hilarious names, if you stop to think about it) are particularly memorable. Equally admirable is story-telling? even the youngest of children can appreciate this story, while cleverly conveying a message to the older audience about how human carelessness can affect the survival of wildlife. Time has inevitably dated from some aspects of the film, and in viewing it, the audience has to accept (and forgive) those occasional signs of general age and wear. But overall, Mr Bug Goes To Town is a complete, fun and very well presented animation with a message worthy of being used.
