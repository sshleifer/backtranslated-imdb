Farscape is the best science fiction show, for one main reason, everything the show tries, does very well. From a technical aspect, the music is original and perfectly adjusted to the show. The special effects are abundance and higher quality then almost anything else you will see on your tv. The acting is also great, many shows nowadays use only the American market of actors for their shows. Remember the first time you saw Matrix and you said, where did Agent Smith come from? It's the same feeling you see Claudia Black, Anthony Simcoe, Lani Tupu, Virginia Hey, and especially Wayne Pygram. These Australians are great and show up at this great show. <br /> <br /> The plot is unparalleled. The next closest thing I can think of is in Babylon 5 during the episodes of the Shadow Wars, but that goes way beyond that. It is a real pleasure to be able to watch all the episodes in sequence again, the intricacies of the interpersonal relations of the characters are well scripted and executed. The overall plot is original and completely entertaining. I'm always looking forward to the next show. <br /> <br /> The comedy episodes are funny, the episodes of drama are touching, and the action sequences are tense. The beginning of the second season had some great comedic episodes that made me laugh out loud, something that rarely happens by watching television other than South Park, Sealab 2021 or Seinfeld. The drama is even more difficult, if Crichton is meeting his mother or if the characters face their mortality, everything is done with heart and intensity. Lastly, it goes without saying that the action is maximal. This is science fiction. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of science fiction, if you like a good television, if you like a good serialized plot, you should note the Farscape. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Ben Browder owns it.
