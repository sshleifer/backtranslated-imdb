"Autumn Spring" talks about the misadventures of a 78-year-old Czech man with a walrus and walrus face who vaguely confuses and pleases everyone who knows him with his malicious ways while his wife meticulously plans her funeral. The centerpiece Hana (Brodsk√Ω) shows us how to make children kiss you when you're 78 and how to cling to an elevator and thank for it as it plays with it day after day in that warm and bright look of old age and creative ways , fun but socially unacceptable of a man to enjoy life, refusing to be relegated to the home of the old. "Autumn Spring" is a light and subtle comedy with messages for all ages, which will have the biggest appeal among amateurs of more mature foreign films. (B +)
