Who does not love muppets?! Impossible is to watch them without feeling some kind of warm and confused feeling inside. So, I think the important thing is that this movie seemed to capture very successfully what makes muppets so special. I do not remember much of the details of the plot, but of the various moments and characters of the film that I remember with great affection. In fact, there was a pretty nostalgic atmosphere throughout the movie, but not being badly self-conscious. Refreshing to someone who possibly gets too attached to detail and meticulous techniques; "magic" transcends all other things. It's really what movies are made of. <br /> <br /> So how does the movie get these things? Hmmm, good question! Am I stumped? We will see. Really, I feel it's pretty simple. Filmmakers believe in their material and do not take themselves too seriously in the process. I probably would not say that the film has many truly inspired moments, but it does have a certain life (which oddly enough many "real people" movies do not have). An enthusiasm. You really want to believe in these funny people and your adventures. They also have a certain innocence about them, which makes them even more enjoyable. Generally I have the impression that the people who made the film simply were not afraid to try whatever they thought was right for them. time that gives the whole thing quite a loose feeling. Kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session. A lot of talent, a little predictability and a lot of warm personality. The apparitions were, of course, a lot of pleasant surprises, for example. Maybe I do not feel like I have a lot to say about it because I was half asleep when I saw (and / or how I write this review). Anyway, I'm kind of repeating myself here, but I really liked the sense of family the movie had. Full of love, I suppose you can say. Again, a sense of nostalgia comes to mind, which not many movies can achieve so effectively or effortlessly. <br /> <br /> And to repeat myself once again, one of the best charms of the film is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Like Nathaniel Hawthorne's quote about happiness being (as) a butterfly, the movie Muppet is partially successful for not seeming to try to do so. Even with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or not forced or something like that. Anyway, if this sounds sweet, I also think it was pretty hilarious. <br /> <br /> So, after all, this movie was very funny, touching and difficult not to smile. Plus, it has a lot of great music! Highly recommended for all humans, both young and young at heart.
