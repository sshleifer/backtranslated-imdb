I watched every doctor that episodes that my local PBS station played while growing up (was introduced to the doctor by John Pertwee) as well as "camera copies" of doctors who sent to America by fans from the UK to their counterparts in the USA. . I had so much fun with the show, but it never seemed to take it seriously - I mean as seriously as a science fiction show about a time traveler could be. I went to the NCOs, did the little outfit (doctor # 5,6 and Tegan were my fantasy characters), I loved it. then everything stopped suddenly. program policy and lack of interest and funding have turned the doctor into an antiquity of 25 years that has entered the ethos. When I learned that the science fiction channel had chosen the new doctor, my first thought was, "cool, now my 11-year-old son can see what I've been babbling about all these years, and I know what the heck is a TARDIS "(I have several phone boxes and TARDISES of various sizes around the house) I didn expect the excellent story quality, character development and f / x. I was saying the least - satisfied. For the first time, I met a doctor who was not a cranky, a clown, a fool, a travel head, a cunt, or an idiot. Christopher Eccleston is by far the most credible doctor to date. Now, calm down the baker's fans! do not get me wrong, I loved almost all the doctors and their quirks, but Christopher gave something to the doctor he never had before - credibility of real words. I'm just sad that he decided against another season. I'll try out David Tennant like I would with any other doctor, but now the bar has gone up ... Bad wolf rules !!!!! <br /> <br /> 2008 Update - I Love David Tennant! your persona "mod" is something my generation remembers, my son's generation can handle, and the gestapo fashion can relax! he's a little more human than Christopher, but not as humas as other former doctors. I miss the rose, I dig martha, and what they were thinking with noble donna!?!? It's still the best tour on TV.
