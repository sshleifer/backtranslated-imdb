I wanted to see this movie since the previous ones were released. I do not understand why everyone is so hard on this movie. It may not all be technically true to the sport of rugby, but this film is not primarily about the sport. It's about a rugby team that is taught to be more than the world expects from them. They are taught to become men and not to the temporarily vain boys. Hollywood is never 100% correct in its productions. They are there to make a product that sells. Something fun. The history of Coach Gelwix and what he has taught over the years is simply incredible. He teaches about service, honor, integrity, and moral cleanliness. How many other movies are teaching this to our youngsters these days? I was proud to see such an incredible story that it taught reverence and respect.
