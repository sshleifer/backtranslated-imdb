Samuel Fuller knows the war and is one of the only directors of the history of the North American cinema that was able to accurately portray the horrible experiences in a form like the film. His pessimism and idealism, if this sounds a little strange to mingle, work for him as a storyteller and at the same time he is always ready to tell the truth, however brutal (or placed in melodramatic constructions) that he can get. Verboten, however, deals with the postwar experience, since we only have in the opening scenes the great boom of war - in bold by a point. The opening scene is like a big exclamation point that seems to continue in the rest of the scenes: a soldier dead on the floor, the camera closing, we see another soldier shot down on a war-torn terrain. Simple and direct language. Then Fuller scores the intensity with something interesting: the title song played by the opening credits as irony and sincerity, and then Beethoven's music about a gunfight between Americans and Nazis. Sergeant David Brent (James Best) is shot, the battle continues, and then he moves to him being treated for his wounds. <br /> <br /> It may lead someone to believe that this will be a somewhat conventional movie from World War II. (in a way, in general, one would not find Beethoven and, later, to a certain extent, Wagner placed in these images), but this is not the case. Instead, Fuller makes this kind of film "Coming Home," though not at all, in the sense that "this soldier comes home injured and so on." Instead of actually going home, Brent stays in Germany, as he is fallen upside down to the woman, Helga (Susan Cummings, very good at taking the German accent), and wants to work in a smaller capacity in the military, so he can marry her. What he does not realize is that: a) she wants him more for money to get food for herself and for the brother, however this gets emotionally complex at the point of revelation for the slightly naive but sincere Brent, and b) there is an underground A Hitler's youth sect has called the Werewolves, who want to get right to the point where Hitler ended up - starting small, despite discussions within the group - attacking the government itself now embedded in Germany to give them a "blood transfusion." "With this, in addition to filming the Nuremberg trials and (as narrated, I think, by Fuller himself) a swift, unpunished history of Nazi war crimes, piece by piece, we have a multifaceted view of a society. an immediate post-war environment.While Rossellini dealt his way with Germany Year Zero, Fuller approaches him in layers: first there is the love story, or what is the tragic fall of a man who can see nothing beyond what he Baker and Cummings, along with Harold Daye as the confused young brother of Helga, and his wife, and a child in the way he can not leave until the revelation that he was (partially) deceived. they present themselves with the most detail to the emotions, these are not very easy parts of the film B, although they may have been that. Then another layer is politics, the struggle of a society to face conquest, and a mentality that is made sen sion, of course, by Fuller, in order to make the Nazis a totally gray-free thing. : they are bad, particularly when they cancel the reason for achieving their goals. <br /> <br /> And finally there is the style layer, which is strangely absorbing. This is probably one of Fuller's "bolder" movies, which is not a bad thing, considering it is one of his best written scripts, since the characters do not speak simply or in many platitudes (except for a small scene where two characters talk about Hitler's youth as juvenile delinquents, which is, according to Fuller's autobiography, probably another layer to be considered in the subtext and period of the 1950s films). And Fuller records this almost in a real European style when he's not going to fight scenes or battles, as the editing is not always very fast, and sometimes a cut will not happen for a whole minute or more. There is a strange tension that grows from this, especially when there is something said by a character who is left with another with wide-eyed or suspicious eyes; Fuller could easily go for a great close-up, but there is a sinister, cool quality to not get away from two people in a conversation without a simple agreement over the shoulder. But when that demands, such as the big fight outside the American military office, or the filming of Nuremberg combined with Franz's memories of the Werewolves, Fuller can be an impressive designer as ever. <br /> <br /> Very difficult to find, but it's worth it if you're a fan of the WWII director or WWII films set in Germany - or even just a Verboten! is a strong intellectual and emotional experience with a cast that is better than expected from a B movie and an attitude toward the "other" that is equally condemning and thought-provoking.
