"The Last Frontier" is a superior western that overcomes numerous shortcomings in weaving its tale of hunters Jed (Victor Mature), Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relations with the army . particularly Captain Riordon (Guy Madison), Colonel Marston (Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston, Colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft). Hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the Indians, Jed, Gus and Mungo adapt to live "civilized" life within a fort on the edge of the "last frontier." Jed, who was created by Gus, inspires and looks at the 'older' Gus and Mungo, and has a particularly difficult time dealing with 'civilization'. His real problems begin after he becomes strongly attracted to the Colonel's wife, Corrina. Colonel Marston is a reckless man who puts all those around him in danger with his dreams of relentless victory over any opponent. Corrina, a woman repressed for her position and sense of responsibility, loves her husband for what he could be and Jed for what he is. Stuck in the middle is Captain Riordon, a brave and sympathetic man torn between his duty to the army, his strong friendship with Jed, and his fear of the probable disastrous consequences of the Colonel's imprudence. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so interesting (and fun) is that in most cases the strengths and weaknesses of 'The Last Frontier' are EXACTLY the same elements (forget the tasteless title and the song dated First, the script Almost all the subplots (particularly the reckless colonel) were better elsewhere, but were rarely assembled with such eccentricity.Just when you think you know what will happen next, it takes off in a different direction. POSSIBLE SPOILER: `The Last Frontier 'being a' Production Code 'film (the word' virgin 'was once a taboo), it is very surprising that the adultery factor has been treated so mature and tolerant I hoped that Jed or the colonel's wife would take some retribution for their sin.I was surprised and a bit disappointed that the film did not take this expectation to create a less predictable ending. <br /> <br /> Second place Madura is at least ten years old to play the role of Jed, the wide-eyed innocent created in the forest. James Whitmore, who plays Gus, "the man who created Jed" is five years younger than Mature. However, Mature is very nice, playing a character who is innocent of civilization, but is by no means stupid. Although there were several actors who could have played the role at the time (most notably Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas), none could have interpreted Jed better. Preston (also Maduros junior) plays Colonel Marston, missing the tics and affections one would expect from such a motivated man. However, Preston perfectly captures the sense of honor one must have seen in Marston to promote such a reckless fool to the rank of colonel. Bancroft is a particularly insightful choice like Corrina. Bancroft's black hair died blondes, and this produces the same effect as Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands) and Christina Ricci (Sleepy Hollow). That is, I felt conflicted about the character without knowing exactly why; I believe the answer is that blondes and brunettes have skin tones and considerably different eye tones. In addition, Bancroft has always designed a resistance that borders the hardness (here the blonde hair softens a little, however). This allows Bancroft, 24, to come face to face with 40-year-old Mature and 37-year-old Preston; yes, she could be the wife of a colonel. Madison does a careful balancing act like Riordan, dealing with a complex role and sometimes with embarrassing dialogues. Playing a role similar to that of John Wayne in "Fort Apache" Madison does a more skillful job in this. <br /> <br /> The movie has a "Silverado" camaraderie. That alone is worth seeing. It also has memorable performances, beautiful scenes and great action and direction. I just hope that a letterbox version is available (many have been lost) because this movie takes full advantage of this format.
