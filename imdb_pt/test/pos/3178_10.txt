Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool / e or channel that opened the young minds of Black Culture. Focus and perspective were a message of positivity for our people and hope for change. I advise this selection for every American home to experience the fight and the reward. The show never had a chance to thrive on the idea of ​​middle-class blacks becoming business owners. The issue was so compatible with the real-life situation that it affected the lives of many. I sincerely hope that the entire volume can be restored and put on DVD for Americans to enjoy with their families. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
