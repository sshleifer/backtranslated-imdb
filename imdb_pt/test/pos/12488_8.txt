A pleasant and humorous mix of music hall (in the first third mainly) and procedural mystery of the police, as the stories of the various suspects begin to crumble. The final exposure of the murder may be a surprise if you do not pay attention. A bold look at Paris of the time. You can ignore the final scene (the end of Hollywood). Louis Jouvet is better as the police inspector who seems to be just passing through, but is really on top of things.
