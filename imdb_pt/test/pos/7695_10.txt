I was 13 years old when I saw this very little appreciated movie at The ADAMS theater in Newark, NJ, I bought the program, and later bought the soundtrack ... still have the two .... I am now 55 + years. and I have not seen it since (possibly once on the TV network, in the 1960s ???) One of the biggest cast ever, great soundtrack and production, please let another generation see this great movie ... It was my introduction to the opera, and aided by my understanding of tolerance .. Please family of Gerswhins or Premingers, release this classic soon!
