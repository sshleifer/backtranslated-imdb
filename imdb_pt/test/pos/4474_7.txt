The story begins with a soldier being transported to a deserted town and then back in time to tell the story of how he got to that place. He began as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt, but separated from his unit. After nearly starving and / or dying of thirst, he encountered a leopard that somehow became his chest partner. This brought him food, and in no time the soldier became almost totally wild, so sharp was his attachment to the animal. All things are over and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the animal. A very strange film, well written and portrayed. Beautiful landscapes of Jordan and Utah, which do not always blend perfectly, but who cares.
