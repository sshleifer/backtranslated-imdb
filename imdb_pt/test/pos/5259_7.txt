Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) a wealthy woman discovers that her husband is cheating on her with a younger woman (Eva Mendes). She does not know what to do and friends Sylvia Fowler (Annette Bening), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing) and Alex Fisher (Jad Pinkett Smith) try to help. <br /> <br /> OK - there was no reason to redo the 1939 film. This is a true classic and does not need to be updated and redone. Of course it was done. This has gotten some of the worst reviews I have ever seen for a movie. I love the original and have seen it many times - I was constantly comparing it to it. Now this is not a classic, but it's not that bad. <br /> <br /> ** SMALL SPOILERS !!! ** First the bad - the story is old and was (poorly) updated. Really - a man cheating on his wife is hardly shocking today. Meg Ryan (a wonderful actress) is very terrible here. Your face seems unable to change the expression! I could not believe how bad some of his scenes came from. Eva Mendes is bad too - but it's not totally her fault. Her role is poorly written and she has to compete with the original Joan Crawford. Smith's character (a tough lesbian) collapses in an operating room. It's funny ... but it's showing that a strong woman breaks instantly when facing an emergency. Also the script inserts some awkward passages where Ryan talks with the daughter about being yourself. In those moments, it seems more like a movie in life than anything else. <br /> <br /> Now, the good - this movie maintains the decision of the originals to NEVER show a man on the screen. This movie is about and for women - men are not needed (BTW - I am a man). Bening is great as Fowler - whenever she's on screen, the movie takes a big leap. Also Smith is simply wonderful - she does not overdo (or underestimate) her lesbian character. Stirring is good too, but it is not in this. Bette Midler is just hysterical in a small role and Cloris Leachman plays the role of nothing of a maid. The direction is also good - especially during a string of fashion shows. I heard that the director Diane English supposedly had many problems in directing her first feature film, but that does not appear in the final product. There are also some smart references to the original (especially certain lines) that were inserted without problems. <br /> <br /> I saw this in an audience full of women (there were some guys, but not many) and they loved it. The movie ends in an operating room sequel that made everyone howl. So - this was not necessary, but it is not the disaster that people are saying it is. Also, people are saying we do not need a movie with all women. Well, why not? I see a lot of movies with all the guys in the cast and no one complains about it! Ignore the complaints and negative reviews and see this. With a better performance from Ryan, I could have given an 8 or 9, but, as it is, I can only give a 7.
