A refreshing black comedy starring some of Australia's finest. Just as Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels captured the funny side of London gangsters, Two Hands rips Sydney's underworld. It would not be so funny if it were not so close to the bone. <br /> <br /> An Australian classic. If Australia could get more rabbits like this, it could have a movie industry worth watching.
