This movie was baked by the boys of MST3K, but in fact it's a clean and nasty piece of low-budget movie noir. The plot is tight, the characters are believable (within the good-boy-gets-obsessed-with-bad-girl genre), the rhythm is solid, the climax is well treated, and the cast is reinforced by several characters . It is true that most of the time you want to hit the protagonist with a brick, but he is really quite scary when he plays with the brain. The scenes between him and his father are quite powerful, in a minimalist way. Of course it's depressing, but that's the point. Good movie.
