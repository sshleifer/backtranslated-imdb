Fire gives everything ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most magisterial meditations in the film about art. Set in nineteenth-century Korea, it tells the story of the famous painter Ohwon, but instead of focusing on spicy anecdotes, melodrama or psychological hunting for eggs, portrays a series of episodes throughout his life that are beautiful artwork in themselves. . It gives no interpretation of these episodes, but leaves them for the viewer to ponder along with Ohwon's own paintings. In this way, the spectator enters the same kind of contemplation that Ohwon, and, less his talent, can "feel" his way to the inspiration of his paintings. <br /> <br /> Part of the reason this is so effective is the totally masterful evocation of 19th-century Korea and the musical / artistic world in which Ohwon moved. There are so many beautiful pictures of the world outside the paintings that we get a mirror effect where we see the wonderful world inspiring Ohwon, Ohwon living and looking for this world and the works of art he creates, all mirroring each other. <br /> <br /> History is told with extreme economy. An evoked feeling is hardly time consuming or explained, it only appears quickly and disappears for the next to appear. As an analogy, it is a kind of Mozartian work of art (an endless and rapid succession of great ideas) rather than a work by Beethovin (obsessive persistent in a grand idea). It has a classical restraint, very similar to Ohwon's paintings. There is really no song hinting at how it feels, except for some classic Korean pieces used with great effectiveness in various scenes (and mostly played by characters in the film). A scary image, if I remember correctly, is a flock of birds flying over the blue mountains, while a singer sings, "This life is like a dream, and only death will wake us up." A line of advice in the film, from one of the teachers of Ohwon, is that "the painting is among the blows". The film follows this attitude, as there is much matter between what is spoken and described in the film. I've seen it twice and it was very gratifying at the second exhibit. A very concise film, with little in the way of explanation, you can see what Im's 96th film is like. It is an artistic work of art. As Ohwon's great friend and mentor tells him in describing one of his paintings, "Not a single blow is wasted." <br /> <br /> I compare this with Andrei Rubylev in quality, although in style it is very different. It's much easier and more directly entertaining to watch, but in a classic way where Andrei is goth. <br /> <br /> All in all highly recommended for almost anyone, except addicts. The two times I left the film, I felt a wonderful spiritual renewal. One point in Ohwon's life that intrigued me was that his crazy drink and delirium began suddenly after visiting the nobleman who told him that "art can only come from great knowledge and learning." In the next short scene, Ohwon became very angry, and the next drunk was often in the remainder of the film. I'm curious because the noble words affected him so much and led him to the drink that dominated the rest of his life. Or was it just a coincidence?
