Jack Webb is fascinating as a DRI Marines instructor .. Webb play Sgt.Jim Moore, a tough but fair Marine whose job it is to prepare young teenagers for a possible fight. No one could have played that role any better than Jack Webb. As a former Marine, I can assure you that this is the most accurate film that handles basic training at Corp. Extremely fun!
