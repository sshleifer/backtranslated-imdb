The movie was very good. I am an avid fan of mystery and I usually find out who is going to be killed and who killed. Although I discovered who would be killed, I did not find out who did it. I was not happy with the portrayal of the character Gerda, but given the year the film was supposed to take place, it's possible the woman was so "naughty". Please know that while these Poirot films are good, they do not have the same dynamics as the series, because they do not have Japp, Ms. Lemon and especially Hastings! David Suchet is definitely Poirot. I saw all the actors who played him. The worst was Peter Ustinov!
