I heard about this movie a long time ago and finally found it on eBay for five dollars. I was not expecting much, but wow, I was surprised. It's a story of a boy and a girl in love trying to escape an evil king who wants the girl for himself and takes place in a huge castle, reminds me of ICO for PS2 because some shots gave him a vertigo. This movie is insane! It is hard to believe that such an original animation was made in 1952. Moreover, the king was probably one of the most frightening characters I have ever seen, with a female walk, strange eyes (usually crossed), and a soft, but a scary voice. The only problem I had with the film was that the boy and the girl had no personality or lines, except for calling Mr. Wonder (A big green talking bird) to save them. The animation was fantastic in most areas, but some cells were missing in some scenes that sucked. It's unbelievably original with flying cops and giant mechas and even laughing out loud sometimes, it's a pity that this is such a dark title, because it's really a good movie. Check it out sometime.
