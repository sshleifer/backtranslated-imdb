It's a good movie in Vienna about a taxi driver, Toni (Donald Buka), who steals the identity of a passenger when the passenger is shot while sitting in the back of his cabin. This gives him an identity, since he is an illegal immigrant, but he needs to play the victim until he takes a flight to the US with a ticket on behalf of the victim. Mrs. Manelli (Joan Camden) scolds him, but she is accused of having mental problems by her husband, Claude (Francis Lederer), a concert pianist. As a result, Toni is off the hook. Claude does not want to separate from his wife, but she runs away from him. There are several twists and turns and eventually Toni and Mrs. Manelli run together - both are trying to escape their lives in Vienna. There is a tense and exciting buildup in the end. Will they stay away ..... ?? ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the picture quality is not fantastic and there is a line that runs through the middle of the image for a while. The cast is very good in their roles, especially the portrait of Claude by Francis Lederer. Also important to the story is Heinth (Manfred Inger) as the owner of the taxi company, Marie (Inge Konradi) as Toni's girlfriend and the inspector (Hermann Erhardt). <br /> <br /> It's a good movie.
