Wow, "The Curse of Michael Myers" what a great movie. Suspense, fun, creative and a clever plot that I love. Many hate the concept of 'Thorn', I love it. I think this gives the Halloween series some plot. Marianne Hagan is a wonderful actress and turns into great performance especially for her first film and Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence are also great. My only complaint is why Danielle Harris was not in this movie like Jamie? She wanted to come back, but the producers said no. I thought J. Brandy was great, but I love Danielle Harris. Still, I love Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. I think The Shape mask looks the best in this movie and George P. Wilbur is the best Michael Myers of all time. Incredibly scary and suspenseful, Halloween 6 rules! <br /> <br /> I love this very violent but hugely enjoyable movie. The Halloween horror series - by far the best of the genre. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
