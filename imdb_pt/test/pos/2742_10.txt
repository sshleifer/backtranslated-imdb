This Academy Award-winning short film has spawned two sequels and a cartoon program, with minimal animations, but an insightful script (by Theodore Geisel, also known as Dr. Seuss) and an even more memorable and charming main character. UPA pioneered a style of animation that even influenced Disney in the mid-1950s and produced some of the best animated shorts made in the late 1940s and 1950s. This is one of their best. God to have it in print. Highly recommended.
