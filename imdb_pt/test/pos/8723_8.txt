As much as I like Walter Matthau, I felt that most of his roles were adapted to his personality. This role is one of the exceptions. He plays a dentist who is both charming and dishonest. This role requires much more acting than in most of its other roles. I liked the fact that the movie was honest about how a professional can be dishonest in order to avoid compromise in a relationship. His goal was to find a way to relate to a much younger woman, but not to be compromised in any way. The alibi - using his secretary (Ingrid Bergman) to pretend to be his wife. At some point in the movie, the feigned Mr. and Mrs. are actually deluded into believing that they really were really married. The ending was good because a middle-aged man found that chasing someone in his own age group was more valuable. The film was funny, fun and not exhausted by being a preacher.
