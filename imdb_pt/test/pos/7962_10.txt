This is undoubtedly one of the most accomplished debut movies for any director. The film is only 90 minutes long, but it can say almost everything about life and death. There is not much action, and dialogue is minimal, but the film flows perfectly and demands your attention because of the wonderfully natural feel of everything that is going on. The performances of the protagonists are perfect, and even some supporting characters have strong emotional scenes. The movie will be a little lost in today's modern audience, but this is one that everyone should see. Absolutely sentimental and honest, this is on the same level as Ozu's works. <br /> <br /> Scratch my title, this is perfect!
