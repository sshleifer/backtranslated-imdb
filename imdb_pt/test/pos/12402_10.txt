I just watched the DVD version of BORN BAD and found it to be tense, dirty and, near the end, very graphic for the faint of heart. Justin Walker (no concept) and Corey Feldman saw top performances. For a low-budget movie, this photo is displayed. Character depth and intelligent dialogue are two things not normally seen in a Roger Corman image. Check it out on DVD!
