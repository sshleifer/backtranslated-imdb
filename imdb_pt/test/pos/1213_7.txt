Wrestlemania 6, is a fun Wrestlemania, if not totally successful. The Ultimate Challenge, of course, is worth the price of admission alone, but again, as with many of the early Mania, there is a lot of padding between them. The crowd appears for almost everything and, as always, gives us the trustworthy Gorilla & The Body announcing team. Having a Face vs Face game as the main event for a Wrestlemania was absolutely unheard of at the moment, it just made things a lot more tense. <br /> <br /> Games. <br /> <br /> Koko B. Ware / W Frankie Vs "The Model" Rick Martel. For a match of 3 or more minutes, that's as good as it gets. I wanted it to be a little longer, but what I got was pretty good. Martel wins with the Boston Crab. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Tag Team Championship. Demolition Vs Colossal Connection | C | / W Bobby Heean. Huge Pop Pop for demolition. The game itself is very annoying, I often had difficulty paying attention. Andre really did not do much, so in a way it was more like a 2 in 1. There is a solid talent involved here, and it's a shame they could not produce better. The demolition wins those titles, with the Pattened maneuver off the top. The crowd blows the roof to the floor. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Earthquake / W Jimmy Hart. Vs Hercules I got what I expected here, a standard annoying filling game, with earthquake doing its thing. I'm not really a fan of either, so it did not interest me much. Quake wins with his splash. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Brutus Beefcake Vs. Mr.Pefect / W The Genius. Pop deafening for Bruti. Very good game, unfortunately did not give enough time to further develop. He really kept my interest and remains one of my favorites on the card. Beefcake wins with a sling for the post, to great approval from the crowd. <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper Vs Bad News Brown. HUGE pop for Piper. Nothing more than a boring fight, which does not know what it wants to be. Some hilarious tricks from The Hot Rod, but nothing more. Of note to Roddy if he painted half black and called himself "Hot Scott" The Hart Vs The Bolshevik Foundation. Remember breaking, but other than that, nothing to see here. Harts win with, The Hart Attack. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Barbarian / W Bobby Heenan. Vs Tito Santana. Average for the time we stayed, but watchable, however. The crowd was dead enough for this, except for Heenan's interference. Jessie's hilarious gossip about Tito's food is more fun then the game itself. Barbarian wins with a nasty look and a flying clothesline. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> Mixed Tag Combination. Dusty and Sapphire / Elizabeth W. Vs Macho King & Sherri. Big pop for Dusty, and an even bigger one for Elizabeth, who looks absolutely stunning, I might add. I thought it was okay. It was lively, at least if nothing great. I'm not Dusty's fan then. Dusty and Sapphire win when She rolls Sherri. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> The Orient Express / W Fuji. You see the rockers. The crowd is quite anemic so, surprisingly. Decent no doubt, but with these guys involved, it should have been better. The constant focus with Fuji, somewhat harming the match. Express wins by counting out, while Janetty is nailed with salt. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> Jim Duggan vs. Dino Bravo / W & Jimmy Hart Earthquake. Duggan like an idiot, brings the American flag in Canada. Duggan gets some solid boo's so too, but this may also be due to Bravo's Canadian heritage. Crap game around, I do not care for Duggan, but that's not why I sucked. Too short at the end, to really matter. Duggan wins when he hits Bravo in the back with two to four. Duggan is sneezed by his problems. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> Million Dollar Championship. Ted Dibiase | C | / W Virgil. Vs Jake Robers / W Damien. Some slow points, but when all was said and done, I had fun. Two solid wrestlers giving it all there, resulted in a fun game. The crowd notoriously gets Ancy during parts of her, making the wave. Dibiase wins by counting. Jake has the last laugh, giving some of his money, to the delight of the crowd. <br /> <br /> Big Bossman Vs Akeem / W Slick. Good pop for The Bossman. Too routine, and too short to really mean anything, in the end. Akeem was a trick I never really liked. Bossman wins with his slam. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Rhythm & Blues segment was practically a failure. The crowd was not into it. <br /> <br /> Rick Rude / W Bobby Heenan. Vs Jimmy Snuka. For a filling match, before the main event, this was not so bad. If I had time to go more, it would have been great, for sure. Rude wins with Rude Awakening. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Title For Title. Ultimate Warrior Champion | Vs Hulk Hogan | WWF Champion | This is all about the atmosphere of the crowd, and the crowd's reaction divided, for the most part. Warrior has a pretty decent pop, but in my opinion it was a little below expected. Hogan dwarfs completely, with his. It's one of the best Wrestlemania games in history. With two people, who are not very well known for wrestling, they have managed to create an incredible game that has been talked about for a long time. I have seen this many times, and my level of respect grows higher for each one, for their effort, considering that I am not a fan of any of them. Even fanatic fanatics who crave pure wrestling can not complain! Warrior wins with his splash. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 6 is a fun entry if nothing is too special. It is memorable for the main event, the location and the crowd, but not the best if you ask me. That said, I like that, and I give my recommendation to wrestling fans. <br /> <br /> 7/10
