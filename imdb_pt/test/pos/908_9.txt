Stan Laurel considered PUTTING PANTS IN PHILIP as the first "true" L & H film. The second year was the first official L & H film, but this was the only one that Stan completely resigned himself to not only performing (he had signed with Hal Roach Studios as a director and 'gag-man' before certain situations including Oliver Hardy's accident with a leg of lamb that took Stan to replace him, and the extra money that performance would provide himself and his new wife, Lois - brought his historical return to performance as well as writing, editing, and involvement in other areas of production), but he also realized that he was part of a team that worked well in set. This, therefore, is a historical film and very important in the history of comedy. <br /> <br /> It's also a surprisingly funny little silent film; quite different from what Laurel and Hardy would become known for and what they are most immediately associated with today. The characters of Stan and Ollie do not appear - Scotsman Stan Laurel plays Oliver Hardy's nephew, a respectable town man who is reluctant to be seen with a strange-looking guy with a kilt and the habit of chasing pretty girls. There are some very funny moments in this small, well-made movie, and the performances of these two Kings of Comedy are perfect - watch Stan's little scissor-kick and the smile that says, "Well, waddaya know?" when he sees girls, or the frill scene at the airport, for example. Hilarious. Watch this movie if you can, with background music from the Beau Hunks Orchestra (available on VVL video releases), which enhances the 1920s feel and is very, very nice to hear. It's a brilliant and underrated little movie, and that's why I said it was 'surprisingly' funny.
