This show is my guilty pleasure all the way !! When I first entered America's Next Top Model, I expected to be bored and find this very stupid. I did not do. This show is really fun. I read in one of the other reviews that makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America Next's top model. And this happens! Who does not love the glamor and excitement that comes with being a role model? At ANTM, you can see how REALLY it is. And who does not like to hear the girls complaining to each other and getting into fights? Or do you want to play something with that Janice? <br /> <br /> Give it a chance. Do not expect something clever or a show you can look for for a life lesson. Just enjoy what it is. Serious fun!
