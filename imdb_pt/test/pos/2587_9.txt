Working in a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to basically watch all the movies that come out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, "Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' from the movie Samuel L Jackson." But of course, I wanted to see this by the laughing factor. Many people have judged this film very quickly based on the insinuation of the title, the images of the promotional ads and the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the movie. I personally loved every second of that movie. He tells the story of an older man and a young woman who are going through difficult times and are able to get closer to each other. The story is truly touching and sends a great message about life and how we live. Of course, I do not recommend it to young audiences because of some graphic material, but if you're looking for a great story and genuine acting from Sam Jackson, Christina Ricci and yes, even Justin Timberlake, I encourage you to watch 'Black Cobra Moan '.
