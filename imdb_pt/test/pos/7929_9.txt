This movie is one of the classics of film history. It was not meant to please the modern crowd, so some people nowadays may think it's squeaky or flushed. I thought I was absorbing everything. Cherkassov has the right presence to play with Alexander Nevskyi, as he did when he played Ivan Groznyi (Ivan the Terrible) several years later. The music was beautiful. <br /> <br /> My only complaint was the soundtrack that was quite distorted. Although I only know a little Russian, it would have been nice to be able to choose more words than to rely on almost 100% of the subtitles. I was watching this on an old videotape from the library, though. Maybe so far there is a DVD version in which sound has been improved. I wonder if the actors were using archaic Russian or even the old Church Slav when they spoke. The captions were strangely written, and it's hard for me to say whether this reflected an older way of speaking or if the captions were poorly made.
