1. I have seen Branaghs Hamlet: Branagh is very old, often speaks with a raucous voice (without funny will!) - not a convincing Hamlet, and his qualities of director - poor! (see also a lot of noise for nothing of Branagh - the funny parts of the dialogues were cut mainly not talking about the errors of directors in the dialogue cuts!) 2. I saw Hamlet 2000: I think the scenario is an interesting idea - but these actors bad ones - all of them 3. Orson Welles Hamlet is fine - but that BBC Hamlet is the best! Derec Jacobi is compelling - looks a bit lunatic - very suitable! and Patric Stewart - wonderful, and Claire Bloom is a very attractive queen. You believe in these actors what they're saying - I think that's the best compliment.
