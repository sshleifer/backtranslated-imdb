The Three Stooges have always been some of the many actors that I loved. I love almost all the shorts they made. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses that many of them were in many of the shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the greatest actors of all time and is the funniest comedy team of all time! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is none other than Brideless Groom! All appearing on this short are Dee Green, the beautiful Christine McIntyre, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre offer great performances here! There are so many funny parts here. This is a very hilarious short. There are another similar Three Short Stooges as this called Husbands Caution and I recommend both!
