I do not want to get into a movie review that I think it is - for a big budget movie - quite exceptional and bold. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say that I'm really sick of the studios. policies and laws of different states that treat their viewers as children. In the database, we find at least 4 different versions of the movie according to the runtime. But, of course, there are likely to be much more different cuts. <br /> <br /> The result is a complete mess and you can never be sure to talk about the same movie (unless you live in Argentina, where the movie works 115 minutes, which seems quite complete). <br /> <br /> Later, on DVD and Video, the studios try to steal us even more by selling a presumed cut of the director (in Germany, there already exists that version out there, running about 110 minutes. <br /> It would be good if the studios did not just think of the money they earn from their films, but also think of their products as a work of art, even at the risk of an unfavorable rating, so that I, as a spectator, who feel cheated and be taken seriously, not just as a resource for money.
