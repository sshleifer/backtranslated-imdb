There are few movies that have the huge amount of non stop ninja action like Ninja III: The Domination. This is a story of love, redemption and revenge, however, this is mostly a story about freaking out and killing people for no reason at all. If you are looking for a movie where a ninja goes crazy and takes all sorts of people to his graves just because he is a ninja and he can do it, this is the movie for you. I can not think of any movies to compare this because no movie is so incredible. Wait, oh, did you ever see the thing with two heads? There is a part where the owner is riding on a motorcycle and about a million police cars are chasing them but they keep hitting and what not because you cant get the thing with two heads !!! Well, that's how the Ninja III is. I recommend this movie especially if you like the following things: Ninjas, Swords, Lucinda Dickie of Breakin 'and Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo, video games about being a security guard in a bar, ambiguous love stories and underdeveloped or "good" ninjas.
