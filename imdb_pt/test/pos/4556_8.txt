A kind of remake of PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES in many ways. I think, I think it's such a bad coincidence that both John Candy and Chris Farley have left us. When they still had many things to do. God bless them. , I think the plot of 2 movies are really similar, Road Trips of two different poles of characters, and many unlucky consequences because of the Chubbies, this movie can not be planes and trains, but it is a very fun movie, especially with the great performance by Chris Farley, The missing part in this movie is the tricky thing if we compare it to Candy & Martin Classic, but I think its better this way
