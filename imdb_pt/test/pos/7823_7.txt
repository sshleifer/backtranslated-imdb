This is a made for the TV movie by Hallmark. Hallmark has always made quality films that are family oriented. Just desserts is a boy and a girl falling in love while working together movie. Two bakers competing for a $ 250,000 prize against a field of professional bakers. It's fun and light hearted. The desserts are great. The film has a small infectious and optimistic song played during the competition. I suppose it's a made-for-music movie from Roger Bellon. Too bad that no soundtrack is available. I really would like to get a copy of the song. I do not even know the name of the song because the credits are squeezed at the end of the movie to make room for hundreds of promos. Anyway, the cast is great. It's always good to see Brenda Vaccaro. She is very cheerful and optimistic. Lauren Holly is always an advantage and Costas Mandylor completes the good with a wonderful performance. Professional chef Wolfgang Puck has an appearance. The movie is worth watching.
