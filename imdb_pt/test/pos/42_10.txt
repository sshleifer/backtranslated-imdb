This is one of those movies that you do not want to end. The characters are rich like a well-woven tapestry. Colorful costumes, music and characters attract you and tell a tale of the people who lived in a pension for decades at the time of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. A young man is taken by a dynamic and great-hearted woman who runs the house and these are stories based on his experiences. <br /> <br /> I did not believe this was a movie made for television. It was so well executed. S. Epatha Merkerson is wonderful as a nanny and she brings so much life to that role. You want to be right here among your boarders. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie so much that I bought the DVD.
