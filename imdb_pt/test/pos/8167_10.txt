This was really a deeply moving film in every sense of the word. I myself was a Mormon missionary and I know firsthand the desire to complete my mission, but at the same time hiding the fact of being gay. Like the character Aaron, I was sent home for being discovered and excommunicated, but being the only Mormon in a Catholic family was not as shameful as it was for the main character. This movie really took me back to those days and it helped me realize, years later, how lucky I was to have a family that would accept me and understand what I was going through. I found myself cheering for the end of a movie, when Aaron and Christian met again for a cut at the Lila Restaurant. I was really touched by tears. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who reads this review and also declare it should buy.
