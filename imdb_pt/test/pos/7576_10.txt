Glenn Close is back as Sarah Plain and Tall, a woman who holds a family together during good times and bad times. The performance is superb - Christopher Walken (exceptionally non-spooky), as her husband once again delivers top-level performance. It's good to see young Christopher Bell grown up; Too bad we could not see much of Anna (Lexi Randall, also a few years older), but the new addition to the Witting family (played by Emily Osment) was warmly welcomed. And finally, Jack Palance, as long-lost patriarch Witting, is as well as ever.
