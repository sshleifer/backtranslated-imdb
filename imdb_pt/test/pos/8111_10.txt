The Great Dictator is an excellent film. Charlie Chaplin manages to be both extremely funny and witty at the same time and at the same time provides a strong statement in his satire against fascism. Chaplin's anti-Nazi speech at the end, with his values, is one of the great moments of cinema. Throughout this film, I felt that there was some superior form of intelligence, in addition to genuinely intelligent cinema, at work.
