I stumbled into this movie while surfing the canal and was impressed. It was being broadcast on a lesser-known short film program here in Australia. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I've been so impressed with a movie, especially one so short. <br /> <br /> The power of history, the quality of acting and the impressive cinematography ... wow. If it were available, it would be a very valuable addition to my DVD collection. I am undoubtedly impressed, and will look forward to Joshua Leonards' upcoming film. <br /> <br /> An exceptional experience 10/10
