Buddy Holly Story begins with a photo of a neon yellow moon on the roof of a skating rink in 1956 in Lubbock, Texas. When the credits begin, the camera moves from the moon to the parking lot, to the skating rink, through concessions and across the lane to a small bandstand where a small band is making its sound pass. It's a tracking that Welles and Scorcese appreciate. He cuts off Buddy Holly's eyewear face, looking down in an ecstatic concentration as he grabs the headphones and talks to a man putting the band on the radio. <br /> <br /> A young Gary Busey plays Buddy Holly and his performance is key. He has to somehow show the passion that Holly had for her music to make the movie work. This is a rock 'n' roll story with no lines of cocaine being chased with doses of heroin and a fifth of whiskey. This is not about a man with several women to choose from a scandalized sex, an abandoned brood lustful tragedy. This is a movie about a Texas boy who respected his parents and went to church and had the same girlfriend for 5 years and fell in love with rock and roll. Busey discovers that the spark and ignites it, her passion is clear and contagious. He actually plays guitar in the film and sings, it's not overdub with Holly's recordings. Busey was a young guy in Hollywood in the seventies, a hard-working actor and a rock musician so or more so combative as well. So he gives a great performance because although he is not Buddy Holly, he is in a similar situation. His first song is Les Paul's old classic, "Mockingbird Hill" and he has the country sound to play it. Then a boy calls for some bop, and against his two bandmates (actually the Crickets were 3 guys, but downsizing works well for the limited narrative of the movie) he takes them crying in "Rocking with Ollie Vee ". Kids love it and parents hate it. The DJ on the track rolls and is later released in New York without Buddy Holly, even though it has already been recorded. This leads to the funniest scene in a movie full of moments of humor. A disc-disc from Buffalo calls Buddy at home. The DJ played "That'll be the day" for 12 hours and goes to 24. The cops are knocking on the barricaded door of the station. Holly is confused, but when the dust settles, he gets quite excited. He tells the boys and his meteoric rise begins. Dan Stroud as drummer and Charles Martin Smith as bassist complete the band well and have good chemistry with each other. There are problems, but not an exaggerated drama, found in most rock biologists (everyone?). The movie also does not manipulate you. Your emotions fly, but they are not manipulated. As the Crickets enter the Apollo arena in Harlem, the first white group to play there, they start an electrically charged performance of "Oh Boy" and catch the public, my love-rock-n-roll butt choked and cried. Then Busey and the boys do "It's So Easy" sound more funk and more emotional than I would have believed possible. <br /> <br /> Anyone with a cursory knowledge of Buddy Holly's story will know where this movie will end. Holly died in a plane crash with Richie Valens and the very young Big Bopper. We, as the public know this, still the film is so well written, directed and lovingly acted that we forget about it almost immediately. The movie is not about his death, it's about his life and his place in rock and roll history. The film ends with its last performance and it's a good fifteen minutes of Busey amusing the ghost of Buddy Holly. I was happy to hear him finish off on "Not Fade Away", my favorite of his songs. The movie freezes before the final credits with the information about the plane crash, but I almost did not notice it. I was still thinking about how good the last song was.
