I do not know what the critics were seeing when this movie was released, but it went unnoticed. It's well written, witty, satirical and completely enjoyable. It's like a video game brought to life. You never know who is behind the door or what will happen next. Violence is neither gratuitous nor exaggerated for splatter purposes. <br /> <br /> One last word: For Mickey Rourke fans ... Mickster is back and in his best performance at the end.
