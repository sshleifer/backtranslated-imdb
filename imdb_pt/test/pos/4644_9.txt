This is basically a crazy comedy, with a rather strange rhythm due to some dramatic elements. For Michael J. Fox and Paul Reubens, this was his first film (Fox had already taken part in a short TV series and a TV movie). <br /> <br /> Since the film is basically a type of hunting / movie treasure hunt, such as "Cannonball Run", "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad Mad World", or more recently "Rat Race", not there are main characters. Instead, there are groups of characters, dividing screen time and allowing tons of mini-plots. Typically, this type of movie is a way to cram the maximum amount of stars (or semi-stars) into a movie. <br /> <br /> This has teams, one of them being the main team Fox belongs to, who are the only characters to be developed. Their plot is more stereotypical Disney, about a college boy who does not pay attention to his younger brother, whom he considers a lazy punk. Since they are forced into a team together, along with the older brother's girlfriend, they are forced to work together. Since this is the main plot, it gets the longest time on the screen. <br /> <br /> Some of the other silly entanglements stand out. The Blue Team is about a rich, overweight boy whose father just wants him and his misfit friends out of the house. They end up with a cool custom van that had an on-board computer (in 1980!) To instantly solve puzzles in addition to playing video games in time saved! One member, Stephen Furst, went on to play Dr. Axelrod in "St. Elsewhere", and was later in "Babylon 5". I also admit that I still laugh when Barf, while trying to decipher a word a'la of Scrabble, says "Fagabefe?" That's a lot funnier than Bart Simpson's "Qwyjibo" in my opinion. <br /> <br /> The other three teams have tangles that are somewhat intertwined. The green team is a bunch of fraternity boys, with mostly beer jokes that culminate in a collapse when hunting leads to the Pabst Blue Ribbon Brewery. They have a chance to harass the red team, with two feminists and two fun twins. The white team of nerds is led by Eddie Deezen, who has been in "Grease" but has come to play a critical role as a computer geek in "Wargames" and later sidekick of Tim Conway in some of the "Dorf" series. <br /> If you grew up in the 80's then there are some classic moments in the movie that bring back memories. The initial video arcade, back when they were cool, is always an advantage in my mind. Look for Paul Reubens and his shooting shots. There is also a mini golf course and a roller disco. <br /> <br /> The film is actually a family movie, simply because profanity is almost nonexistent, and the small amount of sexual humor is completely innocent. The odd pace thanks to the extravagant dramatic moments of the yellow team will put parents to sleep while their kids can laugh with giant melons in Fat Burger (oh, do they really have a special melon dish? Must be that, right?)
