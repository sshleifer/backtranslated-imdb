Written by husband and wife Wally Wolodarsky (who also directed) and Maya Forbes, this indie film is one of the best romantic comedies in recent history. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr takes a break playing smarmy weasels to be the cool guy who comes across the fact that his fiancee wants to sleep with other people and he too can do it. Julianne Nicholson, who was so good at "Tully", plays courageously and vulnerable with great pleasure. Too bad she does not get the recognition she deserves. <br /> <br /> Good support performances help immensely as well. Bryan Cranston (Malcolm in the Middle's father), Lauren Graham, who made the memorable "Bad Santa" last year, makes the perfect, cynical sister to perfection. Bryan Cranston receives some funny and daring moments, and Andy Richter plays a falls in love with a single mother - Helen Slater in a credible, though familiar, role as a shy woman. <br /> <br /> What surprised me the most about "seeing other people" was how funny it is. There are some genuine laughter here. Ed's first attempt at making senseless sex wins a few big lines, and there is a menage a trois that draws one of the truest reactions of a man as the male fantasy is modified. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is not uncommon. , but I liked that it was Alice (Nicholson) who thought about it, much to Ed's disgust (Mohr). Given the genre, you know that no matter how good your intentions, Alice's plan is doomed. We see how the couple works through this strange situation. Initially, Alice and Ed are excited by the idea, but then the human element defines it. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Forbes and Wolodarsky not turning this into a cheap sex prank. Yes, there is sex and nudity, but there are also real emotions at work here. The "other people" that Alice and Ed make friends do not want to be objects of casual sex; they also have feelings. In one case, many feelings. <br /> <br /> Granted, some scenes give one more joke, the Richter-Slater subframe is not needed and Alice does something really unusual. But this is forgivable because Mohr and Nicholson generate tremendous intimacy and honesty - check out the scenes where Ed rummages through Alice's underwear drawer or his reaction to the announcement to end the experiment - that no matter how much we play your little game for this couple succeed. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie has little publicity, if any, and a limited release. Hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies often deviate from the dull, turgid, unsurprised, would do well to learn from this clever and funny movie.
