I absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have fun. The direction, performance and history is brilliant. Definitely up there with movies like scarface and the godfather. This movie makes your heart race. Damian Chapa as well as all the cast was amazing. I would definitely rent this movie. Damian Chapa deserves a gym award for his acting, and for the way he portrayed the life of a gangster. This movie is a soon to be classic, and a brilliant whole piece of film I loved it and gave it 10 stars. In one sentence, the only way to describe it is a flawless movie. Watch this movie and you'll see what I mean. 2 thumbs up !!!!!!!
