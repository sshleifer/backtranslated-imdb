When Jurassic Park was released for the first time, it was revolutionary in filming and special effects. For the first time, people with cold went to a dinosaur film and were convinced they were seeing real dinosaurs. However, some dinosaurs were almost perfect examples. as the actual creatures could have been (T.Rex, Brachiosaurus, Triceratops etc) some were changed to fit the film (Velociraptor, Dilophosaurus) and the film happened in the present on a tropical island where they were not in their natural habitat. . Walking with the dinosaurs shows us the real animals in their real habitats all those millions of years ago. The amount of detail and scientific information used in it is great. Now we can see places like a severe desert of the Triassic, an entire herd of Diplodocus, an Icthyosaur give birth, a MASSIVE marine monster, a sight of pterosaurs eye, dinosaurs thriving in the South Pole, two locking horns Torosaurus, T.Rex roaring at the camera and the impact of the comet that spelled its fate. These dinosaurs walk, run, feed, fight, breed, hunt and swim. But the series also reveals the other creatures with whom they shared the world, two episodes focusing mainly on two different types of animals, the flying Pterosaurs and the marine reptiles that lived under the waves. The locations and scenarios are spectacular and look even more unique when a CG Dino enters the screen. And as for CGI and animatronics, CGI dinosaur movements look totally and completely natural, the coloring is bright and vivid, and the crew have taken careful steps to ensure CG animals interact with their environments in any way that a real creature splashing in water, brushing in shrubs, raising dust and casting shadows on the ground. Admittedly the CG is not perfect, with some brief cases where the animals look like too much computing, but the rest of the time seems to take your breath away. Puppet theater is poor in some cases, but it has its moments particularly the scene with the Cynodonts in the first episode. Kenneth Branagh's narration is very good, as well as giving us vital moments of information and drama at the same time. But of course the real pleasure is seeing a dinosaur alive doing what they did all those years ago and also seeing some really cute moments with Cynodont (mammal / reptile hybrids), Sauropodlets (Baby Diplodocus) and T.Rex pups (Yes, even T .Rex can be cute) and then reminds us that nature can be brutal and it was even more then. All of this contributes to a prehistoric masterpiece of nature that lets you see a true dinosaur and take your breath away, all from the safety of your living room. Whether you like nature, dinosaurs, informative learning, amazing visuals or just to have a truly good sight and have fun, then walking with dinosaurs is definitely for you. Easily recommended.
