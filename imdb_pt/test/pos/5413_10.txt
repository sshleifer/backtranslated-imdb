This movie is a powerful commentary on family life in North America today. The story is so well built, it almost seems like it's happening across the street, right now! If you are connected with your family and community in some way, this movie will pick you up and transport you to Travis's house and not allow you to leave until the credits are completed. <br /> <br /> Our imaginary heroes, through a myriad of innocent circumstances, often inadvertently, lead us to a path of sadness, confusion, and isolation. The Travis family, after a terrible tragedy, invites each of us; father, mother, brother and sister in their respective lives to share their experience in a dynamic set of circumstances that simply do not cease. We see all of the above and ultimately the joy, in powerful performances of the main actors and the rest of the cast, making this film an absolute treasure for the movie theaters. In a movie as well done as this, it's usually hard to find anything special, but Sandy Travis's picture of Sigourney Weaver was excellent. I would be surprised if the others did not recognize him as such. <br /> <br /> Clearly a 10. Well done!
