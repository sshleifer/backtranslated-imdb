A v Brit rom-com, one to see if you can get your hands on a copy. Quirky and often surprising, this is not the best of Brady's films (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the funniest), although it has a unique charm. Well written the story strays into some dead ends, but mostly surfaces with a new high plot. You know from the beginning how it will end, but when it arrives it is honest and very open, a realistic and credible ending, the end seemed a pleasant beginning and left me wanting more.
