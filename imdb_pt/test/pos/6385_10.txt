I loved. Others have revealed spoilers, but I will not. It was an unusual premise, actually kind of weird, but I went along with it completely. Camille was a difficult part to achieve convincingly; maybe that's why some people hated it. But I think Sienna was excellent and her acting skills allowed her to preach the piece perfectly - without being obnoxious or ridiculous. I do not know why she was interested in a loser like James Franco, but she married him anyway. I like him as an actor and I also thought he did a great job. He has nothing to be ashamed of. There were movies with similar settings, eg. "Ghost". I simply love Sienna Miller and I followed the situation as it is written in the script. I feel that his great talent in acting is very underestimated and I hope he becomes more recognized by the public. I thought all the actors did the role very well, and I hope more people see the film. I recommend. I was surprised that my local Block Buster store had about 10 copies available. I definitely plan to buy it.
