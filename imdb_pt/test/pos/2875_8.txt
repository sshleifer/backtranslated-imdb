Well, I'm a few days late, but what the hell ...! Anyway, the word that best describes my reaction to "See No Evil" was .... SURPRISE. The movie is really very good. There is definitely a lot of blood, blood and action in the movie, with a modest amount of suspense. This refers to the good old days of the late 70's and early 80's. Think "Madman" finds Leatherface with a hint of Norman Bates and you'll have a good feel for this movie. While the SNE is skinny on the plot (most horror films are), it makes up for in violence / killing methods, blood, suspense, and the fact that Kane does a great job of playing the highly disturbed Jacob Goodnight. The title of the film comes from the fact that Jacob rips his eyes from his victims using only his fingers and stores them in large pots. Because?? You just have to watch and see (pun intended). There are certain cinematic elements taken from other horror films, especially Psycho, MTC and Madman, but they are not glaring. Finally, SNE does not really go into territory that the chronometers have not seen before and guaranteed, the SNE is no "Pyscho" or "TCM 74", but certainly deserves an imo look. <br /> <br /> BloodStone's recommendation: Take Bloodstone's "See No Evil" Demonstration Rating: 7.5 / 10
