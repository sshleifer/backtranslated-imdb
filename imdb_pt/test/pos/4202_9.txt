Very good 1939 film where John Garfield plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks he committed a murder. The problem is that Garfield's killer and girl, Ann Sheridan, in a brief but good performance, are killed while attempting to deceive the police. <br /> <br /> A corrupt lawyer convinces Garfield to flee NY. with Dead End Kids .. They were sent there by a funding program to keep them out of more trouble. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garfield finds a new love interest but must hide his identity as everyone thinks he was not only the killer but was the victim in the car accident. <br /> <br /> May Robson is fabulous as the kind of grandma who runs the place for the young rebel. Claude Rains is also effective in the role of detective suspecting Garfield is still alive and chases him when a photo is taken of him in Arizona. <br /> <br /> The film really deals with Garfield's relationship with the boys. While the ending is good, you want to see Garfield return to N.Y. to proclaim his innocence.
