Yes, I know this movie is a comedy! And humor is over! But the subject of people getting less intelligent in the future may not be so unlikely! I can not say that this will happen, but if we do not take proper care of our educational system, this may be a possibility! I noticed that some schools are no longer teaching facts! (Like history, geography, basic things). The focus is more on learning practical skills! The theory behind most subjects can be tedious, but it is essential to understand how things work! In the movie there is this ridiculous example of people growing crops with Gatorade instead of water! Well, we can laugh at this! But if you've never learned that water contains minerals needed for plant growth, how do you know? For me, this is a scary notion! So now you understand why this subject is not funnier! It may be that Mike Judge is having fun, but at the same time he is warning people to a real disaster if education does not improve quickly! I'm taking this movie very seriously! Yes of course! For each your own fun! I loved the work of Mike Judge (Beavis and Butthead and Office)! In these, he was able to be critical and funny at the same time! In "Idiocracy" I missed it! Most of the events are very absurd and as I said earlier very scary! I think if you're in the mood you'll like this movie!
