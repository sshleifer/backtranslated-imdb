This classic has so many great one-liners and unintentionally hilarious scenes that I do not even know where to start. If you want advice on dating, it's here.

He buys a car without good reason to kill two gang members ... paying with "MONEY" ...... chunnng ... He buys an ice cream simply because "this is America, it's not" him " , and ends up wasting someone called "the giggler - he laughs when he runs" just because he stole his camera. By the way, this "giggler" is so fast that Bronson's regular pistol can not even reach him, he needs to ask a special just to get this creep indescribable.It gets clean just so he can eat a REALLY stinky (stuffed cabbage) meal in a mousetrap with an elderly couple who like to wear heavy clothes in a 90 degree climate.He enters the He always seems to find a raven bar when he needs one (and it's the same!). And last but not least, he always seems to have a rocket launcher at his disposal just in case he needs it Explode Richie Cunning's Big Brother ham, Chuck, who is now nervous and in dire need of a makeover. Anyway, this will all make sense once you have seen this classic ... all I can say is enjoy! "I owed you this DUDE"
