Not for those adrenaline maniacs, etc. It's a good movie, looking after the war, psychic problem, from another point of view. <br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez is as big as a young man, haunted by the demons of the Vietnam War, causing problems in the family. <br /> <br /> Marin Sheen is also good as a conservative father. <br /> <br /> It all comes down to the problem of how to deal with the past, with whom <br /> <br /> Emilion Estevez's character seems to be unable to cope, and the character of Martin Sheen does not want to deal with that. <br /> <br /> The protective mother looks at this problem with a warm and open heart, but with a closed mind for the obvious reasons.
