I saw this on DVD with subtitles, which made it a bit frustrating to go through because of the length of the movie. But I was fascinated by all this. The fact that I'm fascinated by the characters and always involved in the story, despite the legends, is a testament to the power of the film. It's an incredible job. I have on my list of ten favorite movies of all time. It's easily the best foreign film I've seen in the last twenty years. I'd like to know the full story behind the production of this movie. It must have taken a long time and required the use of hundreds of sites. The use of some hardcore scenes (on the motel room TV) may unfortunately make some people choose not to see, but if you do not care about them, you'll be deeply moved by all the stories on that TV!
