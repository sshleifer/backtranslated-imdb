Oooooh dude I was glad I did not miss it. I wanted to post this review, because this particular episode does what a particular recent movie did not do. It is a true tribute to the game DOOM. Its plot is different yes, and the characters are obviously placed in a totally different universe (obviously the doctor that universe) however the feel, the rhythm, the references and the location are perfect. And for all the original Doom fans to hear the opening and closing sound effect of the door, it was the icing on the cake for me. <br /> <br /> Please, all the doctors and Doom fans, take a look. it is a gem!
