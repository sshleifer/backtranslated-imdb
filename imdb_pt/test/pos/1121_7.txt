Another one of the endless number of Kickboxers movies that fight against death by the fun of the rich scoundrels that were so many in the 90's ... you know, those created with the words 'Death', 'Blood' and 'Steel' and the words 'Ring', 'Fight', 'Match' and 'Cage' and putting them on a random generator! Having said that, Death Match is a good entry into the most popular genre, thanks to its exciting fighting scenes and the surprisingly good acting of its kickboxer cast. <br /> <br /> The story is about two friends - former World Kickboxing Champion John Larson (played by middleweight fighter Ian Jacklin, probably previously known for his bad acting as the main villain of Ring of Fire 2) and Nick Wallace (Nick Hill, a friendly guy probably best known role of the street-fighter Sergio in Bloodsport 2) who work on LA docks carrying boxes on ships. A discovery of a box of weapons and a brief struggle later, our two heroes are unemployed and holding up an A bar. The sensible John Larson decides to head north and look for a job; Hardhead Nick Wallace has heard of a guy paying good money to the fighters to fight in private kickboxing matches. "Why should things change?" says John: "If you need me, I'll be there." Predictably, it does not take long for Nick to disappear and his good friend is fighting in the 'death ring' trying to find a clue to his missing friend. <br /> <br /> There are no prizes for originality here, but as I said before, the strength of this movie lies in its action, its cast of real life fighters and the reasonably good performances it can pull from them. Ian Jacklin, in particular, surprised me. Previously I had just seen him as the bad guy in Ring of Fire 2 and in small pieces in troupe like The Steel Ring, and I always had a lot of fun with how bad he is an actor (good fighter!). But in Death Match, he is very good! With a decent script and a haircut, he turns out to be a charismatic man! And his friendship with Nick is very well portrayed. Jacklin and Hill have good chemistry and you really believe these two characters care about each other. Enough for one of them to lose his job, travel to the other side of the country and risk death to save the other - I would like to have a friend like that! It was also cool to see Matthias Hues as a villainous henchman with a bit more depth than we are accustomed to seeing in his many roles of 'villain villains'. However, do not kid yourself thinking he's the star just because he's on the cover of the video (with his head stuck on Michael Bernardo's body on the cover of Shootfighter) - he's good while on the screen, but he's not much. .. On the negative side, the film is very slow when there is no fight, with many unnecessary scenes (what is the senseless story of gangster Jimmie Fiorello about his grandfather?), and the fight end is disappointingly short but overall I liked it! Lots of fights, most of them good. Is not that all the martial arts really need? And, of course, sweet-eye, here in the lovely form of the very beautiful Renee Ammann. All in all, a very fun kickboxing movie.
