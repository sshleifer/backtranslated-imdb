This movie is a great comedy drama. Christopher Walken is tremendous in his supporting role as manager, and his commentary will keep him laughing. Robin Williams plays a great role as a fast "Jon Stewart" and will have fun if you are a fan of Comedy Central. The show is good, because if the viewer has half-brains, they will see it as a much-needed subcultural attack on the policies of the current Republican government and a critique of the American Democratic Process ... not to mention the means by which most elected. <br /> <br /> I had fun with the subplots and found the movie very fast and fun, without any of the usual "oh-brother's". I agree that the film is less comedy than marketed, however, no doubt, better than 90% of the garbage in the theaters at present. Just my thoughts ... Don
