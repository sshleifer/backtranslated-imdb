On June 14, 1905, during the Russian Revolution of that year, the sailors aboard the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their oppressive officers. Frustrated by the second-rate treatment they receive, and more particularly the meat infested with larvae that are forced to eat, the ship's crew, led by the inspiring Bolshevik sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), decides that it is the right time for a revolution . And so begins Sergei M. Eisenstein's engrossing Russian propaganda classic, "Bronenosets Potyomkin / The Battleship Potemkin." <br /> <br /> The movie itself is filled with brilliant examples of stunning visuals: the glasses of a downed ship's captain. hangs gently from the side rope upon which it has been thrown; the body of a deceased mutineer lies calmly on the beach, with the sign on his chest written "DEAD FOR A SOUP SOUP"; close-up of the clenched fists of the hundreds of spectators who are finally fed up with the tsarist regime; a rebellious baby carriage traverses the Odessa Stairs as desperate spectators watch with their breaths suspended (this scene was memorably "borrowed" by Brian De Palma for a particularly suspenseful scene in his "The Untouchables"); the pipes of numerous canons are threatened leveled towards the battleship Potemkin, in great numbers. <br /> <br /> However, the movie itself is best analyzed ?? not as a fragmented selection of memorable scenes ?? but as a single movie and, in fact, every scene is extremely memorable. Although divided into five fairly distinct chapters, the entire film flows marvelously forward; at no time do we find ourselves losing interest, and we are never in doubt on which side we should be sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The movie is often referred to as "advertisement," and that's exactly what it is, but that does not have to have a negative connotation. 'The Battleship Potemkin' was produced by Eisenstein with a specific purpose in mind, and this is done perfectly in every way. Planned by the Soviet Central Committee to coincide with the twentieth-century celebrations of the failed 1905 Revolution, "Potemkin" was a popular film in its home country, symbolizing the revitalization of Russian art after the Revolution. It is somewhat regrettable, then, that Eisenstein's film did not perform well at the Russian box office, allegedly beaten by Allan Dwan's 1922 Robin Hood film in its opening week, which lasted only four short films weeks. Fortunately, despite being banned on several occasions in several countries, "The Battleship Potemkin" has done more admirably abroad. The film also proved to be a successful vehicle for Eisenstein to test his "assembling" theories. Through quick editing and distant imagery of the crowds of extras, the public can not sympathize with any individual character, but with the revolutionary population in general. Eisenstein, however, briefly interrupts this mold in a scene where Vakulinchuk flees from the officer of the ship who is trying to kill him and of course during the famous Odessa Steps sequence while our hearts beat in horror for the life of the unhappy child . in the falling baby stroller. The soundtrack that accompanied the version I watched, largely featuring the orchestral works of Dmitri Shostakovich, served wonderfully to enhance the emotional impact of such scenes. <br /> <br /> One of the greatest films of the silent era, 'The Battleship Potemkin is a triumph of phenomenal cinema and is a significant slice of film history. The highly exaggerated events of the film (among other things, there was never really any violent massacre on the Odessa Steps) have taken root so completely in the memory that we are often uncertain about the true story behind the events portrayed. This is a great achievement.
