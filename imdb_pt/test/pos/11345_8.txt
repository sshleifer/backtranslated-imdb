In Hong Kong, 1962, editor Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and his wife, and secretary Su Li-Zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung) and their husband move simultaneously to an old building. Each couple has just rent a room in apartments on the same floor. His wife and husband spend most of their time away from home, and Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they like stories of kung-fu, noodles and soap from a restaurant near the building. Their close contact becomes friendship and a kind of platonic and repressed love. Later, they realize that their companions are having an affair, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but his shyness and probably repressed condition of a married woman keeps her love on a platonic level. 'In the Mood for Love' is a very slow, beautiful, melancholy and romantic love story, with a wonderful photograph and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. The film had no script, and the actors were never sure what they were recording. Later, the director edited his story based on filming. When Chow moves to Singapore, there is a gap of many years in history until 1966 when his conclusion is intentionally open and not well defined, leaving questions like who the boy is with Li-Zhen. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Love the Flower of the Skin' ('Love on the Surface of the Skin')
