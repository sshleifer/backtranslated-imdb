A group of young travelers who have just run out of gasoline go to a strange wax museum called "Lost Oasis of Saluesen" belonging to a strange man named Slausen (Chuck Conners) while the puppets are controlled by a mysterious force and a madman with special powers want them killed. <br /> <br /> One of the most underrated horror movies of the late 70's! This production by Charles Band (producer of "Re-Animator") has become one of the scariest and most exclusive low-budget horror productions of his day, combining some psychological themes without having to result in something bloody like the usual horror film . The film keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats with tension and some scares, the film has become a rough cult genre for the genre since then and is worth watching.
