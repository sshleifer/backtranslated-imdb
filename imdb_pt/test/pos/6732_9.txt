This film is one of those that can not be considered by its exteriority. In fact, at first glance, it seems that the story simply focuses on the desire to have more money. But ... take a look on the other side ... What do you see? You see that money is just a metaphor for the ambiguous feelings that the human being has: should I do the right thing, or should not I? And what is the right thing? It gives you a deeper analysis ... "" What does a small border town mean? " - That means that sometimes we can go very close to the border to do something we thought we could not ... - What does the barren soil shown in this photo? - It means the dryness that sometimes takes possession of our offensive hearts ... - What does the character's phrase (KRISTEN) mean: "Now I belong to him"? It means the loss of our free will because of our unpremeditated acts. In MY OPINION, that is the story writer and the director tried to "tell" us. By the way ... do you remember what another character (JACK BARNES) said: "Nothing is so simple ..."
