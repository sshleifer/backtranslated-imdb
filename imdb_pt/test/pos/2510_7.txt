While it's definitely a fun way to spend a few hours and is always worth watching, this movie never reaches the goals it should have for two reasons. First, after the first forty-five minutes, it focuses heavily on Helen and Johnny, who are far less interesting characters than most others - Janet, Jennifer, George and Miss Scattergoods are much more attractive. Although at first this works, since in life we ​​do not always know all about each other, and because the point is that maybe Helen is a bit self-involved, she quickly wears off and we want to see more of the other characters. Secondly, the film seems to get lost in terms of plot in the second half. The letter itself is much less important than in the first half of the year, and again, although this works well in some respects, it seems strange to leave much of the potential displayed in the first half. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is sweet and humorous, with some truly hilarious moments - for example, Janet explains condiments to an avid audience. The lazy, but silently desperate atmosphere that Helen feels heavy and the feeling of living in a small seaside town is portrayed with precision, but the film is not as smart as it is trying to be. He just misses being a light romantic comedy and being a smart picture of life. However, it's still good and if you get the chance, it's definitely worth seeing.
