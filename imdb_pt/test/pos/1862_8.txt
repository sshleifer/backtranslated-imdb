Paul Bettany played a great role as the tortured father whose favorite girl dies tragically of disease. So he deserves all the credit. However, the film went more exactly on this, maintaining Darwin's adventures as he gathered data for his theories as incomplete stories told to children and completely ignoring the disputes over his ideas. <br /> <br /> Two things bothered me terribly. : the soundtrack with its whining sound, practically pushing the sadness down the throat of the viewer, and the movie trailer, showing some beautiful scenery, his theological reflections and his wife and the enthusiasm of his best friends as they prepare for a battle against blind faith, thus misrepresenting the film altogether. To be blunt, if someone removed the scenes from the movie trailer, the result would be a non descriptive family drama about a little dying child and the difficulties of his parents as a result. Clearly, not what I expected from a movie about Darwin, although the film was beautifully interpreted.
