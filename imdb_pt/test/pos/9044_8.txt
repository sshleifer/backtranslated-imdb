This is a 1972 Disney movie. At the time, I was eleven and I really enjoyed this movie. Feeling nostalgic, I bought the three feature films from the Dexter Riley movies, and even now, at age 46, I still liked them. It was all about fantasy, magic and clean fun. And it still is! I did not know which of the three films came first, then second and last. So now I have the official dates. On December 31, 1969, the computer wore sneakers - on July 12, 1972, now you see him now, you did not - on February 6, 1975, the strongest man in the world. I still think the middle movie was the best. The special effects were astounding in 1972 for us children. I would definitely recommend it for all ages.
