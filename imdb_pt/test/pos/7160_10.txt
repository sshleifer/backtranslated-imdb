I agree with the other 9 and 10 star reviews. I saw this at the South By Southwest Film Festival in Austin. Of the 20 films I saw, 7 were very good and this was the best for me. I'm a sucker for movies that have plot devices where the characters go through transformations that totally change their lives. The excellent performance was made mainly by people involved in the TV, or was his first movie. It was written and directed by Jay Floyd. This was his directorial debut. Jay Day's work is apparently as a release administrator for many famous movies. Forgive the Franklins was a total pleasure and extremely funny in some points. This is a movie where I would buy the DVD and re-watch it, really a great addition to me. Well done, Jay, yes ... give up your day job!
