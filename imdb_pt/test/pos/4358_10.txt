This movie is one of the most amazing examples of compelling and ingenious movie making I have ever seen. Herzog seems to capture the almost transcendent tragedy and beauty of Dieter's story, as well as his captivating personal character. At the end of the film, I wished I had the opportunity to meet Dieter before his death. <br /> <br /> On a technical note, cinematography is intimate and incredibly beautiful. The narrative is intricately woven, with great awareness of the subject and its ability to relive and reenact traumatic events. Few documentary directors have such a strong ability to fully invest the public in the character. This movie is a must see !!!
