Traits Errol Flynn brings his usual talent for drama in this historically flawed but fun movie of the life of George Armstrong Custer. Flynn Custer's dashing and jovial rehearsal of his days at West Point as a careless and stubborn cadet during the Civil War years, in an extraordinarily generous and partisan interpretation of history, and finally as the unmatched Indian fighter whose Little mistake Big Horn's has been excused as a sacrifice by Custer of his command as a way to expose the corruption of government officials and post marketers as well as a protest against the unfair treatment of the plains Indians. Olivia de Havilland, Flynn's co-star in several other films, scores as the devoted and beloved Libby Bacon, and Anthony Quinn looks like the fierce Sioux chief Crazy Horse. The battle scenes from the movie are excellent. The battles of the Civil War are brief and are shown as several vignettes in which Custer, apparently supported by only a handful of soldiers, hammers the Confederate army in submission. Custer's last fight against the Indians is a grandiose spectacle, a savage confrontation between red and white men, unaware of a wild mixture of military power between certain fighters. Max Steiner's Great Direction, Cinematography, Cast and Wonderful Music make this movie a Hollywood classic.
