This movie reminds me of "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" and "Garden State" not because of the content but because it is one of those movies you do not hear except through word of mouth or you read the part behind the DVD in the store and think "why not". Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised (like the movies mentioned above) on how good it was and how much I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Best viewed with little knowledge of the movie and with intrigue just guiding you to actually watch it. Also better seen with someone else or if you know someone who has seen it - you will want to talk about it !! It's a beautiful movie that stays with you well after watching it. It is also a smart watch that requires little effort to discover the parts for yourself. <br /> <br /> Just enjoy :)
