This wonderfully witty comedy drama thrilled the crowd at the Philadelphia Film Festival, driving them to mad applause at the end. Backed by perpetual performances by a cast of nuances, firm execution by director Jeff Hare, a fast-paced and one of Peter Falk's best performances in years, the film comes as a loving homage to the heights and sufferings of family life. Falk stands out as Morris Applebaum, a Jewish novice, an eccentric Shakespeare theatrical actor who decides to end his life, but not before reuniting his three adult children and giving a "big fat" suicide party to Jews". The film overflows with indelible delights. There is Morris's "tushy" room; The passionate portrayal of Laura San Giacomo of Morris's cynical daughter; rapid-fire comic dialogue reminiscent of the work of Neil Simon and Woody Allen; the ironic timing of David Paymer, who plays Morris's psychotherapist son; and Morris' patented egg creams (but be careful, drinking too fast will cause an unpleasant freezing of the brain). Everything is enveloped in an intimate and pleasant atmosphere in New York. <br /> <br /> Director Jeff Hare proves to be a master craftsman, drawing memorable performances from his cast and lending a joyful humanity to the film. I was lucky to see an earlier Hare movie: the dark and powerful "Perfect Little Man," starring Neal McDonough ("Minority Report"), as a Los Angeles man plunged into madness. The visceral vitality of "Perfect" and the nostalgic "Check Out" breeze are a testament to Hare's eclecticism and talent. I look forward to checking on your future work. <br /> <br /> I heard "Checking Out" does not have a distributor at this time. Some wise company would do well to get this crowd-pleasing gem, for it's a potential box office titan in the vein of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." Nobler, it would give people around the world a chance to experience the joys of this movie.
