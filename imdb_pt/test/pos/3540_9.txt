I have to say when it comes to Book to Movie Adaptations, the BBC rarely disappoints me. Now, about this mini-series. I love Starling Novel, it's by far the best murder / mystery I've ever read. The Mini-series, made my day defiantly when I saw it. The main story was kept almost intact. The characters match very well with those of the novel, personalities and mannerisms were in place of Red and Jez. I thought Duncan was fine, just like Kate, Eric was a very simplistic character, he had a bit more depth in the book, but they also altered his sub-story so she could have to deal with it. Of course there are changes, but most are cosmetic, but some I found disappointment, the sub-story with the murder of Eric was changed and this changed all the dynamics between Red and Eric for the film, and they cut the Triathalon Jez training . was doing. Some of the other events in the book are changed to be viewer friendly. Above all, if you liked the book, you will enjoy it, if you like the mini-series then you will love the book. I must say that this is the most accurate adaptation of the Book to Movie that I have ever seen.
