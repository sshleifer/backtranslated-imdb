I saw this at the Stony Brook Film Festival in 2004 and was very warmly received. In this pre-WWII movie, a couple of German rocket scientists are working on the Scottish island of Scarp as war approaches on the horizon. The characters found on the island are invaluable in their creation and retraction. Shauna MacDonald is particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> After becoming familiar with the Scootish accents, the viewer feels at home with these people watching with fun as the Germans work to connect their island with the mainland via a rocket-based mail delivery. As unlikely as it sounds, this movie was based on a true story. <br /> <br /> All in all, a memorable movie that will stay with you for awhile thanks to your cast, your story or your scenery.
