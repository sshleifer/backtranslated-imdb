Over the years, some of the nicer movies have been about dysfunctional families. <br /> <br /> Bonjour, Monsieur Sholmi is one of these films. <br /> <br /> This is an Isreali film about a Moroccan Jewish family. <br /> <br /> This can be about any family in any culture. We all know or want to meet people like these in this comic book cat. <br /> <br /> This delight of 2003 was written and directed by Shemi Zorkin. Let's hope he has a long career. <br /> <br /> The film is seen through the eyes of the 16-year-old son who seems to be worried about all family members. Heis brilliantly played by Oshri Cohen (he was 18 when he made the film.) <br /> <br /> He has been in some since & I know I'm going to look for them.I hope this young man becomes an international star. /> <br /> All the cast is magnificent, I hope to see them again <br /> <br /> I have loved all the cast people to some extent.I think everyone who sees this will agree. > <br /> He was nominated for many international awards and won 8, deserved each. <br /> <br /> Now being a film in a language other than English, he had a very limited run. I feel it is unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, you will be glad you did. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) 9 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> NOTE: Since the story is not new, this is a rating as high as possible.
