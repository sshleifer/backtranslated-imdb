So funny is the perfect way to describe this 12-minute parody of the original Star Wars. Hardware Wars is incredibly funny. It is presented as the trailer for the epic Space Wars hardware. The joke is this: imagine Star Wars played by bad actors and incredibly bad special effects. The characters include "intergalactic boy-wonder" Fluke Starbucker, the "wise mercenary and intergalactic" Ham Salad, Darph Nader, "villain" and a host of other fantastic characters. It's impossible not to laugh while you watch this 12-minute treasure. It's stupid but it's fun. You will laugh from start to finish, and you will feel the need to see it again, and again, and again and again ... And you will laugh every time you see it !!! <br /> /> 10 out of 10. The funniest 12 minutes ever made. You'll believe it lasted a minute!
