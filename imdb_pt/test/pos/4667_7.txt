Italian work requires hours of daylight and no experience is needed. This is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the movies. The plot is good, but the actual execution of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process. They are car chases, blasts and all for the simple purpose of defeating the "villain" played by Edward Norton. For Norton, it appears he is content to portray exactly the same characters from his previous films as "The Score." Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron deserve better scripts. Warning: If you saw the trailer, you saw the movie. If you are looking for entertainment at cheap prices then you need The Italian Job.
