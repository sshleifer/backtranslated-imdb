Every time this movie used to replay on late-night TV in the late 70's and early 80's, I always had time to sit in front of the TV and watch it. To see beautiful Kate Jackson, the beautiful Richard Long, the "great" Polly Bergen I've never seen anywhere except this TV movie, the nice Tom Bosley, and another "great" I've never seen outside of this movie Celeste Holme. This is truly the boat of love on a cruise to murder and clutter and boy was always good !! And every time I watched, I always forgot who the real killer was. <br /> <br /> As expected, someone here is already criticizing the movie as if this really was a great help to anyone. This is a great TV movie and worth seeing every time. I can not say that about half of the movies I've seen this month. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to watch it on TV someday, which is not likely, watch. In light of "The Girl Most Likely To," which finally comes out this year on DVD, there may be hope for a DVD release of "Death Cruise."
