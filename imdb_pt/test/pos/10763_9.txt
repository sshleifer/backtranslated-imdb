I really enjoyed Fierce People. I discovered the movie by accident, looking in my lists of movies on demand trying to find something interesting to watch. The film is mostly about class in America, and it quickly catches your eye. The characters are clever and articulate and the story does not follow the usual Hollywood rules. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist is Finn, a precocious but underprivileged 15-year-old boy who spends the summer with the Osbourne family. Donald Sutherland plays the patriarch Ogden C. Osborne, the seventh richest man in America. Diane Lane plays Finn's mother, a friend of Ogden's, who is also a regular user of cocaine and a bitch. The Osbournes possess a large estate and seem to live according to their own rules. At first they look charming and sophisticated, but the super rich are different. They are accustomed to making their own way. The film is entertaining mainly because it has an intelligent and clear dialogue, a superb performance and a story that takes unexpected turns. It's also a R rated movie, so it's not totally healthy. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. Anton Yelchin is credible and sympathetic in Finn's demanding role. Sutherland and Diane Lane have never been better. Chris Evans is awesome as the rogue grandson of Osbourne. Kristen Stewart is good as the beautiful granddaughter. High quality film.
