This film is one of only historical documents that show the talents of so many black singers, actors, actresses and dancers. Many who are no longer with us. Those of us who are blessed to enjoy today in 1999, through this film, allow us to recognize the talents that existed then. That's why those individuals who still live today, as well as those who are dead, are super-star icons. Due to the educational history of music, drama, filming, design, singing, etc., only this film belongs to the people of this country. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie recently. The sound was excellent! The film appeared to be complete, the color and clarity were good, but it is good to consider the age of this film without any fixes on the pictures. I agree with all previous positive comments. I do not have negative points of view. <br /> <br /> I'd just like to make a request. Please, whoever interests, please make this film available so that everyone can have this historical experience.
