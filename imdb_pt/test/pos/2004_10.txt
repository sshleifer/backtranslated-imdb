I started watching this show by accident, but I love it. The fact that the main character is in a wheelchair is something that is missing on television, especially for children's shows. My five-year-old nephew (as most kids do) just looked at people who were wheelchairs or had some other kind of disability, but after he watched Pelswick seemed to be a normal occurrence for him. Every time he saw a wheelchair, he simply said "Like Pelswick" and went on with what he was doing originally. And YES, the animation is a little rough, but if you can watch the first season of the Simpsons, then that's not so bad. The "Genie" is actually an angel who is there to help Pelswick learn life lessons. He CAN NOT WALK ANYWHERE AGAIN, HE SAID HE WAS INSIDE FOR A LONG TIME, HE CAME ALL OF HIS ANIMALS AND HE NEVER REMAINS MY PICK-UP WALK, HE IS PARAPLÃ‰GIC HE HAS NO FEELING THROUGH HIS AREAS (HE MENTIONS IN AN EVENT). As for humor, if you can get a copy of the episode "Ntalented" that satirizes boy bands, you will instantly love this show.
