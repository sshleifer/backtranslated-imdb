The book is better than the movie mainly because of the prose of the writer Ondatje. Before seeing this movie, someone who saw it told me that the love represented in this movie is not real. After watching this movie, I can see how its suspension of disbelief in that regard could have been a distraction to other movie goers as well. Frankly, some of the intense demonstrations of love were laughable and seem to be on the brink of parody. But in the end everyone should realize that this is a great work of art. It is not specifically about love, it uses "love" to reveal dialectically the human divide or the arbitrary borders of countries that help to justify wars and hatred. It's about misunderstandings and the blind following of the things that supposedly separate us. The critical scene for the real theme of this film is when the hero's or anti-hero's appeals for help to the lover stranded in the desert are ignored and disregarded for the reasons shown in that scene. This film is also about hope and forgiveness, the hope summed up in the interracial relationship between the reclaimed character of Binoche and the Indian minefield (echoed in the Sikh comrade's relationship with his white coworker who ends up dying meaningless) and forgiveness symbolized in Caravaggio. first hunt for the character and then forcing off what he thinks will be confessions of the hero to his "crimes" of war (country betrayal). I think the movie could have been made even better than it is. I do not know if a more realistic picture of the circumstances of love would have made the themes and real points of this film even more obvious or not, but I agree that this film is not about realistic romantic love like the people behind it A work of art or film implies an initial scene when the eventual lovers meet for the first time. The hero talks about how a new car, broken car, fast car, etc. (I'm paraphrasing) is still just a car, no matter what adjective you put in front of it. She responds, but the love of the parents, the platonic love, the romantic love, etc. are very different kinds of love. This is ironic because this movie is really about the love that all humans should want, which is the love of (or for) peace (non materialistic things that are usually the real reasons for wars, synthesized into something that most of us want like "cars".) Otherwise, we may be stranded to die in a cave in a vast desert with ancient art / wall drawings of swimmers, suggesting that the seas and life-supporting waters that once were there I do believe that "The English Patient" won the Oscar because of these great messages not specifically for their portrayal of romantic love.Rights tend to follow this path.The relationship of hero and heroin was necessary to attract the public, unfortunately this view of love can be outdated in the age of divorce and so many singles who seem unable to unite on so many levels, ridiculous versions of the mythical love is difficult to enter, even in day-dreams, that the love of cinema has always been, especially in good old Hollywood. The movie may fall short of what people expect, but a 7 out of 10 movies are worth seeing, regardless.
