Yes, I watch this show. Because my girlfriend watches, of course. Well, at least that's what I tell my friends. But since no one here has ever known me, I can say that; I love it! That's great trash tv. <br /> <br /> First, there is the panel; Tyra herself, who does not miss a single opportunity to talk about herself, but must be taken seriously, since she is the businesswoman. Then there's Jay Manuel, a sober, gay guy, very serious and incredibly professional, and Miss Jay, an extrovert, "queen" of the catwalk and a very funny guy, and Nigel, self-styled as the only man on the panel. <br /> <br /> Second, the show is a detailed view of a shallow industry, and we have to give the producers by showing us the inner vision, which can be informative and also fun. <br /> <br /> Finally, the editing is great; there is the right mix of everything; The girls living together in the house of the ego, their impressions on the sets, the competitions themselves and the judgments. All of this slides smoothly with the right beat. There are no deadlines. <br /> <br /> Of course there must be other factors that led to eliminations that we do not see in the programs; The panel is composed of capricious, extroverted and fast divas in the putaria; woe to those who offend them! But, as long as a competitor does not step on their toes, their judgment is usually fair - I think. <br /> <br /> So, give your brain a break; If you can not beat them, join them and have fun watching this reality show with your loved ones. That will make them crave for more, somehow.
