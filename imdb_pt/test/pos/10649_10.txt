Eisenstien "Potempkin" (Bronenosets Potyomkin), is among the best films ever made and possibly the best of the silent film era. Eisenstien was a pioneer of film form and his use of editing editing influenced the movies to this day. The scenes of the Odessa Steps massacre are as powerful today as when they were first seen more than 70 years ago. DO NOT miss the chance to see this movie!
