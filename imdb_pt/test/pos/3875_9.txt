I've seen Borderline for several years at AMC. I've been looking for it ever since. It was haunting: visual, textural, sensual. This movie took me somewhere like a dream and I did not care where. I'll never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. I still remember the way it made me bow my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw her. I did not know what had happened when the movie was over, but I think life is like that. That did not bother me. The injustice of the final rejection of an innocent character seems sadly real to me. I loved the faces, the way the camera stayed on them. The camera looked at the device with the unfocused eyes of a dreamer. Borderline was real to me in a way that movies are not. It was exactly the lack of explanation, color, sharpness that made it enter my consciousness like a thief in the night. I love this movie. Someday I'll own it.
