I've seen this movie for a while and I can not track it. Does anyone know where I can get it? I feel it is worth seeing again. <br /> <br /> I regret to say that I had never heard of Chloe Nicholle until this movie. Yes, she can act. When I started to track this movie, I mistook it for another of his films, Sex Spa. The plot seems similar to me, but the roles are reversed. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I saw Dru Berrymore. I've looked at some of her other films and I feel she looks better like a blonde. <br /> <br /> I agree that this is a good introductory movie. It's not too soft. Not too difficult. You have to start somewhere.
