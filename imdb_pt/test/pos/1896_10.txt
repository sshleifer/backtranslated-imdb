This movie is funny in more ways than one. It has action. Has mood. You have attitude. It has all the Dolemite girls kung-fu army! And that's exactly what the movie offers as a movie. Also misunderstood by some, the microphone makes more of an appearance and some "punches" lost on foot. But when you make such a cool movie, who has time to pay attention to those "details"? This movie rocks. Rent it tonight, if you can find it ... I had to buy it to see, but I do not regret it!
