I saw this movie last night and it was one of the best made for TV movies I've seen. It was very well run and the performance was superb, very convincing. The music was good and the cinematography was beautifully filmed. Take away the desperation of Requiem for a Dream and you will be wasted. An excellent representation of the world of drug addiction and its consequences given in a very open way in which anyone can relate. cudos to mtv for giving us a good move for a change of! * $ *% as Crossroads.
