One of the biggest crimes committed against Sci-Fi television was the cancellation of Farscape. One of the best-written, best-represented and best-of all time to grace the radio waves, has set new standards for Sci-fi television. Since the flagship, the Sci-Fi Channel's most highly rated and critically acclaimed program, defies the explanation of why shows like Buffy, Tremors: The Series and even StarGate: SG-1 have lasted as long as they do. Yeah, even Buffy. But I'm going to save my Buffy for another hour. Farscape was ill-treated by the science fiction channel, continually scheduled, reruns seldom exhibited and never announced. But while the show has been canceled, everyone involved in the production of the show wants to bring the show back (even Henson Company CEO Brian Henson). There is also an extensive fan-based movement to bring the show back. Overall, things are far from gloomy, and we hope fans have Season 5.
