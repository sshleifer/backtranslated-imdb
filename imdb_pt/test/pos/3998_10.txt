This movie can be a bit annoying for some people, but I find this movie very interesting in terms of an attempt to reveal a tradition. <br /> <br /> The director, Lim, has made two films about traditional music in Korea before this movie. The film before this was showing the song throughout the film, and this movie is trying to achieve similar things, having backgrounds in the film as well as a painting. Another thing is that the story is written both by the director and by the philosopher, Kim, who is well-known academician in Korea (with many degrees - including that of doctor at Havard), I am not saying that Educated people make better films, but this philosopher is a specialist in traditional culture in Korea, so it gives more credit to this film.
