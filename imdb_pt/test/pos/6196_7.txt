Written intelligently, well represented, intense and full of suspense. This show lives in the real world, not as fantastic as it is "24" (and I'm a huge fan of 24, by the way). It has credible characters and in many ways is much smarter than most in this genre. He tries to present both sides of Islam. So far, I've watched the first 4 episodes and found the story more balanced. Terrorists are more complex and not one-dimensional. And as a result of this balance, terrorists become more frightening than the typical villains portrayed in film and television. Last but not least, the hero is truly heroic without being a cartoon. I recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of 24 and related.
