During the making of this film, I once got a statement on television about it. Something like: "Killingg√§nget is now taking away Nazism?" <br /> <br /> So my understanding of this film was from the beginning to get a sense of Nazism. When I recently saw this movie on the TV version I had this filter before me and it was not difficult to see it. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I have not known this way of interpreting the film since I first heard it. <br /> <br /> These are the things I found in "Four shades of brown". In all four stories, lack of empathy leads to disaster: 1. The crematorium worker shows no realistic empathy with dead animals or those who have had to say goodbye to them. In the crematorium, dealing with death and fire, it's almost like a joyous game for him. The seriousness of death and fire is not emphasized by the father and his son accordingly, in ignorance presses a button that leads to disaster that seriously damages the father. Possible lesson: The importance of showing young people appropriate emotions. When they grow up, they need to know what behavior leads to disaster and what emotions lead to good. <br /> <br /> 2. The magician maneuvers his wife as an invisible puppeteer. Only when she thinks she has begun to cut the ropes to the master's hand, seeking personality, integrity and joy, he pulls hard and she is back to desolation and despair. <br /> <br /> Their son tried to revolt himself in creating his own life with perfection and "good" taste as opposed to the "bad" taste of his parents. The real problem he is carrying inside is far from comprehensible to him: his father's behavior passes when he suffocates his own wife in her immaculate environment. Possible Lesson: Oppression breeds slavery. <br /> The father who was mistreated as a child transmits sadism to his children when he deceives them in his inheritance. He steals his childhood and, in the end, even his heritage. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson: When no love given to you can give none. <br /> <br /> 4. Parents abuse their daughter creates in her a cruel avenger with sadistic aggression. Here, icy Nazi sadism becomes obvious in physical violence. It gives a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation for the actions of the young "head-of-scin" -nazers behavior by oppressing others. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson? : Can Nazism Be Born in a Perverted Home? <br /> <br /> The horrible consequence of ignoring empathy in family life in the long run can be that room given to sadistic Nazism? <br /> <br /> Very rarely does a movie contain much. Reveal little by little as I meditate on it. I consider it brilliantly "painted" and the actors are superb. Especially the handsome Ulf Brunnberg who turns out to be the worst of them all.
