People who say that some of the Looney Tunes cartoons are inappropriate for children apparently have forgotten something: they were not originally intended for children. They were produced for the movies, to be screened before feature films and to show what they wanted. "Tweety's S.O.S." There's that evil idiot looking for Sylvester aboard an ocean liner and boarding the ship to try to get him. But two things work against Sylvester: the grandmother vehemently protects the canary, and Sylvester gets seasick easily (we do not see him vomiting, but with his green face, they make it perfectly clear he was doing just that!). And then, of course, the seemingly cute tweet has a bad side. <br /> <br /> It's great to see how these cartoons were not afraid to leave; whatever they thought to show, they showed. We need to understand that cartoons should not always be cute entertainment for kids. Really funny.
