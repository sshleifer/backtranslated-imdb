I saw this movie when it was first released and I enjoyed it. What movie I'm in my 40s now and I have 2 teenage children and I would like them to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or an older song by Elton John. <br /> <br /> I've researched most of the stores that sell new and old movies, but I have not found any. <br /> <br /> I bought some old movies like "Melody" in Hong Kong which had a collection of old movies but they did not have it. <br /> <br /> I'm also looking at continuation, Paul & Michelle. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me how to get a copy of VHS, DVD or VCD. <br /> <br /> I really appreciate that. Thank you very much.
