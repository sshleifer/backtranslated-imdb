I know a lot of people have said do not bother with this movie because it's not a good fight movie and difficult with subtitles. This is a really lazy way of thinking about a movie. If you want to focus on that part of the movie, you must find something else, and also learn to respect cinema as an art form, this being a masterful job. If you want to watch this, it's not about fighting really. There are good fight scenes at times, which are filmed very well with good camera work, but the story itself is what keeps the story together and is the important part. This is not the basic Kung Fu movie. The story is really the central focus and not the fights, and the combination of the two makes an excellent movie worth watching, and it's even better in the original language with subtitles.
