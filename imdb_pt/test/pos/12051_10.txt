The film is a very good film. One of the best Yash raj films. The direction is amazing. The screenplay is brilliant. The story is excellent. It tells about Rahul who is obssed by Kiran his college friend. He is a full blown psychopath doing things like talking to her mother on a phone (anyway she died 15 years ago) etc. Kiran is engaged to Sunil. Rahul does everything he can to get her. He even tries to kill Sunil but he survived. He even goes to the place where they are going for their honeymoon. The movie is all pleasure nes. Shahrukh is excellent, Juhi is quite good, Sunny is average, Anupham is fine and so is Tanvi, Dalip did well. The film belongs to Srk.A the dialogues are brilliant (those of Shahrukh and much, if not overcoming and comedy ). "Jaadu Teri Nazar" and "Tu Mere Samne" are absolutely melodious tracks.
