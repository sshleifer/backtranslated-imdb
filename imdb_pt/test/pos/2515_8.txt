"This Is My Affair" was an attempt to capitalize on the current success of turn-of-the-century historical films ("San Francisco" "In Old Chicago") and, in retrospect, had quite a powerful success. The plot is fascinating. A troubleshooter, but the heroic naval officer (Robert Taylor) receives a secret mission from President McKinley to uncover a group of bank robbers that is paralyzing American finances. He meets the gang but falls in love with his mascot (Barbara Stanwyck) and needs to decide between love and duty. <br /> <br /> Not everything about this vintage movie works well, but overall it's a good slice of studio. making a movie. The plot line would be borrowed by Kurt Vonnegut for "Mother Night" (the lead role of the film was brilliantly played by Nick Nolte) and seems quite believable, at least within the confidences of the studio. As a fan of old movies, I'm always thrilled when I come across one I've never seen and "This is my case" was no exception.
