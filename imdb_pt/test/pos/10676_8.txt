This is an excellent Anderson production that is worth comparing to the best episodes of UFO or SPACE 1999 (first series). Of course it's not a fancy SFX party or a pseudo-mystical Star Wars festival, but a subtle movie that has a slow pace but conveys the creepy, weird and mysterious atmosphere of Anderson's best productions: for lovers of ' cerebral 'science fiction. Lynn Loring's voice is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. SFX are good for this type of product and acting is also good. Two astronauts visit a planet on the other side of the Sun but stop at home ... or not? Oh, videophone! From time to time sold as the next 'gadget of everyone in the next decade', but still to happen 40 years later. The device of the Earth's twin planet on the opposite side of the sun also returns in Gamera tai daiakuju Giron (1969), so who copied whom?
