I first watched this movie years ago with my daughter who is now 13 and fell in love with the vampire. We both thought it was a top movie, so we watched sub 11 then sub 111 now I think there is sub 1v that I can not wait to catch my fangs, and there is also a fifth on the pipe line. if nobody saw the movies. These are the best of the best. I think the deserver is an Oscar of thousands. I could watch these from morning till night.I would love to have a set of nails as it has, watch out for the girls. I love this as all the story lines continue from film to film. these typical ant vampire movies are better. I would love to live in the life that is protracted in the movies. would make all my dreams come true
