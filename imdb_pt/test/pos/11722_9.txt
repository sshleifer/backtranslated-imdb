This is Burt Reynolds' "Citizen Kane". Tragically, nothing else he got involved came close to approaching "Sharkey's Machine". It seemed to me that he put everything he had into it. It's a movie that's passionate about movies. The opening sequence in which Detective Sharkey alone rescues a load of hostages is an immensely exciting piece of cinema. Everything moves so quickly when it starts to go wrong that it seems to have a life of its own, a brilliantly achieved effect. It looks cold, tense, and dangerous in the streets of Mr. Reynolds. The police station seems dirty and tired, full of desperate people on both sides of the law, screaming, cursing, trying to do business or just staying alive. In this underworld, Sharkey descends, recently downgraded - a reward for a crippled bust of drugs (caused by a corrupt police officer) - he and his team are part of the vicious squad. Information about a dishonest politician takes them to the world of high-profile girls and ruthless drug barons. Watching the apartment of one such program girl (Rachel Ward) Sharkey falls in love with her portrait on the wall (I know, I know) and when a woman's body is found with her face flung into one of the bedrooms, he thinks ( Well, I said it was a movie that loved movies). The scene in which she enters it works beautifully, even though you have seen the original. The film is full of good touches; I particularly enjoy the wartime story of Charles Durning, subtly depicted and filmed in sharp contrast to Sharkey's abduction and torture, which is suitably harsh and brutal. I must mention Vittorio Gassman and Henry Silva as two disparate but equally evil brothers, absolutely without redeeming resources. They are "full of" every time they are on the screen and are not losses to society when the time comes, the end of Mr. Silva is very special. As already mentioned, this is a Clint Eastwood movie Clint never made. The biggest compliment I can pay for "Sharkey's Machine" is to point out that in my opinion, Clint Eastwood could not have done a better job. The soundtrack is of an equally high standard, with Sarah Vaughan, Joe Williams, Julie London, Chet Baker and other top performers. Randy Crawford's "Street Life" plays behind the title sequence, and I can never hear it without, in my head, seeing Sharkey walking down the sidewalk. Like other correspondents, I never understood why this movie was a failure. I hope it's due to a critical review, particularly at a time when so many police movies and shows show, without a quarter of their energy, freshness and pure joy. vivre are praised from the rooftops. If you're tempted to think of Burt Reynolds as a one-trick pony, put "Sharkey's Machine" on your video machine. I promise you will not be disappointed.
