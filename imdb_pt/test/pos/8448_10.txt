Again, I read all the comments posted here and agree with the smarter, but I totally disagree with those who think it was / is hokum. Personally, I think nuclear is the only energy thing left for us unless our governments (federal and state) increase donations thinking that owners will use photographic cells on their roofs. Many attractive and expensive homes in Southern Calfifornia are designed and built to harness the cleanest energy around, the sun. I live in a loft, which is exposed to full sunlight on your roof all day long. I hardly use the AC - I'm sure it would consume too much electricity to convert the intense heat in the attic to about five degrees colder. We are blessed with "dry" heat in this part of the country. I am from the US Gulf Coast, so I know about humidity ....... That said, I found "China Syndrome" to be a convincing film about what I COULD go wrong, if the industry is not busy regulating and inspecting nuclear power plants. I think there are enough comments posted here to enlighten those who still fear like the plague: they are safe. The TMI is still online .... Director James Bridges carefully guideth this story (Mike Gray-T S Cook) to create suspense and a carefully interesting film. Jane Fonda ("Kimberly Wells"), Jack Lemmon (Jack Godell) and producer Michael Douglas ("Richard Adams") are excellent in their roles as well as the rest of the cast. I also loved not having scoring, it was very interesting to have a real glimpse behind the scenes of the TV industry - which should not be surprising. At the moment, Dan Rather is suing. CBS, and I hope he wins. Can you believe Donald Trump saying "he's a loser"? Trump - who cares? "Tib√©rio1234" posted a very good comment here - I agree. It's my opinion that being "vaporized" by a nuclear Spill is far better than living in a world that has been wasted, and becomes "Blade Runner" and / or "Solyent Green." Get out of your video games for a few hours and watch this movie "dated" (really is not t), and get a little education in nuclear power, I recommend to the whole family ....
