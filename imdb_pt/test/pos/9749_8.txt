My friend gives me these 3 huge boxes. "They're Flash Gordon series laserdiscs," he says. "I'm going to have some giant roller coasters," I say. But it's not like that. This series of rocks. (But I had to moan and moan to almost everyone I knew to find a laserdisc player for them). <br /> <br /> There's really a bit of everything in this series: There are lion men, male hawks, sharks, earthlings, and I think you would call in mongo-men. The sets and costumes match, Greek, Roman, Eastern, Egyptian and there are even armor like English knights. Awesome outfits. And part of it was a tumult. Those horrible socks with shorts worn by Zarkov are beyond description. And the guys in the oven scene seem to be wearing boxers. <br /> <br /> It is also funny how they renamed the octopus for an octosack, the orangutan for the orangapoid, and the tiger for a tigron. There is even a dragon (a creature similar to Godzilla that threatens Flash on some occasions before being killed). <br /> <br /> Do you like the Invisible Man? This has you covered. Do you like sword fights, wrestling (both animals and men), fist fights? Plenty for any taste. We have an underwater city, a city of the sky, a city on top of a mountain, and tons of secret passages and caves. <br /> <br /> Hokey Effects? Mass quantities. The city of heaven is supported by radio ovens, fed like old-time steamships. Rockets are "fueled" by fireworks and have constant backflights and / or buzzing noises. Many wires are visible holding things (like food when the flash was invisible and of course rockets). There are clouds in space, but none around the earth when seen from the Mongo. "Giant" lizards appear briefly. Fighting against sea creatures allegedly threaten Flash & co. on the way to the underwater city of sharks. The "gadgets" in Dr. Zarkov's lab give me a laugh. And they seem to be the same no matter what lab he is in (he worked in Ming's lab and Vultan). <br /> <br /> And yes, we have romance. Everyone wants Dale; Ming, Vultan, Flash. But at least one person wanted Princess Aura (Prince Baron), but not the person she would prefer. In fact, it seems that many of the intrigues involve the intrigue of Princess Aura to try to win Flash. <br /> <br /> Man, I think the characters are incredible. That fat, smiling knight, King Vultan, was hilarious. How he got those wings was pure art. And Ming! What can I say about Ming? He was perfect. They should have it for the Emperor in Starwars. Ming has to be my favorite character in this series. Princess Aura was also a small character. And she made it all right. I think she's a better actress than Dale Arden by a long way. Even the high priest had a distinct role. Zarkov was good, but not the strongest character - and he always stayed in the background during the fight scenes, holding Dale. Now we come to Flash: Flash, of course, was the strong point, the leader, the hero - and he did it well. Crabbe is a good actor and this role fits him perfectly. <br /> <br /> After watching this, I think I know where George Lucas got the main idea for Starwars. Look at this, you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> If you ever thought of watching an old series (or any serial), this should be your first choice. The only reason I did not give this 10 is because of some history holes that could have been easily fixed, the way the giant lizards just looked nailed there, and a couple of weak characters (king of sharks and king of lion men).
