A GOOD THING: This hidden treasure of a crime drama is incredibly entertaining from beginning to end. An example of a low-budget film, screenwriter / director Skip Woods apparently uses everything he could find (eg Lamborghini, supermodel, cow phone) and an ear for dialogue to add levels of satire to the plot and all /> <br /> OTHER GOOD THING: This movie seems to be made for the DVD era, with several segments making up a larger storyline (similar to the work of Tarantino and Desperado by Robert Rodriguez). Each "chapter" of the film features Thomas Jane's main character spending a day at home, finding fast and memorable performances by Aaron Eckhart, Glen Plummer, Mickey Rourke, Michael Jeter, James LeGros and an unforgettable role of Paulina Porizkova. <br /> <br /> SAME OTHER THING: It's not exactly a "good" thing, but incredibly shocking and memorable ... Anyone who sees this movie remembers an important scene. As much as Liberation is always remembered by Ned Beatty's terrible rape, Thursday will end up like the movie in which a woman violently rapes an unwilling man. Unforgettable. A BAD THING: The title makes people think this is somehow related (or derived) from the "Friday" series of Ice Cube movies. <br /> <br /> GRADE: A +
