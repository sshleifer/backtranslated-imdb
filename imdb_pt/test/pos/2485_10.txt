Realistic masterpiece. Thirty years later, the images may seem a bit old, but in fact, only the "fist-in-the-face" effect of the film is needed. I've never seen a film like this in my entire life. The first time I saw it, I did not know if it was a fiction ... And it did not seem ... That movie is a masterpiece that all the people in the world have to see. It's the best movie ever from society. The final movie that demonstrates that the system is inactive. And the system has not changed much in thirty years. I think this movie would have to be seen as a piece of education.
