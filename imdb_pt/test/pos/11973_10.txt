Watchers is a fun movie, if not taken very seriously, the novel written by Dean R. Koontz is obviously much better, but the film itself is entertaining in its own way. The film has many changes to the novel Watchers, the only difference being the main character Travis. In the book, he was an adult and a retired Delta Force soldier, while in the movie he is a teenager. Observers have their positives, the film has some bloody scenes in parts. I'm a fan of Micheal Ironside and it was cool to see him in this movie, he always does a great performance in all his films. The OXCOM costume looks a bit fancy, but the camera never shows the creature completely until the end of the movie. The Einstien dog was impressive since he was well trained. <br /> <br /> The film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a laboratory, a dog and a monster. Both experiments are telepathically linked, since the two animals are part of a military project where the dog would infiltrate an enemy base, so the creature would attack and eliminate them. The dog meets a teenager named Travis who takes him home and finds out he is smart and so he names the dog Einstein, while the OXCOM is wandering killing people and plucking their eyes, two government agents are sent to find the two experiments before incident is out of hand. Soon Travis discovers that it is not safe when OXCOM is attracted to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and no one, so Travis and his mother will rescue his girlfriend, who is being kept in hospital by the two agents. They then hide in the forest while Government agents and OXCOM are not far behind. Watchers is not a great adaptation of the novel by Dean R. Koontz, but it's a horror movie from the 80's, some fans of the book may not want to watch this, since it is not faithful to book, but horror movie fans of the '80s might want to check this out.
