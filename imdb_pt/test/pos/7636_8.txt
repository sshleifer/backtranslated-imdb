It is true that this is not a realistic story, but romantic comedy is not a genre that I seek for realism. What counts is that the characters are friendly and, when necessary, sexy. Shalom is beautiful and relaxed and Jake Weber is handsome in an impromptu way. They have enough chemistry to make the story believable in the area that counts, sexual attraction. I would love to see any of them in another movie. And yes, the clown is very cute too.
