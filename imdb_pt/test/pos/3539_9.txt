After reading the other commentary on this excellent TV drama, I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like assassinations, be serial and subscriber, and your British cops, and yell a lot, and the blood be bloody and have a religious lean, then that tightens every button. Not enough to put the scream on the rarefied heights of Sweeney, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the invited stars are also well-designed, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended. (In response to the previous comments, although I accept that 'Red' does not 'normally' run away from a run-in, he has just witnessed his brother arrested for murder, and I'm pretty sure he does not see the boy moving ...)
