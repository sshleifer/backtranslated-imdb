Gene Roddenberry has never disappointed his fans. His death wiped out the legacy of science fiction that will never be matched. Earth: The Final Conflict was the proof! His pilot film and the first 2 seasons were well written and meticulously produced, but somewhere along the way Roddenberry's touch was lost. The loss of leadership, Kevin Kilner (William Boone), definitely damaged the series, since he was a vital part of what did the job. The story involves the human race being visited by the Taelons, an extraterrestrial race that is titled "The Companions". After 3 years, they gave new technologies, useful information about the Universe and more. Many question their intentions here on Earth. The main link on Earth between the races is Da'an (Leni Parker) and he is for many, the Taelon more reliable. Questions arise: just because they are here? What are your goals, Da'an is aware of any suspicions against humans? There is a clandestine group led by industrialist millionaire Jonathan Doors (David Hemblen), who uses his millions to investigate the Taelons. By the end of Season One, things are going well, Da'an looks confident, Boone assists Doors in his investigation while working with Da'an and the Taelons as a liaison. In the middle of Season 2, things began to unfold and the once-formidable and fascinating series descended, mainly because Roddenberry had died and was not around to guide the producers, of whom his wife, Majel Barrett-Roddenberry, was co-producer. Still, the first season remains intriguing and fun to watch.
