This is by far one of the best biographical films of recent times. I go so far as to put it there with Ray and The Aviator. It is the story of a young bi-racial boy who lives in a boarding house run by the incredible Miss Rachael, also known as "Nanny." You'll fall in love with Nanny, a woman who gives her all of herself to those around her. S. Epatha Merkerson brings the character to life beautifully, and the other cast members do the same. If I were to praise each actor for the way they did their roles, I would have to mention everyone in the cast. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie blends perfectly with the story, almost dictated the way. And what's more, this movie is really fun. It will not bother you, even for a minute! <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to spend an evening at home watching a movie of very intelligent and very fun quality.
