My one-line summary suggests that this is not a good movie, but that's not true. I liked the movie, but I was probably expecting a lot. <br /> <br /> Adele, who is solidly portrayed by Susan Sarandon, did not come off as a very nice character. She is fickle and irresponsible for what would be an unforgivable degree, were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter. That's the only thing she knows how to do without failing. Adele's daughter, Anna, is a sad girl who is so busy making up for her mother's shortcomings that she does not seem to be only 14-17 years old. This, of course, makes Natalie Portman the perfect choice to play Anna, since she never seems to be between 14 and 17 years old. Portman takes this role so easily that you almost forget that she has not made movies for 20 years. However, even with the two solid tracks, Wayne Wang never seems to attract audiences, as he did with The Joy Luck Luck and even more with Smoke. Although I have not read the book, the film seems to have made the necessary changes in the story to bring it to the big screen, changes that can drain the emotional poignancy of the story. I liked the movie for the fun of seeing two wonderful actresses doing their job, but I never got lost in the experience and never related to their situation.
