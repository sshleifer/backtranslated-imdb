A very interesting addition to the Scandinavian surrealist collection. Recommended view for those who like their complicated movies. My interpretation of the "strange" ending would be that Andreas's journey ends in Hell. He does not like the vacuum of purgatory driven by the consumer; a kind of "live", but not progress, that is, get nowhere - not even the city's subway trains stop at the stations. It has a subway system, as you should be able to travel, freedom, escape, but you can never really board these trains. He is unable to reach the perfumed sensory sky and ends up continuing his bus journey to his final destination. The old Norse version of Hell (Hades, NOT Hell, Earth City) is not burning like the British version, its cold, freezing, the land of Niflheim (land of cold and mists). This seems to be the place where Andreas ended, having just failed to access Heaven through that tunnel.
