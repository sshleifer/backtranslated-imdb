I accept ... let's see. The only reason I had chosen to see this movie was the hot dog shown in commercials when Shrader (sp?) Said: "ASK ME ABOUT MY WEINER". After that I had to see this movie and I watched it with a couple of my friends ... and amazing WOW. One of the best movies of the year. The whole movie I was laughing like crazy! The plot in this story is that Bartleby (Justin Long) is not accepted in any of the schools he applied, so he makes another fake college for him and his friends so he can cheat on his parents that he turned into college. . Then he gives the finishing touches and deceives his parents ... until more students look at the site and see the clicker (ACCEPTANCE IS A CLICK OUT) and all those rejected come to this school. They face many problems and they just can not get anything right 10/10 NOW WANTED TO WATCH IT
