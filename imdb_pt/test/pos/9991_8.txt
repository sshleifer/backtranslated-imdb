At 20, Francis Ouimet (Shia Lebouf) all his life ahead of him - in a way. The son of an immigrant family living in the United States from the late 19th century to the early 20th century, class was a very limiting fact of life. If one is born poor, he remains poor; if one is born into the bourgeoisie, he has a little opportunity; if someone is born in the rich class, they essentially do it in the shade. British gold champion Harry Vardon and Francis' golf idol (played by the underrated Stephen Dillane) is the exception that confirms the rule. Born and raised in a poor British family, his golfing skills allowed him to rise from the dirt of the poorer shantytowns to the lush greens of English country clubs. He has not forgotten this life lesson. Francisco wants to follow in the footsteps of Vardon and likewise uses his great golfing ability to enter the 1913 US Open at age 20. But a tough turn and formidable opponents (including Harry's idol, Harry Vardon) are not all Francis needs to deal with. a less understanding father and a cruel social background are in his way of living his own dream. <br /> <br /> I know what you're thinking - I also thought - a movie produced by Walt Disney about the 1913 US Open starring the cranky Shia LaBeouf has the possibility to be fun, but it can not be a big movie. Well, I'm here to encourage you to think again. Despite what it seems for some on paper, the biggest game ever played is one of the best sports movies in the making. <br /> <br /> As with every great sports movie, the biggest game ever played includes many thrilling sports scenes but it's not a movie about golf - it's a character-centered movie about using the talents, following the own dreams and get out of class barriers. Where the biggest game ever played works great as a themed sports movie, it also works just as well as a vintage movie - the costumes and movie sets are the next best thing to travel in real time. The film also simply looks great and virtually unknown music composer Brian Tyler set the film for a wonderful piece of music. The cast is great also with a subtle but powerful Stephen Dillane as British champion golf Harry Vardon, the hilarious Stephen Marcus as the man golfer Ted Ray, a hammy Josh Flitter as the pre-adolescent caddy Eddie and a surprisingly good Shia LaBeouf in the leading role as Francis. Actor Bill Paxton (Apollo 13, Titanic) becomes director here for the second time (directing a feature film) in The Greatest Game Ever Played. It produces a great product - incorporating lots of heart, ingenuity and attention to detail in the film's production.
