I just got back from seeing Black Snake Moan. I had spent time reading reviews ... most seemed to focus on the obvious ... "skinny white girl chained to the radiator of a black man" ... I hate it when "critics" miss the point of a movie. Now I suppose it helps to live in Memphis ... and to have lived in Mississippi a few times as well. It may also help that I am the former director of the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale ... but I get this movie. Brewer's simple "tale of redemption" is easy to follow and could have had several themes to tell the story ... but I believe it is highly effective as a "blues". It would be my hope that people would not read all the hype ... and / or various reviews ... and miss a really good movie. Overcome the various things, like skinny girls in white panties ... pass by Justin Timberlake, accept your character Ronnis (which he plays very well) ... overcome "Snakes on a Plane" and see how the Samuel L. Jackson mercuric is ... as he turned into a very believable mid-south blues man. If you know little about Mid-South culture, a lot of what's going on may seem a bit caricatured ... but accept the fact that Craig Brewer KNOW how to paint the screen and let the actors tell the story and you'll enjoy this movie. Not one to say final ... then go see this movie ... and yes, I'll agree to something that critics have hit ... the music is wonderful!
