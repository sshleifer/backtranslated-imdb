I saw this movie when I was much younger, but it caught me. I loved Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so caught up in the love story of Orry and Madenline. I'm a hopeless romantic so this really affected me. I especially enjoyed it when he met her. I just wanted him to have more time with her and her baby. So you know in Book 3 that I was so hurt that he died. I really did not understand this because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie. I just bought all three books together and I can not stop seeing them. My 12 year old son is stuck in it. He likes the fight in the war. I cry every time. I'd like to meet Patrick and Madeline personally! It was a wonderful movie and cast!
