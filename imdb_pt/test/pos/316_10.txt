During the final period of the Vitnam War, our central character, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent by the CIA on an illegal man's mission to assassinate a renegade US Navy commander, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who allegedly "completely insane", but is successfully blocking a private cross-border war from its base in Cambodia, a neutral country and therefore off limits. <br /> <br /> The whole narrated story of what Willard sees and does as he is transported down the Da Nang by an undisciplined and terrified naval patrol crew to assassinate Kurtz is a great metaphor for excesses, decay, and finally weakness of the Anglo-Saxon psyche: If we do not understand something, and we are unable to control it, we exterminate it. Kurtz finally came to know that. <br /> <br /> Unless you pay close attention to all the emotional gestures, every word of dialogue between the protagonists, especially in the scene where the two are alone in the darkness of Kurtz. lair, you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible movie. Kurtz's subtle agreement with his executioner, his unilateral "surrender" in exchange for Willard to agree (he nodded?) To tell Kurtz's "son" (another metaphor for us, the next generation, those watching the movie) the truth about all the horrors they had both seen in Vietnam, are things that expand the mind. The bond between the two men, while Kurtz interrogates Willard - entwined with some of his own horror stories, is incredible, or rather, brilliant, cinematic. The final (intercalated) scene of the ritual slaughter of a sacrificial bull is the most powerful of symbols. Coppolla did, intentionally or not, the last statement against the war, which must resonate through time.
