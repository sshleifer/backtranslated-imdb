The Railway Children is perhaps my all-time favorite movie simply for the brilliant cast's performance, the warm and human interaction of the three children and the people they find living near the railroad in the beautiful English countryside. Jenny Augutter is especially credible in her role as "Bobbie," her older brother Phyllis and brother Peter. The adventures they discover and the relationships formed in their new home and surroundings are very real and fascinating. a part of the vast history of Britain and the soundtrack is very touching. This comforting film never fails to bring tears to my eyes, every time, just as it makes me homesick. I often wonder if I should have been born at that time, because I think it would have fitted me well, since people treated each other. with such chivalry and decency. <br /> <br /> In short, I regard this film as something of a masterpiece and must-see for anyone who feels "sensitive or caring". Edith Nesbit wrote this story around the beginning of the 1900s and what a wonderful story it is. More kids today need to read this or watch the movie instead of playing violent video games. If we had more movies of this nature, the world would become a better place.
