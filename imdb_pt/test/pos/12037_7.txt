The Turner Classic Movie Channel spent the month of January making the movies of one of my favorite actors, Robert Montgomery. His films are rarely seen these days, except for those who have been atypical for most of his career - which means that the roles that frequently reappear on television are: they were expensive, the lady at the lake, June bride, night should fall, the Saxon CHARM, RIDE THE PINK HORSE, RAGE IN HEAVEN, THE EARL OF CHICAGO (in short, the films he fought to get the roles because they were not the usual comic snitches in which he usually appeared ). It's ironic that today, when you think of Montgomery's career, it's the movies that were made mostly after 1937 - those that broke the original image that MGM and Louis B. Mayer pushed. The pity is that Montgomery was a talented comedian and saved many movies from being routine. <br /> <br /> PETTICOAT FEVER is one such film. Made in 1936 with PICADILLY JIM and TROUBLE FOR TWO, it was a good year of Montgomery good performances, and helped bring him the ability to convince MGM's powers to allow him to play "Danny" at NIGHT. year. <br /> <br /> PETTICOAT FEVER is set in Labrador, and Montgomery is a weather station operator named Dascom Dinsmore. He has lived there for five years and has not been with a woman (except Inuit women) for most of the time. He has a girlfriend named Clara (Winifred Shotter) whom he proposed, but it's been two years since he heard of her, so he believes she gave up on him. <br /> <br /> Dinsmore's world is shaken when Sir James Felton and Irene Campton (Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy) appear. They were flying to Toronto for a business meeting that Felton should address. Felton is engaged to Campton, but Dinsmore finds her charming ... and gradually she finds him equally attractive. Certainly the pompous, self-important, and hopelessly awkward Felton is not competition (it's a measure of Owen's acting that he keeps the character entertained, even though it's hard to believe that such a chest is a Canadian captain in the industry). /> <br /> There is something surreal about this movie - probably due to the original game. While the "Labrador" scenario is quite false, it serves the purpose of comedy (witness the polar bear sequence). But the pinnacle of surrealism is the dinner Dinsmore serves to his guests, a dinner of "pemmican steaks," which Owen eats with gusto. Owen (a smaller nobleman like a baronet) is dressed in normal clothes - a winter suit for the weather). But Montgomery is dressed in his gown (as if he were attending a ball at the embassy). Loy, seeing him dress, also puts on a dress. They are being served by Dinsmore's assistant servant, Inuit Kimo (Otto Yamaoka), who is also wearing an evening outfit - this is the case for Owen! Owen, who previously insisted that Dinsmore transform into clothes more suited to his station, is the only person who is improperly dressed for this dinner !! Montgomery was MGM's most elegant actor in a tuxedo or evening dress (Franchot Tone was his closest rival). It's a movie thing if Montgomery or Fred Astaire was the most elegant figure in such facts. Difficult to decide. <br /> <br /> The course of love does not move smoothly in comedy or drama. Clara appears (we're warned too early about this at the beginning of the movie, when we see her on a red ship). Will Dinsmore break up with Clara? Will Irene break with Felton? The movie is funny, and Loy and Montgomery make a good couple. They appeared together in another film, and both were in separate scenes in a second, before this movie. But this would be their last movie together. <br /> <br /> One last interesting point - at the beginning of the movie, when the credits are displayed, you see illustrations of men and women in comical situations. They are based on the art work of John Held Jr., the great cartoonist / illustrator of the 1920s and 1930s - who was the flapper recorder and "Jazz Age." It's an unusual choice - since it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot of the film or with the Labrador.
