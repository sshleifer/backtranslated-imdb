Black Water, co-directed and written by David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki, is very simple in its execution, but effective. The film is a low-budget Australian film that unfortunately will not have the recognition it deserves because, as far as creature characteristics are concerned, this is one of the best there is. The setup is pretty basic; Grace, her husband Adam and her younger sister Lee are touring some mangroves in the Northern Territory when a saltwater crocodile throws their boat and leaves them trapped in the trees. The whole movie is about their survival while the crocodile is lurking waiting to attack. Unlike Greg McLean's Rogue (another killer movie previously released in 2007), Black Water is not about the public having fun guessing who will be eaten next, hopefully and pray for the three people to leave safely. <br /> <br /> The three unknown actors do a great job with very demanding roles, considering that they were filmed locally with a real crocodile instead of CGI. The characters act realistically in the situation and the dialogue seems natural and not forced. The suspense is accumulated throughout the film, we do not see much creature, but just knowing that it is close is terrifying enough. This is the best for you and is highly recommended if you like original and (most important) scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> 4/5
