When I looked at this movie one more time, I think it belongs to Hitchcock's greatest films. The first time I saw this, I was impressed by the suspense, action and images. It has the exciting ending, the insane killer, the innocent man framed or victimized by circumstances, some great pictures on the spot, for example. the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, and Penn Central in New York. Also has great supporting actors with Hitch's daughter, Patricia, in the role of Ruth Roman's younger sister and the robust Leo G. Carroll in another of his Hitchcock films. The episode of the carousel near the end is one of the most stressful in Hitchcock's work. <br /> <br /> Robert Walker as Bruno Anthony (his last full length film) gives a great performance as the unbalanced Stranger on the Train, which gets into the life of the unsuspecting tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger). Granger plays the cool guy who gets caught up in a messy divorce. The movie opens with the camera showing the shoes of two separate men as they leave their taxis to board the train. Eventually they meet and history takes over. The stranger has an unusual interest in the tennis star and, as the film continues, the stranger becomes a stalker. The action shifts from one place to another, including Washington, the fictional little town of Metcalf, the Forest Hills tennis championship, and a passenger train taking the two leading men back and forth on separate missions. In the end, the rhythm of a game of tennis is entwined in the plot as they race against time. The camera cuts the faces of the athletes as they fly and serve in a remarkable series of shots. When the much disputed dispute ends, the climatic persecution happens. Hitchcock is very fond of trains and it's great to see Penn Station a long time ago. Trains are featured in the 39 Steps, Lady Disappears, Shadow of a Doubt, Charmed, North by Northwest and this movie. <br /> <br /> This classic Hitchcock thriller happened at the beginning of a period of great creativity for the master of suspense - the 1950s and I am convinced that one day will be given due success in the Hall of Fame Hitchcock . .
