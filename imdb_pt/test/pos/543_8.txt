Chick Flick? Of course ... Has it been done before? Often .... Predictable? Yes ..... Is it worth watching? You bet! I was charmed by the portraits of Sarandon and Portman of characters who are not characters in a family story. I'm a big fan of mother / daughter stories. What makes the difference between the good and the weak are the performances and development of the character. Although this is not the best of the genre, I'll buy it and watch it again. I felt that the characters were believable and the acting was superior.
