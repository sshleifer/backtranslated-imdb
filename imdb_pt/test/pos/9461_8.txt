I think a person would be well advised to read or see (I prefer to read) "Twelfth Night" before seeing, or re-seeing "She is the man". The movie is good by itself, but comparing the two, and looking for jokes makes it a lot more fun. Shakespeare was inspired by others. I think he would give a positive signal. Harld Bloom said in "Shakespeare, The Invention of the Human Being," that most people in "Twelfth Night" need to be locked. Malvolio, the person Malcolm relies on, is not for any good reason. The people in "She's The Man" are sensible in contrast. For example, Duke Orsino is much more frivolous than the Duke of Orsino. It also shows that a man can have feelings without being gay. It exhibits a lot of self-control. <br /> <br /> It's a teenage comedy (a clean), so it does not have the dark edges of the play. For example, Olivia in the play is mourning the death of her brother. In the movie, she was evicted. <br /> <br /> If you like Sir Andrew and Sir Toby in the play, they do not have the same attention in the movie. <br /> <br /> Jokes are often quick. The surname of the hairdresser Pauls is given once. It's Antonio. Many people who read the play say that Antonio has more love for a man than just friendship. The deep love among men was noticed in those days. Some see a sexual side - homosexuality was illegal. <br /> <br /> The only line of the piece that I picked up was when Duke Orsino quotes the coach in greatness during the Soccar game. In the play, says Malv√≥lio, citing Maria).
