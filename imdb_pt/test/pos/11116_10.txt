This movie has become an icon of what's great about America. <br /> <br /> Fame is famous for its music and performances. There are several prominent actors, singers and dancers, including Irene Cara, Paul McCrae, Anne Meara * and the superb Gene Anthony Ray. The plot is not the movie. It follows an interesting format ... but, everything really ends in a kind of porridge. <br /> <br /> Where Parker manages to push that film into a periodic overdrive - with the moving, sometimes cute, straightforward soundtrack and direct performances. <br /> <br /> The film's climax is a music-dance festival of musicians, dancers and score by Christopher Gore. A wonder to behold. <br /> <br /> An interesting note about the magnificent and superbly talented Anne Meara ... sometimes the talent must reside in the genes ... Meara is married to a Jerry Stiller and is the mother of Ben Stiller. ..
