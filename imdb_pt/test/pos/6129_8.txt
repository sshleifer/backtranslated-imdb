Like those who heard radio reports about the Pearl Harbor attack, everyone who has seen PINK FLAMINGOS can tell exactly where they were when they first saw him - and about thirty years later, the film is still one of the most elusive. vile, nasty, repulsive and funny hilarious movies put on celluloid, guaranteed to test the strongest stomachs and the most difficult funny bones. Filmed on a budget close to zero and some of the shakiest cinematography around, Pink Flamingos tells the story of two families competing for the tabloid title "The Filthiest People Alive." How filthy can they be? Many: The film includes everything from sex with chickens to what I can only describe as a remarkable demonstration of rectal control to a great help of doo puppy, and I guarantee you will not want to eat an egg for at least several weeks after seeing it, O. <br /> <br /> The cast is wonderful, atrocious or atrociously wonderful, depending on how you see it. The star, of course, is Divine ... and to describe Divine as the GREATEST drag queen on the planet would be the euphemism of the year. She is a gigantic creature given BIG eye makeup, GREAT orange hair and GREAT expressions - she is the Charleton Heston trawling, and if she is nearly running in a hallway, stopping to use the bathroom on someone's front lawn, or By surprising real-life shoppers by taking a stroll along a Baltimore sidewalk, it's indescribably indescribably funny. Others in the cast include Mary Vivian Pearce, Danny Mills and the always scary Edith Massey as members of the Divine family; and Mink Stole and David Lochary as the couple of white slaves, who sell babies, who defy the status of Divine. <br /> <br /> It must be pretty obvious that Pink Flamingos is not exactly a movie that will appeal to everyone, and viewers who know director John Waters only through later films like HAIRSPRAY and CRYBABY will have a big impact. But if you want to see something so completely different that even Monty Python could not imagine, this is the movie for you. Just make sure you eat before you see it because you probably will not want to eat afterwards - and you may want to keep a barf bag handy just in case. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
