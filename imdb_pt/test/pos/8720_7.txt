The swinging bachelor Matthau, a successful dentist, is cornering over his blonde lover Hawn, having told her that he is a married man with three children. After she attempts suicide, Matthau decides to take responsibility and marry the girl. Concerned that she will be a "homebreaker," Hawn wants to meet his wife and explain everything to her. Matthau employs his faithful nurse Bergman to act as a wife and that's where things really get complicated. <br /> <br /> A ridiculous comedy with irresistible leads almost always hits the mark, but it's not believable for a second. The script asks us to believe that we men are so one-dimensional that it's truly unbelievable. But perhaps this comedy does not have to be analyzed very deeply, just relax and enjoy the ever-so-funny Matthau, the ever-so-charming Bergman and Rookie Hawn, who here basically created the role of the dumb blonde girl.
