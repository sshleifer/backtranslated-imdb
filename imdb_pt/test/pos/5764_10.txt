It may not be Oscar material, however this was a very funny movie. I've always been a fan of Eddie (Edmondson) and Richie (Mayall). "Bottom" and "Young Ones" were legendary TV series, and it was time to make a movie. Some of the things they do is bright, from the pencil to the back up to the rubber pants, as well as the infamous line that Richie says when he falls and a candle he carries enters his eye. He tells Eddie "Candle in the Eye, Candle in the Eye," and Eddie was the simpleton he is, sticks the candle he's carrying in his eyes. Can not forget when Eddie is on his bike, and he needs to urinate ... It was a great comedy, not to be taken seriously, but the film did not have a ridiculous ending. <br /> <br /> Overall, an excellent comedy, full of laughter and very vomit green fake. 9/10. <br /> <br />
