This movie was original in a non-original way. Although many films have addressed the subject of suicide and mental institutions, it was always a question of treating and improving patients because of the doctor's assistance, however, in this film, we follow a depressed guy who falls in love with a suicidal girl and goes stop at nothing to make her happy, even if she does not care about happiness, she just wants to die. This was a very interesting novel comedy that in no way less than enjoyable. This is a fun to check out if you ever had the chance, you just have to be open minded about the material. Overall I give a 6.4, I just voted 9 to get a higher rating :)
