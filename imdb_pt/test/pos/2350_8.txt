The plot: Michael Linnett Connors did everything in movies, but straightforward, and is looking for his first big chance. He discovers Molly in one play and soon knows she will be a great movie star. He signs it for a contract with the stipulation he must address. The producer agrees and his great careers are in progress. What follows is a re-creation of the silent film era and early sound films with great emphasis on comedy. And, yes, yes, there is romance and a little sadness too. The performances of Don Ameche and Alice Fay are top notch. The music is a real plus as well with some old familiar music heard. Many DVD extras also in this restored version released in 2008. It should be emphasized that this film is a story first, not just a tribute to silent films. Later years would bring similar films, such as Singin 'in the Rain (1952) and Dick Van Dyke-Carl Reiner, The Comic (1969). What is special about this movie, however, is to recreate dumb movies in 1939. We see parts of them as the movie audience in that last era (though some sound effects are included) in glorious b & w while the rest of the film is in pure color. One of the greatest in the age of silence, Buster Keaton, who at this time was on a steep climb, is superbly used in two scenes re-created in silent films and he is at the top of his game! It is said that he had some input into his scenes as well. But the real reason to watch the movie, if you're a fan of movies, is that after all, Hollywood Cavalcade is Mack Sennett's film legacy. It does not take a genius to realize that this film is a "positive" overhaul of the life of Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand. The character Michael "Linnett" Connors is Mack Sennett, whose real name was Michael Sinnott. And Molly, of course, is Mabel. Sennett had the pie throws, the bath beauties and the Keystone Cops. He worked with Buster Keaton, Ben Turpin (cameo), Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle (double body) and fell in love with its protagonist. Not only that, but Sennett was technical advisor for this movie and appears in it as well. As most moviegoers today prefer sound features, those who were associated with short subjects and silences are left out to graze. As Mack Sennett fell into this category, it's fortunate that there's Hollywood Cavalcade! Sennett was, of course, very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in the movies. His career began in 1908 as an actor, then writer, director and producer. He semi retired in 1935 with about 500 movies to his credit. He worked with the best, such as Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, Bing Crosby, W.C. Fields, Keaton, Harry Langdon, Arbuckle, and even Roy Rogers (in Way Up Thar). Because film comedy is an extremely difficult road to pursue throughout a career, Mack played smart and did only a selective job for the next 25 years. In 1931 he received an Academy Award in the short category and another in 1937 for a lifetime of work. In the 1940s, his presence was still felt, and. Here Come the Co-Eds (1945), where a re-creation of the oyster soup scene used in Mack's Wandering Willies (1926) is made. In 1947, The Road to Hollywood, used some of Sennett's Crosby movies. 2 years later brought some nostalgia with the film Down Memory Lane in which participated. With his way of always associating with the right people, a guest role with the eternal folk Lawrence Welk and his radio program came later this year. 1950 brought a re-release of his greatest triumph, Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914) with sound. In 1952, he was honored on TV, this is his life, then his autobiography, The King of Comedy (1954), which is a great piece of companion to Hollywood Cavalcade, has been published. 1955 brought a more concrete association with Abbott & Costello, as he had a special participation in A & C Meet the Keystone Kops. Finally, in 1957, another tribute to the compilation film, The Golden Age of Comedy. So when you watch Hollywood Cavalcade, it's the legacy of a movie pioneer. In the movie on the banquet scene, the camera slides over the guests at a long table. When we got to the silver-haired Mack, he just turned his head toward the camera as if to say, "Here I am!" When he gets up to make a speech a little later, he gets more subdued, underestimating the words given to him as if to convey mentally: "I know my influence in the comedy will never end, but people will forget Mack Sennett of the individual. this movie will help.
