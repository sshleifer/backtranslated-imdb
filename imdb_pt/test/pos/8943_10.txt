I think this movie deserves 10 out of 10 because it's hilariously funny from start to finish. The plot is simple and straightforward, but it keeps you watching and there are so many laughs that you really start to love it. When I went to see this movie, I had not heard much about it and did not know what to expect. I thought it would be some kind of old lady movie like Calendar Girls or something, but it took me completely by surprise. Although I am still a teenager and the film has probably not been targeted to my age group, I still find it great and I think people of all age groups would like it. I think it's a pity that it's not at all famous and deserves more publicity for more people to see and realize what a great movie it is.
