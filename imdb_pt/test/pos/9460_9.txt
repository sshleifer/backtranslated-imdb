I got this movie right in my eyes when I was going through a poster hall at the upcoming movie theater. The slogan was kind of confusing and immediately after reading I thought of the possibility of being similar to the Dorm Daze of the National Lampoon. I liked this movie, in addition to having a huge collection of such genres, I decided to go to the cinemas soon after my exams for a tension puller. <br /> <br /> Delicately, I came out smiling from cheek to cheek and had an equally large amount of laughter at bits and pieces of the movie. Amanda Bynes definitely started better than Keira Knightley in Bend It Like Beckham. Being a male and female actor is definitely not that easy, especially having to face the similarities of life along with the reactions that the actress has to answer. This movie requires a lot of confusion to confuse you and the viewers at the same time. The only way to achieve this is through this movie. <br /> <br /> The director is obviously unhealthy hilarious in a serious way, the girls are equally sexy and beautiful and the actors too. I recommend this movie to everyone who needs a weekend relaxation and do not worry, you'll get laughs throughout the movie. It is a definite guarantee.
