The first season told very well how all elements of the Marine Corps would operate (ie, solo, air, helicopters and jets) as a team. This is the season I give the high rating for! (It is true that there are still many "freedoms" taken in Season 1, but the stories were more convincing.) The following seasons were a grisly attempt by Melrose Place to meet the Top Gun! <br /> <br /> I was a Marine based at Miramar at the time and I remember them filming the show around the San Diego area. I talked to Rod Rowland and James Brolin. <br /> <br /> Rowland's character was good to go. <br /> <br /> Brolin's character was good only in the first season. For some reason, he loosened after the first ep of the second season. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a LITTLE how the Marine Air Ground crew operates, then the first season is the one to watch. <br /> <br /> If you're at Melrose Place and novel as plot with an attempt to merge them into the Top Gun, see the last two seasons.
