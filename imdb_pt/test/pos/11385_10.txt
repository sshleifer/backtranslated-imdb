This is a classic that will be able to withstand the drama that is to come, simply by being filmed in the style of the 70's and being a story about the 70's. It's funny, action-packed, fun and sad at the same time. It has the effect of pulling you into the lives of these poor people and the consequences of their actions. 4 STARS!
