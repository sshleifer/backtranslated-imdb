I went to this movie with no idea what to expect. I actually took a date for it in the theaters when it first came out. We both enjoyed it very much and it helped to have someone to talk to about it after seeing it. <br /> <br /> I only recommend watching this movie if you enjoy unconventional movies. It is not as disjointed as Liquid Sky or as fanciful as the Forbidden Zone. The original plot is very easy to follow. There is a lot of subtle humor. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief summary of the plot if you are completely lost: a "big brother" type government watches over everyone in society. Suddenly, a new person appears and there is no data on him (he seems insane). It may or may not be the second coming of Christ. The cautious government goes into a frenzy to find it and discover its true motives. The ruler is also obsessed with immortality. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are frantic, while others are completely unobtrusive. We follow the main character when he meets all different types of people in society. <br /> <br /> I did not need my altered consciousness to enjoy the movie, but I know some of my friends felt that helped. The split was also filmed around Santa Cruz and San Francisco.
