I watch a lot of movies. Many movies. Getting a graduate degree requires you to watch 2-3 movies a day for years. Everything becomes very exhausting. Especially because I feel like I've seen everything. So rare is I to be surprised at something, mostly I expect to see something as good as I hope it is. <br /> <br /> The bed of death is so unlike anything I've ever experienced that I had to stop the DVD to complain about its genius. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the play is psychotic. It is structured in a way that forces the viewer to stay out of the picture. It's not like something like Halloween, with all its editing and POV photos; The bed of death, in fact, seems somewhat dreamy. The most pretentious way I can say is: this is Samuel Beckett making a haunted house movie. I mean, it's a manic depressive bed that eats people! And fried chicken! In the middle of nowhere! And it has bone hands! I can barely articulate my feelings about this movie. And yes, copping to like that will open up the ridiculous. But things get real even after some time. It's hard being a movie buff and consistently being compromised. I can honestly say that this is a totally original movie up and down. From what it is to how it is assembled. We need movies like this, movies that will take us out of our complacency. Consider it as an existential field. it's fun and it's stupid but also brilliant in its strange way. The worst horror villain of all time? Maybe, but at least it's not a guy with a mask.
