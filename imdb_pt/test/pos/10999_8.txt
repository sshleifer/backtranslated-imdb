The Squire of Gothos is one of the "silly" episodes of Star Trek and therefore one of the most fun. The entertainment factor is, in general, fueled by the impasse between William Shatner and the hilarious guest star of the episode, William Campbell. <br /> <br /> During an unspecified routine mission, Sulu suddenly disappears into the air, and Kirk follows soon after-wards. Spock immediately begins to search for his missing colleagues (and despite hating to admit it, friends), while the two stranded crewmembers must deal with the mysterious, all-powerful and extravagant Trelane (Campbell), the self-proclaimed squire of Gothos, a being capable of creating or destroying anything he wants through the pure power of his mind. At first glance, the plot may seem to be recycled from previous episodes (honestly, is there any science fiction show? That did not have at least one divine character), but that feeling quickly disappears thanks to the exaggerated use of humor in the script, all transmitted through of Campbell's deliberate performance: his Trelane is essentially the Trek version of a spoiled child. the body of an adult, while his curiosity fueled by ignorance for the human race (his knowledge is quite limited) probably served as an inspiration to Gene Roddenberry when he emerged with the Q character for the Next Generation pilot about two decades later This episode was aired. <br /> <br /> In short, the key to appreciating The Squire of Gothos is this: "silly" is not necessarily equal to "bad."
