First of all, I must point out that I really enjoyed watching this documentary. Not only did she have good music, but the outlets and editing were wonderful, too. However, all these positive things about the film do not change the fact that it touches the orientalist clich√© "East and West" that bothers many Turks like me. Okay, this movie tells the story of traditional Turkish and contemporary music in a very elegant way which is a good thing, something that would show ignorant Europeans and Americans that this country is not just about the murder of Armenians and Kurds. However, the problematic of the film is that it looks at what it defines as "east" of the eyes of the "west." That is to say, as a jazz musician says in the film, there may be no east or west, maybe it is just a myth, a lie created by the ruling leaders of "western" countries in order to keep alive the fear and hostility so that they could continue to rule the world and "keep cash flow"? <br /> <br /> Why do not you think about it?
