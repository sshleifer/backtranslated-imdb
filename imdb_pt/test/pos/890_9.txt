With all due respect to Joel Fabiani and Rosemary Nicolls and their characters, Department S will forever be associated with Peter Wyngarde's Jason King. <br /> <br /> Most people remember him as this camp, flamboyant and womanizer cum detective in the Austin Powers mold, but this will do a disservice to the character: He is much more subtle than that. Jason King is lazy (he often lets Stewart fight all the bad guys and only plays tokens in the end.), he's selfish (his appreciation of people is based on whether they read his novels or not) , much of his detective work is speculation with no facts to support them and he sulks whenever Annabelle is right ... and she often is. He is clearly a man having a middle-aged crisis and drinking records, but ....... Jason King is brilliant. If Wyngarde had played him purely as a dashing hero, it would not have worked, but he often shows King as a paper tiger, led by his libido, love of elegance and propensity to grandstand (and this disrupts his detective work. , but it has some of the best lines and puts in the history of TV. And by not interpreting it as whiter than white, the chemistry and interactions between the three main characters is even better. Watching DVD again recently, you can see how much Wyngarde Depth has put in Jason King.
