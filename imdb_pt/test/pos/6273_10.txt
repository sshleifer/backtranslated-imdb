Expectacular second part of the ACTOR !! Quickly directed by JOE D'AMATO, expert on all sorts of subgenres (subgenres) of exploration, and played again by MILES O'KEEFFE. The Debian movie budget is paltry or minimal. Although not a better film than its predecessor, but not entertained, the ACTOR 2 also has something, something that makes it more innovative. Its introduction you prop explains the origin of the ATOR for us with images of the first part. The script is incredible, it's like any comic from the brilliant ROY THOMAS. has such fantastic elements within the world of the SWORD and such FANTASY as invisible men, black lords, cannibals - monkeys ... the role of the villain whom he interpreted brilliant. The final this fight very well. lacking more violence and blood, but this good. It never gets boring. It has everything that was missing. ACTOR 1. Enjoy it with my self !! 4/5
