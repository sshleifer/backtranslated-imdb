My first review on IMDB, after a few years of using this site constantly ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, I saw this in the tube the other night, I loved it. It is in the mindset of Dangerous Minds or Substitutes, but much better. It was for a certain moment that Rex was Speedy Levitch in Waking Life, but after checking, it does not look like that. <br /> <br /> I can see why many have problems with this plot and their poetry, but I also think these people are closed. Of course, the end was not quite what I expected, but overall it was so unique and well represented that I can not complain. I would not call it tacky, as one reviewer did, left the scene better than most 80's movies did. And they refrained from playing any really dated 80s music. <br /> <br /> I can not remember everything that made me smile when I saw this, but basically it showed realistically very creative individuals surrounded by mediocrity, and if I share the Rex beliefs or not, I love original attempts to describe the meaning of life. And his Mutant theory is, to my knowledge, original. He dived a lot too, but they showed how confused he was sometimes, and why he might have some psychological problems. And then, in his moments of clarity, he was an extraordinary philosopher, a person who realized the small details of life and tried to express them. <br /> <br /> I was also very impressed with John Savage as a teacher. Usually, actors fail in this role. He brought it out brilliantly. <br /> <br /> If you liked Waking Life, I say watch this movie if you have a chance. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> pk
