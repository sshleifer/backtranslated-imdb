This movie was a surprise. The plot synopsis sounds strange and starring Clint Eastwood and the great Geraldine Page. I did not know what to expect. There is that opening scene where the wounded soldier says that the age of 12 is old enough to kiss and continues to give a child a persistent, very adult kiss from mouth to mouth. The child takes him to the boarding school where he lives. He takes advantage of the situation by trying to seduce the director, played by Page, his assistant and another student. Envy, sexual tension, incest, intrigue and macabre merge into this wonderfully original story. <br /> <br /> I read the other comments here and I find little to disagree with. However, I wanted to clarify a point made earlier that there are no friendly characters in the movie. I think there is one. The attractive female slave successfully resists the soldier's advances in a scene that works well because it touches on the common history of black slave women taken advantage of by white men. Even if her strength and lack of illusion are the sum total of her experience, she is what I would consider a nice character. She, more than any other woman and girl in the school, has a legitimate reason to participate in what happens in the end.
