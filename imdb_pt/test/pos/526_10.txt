Never, ever, have I been so impressed with a movie as this little article on four groups of people facing a crisis, or many. In a way, a bit like Short Cuts, but totally different at the same time. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of main characters that we all learn to know very well as their stories unfold, and they are, as people show their good and their bad sides, their weaknesses and their strengths, with much drama and laughter. The closest equivalent in a US movie I can think of, which is then much weaker in all respects, is the Royal Tenenbaums. <br /> <br /> Four Brown Shadows, as the title would be in English, tells the story of a stressed hotelier and his wife, and their elderly parents (who travel magically); about the receptionist in a crematory animal and her family misadventures; about the members of a culinary course (who most often speak about their sad lives) and fourth about the funeral of a trotting jockey, who tries to continue orchestrating the family beyond the grave, singing and appearing in 3D during the funeral, thank you to the high-tech equipment that cost all his fortune (the family does not receive anything, not even the famous horse is given to the family). <br /> <br /> There is warmth and compassion in this movie, which is full of mourning and laughter, which I have never experienced before. Most of the actors were new to me, except Robert Gustafsson and one or two more, but they all deserve the big blow that the film had in the Swedish Guldbagge. extravagance (= the Swedish "Oscar" Awards) a week ago! Male, female and male supporting actor went to this movie, plus a few more to boot! <br /> <br/> If you have the chance, go and see - hours float very fast!
