This was really a pleasure to see; the dialogue was - for the most part - absolutely remarkable (I thought the women's papers were a bit better written, which is a good surprise). The performances were uniformly very good too. Frank Gorshin overdoes a bit when he enters into his various cons, but this can be his overcompensating for what I see as weaknesses in how the character is written; it is very good otherwise. Harry Groener does the same well with a slightly underwritten character (Tony), exaggerating a bit in the character's rage scenes. Ursula Burton is excellent as Sister Theresa, actually carrying the film through some of her weaknesses. Seymour Cassel and Louise Fletcher are a little underutilized here, although I liked their work as always. Shirley Jones, Wendie Malick, Jill Eikenberry and Faye Grant are also very good (I could not help thinking that Grant reminded me a bit of Catherine O'Hara here); Cloris Leachman instead rips his paper, with reasonably good results. <br /> <br /> I wish there was a safer hand behind the cameras, though. At times, the framing or staging seemed a little off, or clumsy. The closes seemed overused (or erratically used) to me. And we do not always go the scene as well as we would like. Some of the "tough" approach to the federal agent (music, costumes) went too far for me as well. And the few fantasy sequences did not work. But there are things that have been very well done; the opening sequence in Buffalo around 1970, for example. And frankly, all the scenes about the work of Theresa's church (I suspect the writer and actress really liked the character, which helps). The scenes between Malick and Eikenberry are VERY good. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably a little overcontrolled - there seem to be some too many schemes going on at the same time to keep them all straight at times, and the coincidences came to be a little too much. And I was a little bothered by the end (should we really be cheering for their biggest challenge yet to succeed?), But the ride along the way is very enjoyable. It would be nice to see more independent films like this one made. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
