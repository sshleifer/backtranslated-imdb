For those of you who have wondered what a movie like art monsters would look like, do not ask yourself. The DAIMAJIN trilogy, circa 1966, was just one such series. More period samurai epics than anything else, these three movies just happen as well to feature one of the most (literally) monstrous deux et machinas ever. There is not a single facet of these gems that is not polished, from the setting (s) to the performances and the skill of the filmmaker. Even special effects are handled with skill well above average and are integrated (in most cases) almost perfectly into the film (s). If you are a fan of GOJIRA or a fan of samurai movies or one of us who likes a good movie regardless of genre, I recommend the DAIMAJIN trilogy.
