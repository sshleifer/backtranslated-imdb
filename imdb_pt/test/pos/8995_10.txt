My family really liked this movie. As for what this movie will do for Rugby in the USA ... well, I'm sure that will be debatable. But as for me and the others around me, I know we got more curious about the sport after watching the movie and I personally gained more respect for the game. You may wonder how this is possible, especially since the film does not dive and explains Rugby. But the simple fact is that you've attracted the players and excitement of the game and life. The film was inspiring and entertaining. It made us laugh and cry. The chemistry between Sean Astin, Big Budah and Sean Faris worked well. Some may think the film is a bit of a cliché, but I really wish Hollywood would make more movies like that. I could not help drawing analogies from the game and the struggles of life. In the end I found myself examining my own life to see what I needed to do better, to be the best person I could be. Honestly, I was grateful for this movie teaching morale, values ​​and teamwork, there is much to the contrary. After watching this, I really hope my kids are trained by someone who has a philosophy like Coach Gelwix.
