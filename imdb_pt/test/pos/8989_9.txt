Now I realize that most people here spoil YOUNG WARRIORS or call it entertainment "so bad it's funny", but let me clarify one thing: it's really a low-rent quality if you're willing to watch movies without a critical eye In fact, it's a lot more fun and thought-provoking than most action films of the '80s. The key is the subject of the film. I'm always a sucker for movies that deal with the subject of vigilantism, especially when they ambitiously investigate the psyche of the characters involved. YOUNG WARRIORS may not have the intelligence or sensitivity of the first DEATH WISH movie (and yes, I think the former had both elements), but it is trying to be different from the ordinary cannon movies of the period when it is genuinely unique. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple (do not worry, there will be no spoilers): A group of playful college students change their moods when one of their family members is assaulted by a street gang. Students take to the streets in an effort to combat street crime in general, and they do not know who the responsible gang is. They end up getting some heavy artillery (machine guns and grenades) and roam the night completely armed. However, these are not Schwarzenegger types; they are vulnerable and inexperienced beginners, who make considerable mistakes almost every time they prepare to clean the town (usually with the mascot puppy of the fraternity). They finally find out who the gang is and go after them, but then you will not be expecting a standard climax in which the good guys come out unharmed. One thing about the movie that impressed me Strange and effective as it is, most of the first act does not offer any indication that we will see any action or violence later as it is treated like a comedy of fraternity that you would see in Up All Night of the USA (where I believe this was actually shown at one point). The comedy setup really made me forget that the VHS cover showed a guy riding a motorbike with a machine gun tied behind his back. So when the violence finally comes, it's nothing fun or cute ... it's shockingly disturbing. From that point on, the film becomes a string of action filled with blood, uncompromising, containing some shootings and bleeds. The performance, though nothing special, is much more passionate than I imagined. James Van Patten, who plays the protagonist, gives his all and his performance is surprisingly good for this type of film. The rest of the cast is also invested, including the ever-reliable Ernest Borgnine as the hero's cop's father. Cinematography is also above normal and the action scenes are treated with a level of severity that I personally did not expect. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people thought this film was not so good that it was extremely dated, but these facets seemed to me to be nothing less than legal in themselves. The character of Van Patten is studying animation and his work patently in the early 80's, which is on display in several scenes, is the psychedelic wet dream of a retro movie lover. I'm sure most contemporary viewers would rate these moments as low points in the film, but I disagree. In addition, Joe Walsh's soundtrack - which looks as if it could only have been recorded in 1983 - seemed particularly appropriate and entertaining, no matter how "old" it seems today. <br /> <br /> YOUNG WARRIORS is one of my favorites. action movies of the 80's and I ask anyone interested in the genre to take a look. Unfortunately, however, it has only been released on VHS so far, and is not currently being shown on TV. A good DVD presentation would make me walk the moon through my room with such intensity that I'm sure my ankles would be swollen. In the meantime, I beg everyone to come on Ebay or Amazon and pay the ten dollars or whatever for the old big tape. It really is a remarkable staple of ambitious junk cinema.
