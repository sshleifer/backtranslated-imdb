Too bad that someone does not have the intelligence to cast that movie into theaters. I had never heard of it when it appeared on the cable. After the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you've seen since Bringing Up Baby you have to let it sweep along and run with it. Not until it's over, you realize that it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant. Alienation, denial, fulfillment of wishes, to begin with. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she's never been better. The whole cast has the feel of the plot and knows what it's doing without adopting free hamming, except where it's needed, as in the snippets of Julie Andrews or in the videos of Jonathan Pryce. If you do not have an open mind, you will not. (See the bizarre review by Mark Adnum, which he devotes to Stephanie Beacham's adulation, his career, and his brother's OBE for introducing vegetable oil or something to the natives of the island.) Taking this as a suggestion, I would also like to pass time praising the stellar link of Amo Gulinello. such as a TV intern or Jack Noseworthy's shower scene. So let go of all the previous comedy concepts and have a good time. I loved.
