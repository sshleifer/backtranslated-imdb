This was a film that I kept reading the comments over and over again; and despite being played in the Cinema Museum and not in Pathe theaters ?? I decided to try this movie. Were the reasons too many? in the comments it was compared to Pulp Fiction, had several parallel stories running in the film and finally had already won 17 awards internationally in several categories. I was looking forward to seeing this movie and due to my day off at Greenpeace I decided to make myself happy going and seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a story based in Finland. I think it reflected the current life of people in general? drugs, crime, sex, anger, anguish, fear and guilt. Each emotion was captured brilliantly in the film. There are several characters and stories intertwined, but some characters come back in the second half? making a link with the opening sequences and that takes the story forward. <br /> <br /> Is the story about two friends ?? one of whom is a computer geek and the other is a drug addict? son of an abusive father. Does the drug-addicted boy negotiate a Euro 500 bill? printed by your friend? to buy back their music system, and on returns receives a big money change back to buy more drugs. Does the negotiation of the Euro 500 note continue to bizarre events ?? from the store marketer to an auto mechanic thief cum? for a car dealer? to a vacuum cleaner salesman? for a prostitute? for a policeman? then to his family and children. Like the beginning of a small thing? creates a chain reaction that took even after 5 years of that first incident to a last depressing note ?? which I will not reveal here. <br /> <br /> The direction is excellent. The development of the character in the film is top notch. The character that stays on your mind, even after you leave the movie, is from the vacuum cleaner vendor. All departments of the film are treated well. Here I would like to make some critical comments. First, during the sequence of one event that led to another, I felt that the coincidences were very fast and forced. But this script writing mistake is forgiven when you see the entire screen. Second, the trail of one character leading to another in some way takes you back to the first two characters and again I found out to be a forced decision of the game's screenplay. There was no need to have the same characters appear again when there are different causes that lead to different effects in such a large city. <br /> <br /> But after saying that ?? It's a great movie! It's a dark movie with some sex scenes. The characters are having shadows and black, white and gray emotions that change from facing different situations that are brilliantly captured by the director. <br /> <br /> A high-rate movie! It has all the ingredients to become a cult movie. I hope that only these films do not become and reach the status of cult films and win many awards because without crime, sex, violence, drugs, etc. Can you make great movies ?? Bicycle thieves and Pather Panchali are your prime examples? The only thing is that they were a long time ago and times are changing and I think the movies are reflecting the current times.
