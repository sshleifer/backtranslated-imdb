Forever Strong is a type of film that we have seen many times before, only in different types of genres. However, what I said, I really thought it was a great movie, Sean Faris is showing the kind of potential that usually takes the actors to great stardom. Apparently, this movie had a limited release because I was not aware of it, but I saw it at the store and decided to give it a try after I remember enjoying Sean's performance on Never Back Down. I ended up making a great decision, I'm not a rugby fan, but the movie really is not totally about rugby, it's about making a resistance in your life, defying yourself, achieving your goals, it's much more than simple plot suggests. At first we do not give a shit about what happens to Rick, he is full of himself and completely arrogant, we feel that he has completely sealed his fate as a troublemaker. Along the way, we see the changes in his character, he starts to walk with better people, he starts to improve himself, we learn the negative impact his father had on his life, it's just a big turnaround and the movie made a great job of turning Rick from arrogant arrogant to a good-hearted person. <br /> <br /> The rugby action itself is not too bad at all, unlike the things I played and saw at school, this was actually a lot of fun to watch and beautifully choreographed. A great young cast combined with some veteran experience immensely helped this film, it just did a fabulous job of avoiding what could have been a mill-type race for a moving and effective drama. I also liked the conflicting contrast between coach | Garry Cole | and Rick | Sean Faris, was a very interesting plot, and I loved watching him help Rick along the way, it was exciting and exciting at the same time. This is a real hidden gem that I'm really happy that I discovered that made me think about my life and I often need something like that. <br /> <br /> The presentations. Sean Faris is excellent as Rick Penning. It reminded me a lot of a young, arrogant, but very charismatic and talented Tom Cruise. It was a difficult role to move from a good teenager to a good-hearted young man, but Sean did it with pure perfection. He clearly put his heart and soul into this film, so much praise to Sean for putting so much effort into this great film. Gary Cole is excellent as the preacher, but friendly, who wants to help the kids. I always find him nice, he always has a kind of presence that he carries in his films. Neal McDonough is fantastic as Rick's selfish but pressed father. For most of the film, the script leads you to believe he is nothing more than a bitter selfish one who wants Rick to be just like him, but in the end you start to see the true he leave, I felt sorry for him little. Julie Warner is an actress of good character and she plays the good-hearted mother, still clueless. Penn Badgley is forced to play a real jerk, and he does it well. On several occasions, I wanted to put it into one, so I must say that it is a great performance. Arielle Kebbel is not much of a love interest, she did well. Nathan West plays a somewhat mysterious character, he did very well. Sean Astin is considered one of the main actors of the film, but he almost does nothing, he did well with what he had to do. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - Forever Strong is a great movie, definitely make you stop and think about how much your life was better than you thought. Do not let this fool you, you will not regret it. <br /> <br /> 8 1/2/10
