Beguiled was one of the few Eastwood movies I had not seen before giving the DVD a chance today. And from his opening sepia shot to macabre climax I was absolutely delighted. Many filmmakers are currently replacing special effects, quick editing, and dizzying camera work instead of character-driven stories, but director Don Siegel knew how to get the maximum effect from this relatively simple plot, and the characters are convincing and compelling. <br /> <br /> The story is about a women's finishing school that happened to be on the verge of several skirmishes during the American Civil War. The ladies who support the south find a seriously injured Union soldier (Clint Eastwood); taking care of him back to health, he begins to manipulate sexually frustrated women for their own ends. Geraldine Page excels in the director's role with a secret, and her descent into madness is subtly conveyed. For a movie that occurs virtually in one place, it never loses visual interest. There is even a chance that the normal status quo, abandoned for a long time when Eastwood's machinations are discovered, may return; but the lovers and students descend on a darker path ... <br /> <br /> This is a totally different style of Dirty Harry movie from the same Director, made the same year, and yet both are equally superb. Eastwood is great at playing against his usual stoic antihero image, but there is also some mysterious quality attached to his character. We never learned much about it before its incarceration, and the viewer is free to decide on his well-shaded persona. Villain or Victim? Whatever you think, all I can say is that I enjoyed it a lot.
