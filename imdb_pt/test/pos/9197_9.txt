This is probably one of those films that many have commented but have not been discovered ... This is probably a masterpiece of Spanish cinema as Bu√±uel's masterpiece. "15 days with you" could be the best "now and they" re-visitation of other long-standing films ago: it could be "Midnight cowboy", but could also be "Les amants du Pont-Neuf" or a realistic and not -spot-look (but more realistic) "trainspotting". This difficult story takes place for humor, love and obviously dramatic sense. In the new Spanish social cinema, this small diamond could be the resurrection of Italian neo-realism mixed with the best films of Ken Loach. Probably the best movie I've discovered in the last 10 years.
