A sick man, Carleton Hendricks (Dee Snider), crosses the lines of Teen Chat as Captain Howdy. He poses as a teenager and invites other teens into his home for the party. Instead, he knocks, strips, slits his mouth and tortures (especially with needles). He captures the daughter of police officer Mike Gage (Kevin Gage). He finds him, arrests him and he is institutionalized. Four years later he is released ... totally healed. But a lynch mop (led, playfully, by Robert Englund) attacks him and hangs him. He does not die, but he snaps and Captain Howdy is back ... <br /> <br /> A very sick, disturbing and distorted horror film. Captain Howdy enjoys pain and torture and is trying to show the kids he kidnaps as well as having fun too. The torture scenes are not so explicit (you hear more than you see), but what you see is very very sick. There is no humor and the screams (silenced) of their victims seem too real. I was shrinking away from the TV for most of the scenes. <br /> <br /> The acting varies. Kevin Gage is not as good as the cop - he's not terrible, but he could have been better. Dee Snider is very scary like Captain Howdy - his attack scenes are not pleasant. <br /> <br /> All in all, not your typical horror movie. I'll probably never see it again (this movie really gets under your skin), but I recommend it to all horror fans - at least those with strong stomachs. I give a 7.
