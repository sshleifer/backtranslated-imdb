After the death of all senior officers, Commander Craig-Scott, of the Corps of Laundry and Morals, is promoted to command an intergalactic spacecraft owned by Starcups Corporation. Its main mission is to search for habitable planets and, of course, long-term coffee markets. Craig-Scott and his second-in-command, Chief Blather, find themselves ill-prepared for command, except to the extent that as they are fully capable of keeping the crew's underwear clean - which is not to diminish the importance of clean clothes, especially when incompetent commanders make these same clothes are, well, regularly soiled. <br /> <br /> The episodes are presented as a series of short, 2-3 minute reports from the Commander to Earth. Humor is a mixture of physical and outrageous comedy. Think yes Minister meets Red Dwarf, but on a budget of shoe rope. All the usual science fiction devices are here - aliens, nuclear weapons, computer breakdowns - but each one is enhanced by the fresh smell of high quality laundry detergent. <br /> <br /> The commander's log is definitely low budget, but the rather tacky effects and props fit the absurd premise of the show. Remember those hilarious hockey helmets they wore in the old Battlestar Galactica? With the "Jofa" brand still visible? Okay, there's a lot of that in the Commander's Log, but it's cute. <br /> <br /> The Commander's Log is not high art, but it's not what it's trying to be. It's a little fun. It does a good job of being that.
