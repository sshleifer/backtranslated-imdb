The title does not refer to a questionable poker hand, but to six comic book players. They come in pairs: Charles Ruggles and Mary Boland as a couple driving to California for a second honeymoon, George Burns and Gracie Allen as another couple who goes along to share expenses, and WC Fields and Alison Skipworth as a sheriff and owner of a hotel in a small Nevada town. No attempt is made to shape a coherent narrative - it is a collection of pooled comics. All that the first couple wants to do is spend some time together but the characters of Burns and Allen are not married, so men are nipped together just like women. There's a bit of plot: a villain plants $ 50,000 in the purse that Pinky (Ruggles) is taking out of town, but as the expedition is being led by Gracie, the loot can not be found. The villain appears in Nevada and Fields accidentally catches him. A lot of nice things, Ruggles's confused expression, Gracie's and Fields's graceful chatter playing billiards with a corkscrew and making a shudder, cowardice, retreating when he's threatened, and his wonderfully distinct way of delaying words . And trying to remember the name "Gracie," he says Skipworth, "Hmm. It starts with a K ... McGonigle." She replies, "Oh no, no, no, no ..." "Mmmm. Wangahanky!" "No, no, no, no, no. Oh, Gracie." "Yes it's right."
