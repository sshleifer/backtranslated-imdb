I collect movies in Super-8, and I got a full copy of this last week on E-bay. It seems that at least for now, this is the only way to see this movie in a country with NTSC video. I've seen it available on the Region 2 DVD many times, but never in Region 1. <br /> <br /> I just watched a few minutes ago and I'm impressed by that. It is a powerful testament to freedom and finding its own place in the world. The photography and the music were wonderful, and I really felt empathy for some of the characters. <br /> <br /> I kind of like the idea that I was probably the only one in the US watching "When the North Wind Blows" tonight! <br /> <br /> Long life to Avakum !!
