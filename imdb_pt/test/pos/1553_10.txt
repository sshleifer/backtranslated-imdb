If you are into alternative realities, contemplating what is real and what is just a fantasy, this is a cutting edge thriller from your seat that will make you guess and really make you think. Try to get a copy and see for yourself! I watched a Los Angeles movie festival recently and it was by far the best of the group I saw. It helped that it was really about something, unlike the others that were selected. It is very well run and the production value is top notch. I would compare this to Jacob's Ladder as you come to guess what the true reality of the world we are in. You should definitely try to hunt this movie and if it shows up at any festival near you, try Check it out.
