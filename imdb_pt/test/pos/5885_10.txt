The film features another outstanding collaboration between director William Wyler and director of photography Gregg Toland, the first after Toland worked for Citizen Kane. But the talent of these two men was focused on getting a perfectly crafted film, understood in good old American sense as a great story. The technical aspects of the film are covered, so that the viewer is absorbed by the action that occurs on the screen without submitting to the power of the image. The technique is seen as a different representation vehicle for Citizen Kane, where Welles' baroque style almost drew the attention of the story to the way the story was told. One of my favorite moves with deep focus in this film is the drama conveyed by the homecoming homecoming of Homer and Al. If Homer's girl, Wilma comes toward him perfectly in focus, Al also passes his perfectly focused wife. This is a brilliant move because it only shows through the use of the image the nature of these relationships as we will see them throughout the film: Wilma loves Homer and she accepts him as he is, Al's wife also loves him, but she feels unprepared for welcome you totally at home. Also later in the movie we discovered that their marriage was not always a sea of ​​roses. <br /> <br /> Wyler is a director whose strength lies in being true to his work without feeling the need to brag. He wanted to show the public how difficult it was for American soldiers returning from the war to fit into a society that did not understand or treat them with contempt. With a perfect cast and a great dialogue, Goldwin and Wyler have produced a movie that will forever be the model for any other home movie that returns. The three hours that coincide with "cut-off" because the test audience at that time never felt for a moment that the action was slow and in fact, all the scenes of the film seem perfectly justified. The whole thing is beautifully constructed, each character gets a fair amount of exposure, nothing is left to chance and it is unfortunate that Hollywood nowadays can never bring so much character conflict onto the screen. TBYOOL explores the depth of the American way of life, the American family and society, to the point of making other films look like "children's time."
