I'm surprised people, after such bad movies hit the top 250 or just being in 7.0, I thought more people would have fun with "Throw Momma from the Train." This was a great comedy of two fantastic comic actors, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito. Together they made a great pair of insanity and obsession. Billy is a man who has just lost his million-dollar history to his ex-wife and repeatedly wishes her dead, Danny has an insane and senile old mother who has just abused him. When Billy gives some "misunderstood" advice to Danny, Danny offers Billy a proposal, if he kills his ex-wife, Billy has to kill his mother. This is a crazy and funny story that can always make a good laugh. Please, sit down and enjoy this movie, everyone! It's a good one! <br /> <br /> 7/10
