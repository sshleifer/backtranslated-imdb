I watched this because a friend told me it was very good, and I watched a video about it so I was actually watching. I watched, and, damn, the fight scenes are really good. If guys can not fight like that in real life, they sure fooled me. There is not much fighting as I like, I must say, but the fights that are in the film are quite spectacular. They do not show much, but you can say it is violent and legal. But there is also the plot, which revolves around a love triangle between the main characters, although it is a little distorted. Tae-sung is a carefree guy who seems to love getting into trouble as well as fights. He is the leader of his school and is the rival of Hea-won, who is the leader of his own school - a bit of playboy, hot head and a rich kid. Then there's Han-kyung, a girl without much for her - her father just passed away and she came back with her mother, the guy she liked is dating her old friend - and then she meets Hea-won, who goes to school her, and Tae-sung, who calls her "nuna" (older sister). Eventually, she discovers that Tae-sung is her brother, one of her father's cases, and he loves her in spite of her blood relationship. Meanwhile, Hea-won falls in love with her and takes her as his boyfriend. But she is torn between her boyfriend and her little brother, who confesses her love to her. Overall, it's a wonderful movie, but if I was really depressed after the end, and I just could not help but think, Damn, all the Korean movies I watch over fight / death / depressing things / incest? Because that was the case of Old Boy and Temptation of Wolves. It's a very good movie, but people have to be ready to cry in the end.
