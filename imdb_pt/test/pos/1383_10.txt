WOW!! Talk about a movie that divides the audience! This is a true love or hate movie. Personally I really enjoyed it. I noticed that other comments are comparing to Pitch Black - this is kind of dumb as the only thing they have in common is SAND! People can be really stupid. No, this movie is much more in common with The Thing (as people do not notice it's amazing - they even have the same basic music). There are many touches of carpenter, blue-collar heroes, sharp humor, endless undulating landscapes full of death and things not understood. Perhaps what prevents this film from being a true classic is its deference to Carpenter's other works. No less Dark Star, which has something in common with. Would I be interested in knowing how much it really costs? $ 8000? Is it even possible? Maybe it was based on a short that cost $ 8,000? But I found myself strangely moved when the various space guys died. They are so underrated that it's like watching a documentary at times. Having said that the script is kinda clumsy and only about half of them can act however and I'm not sure if the big guy who plays the Captain is one of them. But his weapon is incredible !! Take a chance, if you like Carpenter early you can fall in love with him, just do not wait 2001.
