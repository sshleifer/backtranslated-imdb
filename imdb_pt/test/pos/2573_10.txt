This is the first movie I've given to 10 years in years. If there ever was a movie that needed word of mouth to promote, that's it. A box of $ 4,000 is a shame. People do not know what it is. If you have some appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of great music, that's only reason to go see it. How many people knew that Jackson could sing, and very well too. You hear books and movies provoking that they are about salvation. Once you see this, you will never be able to forgive this trivial use of the word. Yes, it's brave, sexy, actually house, bizarre and in your real face. Is not that the best reason to watch a movie? Those who get my meaning will not be far from seeing this for another week.
