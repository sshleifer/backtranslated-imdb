I went and saw this movie last night after being persuaded by some of my friends. I admit I was reluctant to see this because, from what I knew of Ashton Kutcher, he could only do comedy. I was wrong. Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well, and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism. The sign of a good movie is that it can play with our emotions. This did just that. The entire theater (which was exhausted) was overcome by laughter during the first half of the film, and was tearfully blown during the second half. On leaving the theater, I not only saw many women in tears, but also many adult men, trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying. This movie was great, and I suggest you go see it before you judge.
