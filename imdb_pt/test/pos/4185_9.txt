Pity the Monkees. People always accused them of being fabricated (what they were) or nothing more than an American imitation of the Beatles (Again, what they were), but for the children of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate . Discussions about who were better Monkees or the Beatles were commonplace in school playgrounds, but critics, well, never came to believe that. Despite recording some classic pop songs, Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums. Unfortunately, a similar fate was hit by his only movie vehicle despite the fact that he is the best movie ever. Beatles fans can argue that "Hard Days Night" was better and I'm sure many of the boys think "8 Mile" was superior, but none of those movies was as bold and inventive as "Head" and that's probably why he failed. If Head had told a direct story from A to B, he might have appealed to the band's young fans, but using the film to mock their own image, they really sabotaged the film with them. your fans. You could imagine Eminem turning to the camera and really talking about how sad it is that he's the best-selling guy in a genre in which only 5% (and I'm being generous) of the acts are white. If you can imagine that, then you have an idea of ​​how bold it was to sing for Monkess. "Hey, hey, we're the Monkees, you know we like to please, a fabricated image without philosophy." When you have a movie in which Frank Zappa tells Davy he should focus less on dance, and more on music of course there is more going on than you expected. <br /> <br /> The story, what there is, concerns boys who try to run away from their manager, who at one point forces them to play dandruff on a commercial, but every time they run away they end up inside a Cashier. I do not think you need to be Fellini to figure out the symbolism of that piece. Some small pieces of comedy follow with Davy as a boxer who has to give up playing the violin to take a dip in the big game and Peter refuses to throw away an ice cream cone he does not want because there are hungry children so it is wrong food waste , but the real selling point for this movie is the music and some of the best that the band has recorded. Even if you stay out of the story, you can sit back and enjoy fantastic music. <br /> <br /> Any movie that begins and ends with Mickey attempting suicide by jumping off a bridge (at the end the band follows) it) will never be a mainstream classic, but whether you are a fan of the experimental band or cinema of the season, then you will like this movie.
