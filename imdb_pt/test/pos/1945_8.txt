River's Edge is an extremely disturbing film written by acclaimed American film writer Neal Jimenez. It is based on a real event that happened at a time when most young Americans were trying to make sense of their lives. This is one of the most notable films. made by the American director Tim Hunter. Much attention of the film is focused on a reckless murder committed by an irresponsible adolescent. This unfortunate event begins a series of questions about real motivations of young people in American society. Those who have seen this movie during its initial release must have had vivid memories of the great actor Dennis Hopper in a confusing role as a socially friendly outcast. Keanu Reeves also appears to be one of the teenagers before achieving star status. By the time adolescent films are made without any serious preparation, it is hoped that "River's Edge" can not simply be ignored as yet another silly teen. It had a great impact on the people who lived through the turbulent times of the past, when being an inhabitant of a sleepy city was like not having been born. For today's generation with its intoxicating overdoses of Internet props like Facebook, Twitter and Orkut, River's Edge may seem outdated, but its importance can not be denied by any serious movie fan.
