This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It's so magical and fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so engaging, so real, you will love them! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic in your life. <br /> <br /> I do not see how anyone would mind if the movie matched the book, I mean the movie was amazing! I did not even read the book and guess what? I dont care. In fact, if the film and the book are so different, then you can simply call them two separate stories and be happy about it. <br /> <br /> I thought the acting was very bright! Bridget Fonda plays the Snow Queen, so evil and so cold - you just have to hate her. Chelsea Hobbs plays Gerda, a passionate girl who is determined to find her love, no matter what it takes, and goes on a wonderful adventure. And I love all the sisters of the Snow Queen (the Spring Witch, the Summer Princess and the Autumn Wolf), they are so much fun and different in many ways. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie for some time. , then forgive me if I make a small mistake ... but there is no doubt that I will always love this movie.
