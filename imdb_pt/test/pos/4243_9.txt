Chucky's bride starts late at night when police officer Bob Bailey (Vince Corazza) walks into the evidence room at his police station and among all the horror movies jokingly steals the remains of the puppet that serial killer Charles Lee Ray possessed in the original Child's Play (1988). He directs the remains to an isolated area where Ray's ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) cuts off Bailey's throat and takes the remains back to his trailer. There are Tiffany points and Chucky clips (voice of Brad Dourif) together again and using a book 'voodoo for mannequins' brings back to life killer. Thing does not go as Tiffany had expected and Chucky ends up not being the man of his dreams, after all she locks him in a game pen in which Chucky is less than happy. While Tiffany takes a bath Chucky escapes, electrocute her and using that book brings her back to life in the form of a female doll dressed as a bride. Neither wants to get stuck in plastic bodies and has to work together to get to a graveyard in New Jersey where Ray's natural body was buried with the amulet needed to turn his spirits back to human bodies. The bodies of Tiffany's neighbor, Jesse (Nick Stabile) and his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl), who are fleeing from Jade's corrupt uncle, police chief Warren Kincaid (John Ritter), will do well ... /> <Directed by Ronny Yu I love Bride of Chucky. The screenplay by Don Mancini is very entertaining, very fast, very entertaining and makes reference to many other horror films with good affection. From the opening sequence we see the hockey mask Jason Voorhees from the films Friday the 13th, Freddy Krueger's razor blade glove from the A Nightmare on Elm Street series and Michael Myers' Halloween mask. To the clips used by Bride of Frankenstein (1935) when it virtually recreates the same scene. Bride of Chucky never gets serious about what's good, there are many unique liners, self-referential jokes that Scream (1996) did in fashion a few years earlier and does not seem to be afraid to mock himself and the horror genre. generally. I love the scene when Jesse & Jade are having a romantic talk clichÃ© that Chucky hears and makes comments and derogatory gestures. This is not to say that there is not a very good movie there as well, because there certainly is. Director Yu manages to create a good atmosphere and a real sense of fun, both human and plastic characters are friendly and bright as each pair suffers from their own domestic problems that the trail of corpses they are leaving behind would obviously cause. Technically, Bride of Chucky is great for the most part and has that great Polish budget and about $ 25,000,000 I hope so. The only thing I'm going to say is that some of Kevin Yagher's puppet effects are a little harsh and unconvincing, I also do not remember any CGI scene in Bride of Chucky. Fortunately, the film does not neglect blood and blood with a cold throat, fingernails on someone's face in presumably a tribute to Hellraiser (1987), people impaled in shards of glass, someone being bleeding from a huge truck, stolen lip piercing and various stabs and shots. The acting is very good and Dourif as Chucky is very funny when he drops the leaflets. I also like the scenes with Tiffany at the beginning and I find her very sexy when she's wearing all that fetish gear, I can not be the one for sure? I personally think Bride of Chucky is a fantastic movie, total entertainment from start to finish, great humor and horror in equal measure and at only 85 minutes long it never becomes boring or annoying. One of my favorites, watch it as fast as possible!
