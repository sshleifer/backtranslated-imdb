Greetings again from the darkness. Director Alejandro Amenabar creates life against all odds in this one based on a true story version of a man's struggle to control his fate. The great Javier Bardem is fascinating to watch in his role as Ramon. Your eyes and head movements leave little doubt about what is going on in your mind. The sequences of dream and fantasy are not overused, so they are very effective in explaining why he wants what he wants. Instead of forcing us to respond to the question of euthanasia, the real question is: What is love? At each turn, we see people in love, looking for love or dying to be loved. The screenplay is tight and keeps the movie moving despite being filmed mainly in a room. The support cast is wonderful and we really felt their pain and how each family member handles Ramon's decision. This is a gem and deserves to be seen.
