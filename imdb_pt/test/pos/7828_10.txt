Without a doubt, a great show that, if shown today, would attract a large number of followers. The Bodyguards had only 6 episodes and one trailer, but it deserved a few more series to actually increase speed. With exceptional performances from the highly talented and versatile. Sean Pertwee and the dynamic Louise Lombard, this really did with the likes of the pros, The Sweeney and Thief Takers. The story lines are based on the Diplomatic Protection Services and with great footage and stories and scenarios, from a bit of the junk that is shaken up by other TV production companies. I do not think it has been shown on terrestrial TV, like Sky or Freeview, which is a shame as if it were to be shown nowadays, I'm make sure that one day the Carlton TV staff will decide to release it on DVD, cheers, Nick.
