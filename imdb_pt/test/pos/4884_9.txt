Gentleman league has been the most disturbing British sitcom to be on tv and as a funny movie can be so poorly rated, they just do not have taste that this movie will make you want to watch over and over again and still find it funny. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that it has done badly, but it is British cinema does most of the time, but this time (in my words) an impulse with the comedy with a giraffe tucked in on the Lady's, this is a top British comedy and better than dodge-ball, so this is not going to prove you wrong, I did not laugh much through movies, but this movie was amazing through the comedy with the best characters but I was a bit disappointed with how much Edward and Tabb were there to re-enter buy this movie and will not disappoint him.
