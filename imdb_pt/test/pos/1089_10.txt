I love the way he experiences it. Ab Tak Chappan was an emotion of watching both Satya and company. Jatin, the newcomer, also fulfilled his role and Nana Patekar was at his best. Suchak was really annoying, but I think he fit the character he was playing - he had really ugly teeth. The story has made great progress and no music in the film makes it any better. I just want him to sign Urmila for his upcoming movies. I think they're the best combination of director and actress I've ever seen. I have not seen Naach yet, but I'm looking forward to it. I, for some reason, do not find Antra Maali so exciting to watch on screen - unlike Urmila.
