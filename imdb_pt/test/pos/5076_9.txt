The film tackles the horror here and now of "surrender" with a multi-cast trans-global account of everyone involved. Nobody is disappointed because we see the blindness of the players as they carve their own share of the world game, accumulating hatred and misery in their "enemies" and in themselves in equal measure. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Senator Aide's sympathizer (played in twinkling style by Peter Sarsgaard) and Washington's true power-drinkers is electrifying. Meanwhile, on the field, the new CIA man (Jake Gyllenhaal) undergoes a radical change in his attitude toward the new US comfort with torture. Suddenly, despite his rejection of what he initially tolerated tacitly, one must ask why the hell someone who calls himself civilized stands and sees someone being humiliated and abused in this way? The film has few heroes - perhaps the imperfect and unstable man of Gyllenhaal's CIA is the exception and an indulgence necessary to make the film offer a piece of hope. <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that this movie is not fiction at all, but a warning to those with an ounce of decency left in them. The terrible truth is that we in the UK and US have lost the moral plot and this movie shows how low we are prepared to go. All this in the name of freedom! There is a wonderful line in the script that says torture is a way to increase the number of our enemies. This is already happening in real life and we should listen to the message that this movie offers and start using our power and money in a much smarter way !! The message seems to be that any of us who claim that the extradition, torture and abuse of basic human rights are necessary to protect our way of life are as silly and stupidly stupid as Jihadists and suicide bombers. <br /> <br /> All praise for the sensibility of a talented South African director with an eye on the gross injustice of how power is exercised, and a cast of mainstream actors from US principles and beyond. Oh, and by the way, the movie has a prick in the ass with the end of a smart and provocative surprise (which I will not give). <br /> <br /> I saw the movie in London early. preview so it has not yet been widely written, but I'm happy to say that the tide of less than brilliant comments seems to be turning. The BBC review has backed very strongly and they (and I) suspect that many of the negative comments come from those who see the world through the simple Hollywood specs - where good guys and bad guys are cardboard cutouts. Hence the reason why many of the great films of the year are increasingly indie and / or non-American.
