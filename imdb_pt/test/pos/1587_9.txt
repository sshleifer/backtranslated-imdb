Visconti's death in Venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made. As we watch, we recognize that we are in the hands of a visionary genius. The infinitely opulent death in Venice certainly is; but in other important ways, it is an unsatisfactory film. Thomas Mann writes with contempt and distance from the career and literary production of von Aschenbach; of its imperious modes, its layer upon layer of programmed self-conscious behavior. When Tadzio appears and the obsession arises, it is evident that Aschenbach has no idea who he is under his Golden Age ornaments and life lived with care. In fact, upon seeing Tadzio, the 'Solitary', as Mann sometimes calls him, divides himself into two. Aschenbach No. 1 absorbs the vision of a handsome 14-year-old boy, then intellectually tries to process the dizzying jolt of blood pressure as he would with a work of art - a "divine" work of art. But Aschenbach No. 2 emerges as a stalker who takes over, then replaces Aschenbach No. 1. Like the original Aschenbach, his sexual doppelganger is mortified to make human contact with the object of his obsession - and thus Tadzio. remains a distant ideal. Thomas Mann has no mercy on this match. Every fragment of self-knowledge comes too strong and too late; the excitement of the sexual flush is too great to resist. That Venice is dominated by disease means nothing to Aschenbach - except that his game now has higher stakes. When he finally whispers softly "I love you," he knows that all is lost, and the abyss awaits. Is this all filifiable? Perhaps, and Visconti creates a visual feast impossible to look away from. But there are mistakes: he and Dirk Bogarde create Aschenbach as nice; Mann, again, did not. The POV of Aschenbach dominates the film and we must identify it. But nowhere on the screen is there a man being torn apart from within. Bogarde alternates between the sublimely controlled and the ridiculously temperamental with ease - but what is beneath? Bogard's reactive performance has no mooring. Mann writes a character who is, in his imagination, doing the Dance of the Seven Veils, aware of the consequences that such liberty invites, but unable to resist. In addition, Visconti's script creates a character not in the original - Alfred, a friend of Aschenbach's - to dramatize Mann's discussion of Art and Artists. These scenes are poorly written disasters, and the actor who plays Alfred is hard to watch. In addition, the Aschenbach of Visconti is a Teutonic composer of the Golden Age, which I think works for the film; and Mahler's symphonies replace the Aschenbach novels. The great song of Mahler unfortunately is badly engraved and very badly touched. Thus Death in Venice, as Visconti gives us, is not the complete success it could have been, but as a purely visual experience, its power can not be denied. All film students, especially filmmakers, will want to take a look.
