HOUSE CALLS was an entertaining 1978 comedy about a widowed physician (Walter Matthau) who now wants to play on the pitch, but can not help but be drawn to a patient of his (Glenda Jackson) who refuses to be just one more point in his bedside . Matthau likes the woman but does not really want to make the commitment she insists on, so he agrees to date her exclusively for two weeks and then make a decision on whether he wants to compromise or not; however, other complications make it difficult for Matthau to make a decision when the two weeks are over, although he is clearly in love with the woman. Matthau and Jackson have surprisingly effective chemistry as a screen couple and are strongly supported by Richard Benjamin, Candice Azzara, Dick O'Neill and especially Art Carney as the inept and senile staff chief of the hospital where Matthau works. Matthau still has a brief scene with his real-life son, Charlie, who appears as Jackson's son. This engaging comedy still holds up pretty well after all these years. If you have never seen it, it is worth the rent.
