If it is true that sadomasochism is a two-sided coin that contains the whole in the expression of its opposites, then Erika Kohut's cinematographic portrait has its reality. Professor Kohut treats his piano students with a kind of fascist sadism, while yearning for it himself. His outward expression projects his desire. That's why she can get hurt without guilt or remorse. <br /> <br /> Next comes the talented, charming, and handsome young Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel) who is drawn to her because of her passion and intensity. He wants to become his student, so be close to her. She rejects him immediately, but because of her talent the Vienna Conservatory votes for him. He falls in love with her. Once more, she pushes him away, but he does not take no for an answer, and thus begins his own fall into depravity and loss of self-respect. <br /> <br /> The question the spectator can ask at this moment is: who is in control? The sadist or the masochist? In fact, who is the sadist and who is the masochist? It is hard to say. It is the person who has just been greatly abused psychologically and physically, who is really hurt on the ground in triumphant grotesque and satisfaction, or is the person who is running out the door, satiated, giving the order that no one is to know what happened . <br /> <br /> But Erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak. She is an extreme freak of sex. She wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality, keeping the facade of respectability. In fact this is not even true. She says she does not care what others think. She does not care if they come in and find her bleeding on the floor because she's in love. Baby, she calls it. For her, sex and love are one and the same. <br /> <br /> At one point Walter tells her that love is not everything. How ironic this superfluity is to her. How free is the comment. The film is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by Michael Haneke, who does the tale with a specialized camera work and carefully constructed sets, in which the essence of action is not only clear, but exemplified in the bathroom when Walter pushes himself high above the top of the tent to find Erika inside). It also employs a good positioning of the players so that they always stay where they should be with well-timed cuts from one angle to another. This is particularly important in the scene where Erika, like a blood-drained corpse, trapped in a black and white light, is under her lover, stiff as stone. Here, most of the time, we see only her face and the outline of her neck with its pulsing artery. We do not need to see. <br /> <br /> The part of Erika Kohut is perfect for Isabelle Huppert, who is not afraid of extremes; in fact, it stands out in them. I've seen her in several movies and what she does better than anyone else is the body and soul of the character. Like the woman she plays in this film, she is not afraid of what others might think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense. What matters to her is performance and challenge. Neither party is very picky. No too depraved character. It is as if Huppert wanted to experience all of humanity and wanted us to observe it as it does. She is always fascinating and almost perfect. It is not only one of the main lights of French cinema; she is one of the great actresses of our time who set up an incredibly diverse body of work. <br /> <br /> I think it is highly instructive and provides us with a wonderful and striking contrast to compare your performance here with it. performance in The Lacemaker (La Dentellière) of 1977, when she was 22 years old. There she was apple-sweet in her red-and-freckled hair and her handsome face and cute figure playing Pomme, an apprentice Parisian hairdresser. Her character was shy about sex and modest - just an ordinary French girl who hoped one day to be a beautician. Here she is a self-destructive, bitter witch with an odious knowledge of herself, shameless and totally depraved. <br /> <br /> Huppert is fortunate enough to be an actress in France, where there are parties like this for women after the age of stars. (Hollywood could never make a film like this.) In American cinema, only a handful of the best and toughest working actresses can expect to have a career after the age of thirty. Huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her skill and range, but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles here and also in La Cérémonie (1995) in which she plays a vile and rancorous killer. <br /> <br /> See this for Isabelle Huppert. You will not forget her or the character she brings to life.
