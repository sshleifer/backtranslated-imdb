This indie film is worth a look because of the tremendous talent of its creators, Wallace Wolodarsky and Marsha Forbes. Wolodarsky directed the young cast, and he should be praised for that effort. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is a cautionary tale about the danger of wanting something you can not have. What is the story of Alice and Ed. After living together for a while, Alice is restless because she imagines that she has no experience in the area of ​​sex. Alice's and Ed's relationship, while not an example of ideal happiness, is a comfortable way of sharing their lives with each other. That is, until the time when Alice and Claire, her sister, encountered a sexual encounter with another couple who has no idea of ​​being watched. <br /> <br /> This incident causes Alice to reevaluate her own sex life with Ed; she thinks that substance is lacking. When she proposes to 'see other people', Ed is shocked, to say the least, but not wanting to contradict Alice, he decides to go along. What happens next is that Alice and Ed enter a world unknown to them. The people they meet in the end are not worth it. They unfortunately realized in the end, they were made for each other. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth watching in order to see the amazing Julianne Nicholson, which we incidentally enjoyed in another independent film, "Tully." Nicholson reminds us of a young Shirley McLaine; she projects such a luminous quality into her that it is difficult to take her eyes off her whenever she is in a scene. This young actress proves that she is a talented artist who improves with every new appearance. Basically, she carries the movie. Your Alice is a study in contrasts. Alice is a decent woman who thinks she is inadequate in pleasing Ed for her inexperience. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr is excellent to Mrs. Nicholson. Both work wonders together. Your Ed is perfectly credible. We know people like him. Deep down he is a good person who suddenly finds himself in a situation that he did not ask but he just finds out that he is very decent and is not prepared for a free sex life with willing women. which has no problem with a fall in hay, just for fun. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is wonderful. Lauren Graham does an incredible job as Claire, Alice's yuppie sister. Andy Ritcher is also wonderful as Carl, the nerdy friend who finally finds satisfaction when he meets Penelope, a single mother. Like Penelope, Helen Slater, makes a happy, although short, appearance in the film. <br /> <br /> The director is very talented, who no doubt goes to places because it shows that he is well suited for the job. .
