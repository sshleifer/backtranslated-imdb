A powerful debut film by Murali K. Thalluri that explores events in the lives of a group of high school students, each in crisis in one form or another. The film begins with the discovery of the body of one of the students, then traces the lives of the group in the previous hours, leaving the public in suspense until the last minutes regarding the identity of the deceased. Each of the main characters is facing major stressors that we could see as potentially precipitating a suicide. The cast of unknowns provides performances full of power and excitement. Fantastically well done, especially considering the writer / director's youth who was 19 when he wrote the screenplay.
