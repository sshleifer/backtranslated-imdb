The kind of "small" movie the studios used to stand out, but rarely did more. Kind of a "soul" version of the best known "The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells". Ian McShane is an excellent DJ and soul music buff who becomes obsessed with the idea of ​​bringing together members of a classic soul group, and the film follows his feats as well as those of the band members; a cast that includes genuine musical talent like Isaac Hayes, as well as the brave Taurean Blacque, Derrick O'Connor and Antonio Fargas. Not meant to be an epic by any means, this is still a solid piece of gold.
