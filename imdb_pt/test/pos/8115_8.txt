I loved this movie! It was adorably touching and funny. Finally, here is a story about a group of people who face some challenges, stumble a bit and then decide to be just themselves and end up getting happy; When was the last time you saw this in a movie? Dealing with the fluidity of life, love, and sexuality, characters are faced with real problems (albeit in often ridiculous situations such as men's camping trip, and real explicit connections) and can learn and grow without the film becoming lazy. darkly desperate, or very unrealistic. You will love and care for the characters who, far from being empty stereotypes, portray real people with just a touch of the truth behind their possible labels. <br /> <br /> A good romcom for a Saturday afternoon, and the only movie I've ever seen where sexual fluency ends happily, and no one is forced to be anything they do not want to be. Much better than kissing Jessica Stein, a good choice if you're tired of watching gay movies that have some painful lesson and bitter lesson. Or maybe you enjoy a good British joke? James Purefoy looks as dashing as ever, and Tom Hollander is deliciously funny. So go ahead, watch, enjoy; You will not regret!
