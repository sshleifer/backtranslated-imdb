Certainly this movie has the ring of truth about it, as it purports to be based on actual occurrences on a Navy base. He deals with the local Navy commander's attempt to cover up the unacceptable conduct of a Navy major, which resulted in his death by his former girlfriend, a Marine captain. The man and the woman had been lovers, but the captain tried to break the relationship when he discovered that his boyfriend was married. He continued to chase her, going so far as to fire his side arm toward her at the same time. Finally he broke into his house, attacked her with a knife, and was shot twice with his service pistol and killed. The civilian prosecutor decided on murderous self-defense, but the Marines decided to charge the murder captain. The main thing, you see, was a decorated hero from Vietnam and an old friend of the commanding colonel at the navy base. The captain, too, had made some enemies at his command in motorsport, rejecting some male advances in a very basic style. <br /> <br /> There is considerable psychological charge motivating and controlling the actions of the main participants in this drama. , which the very capable cast goes through well. The director and editor, however, seem determined to obscure events as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and fickle viewpoints. You're lucky if you know where you are most of the time. Stay with them, however; is a worthwhile story while the trial of the captain's martial court unfolds, and it seems that every man's hand is against her, even her lawyer sometimes. <br /> <br /> The verdict? Well, after all, this is a suspense story, so you'll have to see it for yourself. There is a kind of "pacifist" message folded in the film, but forget about it. Of course, "war is hell", but sometimes can not be avoided. We'll need those Marines then, even though they may not always be the best defenders of fair play internally. As Kipling says in his poem "Tommy Atkins": "It's Tommy and Tommy, and Tommy waits outside. But it's place for Mr. Atkins when the troop is on the tide."
