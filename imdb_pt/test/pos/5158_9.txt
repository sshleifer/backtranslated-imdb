Roy Anderson's film "You, The Living" includes a series of fifty-odd sketches, snapshots and vignettes in a Swedish city. Some characters are on the screen for only a few seconds while others appear in countless scenes and are sometimes seen in the background while another story unfolds. Many scenes are drawn from the dreams, nightmares and fantasies of the strange but credible characters who inhabit this world. It's a fascinating approach: each of the scenes can be enjoyed in isolation, but together they contain a powerful portrait of what it is to be human. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour or so, 'You, The Living' is gloriously funny. Much of the humor centers on the members of a metal band, whose musical practice infuriates the neighbors in their apartment block. The comic highlight, however, is provided by a dinner strip that went awry. After this hilarious introduction, however, the mood of the film darken considerably. The dinner-dinner dream becomes gloomy when the unfortunate protagonist is brought to trial for his life, establishing a mixed tone of absurdity and despair for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> In subsequent scenes, the unhappiness of the cast of characters becomes more and more apparent. From them is a world where people are unable to connect with each other, where talk about dreams, nightmares and fantasies is widespread, but where no one can be comforted, even when others seek to help them. The discouraged woman with the chorus 'no one loves me' and the young woman with unrequited love for rock guitarist, Micke, are archetypal characters. <br /> <br /> The world of 'You, The Living' is also marked by selfishness. An elderly teacher is called away from the heat of a vast banquet to answer a call from his impetuous son of uprooted money; a thief steals the wallet of a ruthless executive; an arrogant and impatient businessman insults a Muslim barber and receives his punishment. In the darkest moment of the movie, a woman in the church recounts the long list of human sins as her fellow parishioners creep in to close. <br /> <br /> And yet, for all the dark moments in this movie, the shared chorus of "Tomorrow is another day" points to people's ability to continue living despite many miseries. The soundtrack provided by Benny Anderson (of ABBA fame) seems inappropriately jovial at first, but it makes more sense as the film realizes this human ability to persevere. <br /> <br /> 'You, The Living' has an extraordinary visual style. The same whitish and pale green colors repeat themselves, and there is no shadow in sight; this makes the characters look exceptionally pale and creates the feeling that human life is being exposed for examination. Almost all scenes are captured in a still camera frame, as if they were photographs brought to life. The few occasions on which the camera moves are even more extraordinary; the contrast between life and the movement of the great feast forms a striking contrast to the death of the cloakroom scene. In the most intense moments of nostalgia and despair, do the characters transfix the viewer in front of the camera? they know they are being examined and have a few moments to pour their hearts out to us, the viewers. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful human movie.
