Hilarious and low budget comedy is the best. This set of unique individual sketches with extensive self-referential humor is reminiscent of a really disgusting Kids in the Hall. Be prepared for some of the most random and poignant lines, full of ethnic insults and terrible language. Sex toys included! <br /> <br /> There should be more comedy like this for today. This collection of sketches on a DVD will guarantee many views and revisions in order to appreciate some of the parts. If you liked The State and / or Wet Hot American Summer, get ready for a little more glory. If you are considering this for a younger audience, I would say every child on earth should see it.
