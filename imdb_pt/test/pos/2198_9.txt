"Sweeney Todd" is, in my opinion, one of the few "perfect" musicals. Like "My Fair Lady" and "West Side Story", it has a wonderful and intelligent score. It offers the two protagonists and various supporting roles interesting characters. It has a timeless theme, revenge. Has a good mood and is so powerful when presented simply or on a large scale. "Sweeney Todd" tells the story of a man simply wronged during the industrial period in England. He shows the inhumanity of man to man, as in Sweeney's own words: "There are two kinds of men: there is one who stands in his place, and one with his foot in the face of the other." In an effort to rectify the mistake that was made to him, Todd uses a plan to take revenge. With the help of Mrs. Lovett, who owns a meat pie shop under Mr.Todd's barber shop, they decided to have "those above, to serve those underneath." <br /> <br /> I was lucky to have seen the original Broadway version eight times (six with Cariou and Lansbury, the other two with Hearn and Loudon). I saw the revival with Bob Gunton and Beth Fowler, and several other versions of concerts. <br /> <br /> Although the technical aspects in this production are lacking, to say the least, I believe this filmed production version is the best. Lansbury and Hearn were the two best in these roles, and they have a wonderful time playing against each other. Very good support work by Ken Jennings and Edmund Lyndeck. Although Betsy Joslyn and Cris Groenendaal, as young lovers have absolutely no chemistry, and are basically unwatchable. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
