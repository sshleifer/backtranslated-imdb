Alex Benedict (John Cassavetes) is an orchestra conductor who has a secret affair with his pianist. When she threatens to expose him and create a scandal, if he does not leave his wife, he sees that he has no choice but to assassinate her and make it appear that she committed suicide. Too bad for him, our crumpled detective, Lieutenant Colonel Columbo (Peter Falk), is in the case. <br /> <br /> Stephen Bochco wrote another extremely sharp episode for the series, following wonderful details with wonderful details. We watch the villain commit his murder and set up his alibi for about twenty-five minutes, and we are completely absorbed. So when Columbus comes on the scene, it gets even better. <br /> <br /> First we see Columbus after the murder (as always). This time he's at the vet with his new dog. Scenes of purely comic relief are usually the weakest in the series (think of Columbo's discomfort with the naked model in "Suitable for framing"). Columbus is hilarious when he deliberately hesitates or hinders to stumble upon his prey; but many writers make the mistake of showing it in a ridiculous light when it is with non-suspects. Bochco, on the other hand, shows Columbo a little awkward with his new pet in a handful of discrete scenes that are funny and artistically integrated into the story. (And I'm grateful he did not struggle to find Columbus to give the dog a name.) As far as we've learned, the dog remains nameless.) Bochco gives Columbo some of his best moments in this episode, and Peter Falk make the most of it. He is particularly good at a monologue, where he expresses the disbelief that anyone could kill himself, let alone this brilliant and handsome young pianist. And he's even better in his cat and mouse playing scenes with Cassavetes. The fact that these two long-time friends and collaborators represent one another brilliantly is something expected; and that's what we got. Notice how Alex Benedict can not help admiring the deceptively moody Columbo, even though the brilliant detective is tightening the rope around his neck. <br /> <br /> Bochco makes the most of every situation in his script. When Columbus is going to question Benedict's haughty mechanics, of course? clear! ??? he asks the man to look at his own shabby hill. And when Benedict meets Columbus at the Hollywood Bowl before rehearsal, of course? clear! ??? he is at the piano playing "Chopsticks". And what our lieutenant lieutenant must bring with him, but the typewriter of the victim with the false suicide note still on the roll. <br /> <br /> Columbus also has good scenes with a precocious little girl (Dawn Frame) and the lovely Blythe Danner. , who plays Cassavetes' wife. It's good to see Myrna Loy appear as Danner's mother, although she does little with her minor role. <br /> <br /> Director Nicholas Colasanto (who also acted, most notably as Coach in "Cheers") does a perfect job. credible work, although he follows the lead of almost every other "Columbus" director by adding one or two silly flourishes. The scenes end up getting out of focus and begin to come into focus. So there's that piece where Cassavetes sees the carnation he dropped at the crime scene? and we see a zoomed picture reflected in his sunglasses. There is also a scene with Myrna Loy and a bunch of old fogies that is atrociously run by everyone except Cassavetes. <br /> <br /> These are the puns, though. This is a splendidly entertaining episode, the kind that made me a fan of "Columbus."
