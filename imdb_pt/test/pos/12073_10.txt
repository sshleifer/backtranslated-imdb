I have nothing but praise for this film and cast, especially Ann Margaret. But the most important thing is that I have compliments to my in-laws who were (are) the adoptive parents of Warren and Frank in real life. I met most of the "children" at Warren's wedding in 1989. This is an incredible story and it's even more incredible for me to get to know the family and what everyone else has gone through. It's also nice for me to see how my in-laws were portrayed in the movie. It was very accurate. My wife even likes to see some small details, like a toaster that she remembered from her childhood. Yes, it's a difficult movie to watch, but so incredible and sincere. The beauty of this story to me is how many of the children passed through the lives of my in-laws and as a result of marrying their daughter, and having Warren as my brother-in-law, how many I found in mine. For the past 20 years, this story has been a part of my life because of what my mother-in-law shared with me. That and meet Warren. For what it's worth, Warren lives in California with his family. He married his high school boyfriend, whom he reconnected with at his 20-year high school reunion. <br /> <br /> There was a show in the 80's called "That's Incredible". They had a family reunion that also met the cast of the show. <br /> <br /> For the interest of anyone, the DVD is available in Great Britain and Australia. It is a difficult video to pass here in the United States and I still can not find a DVD here.
