Although I have seen this movie nicknamed in French, I'm sure it lost something in the translation, lack of accents, etc., it was a great and fun movie for a lonely night in a hotel room - a real pick. -up that accurately and positively portrayed the complexities of individual sexuality, the role of gender, and find a place within the communities that are supposed to belong - male, gay, urban, 30 ish, etc. I was very proud of the French television for showing such an honest and positive picture of the gay community. Although the fact that the gay protagonist is a bit "straightforward" in the end is mildly disappointing, it's life, and it happens sometimes. This is a great movie, whether alone or with a date! A very pleasant experience.
