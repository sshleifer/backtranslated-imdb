Mud and Sand is one of the parades of Stan Laurel of the popular films of the time, being this one of the Blood and Sand of Rudolph Valentino (hence Stan being the Vasibarino Rhubarb). Although partially incoherent in characterization (as he defeated these bulls in the beginning is not explained), this was funnier from beginning to end, with one of the best sequences being a dance he does with his then-law wife Mae Laurel. Another funny sequence concerns his reluctance to date a femme fatale, while his wife, Caramel, is waiting for him to show some glimpses of his innocent character with Oliver Hardy. It's worth seeing for anyone interested in seeing Mr. Laurel's initial work before his fateful team that made him popular all over the world.
