This movie was great! It was a completely nice teenage fantasy. So what makes a movie great? Technical details? I think if that was the only criterion, our culture would be poorer for that. So this movie is for "The Godfather" as the new wave music is for Mozart. The point is, it's one of the best movies of the kind I've seen. The women are all beautiful (as they are seen only on California beaches when movies are made). It has a bit of everything, a kind of battlestar gallactica meets baywatch meets the video of the playboy center meets Wayne's World. There is a lot of charm and a reasonable (though predictable) plot that keeps you interested until the next piece of eye drops embellishes the screen. Joe Estevez may not have the career of his siblings, but does a good job of bringing the focus to the story as the eternally adolescent Uncle Bud. Contains many expected absurdities, like female rock band playing without the guitars connected. (Was that intentional?) If you're attracted to the box, rent the video, you will not regret it. As promised, it's good non-violent erotic fun!
