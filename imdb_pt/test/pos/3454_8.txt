I rented this obscure aussie relic a few years ago to show up at a friend's house and it was an instant success. The classic tale of the Wizard of Oz with a decidedly Australian turn of 70. The acting is not exactly Shakespeare's society stuff here, but later, "Mad Max" star Bruce Spence is a beautifully understated surfing / scarf and there are some wonderful twists by Gary Wadell and Robin Ramsay as a delightfully fairy godmother / dad character in the 1970s. Also note the musical contribution of former Daddy Ross frontman Ross Wilson on the title track. In a vein similar to the Australian comedies of the end of the day, like "Priscilla Queen of the Desert". Good fun.
