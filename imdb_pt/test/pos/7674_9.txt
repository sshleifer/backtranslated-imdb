I received the "Summertime" solo in the 5th grade for our spring choral concert. From that moment on, a great appreciation for the music of Gershwin arose in me. I love the amazing melodies of this Gershwin opera. When I was in 5th grade (around age 10), I did the LP to practice and I also really love the soundtrack. I recommend watching this movie and if you can get the soundtrack, get it - sometimes you can find it on eBay - an old used LP. I've been searching and looking to find the soundtrack on CD. The songs have wonderful musical arrangements and I really wish they were put on CD for purchase and they would also like to restore the movie and put it on DVD. This is really a great job that I think the present and future generations would enjoy and benefit from. Some may think the movie is slow and tedious, but I find it quite the opposite. Although Poitier and Dandridge have dubbed musical voices, I think voices fit well on faces and personalities. A person's voice and voice may be very different. Porgy and Bess and the songs from this opera will always have a special meaning for me.
