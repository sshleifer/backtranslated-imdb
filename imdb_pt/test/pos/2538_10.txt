"Pixote: The Law of the Weakest" deals with what is perhaps the greatest of all Brazilian themes: poverty. And along with poverty, the other feelings and unnatural actions that it brings; prostitution, violence, crime, rape and murder. <br /> <br /> Brazil is the country of paradoxes, and its social problems are present everywhere. The difference between the rich and the poor; the beautiful and the ugly; happiness and the deepest human decay. "Pixote" is one of the films that dare to touch and open these wounds so painful, and does so without the slightest glimmer of hope, in an honest portrait of a country that, like Pixote himself , is already lost.
