Starring: Kelsey Grammar, Rob Schneider, Lauren Holly, Rip Rip This movie is a classic family favorite. At least for most of the members of my family that is. One of us rolls his eyes at the mention of this movie and thinks, "What a stupid movie." I'm not that person though. I still find this movie very entertaining. I just watched last night with someone I'd never seen before, and I laughed as hard as I did the first time I watched. It's still very funny to me. <br /> <br /> Captain Naval Tom Dodge (Grammar) is a bit of a black sheep in the Navy. He's the kind of guy who's going to play golf while he's on a submarine, throwing a ball at a golf course as he passes it. He's the kind of guy who's going to get drunk, faint and wake up with a hangover and a tattoo on his dongle. He's not the kind of guy everyone wants to be commanding a sub. <br /> <br /> But Dodge is at the end of the line. He put in applications to get command of his own sub multiple times, and if he does not get a sub this time, he's going to a desk job, which means it's for naval life. The Admiralty decides to give it its own boat, but they do not give it a new nuclear submarine. They give him a diesel submarine, an ancient relic of World War II. Your mission is to clear it and take it to the Atlantic for a war game. Dodge is obviously a little frustrated at having such a bad boat when he worked so hard to get to the point where he is, so he talks to Admiral Winslow (Torn) about it. Winslow explains the purpose of the war game. Diesel submarines are still being sold in the real world, to countries like Iran, Iraq and Libya, to name a few. Winslow wants to know what would happen if some renegade captain on a diesel submarine came to the United States and tried to smuggle a nuclear warhead into one of the bases. Would they do that? Dodge and most of the Admiralty do not think so, but Winslow wants to be sure, so he invented this war game. Dodge's mission is to take the Stingray to sea, then try to flee the US Navy and blow up American naval bases. In the simulated battle, of course. <br /> <br /> So, this is as deep as the plot. This is not a movie-driven movie. It's a stupid movie that's just a big joke. He makes grace of himself, and you should not take it seriously. If you're looking for good moronic laughs on a Friday night, I recommend you take a look. <br /> <br /> Line: 3 of 4 (worth a look)
