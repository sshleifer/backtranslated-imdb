Lucasarts took another beauty out of a seemingly bottomless bag of great games. If any other evidence is needed for them to master this genre of play then this is it. Before actually playing the game, there was little concern about how the writers would keep up with the jokes after the first two games. Fears were plentiful, which would wear off a bit. <br /> <br /> Play the game and see how quickly these fears are dispelled. From the introductory video with Guybrush on the dodgem boat (!), To the final stages of the amusement park, the jokes keep coming. I was a big fan of the first two games and the other works of Lucasarts (Tentacle Day, Sam & Max, etc.) and this one does not fail to deliver the quality. You will not be disappointed. (Well, I was not)
