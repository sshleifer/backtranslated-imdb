This movie is not the scariest of all time, but it is a great example of an exaggerated horror film - low budget, no stars, many inventive scenes of death and nudity enough to keep teenagers in their places. The premise is interesting and fun and the three evil children play their part well. A good starting point for "Just Say" Julie Brown exposing her talents early in her career. This movie will not be seen by many, but for fans of the horror of the 80's is a must.
