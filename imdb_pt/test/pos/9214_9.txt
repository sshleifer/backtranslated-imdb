I must admit that I'm a fan of fancy 80's cartoons, but that's one of the best. Rainbow Brite and Star Stealer are one of Rainbow Brite's most entertaining and entertaining cartoons, and are so much better than the TV series. I particularly like the relationship between Rainbow and Darian and I find it very entertaining. My favorite character, however, is Starlite, which is definitely the most "magnificent horse in the universe"! <br /> <br /> I also recommend Rainbow Brite: New Beginnings, which tells the story of how Rainbowland came about. Have a Rainbow Day!
