American fans of war movies may get bored with this movie, but this boredom is born of ignorance. Guerrilla suppression operations are always like this. Sit and wait, get some prostitutes, get drunk at the base, go to the businessman, kick a prisoner around, cover up the murder of the street trader with the green toilet. So, boom, there go two fuel trucks, and for 10 minutes a small arms battle with a high caliber machine gun. So expect Latinos to plan a way to overthrow their fortress and end up killing some civilians in the process of doing so. If reality does not work for Western viewers, there is always the Top Gun or Rambo. The best part of Afganskiy Izlom's realism was the way all airplanes launched rockets like confetti. They had to do this because Carter and Reagan gave the Mujahedin so many missiles. In addition, the Mi-24's wave was excellent, a better helo attack even than the Apocalypse now. The sight of their missiles falling and firing was an impending "death from above" scene for whom they intended. <br /> <br /> It's funny how the Soviets managed to make an honest movie in Afghanistan within a year. his departure, but took the US six years. Afganskiy Izlom is so real if you apply it to the NATO occupation as well. Someone will always take the gun and shoot you because they care more for the earth. It's a movie that westerners should watch. Unfortunately I do not think anyone has ever done English subtitles; I might have to do some.
