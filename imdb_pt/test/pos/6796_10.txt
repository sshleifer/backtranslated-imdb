The ccmovieman-1 must be, like the New York Times critic who preferred the Janis Joplin Big Brother album and the Holding Company's album to the Beatles' newly released "White" album, was evil or insane. National Velvet is a great movie. Elizabeth Taylor's performance is fantastic, and I can not discern even a trace of accent, let alone one. His performance is very natural, authentic and incredibly charming. The rest of the cast is excellent, especially Rooney and Revere. As far as dialogue is concerned, I suggest that CC has dined for a long time on a diet of irony and has lost the ability to discern genuine direct emotion and human interaction. There was a time when people really thought and talked like that. Not that this movie does not have a slight hint of the magic that pervades it. That is the reason to tell the story. One could also criticize the Wizard of Oz, King Kong, The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, The Black Stallion (the other great movie about horses) or a thousand other films for having action and dialogue that seemed richer than real life. No, my friend, National Velvet, endures because of your belief firmly in yourself, with the tongue firmly not on the cheek. Something that today's weary filmmakers find almost impossible to recreate.
