It must be admitted that Harold Lloyd's best work ended with his last great silent comedy "Speedy" in 1928. After that he enters sound films (like Chaplin and Keaton and Laurel & Hardy and WC Fields) and does better than Keaton, but not as well as the other three. Chaplin was rich enough to make his own films as a producer (but he strolled his films so that for five years between productions). Laurel & Hardy were under the protection of Hal Roach, so the production standards of their short and sound films were very good. Fields worked first with Mack Sennett, then with Paramount and then with the free throw. Lloyd tried the path Chaplin had taken, but less successfully. He produced his own films, but unlike Chaplin, he did not own his own studio. Also their first two choices were not good (especially "First Feet"). But he began to choose wiser and "Movie Crazy", "The Cat's-Paw" and "The Milky Way" were all good choices. These three (and possibly "The Sins of Harold Diddlebock") were his best sound ventures. They are all fun, but none of them goes to "Safety Last," "The Freshman," "The Kid Brother," or "Speedy." <br /> <br /> Of the four best sound films, "The Cat's Paw" is the most controversial. Ezekiel Cobb's solution to rid the city that elects him mayor is too extreme for the taste of 2005. Or is it? When a film is said to be political, "The Cat's Paw" is 1934. This second year of Roosevelt's New Deal (itself quite controversial for more government involvement) the audience watched films like "Gabriel Over the White House, "and" The Phantom President, "where our leaders took extra-constitutional action to rid the nation of internal enemies (and force disarmament around the world). Even Cecil B. De Mille entered this act with "This Day and Age," where a group of teenagers uses rats to force a gangster to confess their crimes. <br /> <br /> For us, the use of violence to force anyone (even a bunch of bullies and crooks like Alan Dinehart's gang) to confess is repellent. After all, the Supreme Court protected us from confession under duress. What we have forgotten is that the reforms we are thinking of did not occur until the Warren Court and Burger Court did them. For example, although Mr. Justice Sutherland's opinion in the 1932 Scottsboro Boys case guaranteed that all criminal defendants had the right to counsel, Gideon v. Wainwright did not extend this to the court of claims until 1962. Miranda Case, with her now well-known anti-conviction notice, is from 1963. None of this was deemed necessary in 1934. If you study other (until even 1960) tricks are used to get confessions - Kirk Douglas confesses his crimes in front of witnesses in "I Walk Alone" while Burt Lancaster holds a gun for him. When Lancaster leaves, Douglas mocks about confessing under duress, just to see the gun being unloaded. Suddenly, he realizes that (legally - in 1948) he confessed without coercion. I hate to say this to any civil liberals who read this note, but what Cobb / Lloyd does to Dinehart and his friends at the conclusion of "The Cat's Paw" was not only legal but would have led to their prison sentences in 1934. We may call it heavy, fascist or horrible, but it would have worked legally when it was thought.
