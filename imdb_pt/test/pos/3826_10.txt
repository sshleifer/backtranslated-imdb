I saw the original Outer Limits in real time when I first broadcast and since then I've seen the entire original series again and again in re-runs and complete on DVD. I think the new outer limits are much more than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested. With seven (7) years of programs versus just the two (2) Years of the original series, producers and writers certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a far more TV series long and very well produced (cable). Plots are clever and scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of the sometimes frightening and imminent future. While most Hollywood producers and directors ignore science fiction as indistinguishable from Horror and Fantasy, this series returns to the origins of science fiction in the logical, moral, and philosophical projections of the current technologies in their possible short-term achievements. This series does it very well and remains unique in mentally avoiding the monster of the shoot-em-up video game of much of the current generation. It has brain, history, a message and good entertainment. It's an adult series with no-nonsense adolescent fantasies unbearable. Hurray! <br /> <br /> Now if we can get MGM to release the entire New Outer Limits series on DVD, instead of just six teaser and the first season now available.
