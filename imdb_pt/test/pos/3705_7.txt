When her aging mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her tenant Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibal monster, TV reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) struggles to keep the beloved mother from satisfying her hunger. Although the above plot summary evokes images of trashy, over-the-top, 1980s horror titles like Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, the mother actually ends up being an original and refreshing version of the werewolf / vampire / zombie myths ( exactly what Emily becomes is never very clear, but it's not cool!), as well as a touching study of the close bond between mother and child: Clay's devotion to mother leads him to abandon all of his other responsibilities. , including his work and relationship with pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough), while Emily's love for Clay leads her to self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film could be sharper, with more stylish direction. and better effects (the creature's shots are kept too brief so as not to disappoint), and some more experienced cast members are frustrated with terribly cheesy performances (Yes, Brion James and Stella Stevens, I'm referring to you); Fortunately, however, the strong emotional current in the well-built story is enough to ensure that the mother is an effective, compelling and occasionally shocking story - one that I would not hesitate to recommend to those looking for something a little different. .
