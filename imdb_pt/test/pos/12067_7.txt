Like many sitcoms, "The War at Home" is improving with each episode. The characters are starting to become real and I believe in them as a family. I agree with many that the first few episodes were not so funny; I thought the show would be canceled for sure. But with the absences of "Malcolm in the Middle" and "Arrested Development," "War" provides much-needed live action comedy for FOX on Sunday nights. And when compared to the rest of the sitcoms that are now appearing, "War" is an even better choice. <br /> <br /> Your appeal, at least to me, is in your real situations. Teens have sex. Not every parent likes how his kids are doing. Parents fight and call each other names. But instead of relying on being "evil" like many shows, everything is good in the end, which is the number one rule of a good sitcom. <br /> <br /> A detraction from the show is the narration during / between scenes. The style of flashbacks "Arrested Development / Family Guy" works well, but the narration may be too much. <br /> <br /> So anyone who needs something to watch on Sunday nights should check out "The War at Home" especially considering what's on the other major networks at that time.
