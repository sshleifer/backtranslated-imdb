In Sri Lanka, a country divided by religion and language, the civil war between the pro-Sinhalese government and the Liberation Tigers of the Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist organization, has already collected some 68,000 lives since 1983. Rights groups As a result of the war, more than one million people were displaced, displaced or living in camps. The impact on children and families caught up in the conflict is dramatically dramatized by acclaimed director Tamil Mani Ratnam in his 2002 film, A Peck on the Cheek, which won several awards at the National Film Awards in India. Although the civil war is only a backdrop to the story of a young woman's journey of discovery, the human cost of the war is very clear and Ratnam gives the fighting a universal context, pointing the finger at arms traffickers as a source of crime . Beautifully photographed in South India by cinematographer Ravi K Chandran in a setting that reflects the terrain of Sri Lanka, the film tells a touching story about a 9-year-old girl who decides to find her real mother . in the midst of fighting in Sri Lanka. Played with deep feeling and expressiveness by PS Keerthana in a memorable performance, Amudha is raised by a loving middle-class family with two younger siblings, after her natural parents, Shyama (Nandita Das) and Dileepan (JD Chakravarthi) were forced to escape when the fighting began. Crossing camp. In a loving flashback, we see Amudha's adoptive parents, father Thiru (Madhavan), a prominent Tamil writer, and mother Indra (Simran), a TV personality, who marry to facilitate the adoption of the darker-skinned little girl . Young Amudha has no idea that she is adopted until she is abruptly sprouted on her ninth birthday, according to her parents' prior agreement. While she's playing, Thiru almost says in tone that "you're not our daughter" and the answer is predictable. Disturbed, she questions who her father was, her mother's name, why she gave up, and so on, but few answers are yet to come. Amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to Sri Lanka to help her find her real mother, now a fighter for the separatists Tamis. The immersion of the family in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions, mainly treated by Ratnam, although a sequence in which the family was caught in a crossfire was amateur. <br /> <br /> Peck on the cheek is of course a Bollywood-style movie and it means tons of music and melodrama. The melodrama did not get in the way of the strong performances of the main actors; however, I found the musical dramatizations of A. R. Rahman's songs contrary to the film's climate with its high-producing techniques and the fast-paced editing of music videos. However, the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the limitations of the film. Tamil cinema has been criticized by many, even within the country, for being overly cliche and commercial, but Peck on the Cheek is both an entertaining film and one that addresses serious issues. The fact of successfully crossing the border between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute.
