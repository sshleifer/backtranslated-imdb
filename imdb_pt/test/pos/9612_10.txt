This movie is the best kung fu movie of all time. Although there are no special effects like those used in Crouching Tiger, this film uses creativity and creative camera work to create memorable fighting moments, and the fight scenes are well choreographed and narrow. There is a ton of action in this movie with many fight scenes, but the story is very good too, with many twists. The characters are well rounded and have real depth to them, as the motivations for their actions and personality are revealed in much greater detail than most kung fu movies. There's a great camera in the movie, with my favorite photo starting as a close-up on our hero's face showing his reaction, and then moving away quickly to reveal the scene in front of him that is the cause of his look. Originally, I bought the movie hoping to see some great fight scenes, but in various visions I learned how amazing the acting and the story were as well. Overall a great movie.
