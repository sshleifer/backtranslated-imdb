This movie starring Peter Lorre as an exceptionally legal guy immigrating to America. Unfortunately, shortly after his arrival, he is in a horrible fire and his face is terribly burned. Because he looks so horrible, no one wants to hire him and out of sheer desperation, he resorts to a life of crime to earn the money needed to buy a mask to hide his ugliness. Where exactly the movie goes from there, you just need to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I have marked this movie as 8 because, for the money spent to do it, it is a great movie with many good twists in the plot to keep it interesting. The film could have degenerated into a simple horror or crime film, but goes far beyond that and offers some genuine surprises. In addition, Lorre's excellent performance shows that he was capable of more than just supporting roles. This is a great movie and offers more than most of the "A" photos of the day.
