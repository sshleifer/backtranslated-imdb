I really liked this movie. I watched last night on the Public Broadcasting System. The part I liked about this was the fact that they dealt with today's issues not in the future or in the past. They basically made some terrorists pick up a van or two and rent them to be car bombs. I think the film could have shown people from different countries at the same time. It showed the fact that England, or any other country, is not prepared for an attack on the magnitude they showed. I've never heard of any of the actors or actresses in the movie so I can not tell if they are usually their roles. After the movie, they had this panel of experts talking about whether something like this could happen here in the US. It was a thought-provoking discussion!
