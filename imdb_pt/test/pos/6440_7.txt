In 1850, in Yorkshire, a chimney boy is falsely accused of robbery by his dishonest master and flees. He falls into a treacherous local river and is transported to an underwater kingdom, where he makes many friends and rescues the mythical Water Babies of an evil shark. <br /> <br /> Based on a book by Charles Kingsley, this is a charming children's movie, half live-action and half animation, which is both a gloomy and evocative representation of Victorian times and a terribly pleasant underwater adventure . They are two films in one, which somehow complement each other and combine into one much richer whole. The animation of Tony Cuthbert, Jack Stokes and Miroslaw Kijowicz is wonderful, as is the picture of Ted Scaife and the music of Phil Coulter and Bill Martin. Pender has a great quality of rough diamond as the fish (literal) out of water - I love the moment he is at the top of the mansion, he sees all the chimneys and shouts "Wow !!" at the top of his voice. Mason and Cribbins are the dirtiest and nasty bullies you could expect in a costume drama (if you want to see real Victorian values, do not watch Sense And Sensibility, see this), and Whitelaw, Pertwee (who does a lot of voices ) and Percival are all excellent. This is how it should be a good children's film - good old fun, but also a bit thoughtful, sad and scary. Cockallorum high !!
