IN & OUT, in my opinion, is a very hilarious movie. I thought Cameron (Matt Dillon) was wrong to say that Howard (Kevin Kline) was gay. The part that I liked the most was Howard's bachelor party. That's because they were telling jokes about many things, including the Barbra Streisand movies. I also thought that Emily (Joan Cusack) looked very handsome in her wedding dress and that Howard looked good in his tux. My favorite quote from IN & OUT is: "Is everyone gay? Is this 'THE TWILIGHT ZONE'?" That was absolutely hilarious! The only character I could not stand was Sonya (Shalom Harlow). That's because she was VERY presumptuous and snobbish. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to all fans of Kevin Kline who have not seen him. Be prepared to laugh HARD and have a good time when you see this.
