From the standpoint of the hectic and contemporary world in which we live, the so-called "good old days" always seem much more serene and innocent; an idyllic era, of which we only have memories and shadows that linger on the silver screen, as in "Christmas in Connecticut," a warm and captivating film directed by Peter Godfrey. Barbara Stanwyck stars as Elizabeth Lane, a popular columnist for "Martha Stewart" magazine who writes about life on her beloved farm in Connecticut, always with the latest recipe in the center of the story. One of his biggest fans is Alexander Yardley, played by Sidney Greenstreet, the publisher of the magazine for which she writes. Yardley never visited her farm, and in response to an idea expressed in a letter from a nurse, Mary (Joyce Compton), he decides to spend an old-fashioned Christmas with Elizabeth, her husband and son and as special guest Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan) , a sailor who has just recovered from spending fifteen days at sea on a raft after his ship was torpedoed. Elizabeth, of course, can not refuse her boss, but there are problems; not least is the fact that she has no farm and writes her column in the comfort of a city skyscraper. This creates a precarious situation for her, as well as for her publisher, Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne), since the only thing Mr Yardley demands of his employees is total honesty. What follows is a delightful and delightfully romantic comedy that transports the audience back to an apparently simpler time and place to share a Christmas Past, where a warm home, good food and gentleness prevail. Barbara Stanwyck absolutely shines like Elizabeth, with a smile and presence warmer than anything the larger fireplace could provide, and utterly convincing as a town girl completely out of her element on the farm. Morgan also does well as the somewhat na√Øve sailor whose confidence in his fellow man is admirable. Even with the deceptions being thrown around him, he's the kind of guy you know who will somehow land on your feet, and in the end it's for Elizabeth that you really feel. One of the true wonders of this film, however, is Sidney Greenstreet. Your Yardley has a rough exterior, but below you know, no doubt, that this is a man with a heart as big as Texas. It is an honest and direct portrait, and it is a joy to see him work; the most memorable scenes of the film belong to him. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), the fantastic Una O'Connor (Norah), Frank Jenks (Sinkewicz) and Dick Elliott (Judge). Crothers). A film that fits in nicely during the Christmas season (though it works any time of the year), Christmas In Connecticut is a memorable movie that never takes itself too seriously, is completely edifying and will leave you with a hot spot on your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world seem like a good place to be. It's a real classic and one that you do not want to miss. I rate this a 10/10. <br /> <br />
