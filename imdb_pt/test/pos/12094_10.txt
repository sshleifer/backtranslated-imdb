Turkish culture is complete with many different cultures. Different cultures have different styles of music. Istanbul is like turkey mix. has mainly the same language, but different dialects. This documentary shows us these different types of music with different dialects and different instruments. you can watch reports with singers and groups, their performances, their daily lives and learn their thoughts about music. the film includes not only the music of Istanbul but life in Istanbul, how people communicate and what they eat and drink. The surprising part is that although I live in Istanbul, I learned a lot from this movie.
