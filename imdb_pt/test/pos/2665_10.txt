A review I've made for a long time ... <br /> <br /> Bluntly, 2001 is one of the best science fiction films ever made, if not the best. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a filmmaker and this is one of his best works. And although it is misunderstood by many, and underestimated, it is considered one of the best films of all time and I have to agree. By 1968, no one had done anything like it before, and no one has done it ever since. It was a marvel of a breakthrough special effects at the time, and seeing how the effects hold up today, it's no wonder why. The movie still looks wonderful after almost forty years! Take note of the CGI people. Through the use of great miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick has created some of the best special effects ever placed on the celluloid. This aspect, by itself, almost alone, created the frozen emptiness of the space atmosphere, which is also attributed to music and realistic sound effects. I can not think of another movie where you can not here anything in space, as it is in reality. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, it is used intelligently as a mood-setting tool, and it works perfectly. <br /> <br /> In addition to the magnificent display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors that play a role in establishing the film's feel. The music played, all classical, complements what the eyes are seeing and makes you feel the meaning of man's journey through his evolution, from the monkey to the space traveler. <br /> <br /> The story, though seemingly simple, is profound. Sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events that make up the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What they do? These are all questions that someone asks themselves as they watch the story develop and are asked to find their own way. While most have a general idea of ​​what happened in history, each individual will have to decide what that means to them. Anyone who decides to answer this question results in profound solutions. It is not entirely left to interpretation, but in some respects it is. Try for more clarification. The end result is very cold, no matter your personal solution. <br /> <br /> Although it is a long movie, and sometimes slows down, it has to be to accurately portray the man's journey. It's not a subject that would have been well presented in a shorter film with a faster paced feature. Those with short attention spans need not apply. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, it is the epitome of a relentless antagonist, HAL 9000, the computer. Never a machine had this creepy screen presence. Which reminds me, for a film with such deep ambition and execution, there is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius. <br /> <br /> All in all, one of the best movies ever made and one of the best science fiction films ever made. A personal favorite. Everyone should see this movie at least once. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
