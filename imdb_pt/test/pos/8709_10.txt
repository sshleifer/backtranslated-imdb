This is one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Calvin Klein underwear model ... oh, I mean, Stefan, the Good Vampire, returns to Transylvania to ascend to the throne of vampire royalty, but half-brother Radu has another plan. Having killed his father, the Vampire King, Radu now focuses on Stefan, Stefan's new mortal girlfriend, Michelle, and her two beautiful friends, and the all-powerful Bloodstone. <br /> <br /> Okay, the scenery is beautiful, and it should be like it was filmed on the spot in Transyl-fricken-vania for goodness sake. The actresses are not great shakes and Stefan, the Heroic Vampire, is as charming as a poker with a chilled fireplace, but who cares? There's only one reason to watch this movie, and his name is RADU! He is a physical tribute to Nosferatu and he has the best lines in the movie, all spoken in the hoarse voice of a man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day. The graveyard festival scene is one of the best scenes in the movie as Radu slowly approaches the camera and reveals his smiling, drooling face for the world to see. I caught myself rooting for him as he collected victims and mocked his perfect brother. But maybe I'm just a sick man. The questionable taste in men aside, I highly recommend this movie to vampire enthusiasts. It's original, it's fun, and Radu is one of the best vampires I've seen in a long time ... far more fun than the gay, helpless undead brutes who forever adorn horror screens lately. Radu likes his sadism and never apologizes. He's what a vampire should be.
