When it comes to political films, I usually leave feeling empty. They usually take some moralistic stance and you have a clear and good story against bad history as if it were some kind of Batman movie. <br /> <br /> But with Lumumba is the first movie I've seen that showed politics for what it is, and the real issues of trying to rule a country of broken people who know no rule other than violence. There was no good or bad, there were only interests and conflicts of interest. This is the only political movie in my opinion that you can get out of it really learning something. Especially for anyone who is watching politics as a career this movie shows, you can not decide what you want for a country, but what the country wants from you. <br /> <br /> This is why I strongly disagree with comments that say everyone is evil, I think they are too idealistic (the Belgians want the perfect colony, Lumumba wants a perfect unity of the Congo, Tshombe wants riches and riches, America wants the perfect ally against communism, Russia wants the perfect adviser of communism). And the Congolese? They leave used and abused, (best example in the film, when Général Janssens tells his black troops that his government lied to you and it leaves them in a frenzy) they are always being pulled and pushed to support this person or another. /> <br /> This film shows in politics that a mistake can cost you dearly and this movie everyone makes mistakes wrong until it worsens and ends up destroying the country. His intentions may be good (or at least in the opinion of the characters), but they are the mistakes of all that lead to the fall of the Congo. I do not think anyone is bad in this movie, I just think they want a lot of people tired of giving and want to start taking. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not just the best political movie, it's a great movie in general. Acting is fabulous (Eriq Ebouaney as Lumumba was the perfect cast, I truly believe in him), impeccable script, perfect rhythm editing and production value greater than I expected for a Central African film. A must watch.
