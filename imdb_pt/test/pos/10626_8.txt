First of all, I must say that I love this movie. <br /> <br /> It was the first movie I saw from director Micheal Haneke and I was impressed by how good the direction was! <br /> <Haneke certainly knows how to direct actors. What I found interesting is also Haneke's scenario. At first you saw a woman who is very straight and seems to be a good piano teacher and very well loved and respected by everyone in her entourage. Then you realize that she has a mother who is a control freak and is very present in her life. Now you know that she is cluttered, that she has emotional problems, but you do not know exactly what. And then you fall on your dark side, but your dark side is only revealed when a student falls in love with it. She can not control herself anymore. <br /> <br /> The roles are very complex and difficult to interpret, but Isabelle Huppert is wonderful in her role and deserves the recognition she had at the Cannes Film Festival. Benoit Maginel is very solid too, but a bit eclipsed by Huppert's performance. <br /> <br /> There is one thing I found strange in the scenario is how the character played by Magimel is not very credible. He is very talented! It's rare for a person to be a piano virtuoso, but spend most of his time playing hockey and studying ... He thinks it's a weakness, but only a small flaw. <br /> <br /> I just saw the movie once, so I can not make a very thorough review because I did not analyze the movie. I like what I saw! so I give the film a 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Oh yeah ... as for the ending, Haneke showed that he really wanted to shock his audience. A motivation that does not think it necessary to make films, but Haneke does it with style and precision, so his film is better than Baise-Moi, for example. <br /> <br /> Vince
