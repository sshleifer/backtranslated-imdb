I like the movie, it's the best pirate movie I've watched so far (forget about Errol-Flynn-stuff and Pirates of the Caribbean). This movie is wonderful and melancholic. I compare this with "Johnny Guitar" on the sea side (but 3 years before), two women fighting for a man, where mad love can take one. The heroine, Anne Providence, is superb, acting without compromise as a child, lost alone in her quest for a feminine identity of her own in the world of a real man. a very strange movie heroine, not a funny pirate, like most of her comrades in this genre, not making jokes all the time, fighting for the poor and good and just killing the stupid Spanish or British soldiers or - better - governors, but she is murdering all the poor prisoners of war, after she captured a ship (be careful with that at the beginning of the movie), she is primitive (she can not even read), she is desperate and she is an alcoholic, she loses all her friends as a consequence of her stubbornness and she is using rags to most of the film.This movie shows a pirate "hero" a little (!) Bit like him (or in this case "she", but there was a woman "Anne" buccaneer Anne Boney) could have <br /> <br /> The film is rather short and the story is told in a sweeping way. Certainly, a 1950s movie has no exciting special effects for current viewers (the boats swim very obvious in a tub tube), but this real drama about love (kills), confidence, betrayal, revenge and hatred leads to a crazy. Perhaps, Anne should be Judas Iskarioth and Jesus of Nazareth in one person, being betrayed by her friend (the French LaRochelle) as Jesus; after being disappointed by his friend, delivering him to a death penalty (like Judas); than to have remorse over it (like Judas, who commits suicide according to the Gospel of Matthew); and in the end sacrificing himself for the rescue of the beloved enemy (like Jesus). But even if you are not interested in these philosophical issues of guilt and atonement, the film brings a lot of action (cheap) like sword fights and burning ships (plastic) for an hour and a half too short.
