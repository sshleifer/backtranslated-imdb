Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early rock 'n' roll. The young singer / songwriter from Lubbock, Texas, made his mark on the model of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly would spend a lot of time battling the system to record her rock-a-baby sound. Before his untimely death, he was mixing lush chords with be-bop beats. Holly would take her place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voices of teen angst. <br /> <br /> This easy to see biography is not flawless. Some situations, events, places and even names were not correct for several reasons. What makes this film so believable is that Gary Busey made his own singing on Holly's part. A well-produced soundtrack has become a multimillionaire seller. <br /> <br /> Busey was nominated for an Oscar. Other prominent stars are Don Stroud, Conrad Janis, Charles Martin Smith and Maria Richwine.
