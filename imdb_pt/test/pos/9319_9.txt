Yes, I give it a 10 because I compare it not only with others but also with what the dreck is bombarded daily in what is ridiculously called "popular culture" today. In addition, the film is beautifully released, as has been said elsewhere, and gives us a good look at the popular theater of the late 18th and early 20th century. It is not by chance that many of the plays that Olcott played involve a similar storyline: Boy knows the girl, someone objections (usually the father or some authority figure), boy fight, boy beat girl. The was actually known at the time as a "Chauncey Olcott Act". No coincidence, too, that John Ford drove one. He called, "The quiet man." And, "My Wild Irish Rose," is by itself an "act of Chauncey Olcott." Great, is not it? Anyway, great songs, great stuff. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> PS - After watching the movie, I would like to know more about Bill Scanlan. I found a death that said he gave up "Mauvorneen" as a result of insanity (replaced, as in the film, by Chauncey Olcott) and died in an asylum several years later. But he had apparently been a very large star by himself, who wrote songs and plays and had pieces written for him. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know more?
