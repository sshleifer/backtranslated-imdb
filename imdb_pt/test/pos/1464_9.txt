The first episode of 'Man to Man with Dean Learner' that just aired was at least up to zero with most episodes of 'Darkplace by Garth Marenghi' and had me in "My Maisonette". I hope you continue the good work of 'terrible faux' on my TV. Richard Ayoade is one of the best in the new generation of "alternative comedy" (I hate this phrase, but I'm too lazy to think of another). Comedians on TV today. I'm glad that on a local DVD retailers trip today "Garth Marenghi's Darkplace" was sold all over the board. Even from his brief spell on Nathan Barley I knew that Ayoade was a serious talent and I'm sure he would have been great as Dixon Bainbridge in 'The Mighty Boosh' to continue success! In the vein of these programs, I also felt the need to extend my review in order to secure a place in this public domain.
