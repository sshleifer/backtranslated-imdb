Project A II is a classic Jackie Chan movie with all the kung fu, acrobatics and wacky humor you expect. Not as good as the prequel, but still a great movie if you want something fun to watch. The story is simple, jackie chan versus bad men. So, if you want a movie you do not have to be a braniac to understand, I would suggest this.
