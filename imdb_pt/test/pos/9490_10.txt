just another zeppelin showcase led in its best and absolute best balance. each member of the band is on his best page of jimmy and his JPJ bow and guitar with his boom boom and Robert singing as if there was no tomorrow. I have to say that when we get into the first song, where will groove is the beginning of something very special. this DVD follows the zeppelin through its Carree of 11 years beginning in 69 in the Royal Albert Hall and later in Madison Square Garden 73 followed by a much older and mature band in 75 in the Earls Court and finally in a different band in its last show at Knebworth at 79 This DVD is fantastic zeppelin showcase and if you are not a fan you will be after.
