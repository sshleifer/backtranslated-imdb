After many, many years, I saw this beautiful love story again, thinking how I would react to a movie that made so many girls cry and sigh back then when I was just a teenager trying to understand women's behavior , in a small city in Brazil. <br /> <br /> This time, however, what struck me in the film was something very different, namely, the insistence with which the doctor Dr. Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) makes clear to the journalist Mark Elliott (William Holden) his ethically special condition as an Eurasian. In fact, she is constantly emphasizing this point in her relationship, repeating that she is willing to take his love for him and to perform in a "Western" way, as long as in doing so she is not betraying her Chinese side. . It seems to the viewer that Suyin is eagerly making efforts to establish a very subtle conciliation between these two unstable and opposing aspects of his culture, for they will immediately engage in open conflict in their mind with a minimal flaw in their attempts to control it, the So, does Suyin's attitudes always leave poor Elliott? a determined man, brave and extremely practical? anxious and perplexed, not knowing how much importance to give her words. For him, whose love for her is clear and simple, the situation is totally clear: if we love each other, let's make a couple and immediately start a life together. "Not so fast," is what she seems, verbally and not verbally, to respond to it all the time. <br /> <br /> In fact, the Chinese portion of Suyin would never allow such a level of pragmatism. And as she continues to reinforce this so directed balance between these two worlds within herself, she also often points out to him that too a very peculiar trait of Chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind, namely the constant "incursions" into real world by invisible beings from a spiritual or non-physical world. For Suyin is always warning Elliott of how dangerous life is, not because of any objective and concrete threat (such as the perpetuation of English colonialism or the eminence of a Japanese invasion), but because of the threats of many cruelties and harms. gods and other mythical and mythical beings about poor, frightened and vulnerable human beings. <br /> <br /> In fact, it seems that a handful of Chinese deities are constantly on the alert to make people's lives totally unhappy. Because of this, mothers should dress their precious male babies in girls' clothes, so that they are not carried away by jealous gods; everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to ward off the clouds in order to prevent them from covering the vision of the moon; the peasants are warned to shout loudly: "Rice is bad, rice is bad!" protect their crops from being robbed by deities; and at a funeral, it is recommended that the family of the dead be cut off from other people so that the gods do not take advantage of their sadness and fragility. In other words, Suyin introduces us to a culture in which the supernatural has a real existence, as if a disturbing pantheon of evil and sadistic gods was always on the verge of interfering negatively in the most trivial acts of life of anyone. As history takes place in Hong Kong in 1949, it should be clear that China was, at the time, almost a semi-feudal society, while the country from which Elliott came was still not dominated by the ferocious capitalism that, launched by the United States after the first oil shock in 1973, took over the entire world. So, at least in one respect, both sides of Suyin's Eurasian personality were still far more innocent than they would be today. <br /> <br /> A lot of history has come from those old days. As for China, the main fact is that, after several phases of a communist regime, the country has at last reached the status of a very aggressive economy, much more properly described as state capitalism. And what happened to that old spirituality that so enraptured Suyin in Hong Kong in 1949, and with which she used to impress so much a passionate Elliott, under that tree on the hill behind the hospital? He's gone, completely missing! In short, if this story were to occur today, Elliott would not find it necessary to go to China to propose to Suyin in the presence of the Third Uncle and his whole family. In fact, both men would now be incomparably closer to each other, in their enormous pragmatism, talking as ever!
