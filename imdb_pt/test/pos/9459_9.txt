She's the guy is great. It's funny, original and made me laugh so hard I almost wet my seat. the day I went to see in the movies I was not in the best moods (problems with the man), but leaving the film I had a smile on my face. The story is a bit out there with no one realizing that she looks a lot like a girl, but hey, who am I to say what is believable, the jokes are great and some of the liners of this 2006 hit may end in history. Amanda B. did a great job as the lead role and Channing Tatum seems too good to be true as her opposite as the gorgeous duke. So girls will see this because it's a great laugh and you have a hot guy and you guys will see why you can learn something about girls! <br /> <br /> All in all a brilliant, fantastic and fun movie that I'll buy on DVD when I leave.
