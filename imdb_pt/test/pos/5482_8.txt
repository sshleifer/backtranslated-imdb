Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is being harassed by Mitch Leary (John Malkovich), a terrorist bomber who literally believes he will not get caught. Opening is the all-time popular serial killer, "John Kramer" (Tobin Bell) from the Saw series. Through intelligent planning and influence, Frank is able to make the arrest of Mendoza (Bell). <br /> <br /> From then on, it's a cat-and-mouse chase series. Malkovich is a tremendous and incredibly versatile actor. Once again showing a different role in this film, it surprises me with his ability to swap his characters with the next movie. <br /> <br /> I see Malkovich touching Con Air as an insane and cunning Cyrus in Of Mice and Men as the tragically challenged bunny lover Lenny, to name a few. He plays a very intelligent bomber terrorist, who is very sensible, but is deluded into thinking he can escape his captures. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood is no one special to me. He's too old to actually do a lot of action in movies, so the only thing he can really surprise is his ability to create dramatic scenes. The characters he plays are simplistic and one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Ren√© Russo interprets Eastwood's love interest in the film and captivates me with his support being really a bigger role for me than Eastwood's. <br /> While this may seem like an action blockbuster, it's relatively slow and throws in anticipation. You have to wait for the build up and the end, and that will be rewarded in the end. Along the way, you'll be mesmerized by the chemistry of Malkovich and Eastwood and their cat and mouse scenes.
