Well, I'm not about to add to the diatribe that was "preached" about this movie. <br /> <br /> All I can add is that at no time does it pretend to be a "historical" image. Unlike 'Braveheart', 'Titanic' or 'The Patriot', all with very credible and serious historical alterations, purely for theatrical effect (possible worst of excuses). <br /> <br /> Did everyone like a bad mood? <br /> <br /> All I can add is a paraphrase from the good Captain Macleane - "It looked fantastic and we got a good laugh." <br /> <br /> One last point. What surprises me is that there are comments related to "modern music" in a historical setting. I wonder if the same people made the same judgment about the Moulin Rouge. I suggest not.
