Horses on Mars is an engaging short animation that sometimes takes a comic look at the process of evolution through the eyes of those who have not yet evolved. The story is personal, and sometimes sentimental, and is backed by a strong digital animation and narration that engages the viewer in this science fiction story. I was fortunate to see this short widescreen format at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival, and I must assume that when transferred to the small screen, it will lose some of its ability to lure the reader to the story no less careful and impressive graphics.
