Nostalgia is not always the best reason to watch a movie. More often than not, the movies you loved as a child disappoint you as an adult. Although there are exceptions to this rule, it is difficult to justify possession of a Krull DVD, no matter how insightful the director's comments. But staying sharp Gen X / Y'ers, because the dozens of disappointments dominating your journey down memory road, can prevent you from stumbling on a worth revisiting. A surprise movie worth another look is Joel Schumacher's Flatliners, the supernatural thriller starring eighties popcorn heavyweights Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Julia Roberts and Billy Baldwin. You'd think a stew composed of this cast, Schumacher's flamboyant flair, and the smooth eye of filmmaker Jan De Bont would result in something disgustingly boring, but the calories aside ... Flatliners is not at all bad. Although the production design is inexplicably exaggerated and the photograph is too painfully stylized (filled with streets soaked in neon that spew endless steam streams), Flatliners can still be an effectively dark and irresistible thriller. If there is an explanation why the Flatliners were forgotten, it may be because the year 1990 saw the release of another supernatural thriller: Jacob's Ladder. The Flatliners were released a year or two after Jacob's Ladder, it's probably the Schumacher thriller would have been dismissed as a commercial theft of Adrian Lyne's nightmare masterpiece. But with those films being released that same year, Flatliners had a different fate, tripling JL's box office share, though it was a diluted version of a similar premise. The passage of time has not been so gentle with the Flatliners, it was lost upon a stack dated from the trash Brat Pack of the 80's, while JL cemented its reputation as a timeless classic. Leaving fate aside, JL is perfectly terrifying and manages to keep the audience guessing until the last frame, while the Flatliners fall victim to the oversimplification and Hollywood conveniences that drag the last act to a predictably neat outcome. The comparisons between the two films are unfair and end up neglecting Flatliner's ability to represent the 1980s at its best. Launched at the end of a decade of superficial excess, the Flatliners will always be dated by their hairstyles and clothing styles, but to be fair it must also be remembered as a well-executed movie on (or at least close to) the top of their stack private. of dreck. For intentions and purposes, it's a fun ride down memory lane.
