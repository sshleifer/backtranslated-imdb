This movie shocked me. It was so realistic and the story was amazing playing. They speak German and Russian, which makes it more believable and real. This is a must-see movie. The actors are great too. Really a good job. The plot takes place within a German troop in World War II. They have to go to Stalingrad, Sovjet, to fight against the Soviet armies. You become more connected with all the soldiers in this group and follow them through all the dangers when they are captured in Stalingrad. They meet face to face with Russia's death, blood, sadness and coldness. This is a must-see movie and you can not afford not to see it.
