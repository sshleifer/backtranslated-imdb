Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary about the Zephyr Skateboarding Team and its influence on skateboarding. He also focuses on the history of skateboarding. It was directed by Stacy Peralta, a member of the original Zephyr team, and was written by Stacy Peralta and Craig Stecyk, another member of the team. The documentary is starring members of the Zephyr Team and is narrated by Sean Penn. <br /> <br /> The documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding and how it evolved from surfing. He discusses the popularity of skateboarding in the late 1960s and 1970s, its decline in the 1980s and its "rebirth" in the 1990s. Skateboarding was introduced in Dogtown, the nickname of the poor side of Santa Monica, California. The Zephyr Team came from the Zephyr Surf Shop, which made the first modern skateboards. The documentary consists mainly of the original members of the Zephyr Team talking about the past in the Zephyr Team, the competitions they have won and their popularity and prestige. It focuses on three specific team members; Peralta, Tony Alva and Jay Adams, three skateboard virtuosos, and probably the top three team members. <br /> <br /> Interviews in the documentary were usually voices about Dogtown filming in the late 60s and 70s. You rarely see people being interviewed, but when they do, they are shown in black and white while the file footage is colored. I think Stacy Peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past (ie the Glory Days of the Zephyr Team) and not the present. The documentary is very fast, since we often see awesome skateboard clips about the music of the day (like Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and David Bowie), and the interviews tend to be quick and objective. Not knowing anything about skateboarding (ie not even knowing how to walk straight across the floor), I was very surprised to find this documentary so interesting. The reason is that this document was more about the Zephyr Team than about the sport of skateboarding, so while I could not relate to skateboarding, I could relate to the guys on the team. Because it was made by real team members, it gives you a bit more depth and authenticity. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would have to say that this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. This gave me a whole new vision, not just for the Zephyr team, but for the skateboard as a whole. For those who like to skate, I can imagine how it should be even more interesting. Seven and a half stars out of ten.
