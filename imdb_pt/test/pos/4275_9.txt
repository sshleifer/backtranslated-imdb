As a local artist, I thought that "Grease" showed what the Broadway producers are looking for and highlighted a bit of the population in action. Although my favorites did not win (but came second), I liked to compare myself to them and see what I liked and where I could improve as an artist. <br /> <br /> They brought in Olivia Newton-John because she is the obvious link between Broadway production and the television audience. <br /> <br /> They sang songs from the film (Hopelessly Devoted, et al) because these songs will be included in the new production. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous comment that the cast of B'Way seems much older, but you should keep in mind that they are people who have been on Broadway and worked to be there. If the cast were all fresh and green, I believe that would have compromised the casting process by which producers choose their talent.
