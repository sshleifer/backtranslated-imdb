I found this movie amusing. I've never watched old movies before and this was really a great first date movie. He had warmth and heart and spirit. It was kind of tacky, but in today's film industry, cheese is cute. I gave a ten and I suggest renting, buying or watching the movie anyway you can. Gene Kelly was very dreamy and a little sarcastic and you knew the character thought he would have it all. The female lead was perfect because her two personalities had the spark and you wanted to hold on and see what would happen. The movie's grandmother was priceless. The perfect addition to a great old movie. I love the fact of being black and white and Gene Kelly is so sweet with all the kids in the movie that you can not help but like him. Look.
