The plot of this film is against the most terrible war in the history of mankind: the violent confrontation between Adolf Hitler's Germany and Soviet Russia, from 1941 to '45. <br /> <br /> With the western areas of his country completely devastated, and 20 to 30 million Russians killed, the vibrations of this conflict can be felt in Russia to this day. Much less in 1957, when the memories were still very fresh and painful. <br /> <br /> This very black scenario contrasts sharply with the fine, coherent style of the beautiful shots of Letjat zhuravli. Its simple story deals with human behavior in times of war: bravery, love, patriotism, weakness, cowardice and corruption. All beautifully tied up by a toy squirrel. <br /> <br /> Add to that the really magnificent acting, and it's easy to understand why this movie is so famous. Really, one of the best ever made. <br /> <br />
