Blademaster is definitely a memorable entry in the Swords and Sorcery movie category. I found Blademaster along with Quest for the Mighty Sword in a thrift shop serviced by mentally handicapped and I was very happy to pay 2.00 each for them. Sets and costumes, good sword fighting and a beautiful warrior, Mila make this a nice watch. A few problems, however, were many details in the plot that did not fit well, as did the men from the cave to one. I did not understand their purpose. Also, this movie could actually have benefited from a few more monsters. The snake was cool, but I think it lent a little of Conan. However, any primitive type of movie where someone ends up with a hanglider is OK by me (see Yor and Battle for Endor). I think Actor is cool! Oh, and did anyone else remember Gallager for the villain or is it just me? I give blademaster a 7/10
