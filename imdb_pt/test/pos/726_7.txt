What can I say? It's not as bad as many here got to be. The only reason I even watched this movie that I had never heard of before was strictly for IAN McSHANE. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brings an incredible subtlety to his role. He is always great to watch and for my money ... an extremely underused actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the film .... All the other actors in the film performed strong and solid performances. These people certainly were not receiving huge amounts of money for their participation (since this was a low-budget film), but that did not mean that any of them "sent" their appearances. All were convincing and convincing with the given parts. I was even pleasantly surprised by the performance of ADRIAN PAUL, although I must admit that I only saw him on the HIGHLANDER Television series before this movie. The plot was well paced and the plot intriguing and very much like real life, not everything ends up tied in a nice package for you at the end of the movie. Anyone who expected a clear, by numbers, connect the "conclusion" or "answer" points at the end of the movie ... CLEARLY was not watching the movie closely enough! This movie will not tell you what the "meaning of life" is! The idea is that after watching the movie, you can go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends during a coffee break. I certainly did. <br /> <br /> No car chase ... No blast ... No bar fight ... (sounds pretty dull, huh?) But the reality is that I was completely absorbed in the movie and it's just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involved. <br /> <br /> ****** WARNING ... ****** If you are the kind of person who does not like movies that sway a huge "question" as the central engine of the story and then finish the movie without answering that particular question directly ... <br /> <br /> YOU CAN NOT SEIZE THIS MOVIE.
