I found this movie to be one of those big hot heart stones. The plot is well woven and the character development is fantastic! I'm a big fan of movies from outside the US anyway and this is there: "Happenstance", "The Closet" and even "King of Hearts". Vlastimil Brodsky as Fanda, is fantastic. It is a love story in the true sense of love life, and the twists and turns necessary to make the viewer understand / appreciate Fanda's vision of life (which almost costs him more than he is prepared to give) are wonderful. His co-star Stelle Zazvorkova is unforgettable as his weary wife. I highly recommend this movie to the whole family - my kids loved it.
