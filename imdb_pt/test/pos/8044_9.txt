The Assignment is an excellent thriller with several character-driven twists, rather than turning stars, the need to stage special effects, compulsory romance and endless car chases. However, there is a car chase here and a dandy is. Aidan Quinn is wonderful, both the terrorist and the navy officer "recruited" to eliminate it. It is rare that a second or third actor, like Quinn, receives an important protagonist role like this, that carries a film. Usually, this role is given to a first-rate actor with box office draws, and that's probably why I've never heard of this movie before watching it. Donald Sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous, sometimes scary, agent that recruits Quinn. Ben Kingsley is also good as the Israeli agent. The plot is very complex and there are several plots, which converge gradually to the end, and not all at once as we are accustomed to see. The paranoia and claustrophobia of this type of thrillers are captured and portrayed with moral ambiguity and frightening intensity. The sites are convincing and effective. The soundtrack is nothing special, but we rarely get all the qualities mentioned above these days, without stupid and / or nonsensical plot developments; unconvincing star turns; loud, annoying, kind of music video soundtracks; a villain who does this; and repeatedly a cast, costumes and plot that mostly serve a public under 25 years. This is a featured thriller, which certainly did not get due due to its release. *** 1/2 of 4 stars.
