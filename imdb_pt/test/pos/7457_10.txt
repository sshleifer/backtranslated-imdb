Duckman was a show that used to happen during the last hour, before it was time to sleep about ten years ago. It was a contrast to the kind of childish animation I was seeing at the time; I was still a minor addict to things from Disney and Looney Tunes, and most of the Saturday morning cartoons were still in the second-round peak of the days of Ninja Turtles and Batman. But also at this time I began to recognize that the most obscene, mature, surreal, obscene, and (although I did not know the term at the time) satirical drawings were more creative than I was accustomed to. At the time of Beavis and Butt-head, Ren and Stimpy, and even the Maxx were coming to the TV sets via MTV, the US made two shows - one was Weird Science and the other was Duckman. I've always remembered some parts of the show, and some of the sentences are very quoteable to those who have not completely forgotten it. Luckily, I found a tape recently with about six episodes I recorded long ago, and the jokes remained fresh. And the delivery of the jokes is too fast most of the time in the best episodes. <br /> <br /> In the voice department, talent choices are first-rate for story lines, which are usually just an excuse for raw and fascinating parodies of pop culture, politics, movies, and TV shows, music. , detective mysteries, and the dysfunctional family unit. Jason Alexander is a wonderful choice for Duckman, and his performance is a comedy of his days in Seinfeld (even though there may be some similar features here and there). In addition, Gregg Berger's voices like the unmistakably monotonous and unimpressive Cornfed, Dweezil Zappa as the unfit hilarious Ajax, and Nancy Travis as the annoyed sex prostitute, Bernice, all contribute in a total amount. Along with great writing - even when a joke is not surefire, the wit behind it pays off - the style of animation, though far removed from some of today's computer-enhanced products, is inventive and often abstract. It has that sandy quality that Beavis and Butt-head or South Park would have later. And as these shows, if you're a kid, I mean little like in younger than I was watching the show, you may not understand most of the jokes (ie there are enough stripper and VD references to fill two shows at times). But it's inventive to catch if it's on TV late at night and works great at that time. We can only hope for a set of DVD boxes. <br /> <br /> So, for anyone who has barely heard of this program, here is a general note: think of this program as if Dashiell Hammett met with Walt Disney and decided to go to the Las Vegas slum with a free mini bar and do a collaboration in vein of Luis Bunuel and The Simpsons combined. Not to mention, it's the group that made Rugrats. (Strong)
