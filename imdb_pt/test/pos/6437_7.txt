I saw this movie for the first time when I was a 6 ish - my grandmother thought it would be a good kid movie to entertain me and keep me busy ... however, every time I watched I had nightmares the same night. Yes, it disguises itself as a children's movie, but even now I think it's actually dark in some places, particularly the haunting music that is played every time the guardian angel's wife is onscreen, and her eyes and voice quite hypnotic . The real "villains" of the film, namely the sharks, Mr. Grimes, etc. did not scare me, I always found the whole movie quite scary and gloomy. This is obviously something I can appreciate now that I am 21, but speaking from experience there is no way to show my children!
