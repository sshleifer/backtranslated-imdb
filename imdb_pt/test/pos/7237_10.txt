Yes!! They finally went down to perfection. What a great idea, an epic of refreshing exploration for Generation-X, whether they know it or not. After disasters like the sergeant. Kabukiman from NYPD and fucking with Blockbuster, our hero, Lloyd Kaufman, decided to go there, stop taking care of distributors and let Troma be the Troma that can be. Lloyd would make this Troma movie the most remorseless, weird and downright hilarious yet. This time, Lloyd takes Shakespeare's love story, turns it upside down, trottles it, and adds that long, lost entertainment value that was always lacking. Entertainment value, like Lemmy Kilmister (the narrator), Debbie Rochon (the cook), Joe Fleishaker (the fat guy) and, of course, brutal mutilations and bathroom humor. Tromeo and Julieta is the definitive edition of a somewhat dull story, and the crown jewel of the Troma universe. Years ago in Tromaville, business partners NJ, Monty Que, and Cap Capulet started a film company called Silky Films, which would produce soft-core films supposedly in good taste. Monty considers Cap his friend, but Cap wants to wipe out the poor sucker for his part in the company. On paper and on the books, Monty seems to have given the work of his life for free. Moving into the mid-'90s in Manhattan, we have two families that are extremely unhappy with each other, so much so that they are just looking for a reason to get a member, or preferably a life. Monty has a son, Tromeo, nephew, Benny, they, with their friend, Murray Martini, who is a little too excited about all the carnage, makes war against the incestuous Capulets, except Monty, he's too drunk to care. As in the original, there is a confusing situation, causing Tromeo to fall in love with Cap's daughter, whom he never knew or never met. Unfortunately, Cap is a sadistic pervert who, unlike Tromeu's father, has a crush on the bottle, and that, of course, would bring Dad's chenshaw melon to be physically, emotionally abused, molested and kept in an acrylic cage. Cap is also forcing her vegetarian daughter to marry London Arbuckle, a billionaire butcher, who would make anyone uncomfortable with or without the raisin bread. With all these drawbacks, young lovers think running away would be the best decision, but how will that affect the big fight? It may or may not go a bit like the original, but figuring out how it ends up just is not going to happen, you'll never see it coming. with Leo "is absolutely sleep inducing compared to Tromeu & Juliet, but if diluted, over-directed, big budget, Hollywood, Garbage is what you've been scheduled to go, then by all means media, go ahead, but if you're in the mood for something a little more colorful, something that really jumps, and does not follow the "normal" movie standard, and if you have a rather abnormal sense of humor then you and Toutoo and Juliet, who plays the most enduring role in the history of the movie, Motorhead, and not to mention a lot of comments by James Gunn, who actually put together this one.For more pomp from James Gunn, check out Lollilove and, for more excellence by Lloyd Kaufman, check out his next vision, Terror Firmer. the invaluable exploration breath for the 90's brought to us by one, and only, King of the B movies. Thank you, Lloyd. 10/10
