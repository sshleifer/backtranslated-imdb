This film is a variation of a theme we have all seen repeatedly - Posiedan's adventure in space. The characters are all action characters - moody heroine, Judas, coward, etc. etc. The only question is who is close to finalizing. Sometimes this tried and tested formula works - as in this case - but more often not - as the "Red Planet," which mind numb. <br /> <br /> So, why does this work work? Because it is elegant. The performance is above average. And above all, it is not predictable. The conclusion was not published. I really had no idea how it would all end and I was surprised at how it ended. That alone deserves the best grades in my book. <br /> <br /> It's an intriguing and entertaining movie. And though it's never likely to change the face of the movies as we know it, it does not disappoint.
