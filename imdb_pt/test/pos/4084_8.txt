I thought the movie was good, but I like to read the real story behind the movies "based on a true story." Does anyone know the names and locations of the actual characters on which the movie is based? I have done a complete search on the Internet and can not find any information on this case. All I get is the information from the movie and the fact that it is based on a "true story". I find it hard to believe that a judge would change his sentence processed immediately in court, even after such a sincere speech from his brother (handsome John Corbett), but overall the story was very moving. Anyway, if anyone knows the real "real story" I'd like you to share!
