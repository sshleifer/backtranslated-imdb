First: if you like watching movies, I recommend that you DO NOT watch this. Because? Then you will no longer enjoy any other film so easily ... <br /> <br /> In fact I do not want to give rise to excessive expectations, but it is almost scary how perfect, intense and beautiful this work of Einar Gudmundsson is . While in most movies there is at least one aspect spoiling the whole thing, such as good actors but horrible dialogues or a nice scenario but low budget cinematography? in "Angels of the Universe" there is nothing of this ambivalence. Really everything is great, even (and not least) the soundtrack with the magnificent Sigur RÃ³s. <br /> <br /> In this story about Pall, a schizophrenic student after being dismissed by his girlfriend, especially the dialogues (and monologues) deserve some attention: along with (and sometimes in contrast to) the plot they vary from depressing and fatalistic for all the opposite of comic and totally absurd. In addition, they are often (with quotes from Hegel and Shakespeare) of such poetic beauty that the film almost transforms into a surreal sphere and is only saved in the real world by its incredibly authentic actors. <br /> <br /> One of the other comments already referred to another point: this movie is not a trivial entertainment to relax at night, despite several comic reliefs between them, is quite disturbing, partially cynical and bitter, and above all sad a modern poetry about a life of insanity with all its emptiness, anger and loneliness. <br /> <br /> Finally: When did you see the movie? watch again. There are some great visual metaphors and allusions in it that you only notice when you look twice and connect them with the moral of the story. And, of course: read the book, it contains many more of the little funny stories in the story. between and also makes you understand some things in the movie a little better.
