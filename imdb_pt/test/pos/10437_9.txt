I saw this movie for the first time recently. If you ask me, you do not get the credit you deserve. It's a bit like American Pie meets Fast Times in Ridgemont High but with more depth. It deals with the same problems as the two films, but in a way it does contain some truth. The end is sad, but that's how life is. I think everyone should see this. I have this in DVD format, and it took me a long time to find it too. That should say something, heh and another thing I will add is that it is very difficult to find the soundtrack. I believe they have stopped, but the soundtrack to this movie is incredible. There are songs by artists like The Commodores, U2, Devo, REO Speedwagon, The Cars, KC and Sunshine Band, and many more.
