This movie is simply amazing. It's so hilarious. Although the skateboard and other mounts are thrown away, the comedy is incredible. Raab and Brandon Dicamillo themselves are hilarious. There will be times when you can not breathe and you're laughing so much. Also, there are scenes that you can watch hundreds of times and still laugh. This is one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen.
