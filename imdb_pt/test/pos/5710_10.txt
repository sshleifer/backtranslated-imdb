"The Student Nurses" is an excellent film that deals with four women linked by friendship and career. For the first time, it is possible to see a realistic picture of relationships within the workplace, outside the workplace, the risks of such relationships and the consequences. This film also offers a rare chance to see veteran theater and television actress Katherine "Scottie" MacGregor as the nursing teacher, "Miss Boswell." MacGregor is best known for her performance as "Mrs. Oleson" in the TV series "Little House on the Prairie". The direction, music, and color of the print are very good, as is the opening theme song by Clancy B. Grass, III. This film offers a rare opportunity for those who like themes centered around the late 1960s and early 1970s, offering a "softer side of life" while appreciating the beauty of the female.
