I lived in London most of my adult life before moving to the United States, so I lost this movie when it came out and I only saw it now on HBO. I disagree with anyone who thinks this should have been a Hollywood production, the UK team has given a creepy mood since day one and I was on the edge of my place in the last 30 minutes wondering what would happen to my house. City. And, of course, nine months after the release of the 7/7 film takes place. Yes, truth is stranger than fiction. Having lived in both countries, it is also clear that the probability of this happening in the UK is much higher than in the US, Muslims live in ghettos and isolate themselves in the UK, in the US they assimilate much more readily.
