I have noticed that many people are making the Opera act by the way Betty reacts to the murders. I think they are basing these complaints on how they imagine a "normal" person would react. The thing is ... Betty is not a "normal" person due to traumatic events in her childhood. She has problems long before the movie starts ... and by the end of Opera ... in my opinion ... she was totally unbalanced. SPOILERS -------------------- --------------- ---- You have to keep in mind that when she was a very small child she witnessed her mother's mistress committing at least one brutal murder while her sadomasochistic mother was coming out watching. <br /> <br /> She was raised by a woman who gets sexually tied by watching the girls get hacked, hacked and strangled to death. This does not contribute to a healthy family life. I find it very easy to conclude that her mother would have employed all sorts of emotional manipulation and negative reinforcement to ensure that her daughter never denounced her. It is also likely that, at her impressionable age, Betty was deeply confused by what she saw. This is something adults do, and so on. <br /> <br /> Betty obviously looks at her mother ... I mean ... she became an opera singer like her. If Mom likes it, it can not be bad, can ... Momma can not be bad, can it? She could not tell the police about her mother or that mysterious hooded fellow she associates with Mom. <br /> <br /> Betty has many deep emotional problems. For years his mind has been trying to block the memory of what he saw his mother doing ... but it continues to surface, manifesting in the form of horrible nightmares, throbbing migraines in the skull, reliance on relaxation techniques, and frigidity She associates brutal violence / bloody death with sex on a subconscious level. There is an internal struggle between the part of Betty that confused murder / sex and the part of her that believes these things are wrong. <br /> <br /> After she saw her boyfriend murdered by the hooded man ... she calls the police, but is not willing to give her name. The part of her that thinks the murder is wrong forces her to make the call, but the part that is ambivalent does not allow her to admit personal involvement. Her ambivalent part takes over before she can go to the end. So she walks away from the phone in the rain ... and when she gets caught by the director, she's acting surprisingly calm, not as upset as you'd think a "normal" person would be ... because the part of her that has been block things since she was a child is struggling to block the horror of what she has just witnessed. <br /> <br /> The state of affairs in your life contribute to an impasse within Betty's psyche. Her singing career is starting to bear fruit ... she's going to be a great opera singer as her mother was. But will she become like your mother in every way? In the darkest ways? Or will she be able to make her own way? Add this to the resurgence of the hooded man killing everyone around him. <br /> <br /> It's not until the hooded man kills Daria Nicolodi's character that Betty really plays an active role in defeating the killer. Here is someone who loves Betty, who has supported her wholeheartedly in her emerging career, who is actually a maternal figure in Betty's life now since the mother died. Imagine how terrible it would be to lose your real mother and then see the woman who is the closest thing you have to a mother being shot in the eyeball. <br /> <br /> I could go on ... but I will not. The main essence of what I'm saying is that Betty's character is much more complex than most reviewers here have been willing to acknowledge. <br /> <br /> Opera is one of the best of Argento ... and not just the visuals (though they are truly magnificent) and not just the inventive murders (though they are). There's a depth here ... and the attention needs to be paid.
