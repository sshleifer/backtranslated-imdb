From the beginning of the movie I found myself laughing trying to be quiet, so I did not wake up anyone in the house, it did not continue so much throughout the rest of the movie, I did not find everything completely funny "laugh" but still I found some things well funny At first I had to laugh when he dropped his very clever hand on his sleeve. So there are scenes where you just smile, like when the Barber falls on a roof in someone's apartment, I can see that this is very funny, but these days and in the time that was done quite, did not seem original, although Na time, I'm sure it was. I loved Hynkels (Hitler) bursts of furious German with nice subtle English translation. <br /> <br /> The final scene is wildly discussed because, well it is absolutely true, and very cleverly constructed. Although the film is sixty-eight years old, the final scene is still relevant today, if that does not show how great the writer Chaplin is, then I do not know what it will be. The performance in this particular scene was very good, the Barber transcended the message perfectly and makes you realize the gravity of the film, while enjoying the humorous side. <br /> <br /> Another element about this movie is the fact that this was such a brave movie that it almost feels ahead of its time. Of course, Chaplin did not know what would happen after 1940, he was not aware of the Holocaust (obviously), he also forgot to say that if he knew he would not make that movie. The fact that this film is so anti-Hitler is interesting, it is more interesting that it was not anti-Germany, which would be very easy to do in those days, Chaplin could easily make this a propaganda film, but instead did something plus, he made an honest movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend that anyone remotely interested in this movie see, as well as those who have studied or are studying Hitler and WWII to watch this movie. It's fun to say the least, does not have an annoying out of fashion feel that some movies of the era did. Unlike most "comedies," this movie actually has a message that tries to bring it to you, watch this movie, you will be better off having seen it.
