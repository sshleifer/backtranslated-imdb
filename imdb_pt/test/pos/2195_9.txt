The genius who is Stephen Sondheim has never appeared more prominently than in his 1979 "Musical Thriller" SWEENEY TODD, a gothic, bloodthirsty, horrendous and delicious mix about a demented barber who returns to London to avenge himself on the evil judge. who not only permanently exiled him from London, but is also raising his daughter and plans to marry her to "protect her from all the ills of the world." The barber finds the love, sympathy and help of a lonely owner of a pie shop who has his own schedule where Todd is concerned. This musical rocked Broadway and won nine Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Actress in a Musical (Angela Lansbury). The production was filmed in full in 1982, with Angela Lansbury recreating her Broadway role as Mrs. Lovett, the owner of pie pie who finds practical use for the heads Todd makes mincemeat. George Hearn, who replaced Len Cariou on Broadway, is electrifying in the title role, so much so that you have to wonder why he was not originally cast for the cast. Lansbury and Hearn are fascinating from start to finish and commit 100% of their macabre characters aided by a first-rate soundtrack in Sondaheim, probably the closest thing Sondheim wrote to an opera. Lansbury shines in "The Worst Pies of London" and "At Sea". George Hearn stops the show with "Epiphany" and is also convincing during "Pretty Women," a duet that he sings with Judge Turpin, the man he got his revenge on. Cris Groendahl is vocally impressive as Antony, the young sailor who rescues Todd and falls in love with his daughter Johanna. Betsy Joselyn is a bit exaggerated as Johanna and really speaks out loud to her that during "Green Funch and Linnet Bird" she really leaves her voice out of tune for a few moments. The rest of the cast is first-rate, especially Edmund Lyndeck as Judge Turpin, who plays Johanna in this production, which was cut from the original production and Ken Jennings as Toby, whose beautiful tenor fills the auditorium of Not While I. I'm close. But it's a breathtaking soundtrack by Stephen Sondheim and Lansbury's mesmerizing performance, especially George Hearn, that makes this night of gothic musical theater an experience that stays by his side for a long time. Not for everyone, but if you're a game and have a strong heart, SWEENEY TODD is a joy to all lovers of musical theater and a must for fans of Stephen Sondheim and Angela Lansbury.
