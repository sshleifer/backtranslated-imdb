It's actually quite simple. The name of the movie is death bed, the bed that eats. If you're like me, you already know if you're going to like this movie. I stumbled upon this gem at Best Buy the other day and got it for ten dollars. I have ten dollars in fun and title. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of B movies. This is, in my opinion, one of the biggest B movies I've ever seen. Now, it is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> Granted, it's not even for most people. In fact, I suspect they will be just a handful of people who will really enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> For those of you who like B movies, this movie is a rough diamond. . It has a great premise, a bed ... that people eat. It does not walk, it does not move, it has no appeal to attract people. It basically depends on people walking around and sitting on it. <br /> <br /> I loved every inch of this movie and I've seen it three times in the few weeks I've had it. <br /> As I said, after reading the title of the movie, you already know if you will like it. If you laughed or smiled then give it a try. Worth it.
