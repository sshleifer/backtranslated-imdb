This film recreates Lindbergh's historic flight across the Atlantic, playing episodes in his aviation career through flashbacks. Stewart was about 20 years old to play the youngster, but his good performance, particularly in the solo flight sequences, makes it a little discussion. Waxman's exciting scoring is a big plus. Despite the long runtime, Wilder manages to make it quite exciting and is able to sustain the drama, although the outcome is known. That year of 1957 was for Wilder: in addition, he also wrote and directed "Love in the Afternoon" and "Witness for the Prosecution." And the next two were "Some Like It Hot" and "The Apartment". What a rush!
