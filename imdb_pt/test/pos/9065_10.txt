I really loved this original script and the different places that took me, emotionally, spiritually and simply silly things. I did not get caught up in "credibility" in the script or the actors and did not even think about it until I read the reviews listed here in IMDb for the movie. Listen to Michael Parness talk in the Q & A about his idea of ​​the movie, wanting to see how crazy people, or "fuck" people, as he said, falling in love is really interesting. I identified myself with not having a history book romance and liked to see dysfunction at its best. I like to watch David Krumholtz on anything he does and have followed his career for a few years now. I believe this is one of his best jobs and tell anyone, just watch this movie to watch an incredible young actor. I agree that Guillermo Díaz really was a scene thief, and what he did with his character is really a great acting lesson. I laughed and cried so much in this film and was disappointed that it did not win any awards at the festival. I question why this did not happen. I gave Max and Grace ten because these creative, interesting and unique indie films deserve an audience. Technically watching this movie, is it really well done? the colors are incredible and lastly it's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a movie for some time.
