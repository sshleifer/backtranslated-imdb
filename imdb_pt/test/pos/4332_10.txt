This movie is the real action at its best, there is nothing better than that. This is one of those movies that you can kick back and watch for some good and uninterrupted shootings and deaths, plus some great lines to keep up with all of this. My favorite is that there's a bad guy who's invading this old couple's house and he's stealing a TV or something and he's going up to them and shouts, "I'll come in here anytime I like !!!" and just before he jumps out the window he shouts "Anytime !!!" I mean, this is just classic stuff all around, so you have a choice, you can watch that crap Will Smith try an action movie or you can watch one of the Masters Charles Bronson !!!!
