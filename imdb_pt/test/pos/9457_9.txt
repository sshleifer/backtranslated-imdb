I've been a fan of Amanda since All That, and she's still funny. Me too, it's that simple. If you like Bynes, you will like this movie. It is harmless and fun in parts. Sebastian's accents and mannerisms are totally unrealistic, but they made me laugh so hard that at some points I almost choked on my popcorn. <br /> <br /> And anything that makes teens read Shakespeare (maybe) is a good thing for me. <br /> <br /> On a superficial note, Tatum Channing is quite * hot *. He also does a good job with some of the film's toughest scenes. <br /> <br /> Some of the secondary characters are very wide, but they are wide in Twelfth Night, so it's cool.
