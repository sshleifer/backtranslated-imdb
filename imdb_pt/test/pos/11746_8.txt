This film immediately catches the eye, with the atmospheric air sights of a very beautiful Hong Hong. Filmed in the rich colors of the 1950s movies that modern blockbusters never seem to capture. Probably a sign of these times, because this is not a high-powered film, seen everything before the movie, full of destruction and violence. Chaos and violence are deep inside, with thousands of refugees trying to get out of China. This is a very touching and compelling story, full of hope and love in a tragic moment, in recent history. The story of two people from different cultures falling in love. And the development for them trying to overcome this is the heart of this very good and moving film.
