The career criminal and crime chief, Abel Davos (Lino Ventura) has been on the run for more than 10 years, hiding in Milan, Italy. In his absence, he was sentenced to death in his home country, France, for his crimes. Disillusioned with his life in Italy and with the police approaching there, he decides to return to his former stronghold in Paris. Sending his wife Therese and two young sons in front of Nice, Abel and his next in command Raymond Naldi make a final assault to finance their new lives in France. The assault offers about half a million francs, much less than their sources suggested, nonetheless, and with the police in pursuit, both arrive in Nice, where they are briefly hiding. After stealing a pleasure boat from a local, they intend to reach San Remo, a tourist spot where they will mingle more easily, but they are stopped by armed police on a deserted beach, a shooting follows and Therese and Naldi are both dead. A Davos, now injured, with two children in tow, will be easily detected by the police, so he calls his old friends in Paris to send help, but they have moved on since his old friend hid and are not inclined to accept a risk themselves, so they send the little time thief, Eric Stark (Jean Paul Belmondo) to rescue him. Davos is disgusted that such a low thief is sent to help him, despite the fact that he gets along immediately with the charming Stark, he decides to find out why he was despised, but his betrayal does not stop there. Class Tous Risques (also known as The Great Risk) was written for screen by former death row convict and crime writer Jose Giovanni (Le Clan des Siciliens) with Ventura already aboard the project, Giovanniwanted someone unique to direct the project, Ventura suggested an assistant director who drew his attention to an earlier project, a Claude Sautet, best known at the time for helping Georges Franju in Les Yeux sans Visage. Sautet agreed immediately and the rest, as they say, is history. Sautet has created a good gangster film, which touches a lot on characters and relationships. Davos constantly has plenty of time to reflect on his past, present and future life, his friendships that no longer seem to be what he believed to be, his deceased wife and what will become of his two young children. Ventura as a character actor has always impressed me, being comfortable and convincing in both the police and criminal fraternity, here his tired performance is sublime and powerful as his world collapses around him, as the loneliness and loneliness of a man in the world. Race comes into action. Ventura's old profession as a professional wrestling wrestler is often used because he plays away from home with a consummate spoiler. Belmondo as Stark animates the other plot within the movie, that of his budding relationship with a girl he meets on the trip. With her frank charm, her coming clean for this woman in danger that he is just a "Voleur" and that "the only good thing about me is my left", as he knocks down his aggressor, it is also a joy to see , as she falls in love with him anyway. Belmondo's performance was ignored at the time, as Godard's A bout de Souffl√© was released only three weeks earlier, Godard won credit for the discovery of the new boy on the block, his versatility in those two films, being there for everyone to see and admire. Sautet's film is a class affair, using many attractive venues, the film also has very meager dialogues, Sautet prefers to let the actors do the work with the simplest looks or enough looks to delve into the story, needles to say that this fan Noir will be checking more of Sautet's work in the future.
