This film is one of the historically most accurate war films ever made that shows the reality of soldiers in a battle situation as well as the particular circumstances of the Battle of Stalingrad, obvious when comparing this film to works like the book by Anthony Beevor "Stalingrad". Unlike the best-known "Enemy in the Gates," where the plot drifts into a sniper story, this movie shows what war can do to individuals. Although filmed by the Germans, "Stalingrad" is anything but a nationalistic apologetic film. This shows that war films may be more than the flagellant distortions of war sadness, as so many Hollywood "war" products appear to be. <br /> <br /> The writing, acting, directing and other filming techniques in "Stlingrad" are of the highest caliber. <br /> <br /> It's a must-see for anyone who wants to join an army and obey the orders of any kind of "FÃ¼hrer".
