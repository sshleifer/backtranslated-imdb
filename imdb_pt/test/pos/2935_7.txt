Having messed with the modeling industry (as a model), I watch this program with a view a little different than most can. Although I admit that the ANTM can be a fun and entertaining show, with the passing of the seasons, it seems to continue to deviate from any reality. <br /> <br /> The show seems to be almost pure publicity to its competitors, since none of the program's winners (or fellow competitors) did much of it under the umbrella of the show. Maybe it's because the truth is that any girl with the potential to be a high fashion model should not have too much trouble submitting to agencies (you can do so via email or mail if the distance prevents you from joining a call open) Signing for an agency and starting a modeling career. Yes, the process does not guarantee success, but apparently does not do the same. And joining a reality show seems to offer less momentum in the modeling business than signing up with a high-level or decent agency (that only one participant in each cycle has a guarantee anyway). <br /> <br /> The show can not hurt, it can certainly be fun, and it has a kind of magic that particularly works for teenage girls, I discovered. Although, I might add, the ANTM can become a little tiring and boring, after watching several cycles, as it has become for me. And besides some unreal situations (each more outrageous than the last), the only other annoyance is the overuse of "Tyra, Tyra, Tyra!" Tyra seems genuinely to want to guide these girls to success, but it is necessary that each of the temporary excavations of the models be covered by pictures of Tyra; for virtually every panel and challenge include a story or scenario that "Tyra" has experienced and surpassed? I think not. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, take a bit of Tyra, put it back into a bit more reality, and the ANTM could be a 10-star show, instead of a 7.
