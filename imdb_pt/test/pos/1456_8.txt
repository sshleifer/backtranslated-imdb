The man with a golden arm was one of three great films around that time that dealt with drug addiction. The other two were Monkey On My Back and A Hatful of Rain. But I think all three of them are the best. <br /> <br /> Maybe if Otto Preminger had filmed the thing in real Chicago, instead of those obvious studio sets, the film might have been even better. Who knows, maybe Preminger could not get enough money to pay for the place. It's the only flaw I encounter in the movie. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is a heroin addicted dealer who was arrested for covering his boss Robert Strauss when the game was invaded. He got the cure while in jail and wants a new life as a jazz drummer. But many people are conspiring against it. <br /> <br /> First Bob Strauss wants you back, especially since some heavy players are in town. He uses some covert methods to recover Sinatra's services. Secondly, Darren McGavin is the local drug dealer who wants Sinatra good and addicted as a customer again. And finally, Eleanor Parker, his stalwart wife, who is working on a game to defeat everyone, just to keep him around. Frank Sinatra received a nomination for Best Actor for this film, but lost to Ernest Borgnine in Marty. Sinatra could have won by this if he had not won by From Here to Eternity in the category of Supporting Actor a few years ago and Marty was an acclaimed movie that year. His retreat scenes locked in Kim Novak's apartment will shake him. <br /> <br /> Eleanor Parker does not get enough credit for her role. She's really something like the crazy and intriguing wife who wants Sinatra to be tied to her, no matter the cost. If she had not been nominated the same year for Interrupted Melody, she might have been nominated for that. 1955 marked the highlight of his career. <br /> <br /> Darren McGavin had his first real warning as the very serpentine drug seller. Their performance is guaranteed to make their flesh crawl. <br /> <br /> Elmer Bernstein contributed a great jazz soundtrack to accentuate the general gloom of Chicago's shady neighborhood in which the characters live. It's not a place you'd like to mention your family.
