I was so moved by this movie in 1981, I went back to the theater four times to see it again! Something I've never done for another movie. No movie evokes feelings of growing up in the 60s like Four Friends. That this is so close to my own experiences in the 60's is probably something that many will share. Jodi Thelen is radiantly beautiful and unforgettable! Why did not she become a big star after that I'll never know. The cast's performance is flawless, as is Steve Tisch's screenplay. I always wanted to know how much of the story was autobiographical. But unfortunately Steve is no longer here to answer that question. I've got everything but worn out my VHS copy of this great movie! Highly recommended!
