If Hollywood were at the heart of the public's welfare, we would see 20 films a year with the kind of healthy fortress behind that movie. There are several personal growth experiences in this movie, and while the characters are still very human, even the lessons learned are not that greed will benefit you, or make-to-others-as-you-want-as-you -how-you-are-ok-with-that, no, that's what our sad and desensitized lives need, more meaning ... more love ... more do-to-others-as-you-would-have-done -at- you ... more HOPE. (thanks Ursula!) This movie has a clever wit, not "yo 'mama" cracks that run rampant in the so-called comedies. People need to feel good. This movie will make you feel good and possibly inspire you to improve your life and that of others. sidenote Each person counts on the sale of tickets. This is a truly independent movie. If you want more quality movies, you should support them.
