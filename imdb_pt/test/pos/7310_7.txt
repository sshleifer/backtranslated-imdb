Wife wife Norma Shearer (as Katherine "Kitty" Brown) waits on husband Rod La Rocque (as Bob Brown) hands and feet. While making breakfast in bed, and helping him get dressed for a Sunday golf tour, Shearer suggests that he join Mr. La Rocque during the day, noting how rarely they see each other. But La Rocque says his presence negatively affects his game. So, unexpectedly, does Shearer find the real reason for her husband's frequent absences? your beautiful blonde lover! <br /> <br /> Three years later, Shearer is a glamorous and seductive divorcee. During the summer in Paris, she befriended the older and wealthy socialite Marie Dressler (as did Mrs Boucci Bouccicault). Dressler invites Shearer to her home on Long Island, to socialize with some friends and ask a favor. Dressler is worried about her granddaughter's relationship with a gentle, mundane man. She wants young Sally Eilers (like Dionne) to marry Raymond Hackett (as Bruce). Aware of Shearer's flirtatious achievements, Dressler asks her to ward off the undesirable man from Ms. Eilers. Shearer is surprised to discover that the man is La Rocque, her ex-husband. <br /> <br /> Shearer and Dressler make it fun and entertaining. They are at their best, offering guaranteed performances to be popular with enthusiasm and professionalism. The story is silly and predictable; still, in a way that helps the humorous situation. And the ending is pretty clever. In fact, the comic book "Let Us Be Gay" may have aged better than Shearer's "The Divorce," which was released around the same time. Cast it evenly. La Rocque is better than your movie with Lilian Gish; but, his role is not at all pleasant. Gilbert Emery (as Towney) and Tyrell Davis (as Wallace) are funny supporters. <br /> <br /> Those who do not know Norma Shearer may not realize that it is she who appears as the sloppy wife in the opening scenes. This is Shearer as "Kitty" before her transformation. Watch Shearer's close-ups with lightweight and natural makeup for a good look at an intriguingly beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> Let's be gay (1930) Robert Z.
