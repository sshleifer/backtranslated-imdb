This film revolves around an Arab leader (Amir) who dies and wants to live. Thus, Dr. Lloyd Trenton is being paid to transplant the brain of Amirs to a "volunteer" participant. But in the doctors 'basement, her dwarf helper Dorro (Angelo Rossitto) drains young girls' blood for the doctor's purposes. Meanwhile, Doctor Llyod pays a man to kill the people who helped Amir enter the country (which is Reed Hadley, Grant Williams and several unknown bodyguards). Grant is the only survivor when his car falls off the road. While this has happened, the other assistant physicians Gor is sent to get a body to amir and it hurts so badly that Dr.Llyod can not operate. Meanwhile, Grant finds Amirs "girlfriend" Regina Carrol and tells his story. Grant sees the man who took him off the road and Dorro kills him. So, since Gor did not get a body, D.r Llyod places Amir's brain on Gors's disfigured body. Then Grant and Regina go to the doctors' lab. <br /> <br /> ------------------------ SPOILERS ------- - ----------------- discover your secret. Soon Amir (Gor) is hovering around to kill people and in the confusion of what I think is the plot Dr.Llyod has a brain-radius weapon that hurts Amir in charge. It turns out that Dr. Loyd wants a country where all scientists can work without law. Then Regina dies. and in the end Amirs new body (I think) say it should be a new country blah blah. <br /> <br /> I still do not understand the ending, but overall, this was a very nice piece of smelly cheese. This movie features Grant Williams in his second to last film roll. I recommend it for any Al Adamson fan or if you like Brains.
