Great movie in a Trainspotting style ... Being rated as the Welsh Trainspotting, but then it was Twin City, although this is streets ahead. <br /> <br /> It takes on a weekend in the life of Cardiff Clubbers, good film debut by Kerrigan and some great performances in the cast. <br /> <br /> Go and see! so it's going to hit
