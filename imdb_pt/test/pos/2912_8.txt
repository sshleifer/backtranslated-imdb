When this movie hits, it really does. And when it goes wrong ... I would say a total of 3 / 4s of the movie is great. I can even isolate the bad part. It's all about romance. Everything you need to know about this is said in the first five minutes, but it trails by about 30. I would recommend skipping this section if you can. He does nothing but explain his exile. It should have been a small plot point quickly set aside. Fortunately, the period of about 0-30 and 1: 00-2: 19 (The End) is excellent. <br /> <br /> There are a number of excellent performances in this film, and an equally terrible number. . Like everything else in this movie, acting is either perfect or terrible. Peter Ustinov as the slave of a slimy Kaptah eye is perfect. It's one of his best performances, up there with his role in Spartacus. Victor Mature as the ambitious Horemheb is also perfect. Again, one of your best roles. Jean Simmons is wasted as Merit, the perfect girl and in love with our hero, John Carradine plays a good supporting role as a thief of philosophical tombs; and Michael Wilding is excellent as Akhnaton, the idealist pharaoh who tries to bring peace and monotheism to Egypt only to see it crumble due to his reluctance to fight. Now for evil. Edmund Purdom as Sinuhe is sadly miscast. This is doubly unfortunate since he is the main character. The whole movie revolves around him. In fact, he is very good as the disillusioned exile and the old sage. This is because of its extremely limited range. He does not seem able to put any passion into his words. This is especially apparent during love scenes that are beyond strange. He spends the last half of the movie as an old man, a performance in which he is decent enough. He has the perfect voice for the character. The less we speak of Bella Darvi as Nefer, the treacherous Babylonian woman, the better. The costumes and scenery are magnificent. This is the only film I know that tries to portray life in Egypt that is not overshadowed by Jews or Romans. The film takes place in the 14th century BC which is before the Exodus. The only monotheists are Pharaoh Akhenaten and his followers. There is the same strong element of religious zeal that can be found in most epics, but it is done differently and only appears at the end. An interesting note: having Akhenaten followed by Horemheb as Pharaoh, the film jumps completely over the most famous pharaoh of all: Tutankhamun. It seems a strange thing to do when using that name can increase awareness of the film. <br /> <br /> Be warned: this is an epic 50's movie. If you do not like this kind of thing, then do not expect it to be any different. It's different, but it's still an epic. I appreciate this movie, and I appreciate what he did and what he tried to do. This is a movie that should be remembered more than it is.
