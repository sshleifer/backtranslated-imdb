I have fond memories of watching it when it came out. It's one of those movies that you know is crap, even when you're a kid, but at that age you ignore ridiculous acting, special effects, and plot (so there's a big nymphet race living underground, huh?) And just enjoy the monsters exaggerated by all that they are worth.
