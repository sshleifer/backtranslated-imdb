The Ator series is a brilliant example of what B movies should be. They fail in every way, but in a way so hilarious that they are funnier than sad. "Cave Dwellers" shows us Europe's favorite Conan clone, Actor, where we left him in the first film - after showing us a long recap of all the events of the first film . This time, the world must be saved from "The Nucleus", a kind of bomb, represented on the screen as a bright light (I think they could not afford a prop). This one features invisible and samurai attackers. As in the first movie, many images are used (including a bit obvious from "Star Wars"). Completely laughable and unforgettably bad - this is an exception B movie.
