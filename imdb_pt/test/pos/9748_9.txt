After 66 years, "Flash Gordon" still has a scary science fiction / adventure / epic feel that many of today's science-fiction adventures seek and do not deliver. The only way to take advantage of this serial is to just sit and choose nothing (fake effects, dialogue, why Flash does not match with Princess Aura, etc.). And as for you, older people who have seen "Flash Gordon" back on the serial screen or TV "in the past", if they want this great series to remain attractive to future generations, have your children / grandchildren watch when it is young. It worked for me (male aged 18 years or less). 9 out of 10
