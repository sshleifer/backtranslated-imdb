I took this movie on TV and watched it again. I told myself, it's been a long time since I watched this movie, so why not? And once again this movie moved me. It's so easy, so watchable and so human that I do not know why some people do not like it. <br /> <br /> John Travolta shines like Michael (his dance and every move), angel that can hardly be related to that word. He smokes, drinks and he eats like a savage, but he has a big heart. On the way, Michael helps everyone he knows. Dorothy Winters (Andie MacDowell) singing and finding a right man. Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) in developing himself as a good and decent man. Michael even helped the beloved Pansy Milbank (Jean Stapleton) - this last scene is beautiful when they dance in the streets. <br /> <br /> Travolta had great help in other actors. Andie MacDowell is so handsome and friendly, William Hurt is great as always, the late Robert Pastorelli shows his talent. Jean Stapleton and Teri Garr are also good, but my favorite actor in this movie is Bob Hoskins as the owner of the tabloid. <br /> <br /> So, we have here a solid movie about people with a warm story too and attractive cast. Just do not take this movie seriously and I guarantee you will have fun.
