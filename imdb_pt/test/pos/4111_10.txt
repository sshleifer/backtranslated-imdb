This musical has a deep meaning that is appreciated by only a few. Sages can see the wisdom contained in what they call more foolish. <br /> <br /> This song may well regain its popularity as world consciousness soars. It is a land "far from everything" where "living things have room to grow." Your people are "living and growing together" mentally and spiritually faster than at biological age. <br /> <br /> Letters help us recognize the relativity of this "world that is spinning around" and "looking within itself, where truth always lies." The absolute level of consciousness is more real world than the ever changing world of the senses. <br /> <br /> I've been looking for the video for years. When I find it, or go out on DVD, it will help to "share the joy" of being in "Shangri-la" again. The music of Burt Bacharach and the lyrics of Hal David made a masterpiece in turbulent times that is now ready to be fully appreciated. <br /> <br /> Let this CD inspire you to find your own "Lost Horizon" or recognize it when "peace of mind" has found you. - LostHorizon.org
