The first Dead End Kids movies (before being renamed "Bowery Boys") were all very fun and well-produced movies from Warner Brothers. Although stereotyped enough, they still had excellent writing, acting and staying well over time. Do not confuse this with Monogram Pictures' Bowery Boys cheap movies - despite the presence of Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey, these films were several levels below the previous films in terms of quality. <br /> <br /> The film begins with tough John Garfield winning the lightweight boxing championship. Unfortunately, shortly thereafter he is drunk and is guilty of a murder he did not really commit. The problem is that he was so loaded that he was not sure if he did not kill the man, so he flees and lives the life of a tramp. Eventually he meets up with May Robson and the Dead End Kids - just as a lady you just met will become your girlfriend sometime. Where the rest of the movie goes, that's not all. surprising, but because of the quality of the film, does not seem to matter. Garfield and the kids are at their best and this is a movie that will certainly please everyone but the most demanding viewers.
