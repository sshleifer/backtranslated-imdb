I rented this movie because it was a documentary and highly rated. It's more a study of a bastard son trying to figure out who his biological father was, than anything about architecture. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, the underlying theme of the movie is that we have an eccentric, highly praised, possibly genius architect who had little regard for anything or someone from outside is a profession. <br /> <br /> The tragedy of the movie is the broken families he left behind. Their baby-mothers have come across more scornful fans than irresponsible women, which can only have negative effects on children. That said, Nathaniel, the producer of the film and son of Louis Khan, came across as fairly stable and curious, if not bitter. The people he interviewed were, of course, more interested in talking about Louis Khan's buildings than in his personal problems, but I think the mix of themes made the film interesting. As for the buildings, I found them abstract art - strange, non-practical, and generally only appreciated by so-called critics.
