If you value your freedom! <br /> <br /> I began to be seriously interested in The Davidian Branch disaster after reading an article in the British magazine The Fortean Times. Wanting to learn more, I rented this documentary and after watching it, I was shocked by what I saw. This film has caught my interest in the subject and I have read several books on the subject ever since. This movie is a must see for people who only know the facts as reported in the media called "mainstream". The false lies, the small talk, and the contradictory statements made by the authorities and politicians shown in this film will make you think twice before calling people who question government actions in this freak of "crazy" and "crazy" freaks. <br /> <br /> What is scary is that I know some people who consider themselves "open minded" intellectuals and liberals loving "liberals" who are still convinced that the government did the right thing in Waco and refused to watch this movie or read any of the books on the subject. They continue to insist that it's not worth their time because all of their propaganda comes from arms-lovers, Clinton hating, religious fanatics, crazy right-wing anarchists. A publication of an organization composed of many "great minds" who are said to be dedicated to the promotion of "reason", "common sense" and "rationalism" condemned the film on the grounds that it would poison people's minds and strongly suggest that this film be deleted . . They even suggested that the Davidians were coming. I will not mention his name, since I am a coward. If you're one of those who read this (of course you probably would not be reading this anyway), I can only say that it's a shame that you do not open your mind.
