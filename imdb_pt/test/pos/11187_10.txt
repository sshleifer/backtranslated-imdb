A group of evil businessmen need to knock down a building to build a huge complex, but they can not remove the tenants. The tenants and business owners with their hired crooks face each other until the film ends with one of the funniest fights of all time! The guy with the red hair that goes 'eeeeehhhh' every time he punches and the other guy who poses with a knife in his mouth instead of fighting, only to be beaten off the camera, make this vision essential if you like laugh movies instead of with them.
