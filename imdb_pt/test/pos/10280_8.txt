Not all movies should have this predictable ending to which we are all accustomed, and it is great to watch movies with unusual twists. However, with that said, I was very disappointed with the end of l'artamento. In my opinion, the ending did not fit the rest of the film and basically destroyed the story that was being told. <br /> <br /> You spend the whole movie discovering everyone and your feelings, but events in the final two minutes of the movie would have impacted most everyones character, but the movie ends and leaves everything very open. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was very well done, and unlike similar movies like Serendipity. all the scenes were believable and did not go over.
