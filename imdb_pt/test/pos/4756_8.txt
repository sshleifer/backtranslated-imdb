A team of renegade New York police officers led by the fearless Buddy Manucci (superbly played by the always excellent Roy Scheider) goes after a group of mobsters involved in a kidnapping ring after one of them is killed by them. Director Philip D'Antoni, the producer of "Bullet" and "The French Connection", skillfully creates a strong, hard, absolutely amoral tone, maintains a steady pace and stages the action scenes with considerable vigor. Don Ellis' exciting sound further increases gross and violent intensity, while the fragmented sites of the Big Apple and the rough, grainy filmmaking of Urs Furrer greatly enhance the dirty realism. In addition, the tenuous line that distinguishes cops from criminals gets blurred in this image: the incumbent squad uses strong, brutal, and morally dubious tactics as a means to an end to law enforcement and there is certainly no code of honor among thugs. and thieves who populate the underworld of the city that is vividly portrayed in this film. Good supporting performances by Tony Lo Bianco as the lice Vito LÃºcia, the Undertaker, Richard Lynch as the psychotic addict Hoodlum Moon, Bill Hickman as the partner of Moon, equally cold, Bo, Jerry Leon as funky Mingo and Joe Spinell as an employee from the garage. An extremely monotonous destructive car chase, extremely wild and exciting, qualifies as a definite highlight. The climax shootout likewise offers the hectic products. A real little winner.
