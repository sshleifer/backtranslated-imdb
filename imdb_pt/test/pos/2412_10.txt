THE NEXT KARATE KID, in my opinion, is an excellent martial arts film. I thought Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) looked good in their graduation outfit. For me, Ned (Michael Cavalieri) was a real bully. That's because he put Julie in trouble with director Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside) was a neat orgasm! That's because he was a very tough man who did not tolerate mistakes. My favorite parts were the dance and the confrontation between Julie and the Alpha Elite. In conclusion, I highly recommend this success to all of you who enjoy martial arts movies or are fans of Hilary Swank.
