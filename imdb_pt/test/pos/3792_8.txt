In these modern times (as a well-known subject of the director of the short film that this German count will speak?), Politically correct films are the leitmotif of the projects of young modern filmmakers. "Shoulder Arms," ​​directed by Herr Charlie Chaplin during World War I (the film was released just weeks before the armistice) is an obvious example of why the early film pioneers were a very daring people indeed! Directing a humorous film inspired by the terrible and bloody First World War was a complicated issue that only a few directors with those dangerous and bold ideas could do? venturing into such delicate endeavors and was successfully reserved only to geniuses. <br /> <br /> As this German earl said, "Shoulder Arms" was made during World War I, at a time when the whole world definitely lost its innocence (fortunately not the fat German heiresses of this aristocrat ??) and is a hilarious, inventive social satire about this and any war. The film is full of great jokes and fun movie continuity for a story in which that tramp will live risky and brave adventures in front - be a hero to the allies ?? To mock the war trenches, the insalubrity, the frontal attacks and the Germans (how dare you !! ... by the way, there are many inaccuracies in the film?) German soldiers at that time had longer whiskers and beards not to mention that the Kaiser lacks many medals in his uniform - in an elegant, fun and delicate way it is still today a cinematic miracle that can not be overcome. Keeping in mind these terrible circumstances of war, the difficult task is only possible thanks to a lot of creativity and talent. Obviously Herr Charlie Chaplin had a lot of it. <br /> <br /> And now, if you will permit me, I must temporarily withdraw because this German count must return to the Schloss trenches. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
