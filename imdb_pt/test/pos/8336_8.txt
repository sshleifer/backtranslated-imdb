SPOILERS AHEAD ?? During the first ten minutes of Star Witness, we are introduced to a typical quote from the urban American family in an unnamed city, which is another way of saying the NYC version of Warner Brothers. With the exception of the young children, including the charming Dickie Moore, and the lively Sally Blane, they are very sad, and the conversation at the dinner table is tedious and we want the story to move and bring the star, Walter Huston. But wait, people, wait. Suddenly, a sudden action of a gangster explodes, luring the family against his will, and after that, this baby never gives up. There is suspense, an Oscar-nominated screenplay, good acting; everything you want old movies to be, it's here. I question the sales performance chic; it must be an acquired taste, but its presence turns out to be crucial to the plot. He is treated with a special status in credits, then Warner Bros. must have been very well sold, but as his old man routine fits with the public, then, it's something lost to me. Maybe it's lost in the time period, an unseen factor you had to be a bystander of 1931 to understand. In addition, the climax is typically melodramatic. However, this is the best studio release I've seen so far (however, I only saw eight, so maybe it's an inconclusive view). Do not miss this when TCM shows this. 8 out of 10.
