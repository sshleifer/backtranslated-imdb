OK, I got the DVD last week and I'm finally getting my reviews posted, but I'm sure I enjoyed this sequel in so many ways. <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath 2: Rage of the Undead. IT'S OK. This movie in a fast clip, has some very good effects and very well done atmosphere and style. I would actually go on record as saying that this may be one of the most stylish DV shooting movies I've ever bought. Most of the time, I get mad at DV movies for being boring and resembling soap operas. Even a movie like Bone Sickness that I like, has incredible footage of DULL. Not this movie. It never stops long enough to let you catch your breath. Although I would not say that I liked more than the first film, I will say that Sheets certainly improved technically in the two years between the films. This one has better blood, the inevitable feeding scenes of zombies, despicable characters and some returning actors (although their roles are different), especially Jerry Angell as a good psychopath with a murderous mullet of hell. The shots are more ambitious, just like the script this time, because you can say that Sheets is trying to extract much more than he did in the first film. Some of them work and some do not, but I must say that at least he was not just trying to make a bigger version of the first movie. There was no mention of a chemical spill this time around, only Satanism and the occult that brings the undead back to life. So I say congratulations to Mr. Scarf for trying to do something different with this one. I give this movie two bloody thumbs up!
