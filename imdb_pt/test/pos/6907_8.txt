I see the dead revolves around the thief of condemned tombs Arthur Blake. Blake's friend and his fellow thief Willie Grimes have just been executed and Blake will follow suit the next morning. As he sits in his cell, awaiting his execution, a priest named Father Duffy walks in and asks if he will tell everything he saw as a tomb robber. He then goes on to give Father Duffy an almost biography of his most interesting deeds. <br /> <br /> The plot basically consists of several incidents united by chronology. This prevents the viewer from getting bored, but also makes events less significant because you can easily add or remove many scenes without realizing too much. Despite failure, I thought this method added to the movie's fun loving nature and kept it very entertaining. Most of the various stories are good, specifically the alien, Murphy's and the vampire, but others were not so good. <br /> <br /> The acting is not incredible, but I did not find it bad in any moment. Score. Dominic Monaghan performed well, as he managed to be serious when he imported and also played very well in the comic parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The characters were not extremely detailed, but they were all interesting. . I also liked how some of the villains were made in an almost over-the-top comic way. The part with the background story of Murphy and his gang is invaluable. <br /> <br /> So, overall, I sell the very successful dead combines horror, comedy and science fiction into a mishmash of fun and excitement. It's one of the most interesting and original films I've seen for some time, and it's unfortunate that independent films like this have no more recognition.
