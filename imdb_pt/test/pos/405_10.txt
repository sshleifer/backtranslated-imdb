Note: After writing this review I see that this listing is in fact about the TV series and not the original movie. My mistake. I thought of IMDb for a database for movies, not for TV shows. But as most people will look for this movie in BAGDAD CAFE and not in FOR THE ROSENHEIM, which, strangely, is the name of the movie that is listed in IMDb, I leave this comment here. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed something, but when I read this other review, it seemed to be a complete review of the CBS series - which must have been loosely based on this movie. I have not seen the TV series and I might like it or not, but one thing I'm sure of is that it's very different than this movie. This movie is NOT like a TV show and Whoopie Goldberg is not in it or any other famous Hollywood star (besides Jack Palance, who was very charming in his role). <br /> <br /> This is terribly sweet movie that totally thinks "out of the box". It's not at all like a Hollywood formula movie, which is probably why (what's a pretty word for idiots?) Who decide to market movies or have not decided not to market this one. <br /> <br /> First of all This movie has captured my heart and imagination from the beginning. Of the music (which is only part of the time, so you can not really call it musical) for cinematography for the really cool story. <br /> <br /> A German or Bavarian woman (very pretty and quite fat) enters into an argument with the other German or Bavarian man with whom she is traveling in the California desert and separates from him - he takes off in the car and she leaves to defend herself on a desert and deserted road In the middle of nowhere. <br /> <br /> She finds the small, dilapidated, but charming Bagdad Cafe in Baghdad, California, and checks in. The rest of the story is magical. I do not want to try to describe this movie because I want you to enjoy every surprise. <br /> <br /> Warning: If you are a racist or have something against great women, you will not like this movie, as the main romantic protagonist is a big woman and brown and red skin characters have large roles and are included as "part of the mix" without any racism involved. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 10 for orginality, entertainment and sheer delight.
