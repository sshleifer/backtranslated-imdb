Lackawanna Blues is a poignant story about a boy who is raised in a house by some rather unusual people. <br /> <br /> It's the editing and the soundtrack that really get you into the story and lets you experience the movie the way the writer really wanted it to be seen. <br /> <br /> The song really fit the story, which made the characters come alive. The editing made the story more progressive and engaging. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised by some of the cast's performances, most notably that of S. Epatha Merkerson. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see the show of a man with these movies writer, Ruben Santiago-Hudson.
