I also saw The Last Stop at the Moving Pictures Film Festival in Prince George. I have to confess, the only reason I went to see this is because I'm a big fan of Callum Keith Rennie. And he did not disappoint me. He performed well for an unfriendly character and provided the only comic relief throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is the usual plot of 'a lot of bad people trapped in a snowstorm', but there were some twists that kept me guessing. The characterizations were strong and the whole cast performed well. The only problems I had with the cast was Rose McGowan. It was so cold during the movie that we had no idea of ​​the personality or motivations of her character. Beyond it and a few small problems with continuity, this was a well-written and well-represented thriller.
