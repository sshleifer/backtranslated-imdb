I recently rented this video after seeing "Final Ascent" by the same writer. I was not prepared for how intense this movie would be. I found it overwhelming from beginning to end, and I was hoping the teenagers would escape with their attempted crime. The ending was definitely disturbing with some of its implicit but well-made violence. I recommend this photo.
