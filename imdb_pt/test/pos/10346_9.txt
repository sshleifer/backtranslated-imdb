A touching movie about a talented woman struggling with a society and a love that structurally underestimates her. The issues are subtly addressed and timeless, as many of the difficulties described between man and woman still exist in Dutch society today. This film is a tribute to all modern women without sticking to feminism. Not only is the story well told, the acting and setting are great too.
