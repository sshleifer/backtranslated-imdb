One of the most famous of all the movie series! Still interesting today, although it has an "old movie". The second grade looks better, but it just is not the same. The actors have fun, especially Middleton and Lipson. Great edition by the Universal team of experts. The track was recorded in "Destination Unknown", "The Invisible Man", "The Black Cat" and "Werewolf of London" by Universal. And what great action music it was! If there is a choice for the best all-time series, this (no doubt) should be # 1.
