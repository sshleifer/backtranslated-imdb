Seriously engaging, intelligent and thoughtful provoking drama at its best. I mean, exciting, moody and catchy. Every house should have a copy! Do not take my word to see for yourself. One Life Stand makes you consider your own lifestyle and how you treat your family and friends. Beautiful photography and stunning acting make it one of the best cinematic experiences of the year. The debut of John Kielty is a delight and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this deep and brave film. This is a film that cares and has an honesty that is unmatched in recent years. No car chases, but a movie filled with hum and excitement. I first saw this movie screened at the Edinburgh Film Festival in 2000 and now I'm happy to have a DVD copy.
