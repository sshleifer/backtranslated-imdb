Breathtaking, intriguing, Francis Ford Coppala's epic novel, Apocalypse Now, is one of the most celebrated and iconic films of the 20th century and, in my opinion, the greatest cinematic representation centered on the United States' involvement in Vietnam. What I most like in 'Apocalypse Now' is that it is unlike any other movies of the same genre. Growing up as a cinephile and with a particular interest in war films, I saw many films, which tried to portray the "images" and "feelings" of Vietnam, but were not successful in doing so. Films such as "Hamburger Hill" and "We were soldiers" fit into the category of trying to capture Vietnam's atmosphere by describing "heroic battles" that are often tainted by the zeal of Hollywood filmmaking. In 'Apocalypse Now' there are no battles, no heroes or villains, there is nothing in the movie that suggests that it is intended to reflect the images of Vietnam through the physical aspects of war. On the contrary, it is a film that powerfully investigates and explores the human psyche when it has been plagued by the absolute "horror" of the darkest military conflict of the last century. The brightness of acting (in particular Captain Willard's interpretation of Martin Sheen), along with the spectacular cinematography (filmed in the Philippines), which provides crucial realism to the film's setting, makes Apocalypse Now an epic unforgettable. Evoking a myriad of emotions and leaving us with a swirl of mediation, "Apocalypse now" is not for the cheerful spectator. It is a masterpiece that requires multiple views to be fully appreciated.
