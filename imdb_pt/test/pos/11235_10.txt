Do not care what this socially retarded person says, this program is hilarious. It shows how many single men are in a bar atmosphere, and also shows that women are not as naive as men think they are. <br /> <br /> The aspect of the contest is very cool and original. It's not the standard reality show we're all used to these days. <br /> <br /> Give everyone a chance, we're just one episode, we finally have some Canadian programming that is not absolute crap. As Canadians, we usually get it, Bon Cop, Bad Cop or Corner Gas. Come on, people show that we are not all as prudish as the previous critic. <br /> <br /> Well the Comedy Network, giving a chance to a new show. The panel is funny and the competitors so far are very good.
