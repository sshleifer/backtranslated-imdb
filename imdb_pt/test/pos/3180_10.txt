I remember coming back from school to watch and come this was the story of a black family who moved from the ghetto to a high class community The family was named Wilson Frank Wilson man with his own construction business his wife Joyce was manager of bank they had 3 teenage children, Kevin Valerie and Marcus. This was a really good show. it was educational without being a preacher. the show was well written. This show gave us a look at a successful African-American before the Cosby Show. A lot of a black actor appeared in this show from Ester Role to David Hubberd to 227 Stonnie Jackson, to name a few. If you are able to find this show on DVD, you should get it for your whole family
