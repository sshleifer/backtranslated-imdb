I've seen this movie maybe a hundred times, I've never tired of it. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 7 years old, and it has left a mark on my memories ever since. It's a lovely love story that brings the sun to most people, even in the darkest moments. I think this is a must-see movie and one of Anthony Quinn's best performances. I just wanted the TV channels to send this movie more often. This inspired me in a good way and the rudeness will do this with many others. If there was any actor I wanted to meet, it would have been Anthony Quinn. There will never be one like him on the silver screens, ever. He wanted Anthony Quinn to be alive. May God bless your soul.
