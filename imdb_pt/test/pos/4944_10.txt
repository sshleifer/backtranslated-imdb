Soul Calibur has always been my favorite series of fighting games of all time. And SCIII is my favorite series. <br /> <br /> The graphics are very well done. Much greater improvement over agitated polygons in Soul Edge / Soul Blade. The characters have facial expressions, hair blowing in the breeze and even blink. <br /> <br /> Soul Calibur has always been known for its intriguing plots and characters and SCIII is no exception. Each character has his background story detailed and well made. My favorite character is Chai Xianghua. She's cute, she's funny and she's a strong female character. Yeah, I know she wears pink and has a boyfriend (she ends up saving BTW), but there seems to be more to her than that. Xianghua, like all other characters, has flaws and drawbacks in their personalities, so no character is perfect, not even the good guys. <br /> <br /> The song is beautifully composed for a series of fighting games. It does not sound kitchy (the Vampire series) nor does it sound like old school pornographic soundtrack (Mortal Kombat). The characters have their own themes and many of the themes are made to match the culture of that particular part of the world. I do not think there's a song on this soundtrack that I do not like. <br /> <br /> Another cool thing about this game is to create your own anime character (Create a Soul). You can make it look so cute or sexy or even ugly if you want. However, if you have found a character customization that you like, remember to take notes, or else you will not remember how you created this character. I found myself very addicted to CaS. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think Soul Calibur is my number one game series of all time. You have everything I asked for. What more could I want?
