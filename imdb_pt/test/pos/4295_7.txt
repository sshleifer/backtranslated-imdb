A well written script. A moving story showing middle-class English at its best. Some great acting by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of the best actors in Britain. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I was not familiar with, but to her credit, she does a great job of playing the wife of orgasm. The director, Julian Fellowes, did not succumb to the typical Hollywood tricks to give the film a fleshy tangle. He did not finish dramatizing the portrait of the English middle class. The rhythm of the films does not falter, although it is not a film with rhythm of face. A good twist in the plot, this is not predictable. I really liked this movie The places were also very well selected. If you like movies about relationships, this is one to watch. It's better to have some fabrics ready!
