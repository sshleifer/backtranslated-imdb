How many reviews of this movie do I have to write before I hit it? Tom Conway totally inherits the robe of Falcon from his real life brother, George Sanders, with this entry. Conway's beautifully dressed double-breasted, buttoned-up suits in gorgeous cars, 110%, with huge paraglide skirts and suicide doors that rise to his armpit, Conway travels from New York to Miami to keep a formula for industrial diamonds falling into the hands wrong Her "client" is the lovely and virginal Louisa Briganza, who has beautiful hair but who will only kiss her in the first two months. Along the way, he comes across the kind of colored array of characters that only a B movie could offer. Your partner on this tour is perhaps the best of Falcon's helpers, Edward Brophy, like Goldie Locke, who is given some really funny lines. He rushes to the sinister plate Doris Blanding, the kind of 1940s girl you know. His cohort is Benny played by Steve Brodie, who, twenty years later, was a Presley punching bag in two Paramount King movies. The two work for cold fish and Kenneth Sutton, who is wearing a sail hat, is ready to do whatever it takes to get the formula while cruising his yacht to Brazil. Loaded with the most haunted Falcon cops ever, this entrance still reigns supreme. Forget these 120 minute melodramas, give me a 1 hour Falcon movie any day. I have a wife and two children - who has time for a two-hour movie? Shake some dry martinis and forget about your troubles with this great Falcon movie. But if you did not record the local TV in Toronto like I did 17 years ago, you're out of luck.
