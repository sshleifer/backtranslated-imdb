Watching the last two episodes, I remembered a video from my childhood. He showed the wild west, very dusty and dry, and there is a small hall, a man enters the bar / hall, he is thirsty like hell, cracked lips etc .... he just crossed the Nevada desert and I have not drank water for days. He murmurs to the bartender "give me a packet of chips" While he's eating, we can feel how thirsty he's getting, we hear a voice in the background saying ... "Keep building that thirst, build until you can not hold it over ............. then blast it with the team "Man drinks TEAM (a soda pop) It seems like a few dozen bags of potato chips the thirst is so intense that I do not you can take more, the second season has more laps and more laps than the first season. The ending answers many questions, but asks many more questions. I hope we know the answer in Season 3, but I doubt because I feel that LOST's momentum goes way past the 3 stations if the people behind the camera keep up the good work. <br /> <br /> I will at least keep watching. <br /> <br /> From Pakistan with Love
