This film is about Xavier, an Erasmus exchange student from Paris who spends a year in Barcelona. During this time, under the influence of all new impressions, it changes and grows. Upon returning, he has a much clearer view of his life and finally takes it into his own hands. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most moving movies I have ever seen, and the reason is probably that I've been in a very similar situation. I am from Germany, not from France, and for me it was Madrid, not Barcelona, ​​but I can assure you that this film is a complete and accurate representation of what an Erasmus semester in Spain will do to you. From what I heard the story is autobiographical, and that's probably why it's so realistic. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some examples (SPOILER soft alert) - Xavier shares an apartment with other students from Italy, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Spain and England. The apartment looks EXACTLY like all the Erasmus shared apartments I've seen in Madrid. The main characters are well developed, and some funny scenes arise from the usual stereotypes. The Spanish landlord is also 100% accurate. - The story of Xavier and his girlfriend Martine, who stayed in Paris, is also very typical. About 90% of all relationships end during an Erasmus semester (or shortly thereafter). "There's a marvelous scene where Xavier tries to convince Wendy, his half-dowdy English flatmate, to hang out with everyone else. He finally succeeds, and Wendy probably has the night of his life. Another good thing about this film is that it is truly trilingual: students in the apartment speak Spanish or English, and Xavier speaks French with his colleagues. mother and girlfriend. There are subtitles so that everyone can understand what is being said. I sincerely hope that this movie will never be dubbed anywhere. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that for non-Erasmus this is simply a fun comedy, but for all my Erasmus colleagues I can only say: This is YOUR MOVIE! If you have not seen it yet, do so. But be prepared for some feelings of nostalgia ... <br /> <br /> 10/10
