I just came back from the European premiere of The Gamers: Dorkness Rising. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that if you're a gamer (CRPG, RPG or LARP) then this movie is for you. What if you're not a gamer? Well, it's still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> The acting is certainly not worthy of the Oscar, but in every element of the film it adds to the charm. The humor is everywhere, along with some very nice touches (the tribute to Gary Gygax is especially well done, if you can spot it). The cast is very realistic in its appearance, consistent with the fact that they are ordinary people enjoying a common pastime. <br /> <br /> The sound quality and vision of the film is adequate, but again, everything just adds to the atmosphere that helps define this movie as the movie Dungeons and Dragons, written and played by gamers gamers. <br /> <br /> I'm not afraid to use specific terminology for a system, they still manage to allow the placement of products to be part of the film, but in a very understandable and absolutely just way. It also addresses some of the perceived prejudices that some players may have about other players and handles this very well. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is driven by an equal and well thought out balance. of character, plot and entertainment (the bard is surprisingly good value-for-money). <br /> <br /> In the end, it makes marking this film quite difficult, so I gave it 2 points. <br /> <br /> Score (for non-RP'ers): 7/10 (Some times may go over your head, but the main sections of the movie work so well and they achieve much more. > <br /> Score (for RP'ers): 10/10 (Everything fits, in perfect amounts, and with the perfect charm and feeling)
