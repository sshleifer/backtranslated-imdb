Buster Keaton was undoubtedly his most enjoyable when he made short 20 minute films, and they did not come any more funny than this gem. The comic book gets involved in a photographic mess with a wanted criminal. This leads to his elaborate evasion of several street policemen and fellow travelers who recognize his face from the "Wanted" signs. The Goat is a block of choc-a-block with glowing website gags, from the opening scene in the bread queue, to the wonderful elevator chase at the end. A Keaton movie never feels as if your silence is missing, since sound is never something you needed with it. His films are explained through the wonderful (but incredibly dangerous) things he did for himself. It is not difficult to see how influential he really was - the man is as incredible today as he was in 1921.
