As an adventure miniseries, this is as good as it gets. I saw him when it was originally aired on HBO. Sigrid is totally credible in his role as Philadelphia, and the whole production was top notch! See all 400 minutes if you can. I highly recommend this mini-series. Amazing that I can not officially rate it, but for you readers / users, I'll let you know it's a solid 10!
