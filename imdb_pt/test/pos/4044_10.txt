I thought the movie started a bit slow and disjointed for the first hour. However, it has become more absorbing, fascinating and surprising in the last two hours. So, although it starts out as a cheap horror movie, it evolves into a beautiful and wonderful fantasy film. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda stands out as the Snow Queen. This was her best performance and it's sad that this was her last performance since she has not played in the past 7 years. She absolutely embodies both the beauty and coldness of Winter. <br /> <br /> My 14-year-old daughter found the movie a little scary, so if you're showing it as family entertainment, please stay with your child and reassure him. or he who is just a fairy tale costume and not take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> It's really one of the best fantasy films I've seen in a long time, a little better than "Eragon" or any of the "Lord of the Rings". It's as good as "The Golden Compass".
