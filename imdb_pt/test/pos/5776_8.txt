I saw this movie when it first came out. Patty did not want to part with her brothers. However, the Juvenile Justice system does not care. When Patty looked at the case file, the judge sent her to a juvenile detention facility. He alleged that she violated privacy rules by looking at private files. She just wanted her family together. I could not blame her. Parents were not even suitable parents. One of the smaller children had to have a bathroom. The father stopped and let them go. He left and left the children stuck at the service station. Patty had to take authority to protect them, since she was the oldest. They were placed in foster homes. The good part is that the social worker got them back in the family. The head of the social worker told him to leave and not interfere. He was crazy for power. He was the only one, that Patty put in the juvenile facility. Why did not they go after the Father, who was released from prison by abandonment? However, children are stuck in the middle and feel insecure.
