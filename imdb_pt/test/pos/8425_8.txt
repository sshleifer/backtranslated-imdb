Although this production has received a number of negative reviews, it actually holds up very well for its age. Note also that it is not a BBC program, it was simply licensed to them by Granada Ventures when the Jane Austen collection was released on DVD. <br /> <br /> As compared to other adaptations of the same novel? The most well-known version these days is the 1995 film with Amanda Root as Anne Elliott and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Frederick Wentworth. This film was of course shorter but a good snapshot of the story - the previous version, with Ann Firbank and Bryan Marshall in the same roles, had four hours to tell the story and moved at a slower pace. <br /> /> Firbank has a good ten years too much for his role, but she is very good - Marshall is excellent as Wentworth, a man disappointed in love and bitter about the interference. And hidden in the cast are people who also contribute - Michael Culver, later seen in Cadfael, as Harvill; Richard Vernon, later seen in the Guide of the Hitchhikers of the Galaxies, as Admiral Croft; Noel Dyson, earlier on Coronation Street, as Ms. Musgrove. <br /> <br /> One criticism I have is that the hairstyles are a bit disturbing, and that the costumes are horrible! Still, this should not undermine an extremely pleasant Austen adaptation.
