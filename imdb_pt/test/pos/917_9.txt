There is a spartan, non-sentimental edge to this film, which allows us plenty of space to participate in the action, without any stylistic weight that tells us HOW we should be feeling; in 'Blue', everything was openly sad (of course, powerful as hell, but still); in 'White', it was a delightful treat. But there are no emotional clues, or suggestions, in this case. It is as if he finally allowed the force of the tale to work with its own magic, without a dazzling embellishment. I think that this is what makes the most initially enigmatic of the three, but ultimately the most transcendent and redemptive. Never has merciless and ruthless honesty been so beautiful.
