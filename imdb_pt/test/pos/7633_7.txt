"L'Ossessa" (released in English under many titles and the strangest one of them certainly is "The scary midnight terror show") is one of the best Italian dilemmas of "The Exorcist". To truly enjoy this movie, you must have a sense of humor. "L'Ossessa" is both sloppy (but naive), pathetic and sometimes even touching. <br /> <br /> Danila (Stella Carnacina), an art student, goes to an old church to see the statue she will restore. It is a wooden statue of Christ, a demonic Christ, perhaps already overcome by evil, or battling it, or perhaps planning dark acts. The face shows infinite torment. The statue dates from the fifteenth century. Danila is impressed by the mastery shown by the sculptor - the statue looks almost alive! She lives with her parents. His mother Luisa (Lucretia Love) lives a dissolute life and does not care much about keeping up appearances. His father Mario (Chris Avram) watches everything with disenchanted eyes. <br /> <br /> The wooden statue will soon assume a human form (Ivan Rassimov) and will possess Danila in the carnal and spiritual sense. An incredible scene! Poor Danila, from now on, will suffer the torments of hell. Danila (the lovely Stella Carnacina) has been raped, raped, possessed by the devil and now following her orders, she will try to seduce others. She is not imitating her despicable mother Luisa (Lucretia Love), who feels great pleasure when her lover whips her with a bouquet of roses? There is such a ridiculous scene to the point of being sublime and moving, when Stella Carnacina runs in despair through the narrow streets (possessed by the devil, remember?) Of a small Italian town that screamed her heart. Luigi Pistilli is a very good exorcist. His performance is, as usual, intense. The exorcism scenes (particularly the final battle) are very, very amateurish, but will this only increase the fun (and / or emotion?) If you really have a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Stella Carnacina is beautiful and looks fresh and innocent, and that is one factor that enhances her pleasure when she is naked, but I think the film could have explored more of its natural beauty. Lucretia Love is a very good companion sleaze (her scene of nudity with roses ... well.) <br /> <br /> Other exorcist Italian insults that I would recommend to you are: <br /> <br /> "Malocchio" - "The Exorcist" was the main source of inspiration for "Evil Eye", but other films, such as "Rosemary's Baby" should also be taken into account. "Evil Eye" is completely exaggerated. Not that neat, but with lots of gorgeous Italian and Spanish actresses. You'll be drooling throughout the movie. The movie is ridiculous, the story does not make any sense, but if you see it in a good mood you may feel moved! - a diabolical sect, possession, murders, despair, love, investigation and beautiful women around. A wild ride! <br /> <br /> If you liked "Evil Eye", see also "Ring of Darkness" (Un'Ombra nell'ombra). This film can be found in the alternative market.

It's cheap, tacky ... sloppy (but not so much) and has an underlying "moral" message. This strange beer can sometimes be very funny. We all already know that "L'Ossessa" is an "Exorcist" fraud, so why can not we see it on its own terms? Yes, Mario Gariazzo was trying to make quick money but managed to get the most out of a tight budget. The story is well told, the film is atmospheric and, in general, the actors are committed to their roles. Watch the movie with an open mind and you can discover two or three new things.
