I saw this for the first time as a kid (THE LITTLE RASCALS was first on TV the year I was born) and recently bought it on DVD. In the meantime, I watched on the occasions when I was and I took careful notes on 1) the pie fight itself and 2) how some of these parts were racist: Farina as a Nubian slave, making voodoo, for example. I think Roach and McGowan would have been beaten to death if they had tried to do that now. <br /> <br /> Notice how the pie fights on the Three Stooges holiday and the PIE AND PIE look like this ... and this movie came out a few years before the initial deal with Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures. Obviously, there were some inspirations from SS and Laurel & Hardy from the BATTLE OF THE CENTURY for these films ... remember, at that time, they all stole the best of each other !!! One more note: Laurel and Hardy, that lady selling cakes was none other than Dorothy Coburn, who also appeared on TBOTC - the 'flapper' getting into her car and picking up the rear. Do you always escape me because she was never credited?
