Jennifer Gray seems the most unlikely of romantic links and that's probably the reason why this beloved movie is such a hit. It's all very well doing a version of Montagus and Capulets with sweeteners like dancing and attracting the tropes of the family of Jewish society, but usually there has to be an X Factor. Swayze probably makes this movie safe with her rugged and post-Travolta moves and temperament, but they are being conquered by this teenage Penelope Pitstop who makes the dream come to the impressionable market. The super soundtrack (dated? Maybe 'immortalized') helps and, of course, the cunning concept of putting the film in a resort away from everyday limits fantasy. 7/10
