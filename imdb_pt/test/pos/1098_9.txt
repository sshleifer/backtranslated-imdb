This was a random rental in the rental car. But I was impressed from the beginning. Wooden camera is a gem of a second feature by an engaging director. The film captures deeply insightful moments and several times frustrating and complicated social interactions that young interracial friends would experience in a post-apartheid South Africa modern. The young actors are very good and well-focused in their approach to the core material and the dialogue is both natural and interesting. The film is very rich in visuals, providing a frame-by-frame study of deeper understanding and achievement, without falling into stereotypes and iconic cliches. The movie soundtrack adds body to the movie without being intrusive. After watching it for the second time, I crawled the DVD on Amazon and was happy ever since.
