I'm fifteen years old and I've seen thirty-three Sinatra movies (not counting videos from TV shows and documentaries) and I'm not impressed with just two of them. '' Until the clouds pass' 'and' 'The Miracle of the Bells'' do not count, however, considering that at first all he does is sing a magnificent 'Ol' Man River ', and in the latter he is not half bad, only My favorite albums, radio shows, TV shows and movies about Sinatra change virtually every day - all taking on a different connotation at each viewing and occasionally looking like the best thing he's ever done and occasionally the worst until the cycle will come up again, but there are some things that are beyond comparison. When it comes to movies, "The Man with the Golden Arm" leads this list. Everyone who knows anything about Sinatra knows that he thought that was his best. has been nominated for an Oscar, was the first serious look at drug addiction, etc., etc. The jazz score is unforgettable, Kim Novak is sympathetic, despite a ridiculous accent, Eleanor Parker is annoying and waaaay very dramatic, the turtle as Arnold Stang is fun to fi The first time, but increasingly embarrassing, and Darren McGavin makes a marvelously viscous drug dealer, the scenarios are not convincing - at first glance, it looks like a quirky bag mixed by the great Otto Preminger with an off-center charm . <br /> <br /> So you come to Sinatra. Like everything else in his life - apart from music - the reports of his performance are always divided in half. Directors such as Fred Zinnemann, Frank Capra, Billy Wilder, Stanley Kramer, Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich and Otto Preminger all agreed that if Sinatra had worked both in his films and singing, he would be among the greatest actors. in the world - if not the largest. Humphrey Bogart went on to say, "This guy has the most natural acting talent I've ever seen." Not bad for a man who never had an acting lesson in his life, was at the same time producing the discography that would make him "the greatest singer of the 20th century," and did almost all of his scenes at once. <br /> <br /> In direct conflict with all this are those other reviews and biographies that smell arrogantly about how bad a Mr.Sinatra actor was, and how many "bad" movies he's made. The question will never be answered to the satisfaction of all, because the controversy was among Sinatra's greatest resources, and both arguments were, in a sense, being thrown into their hands. In any case, at this time, in this role, Sinatra is magnificent. One critic said in the late fifties, "Sinatra may not be the greatest actor in the world, but there is no one more fascinating to watch." No matter what Sinatra is doing in a movie, it's hard to take his eyes off him. That, of course, is a "charisma" I've only seen in a handful of other people - Orson Welles, Richard Burton, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift - perhaps James Cagney. There is no real definition for this and it often makes it difficult to find out whether you are really enjoying a performance or just fascinated but that the quality on display here is what makes the movie. Sinatra is frankly fascinating, real, intense - transcending decades and thousands of pop stars from paper dolls with something called quality. Like it or not, this is a one-man show with some character actors hanging in the background. He covers all emotions with remarkable subtlety, sweet and solitary tenderness with Kim Novak to the terrifying shock of Frank Sinatra (Frank Sinatra!) Whining and screaming in the agony of "cold turkey". Sinatra was right - this is his best performance. No doubt. <br /> <br /> I was eight when Frank Sinatra died. I was not around for all the years of bobby-soxers and '' Anchors Aweigh, '' Mr. Ava Gardner and '' From Here to Eternity '', albums with lampposts and swingin 'lovers, Kennedy , Vegas, ding ringing. Basie and Mia and Reagan and concerts from Madison Square Garden to South Africa to the White House to the Sands. I can not say I like Sinatra because I heard it on Paramount or because I hear "September of My Years" autobiographically - the usual excuses. And my excuse? When I was eleven I watched a movie called "On the Town" ...
