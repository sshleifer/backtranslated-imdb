Let me first say that I am a big fan of the original Lonesome Dove series and the book it was based on. I postponed watching this continuation for most of the 10 years due to the bad comments I've heard about it. If Tommy Lee Jones was not playing Cap. Call, I did not see the point. If Larry McMurtry was not involved, why should I care? How wrong I was. <br /> <br /> This is, in many ways, a sequence worthy of Lonesome Dove, perhaps even more so than the somber mood of Streets Of Laredo. The story, acting, production, cinematography are all top notch. Of course the script is not as colorful as Lonesome Dove, but it has its moments. And, to my surprise, there are bits of Lonesome Done in this series; the relationship between July and Clara, completely discarded in the prequel, is brought here almost identical to the book, a welcome surprise. The story is not just roses, it also has surprises. By far the biggest surprise is Jon Voight's interpretation of Cap. Although not a direct copy of Tommy Lee Jones, he is faithful and unique to Voight's credit. The cast is fantastic across the board, and I do not think Rick Schroeder has done a better job than in this series. Oliver Reed pretty much steals the show here, he's superb in a role that makes you care about his character as equally as you hate him. <br /> <br /> It is worth watching this if you do not have bad reviews, especially that the DVD is so affordable (I have the 2 disc set for $ 10.99, you can probably find it cheaper ). It's by no means the disappointment that Dead Man's Walk is over (well, it was for me). And MCMurtry was involved with this!
