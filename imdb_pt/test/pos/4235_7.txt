The film does not take itself seriously, and if you follow your example, you will have a lot of fun (as long as you do not mind the fact that your murders were bloody, and your horror covered with extra cheese)! <br /> <br /> This movie flicks an eye on all the horror fans and then gives them the finger. He knows it sucks and because of that he is by far the best of the "Child's Play" series. <br /> <br /> It reproduces the angle of the "stoopid mood" so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing, but with that. And, believe me, the whole time you're laughing, it's laughing back to you. <br /> <br />
