Chokher Bali was shown at the (Washington) DC Filmfest on April 15, 2005. The director, Rituparno Ghosh, was there to give a brief introduction and answer questions later. <br /> <br /> As always, I think Aishwarya did a fantastic job. I can understand those who think it should be more aggressive or more malicious, but would it really be realistic in 1904? Possible, perhaps; realistic, I'm not so sure. I think her interpretation was valid, though there certainly could be other ways of doing it. <br /> <br /> I hate to use the word, but this was the most "inaccessible" of the Indian films I've seen so far. . I know a fair amount of Indian history, Hindu religion, etc., but the level of detail here was far beyond me. Clearly you would have a much better understanding of the film if you were intimately acquainted with Hinduism and its customs, esp. as they were c. 1904. I missed many things-one of them being the fact that the mother-in-law would like Binodini at home as a sort of counterweight to her daughter-in-law Ashalata. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * Ghosh had several things to say that explained the movie a lot better for me. First, the original version in Bengali lasted more than 20 minutes. So, what was left out? Apparently, three main things: an initial segment in which Binodini (Aishwarya) leaves E. Bengal to Calcutta. According to the director, different characters are speaking in W. Bengali Vs. E. Bengali - setting some of the political comments later. Of course all of this is lost in the Hindi version, and certainly for a non-Indian like me, it would not have mattered anyway - but a configuration of the Bengali situation would certainly have. Then there was a segment where Binodini was writing a poem - a sign of his independence, etc. Finally, a few more deals on jewelry. So although some people find it was too long, I think the original, longer version would have been clearer. Women's hair was apparently another sign (Ghosh again) - the mother-in-law had short hair (short hair for Hindu widows), her sister - also a widow - had longer hair (more modern!) and, of course, Binodini / Aishwarya had extremely long hair up to the waist (rejection of widowhood status). <br /> <br /> The end really threw me - suddenly Binodini, who has never had a political thought, is writing a political manifesto? Wow!! Ghosh explained that he was in Locarno, at a film festival, when the captions were made. The captions use the word "country" throughout the letter of Binodini. Gosh said that a more appropriate word would have been (I forgot her exact word) something like "I" or "independence" - she was talking about her own liberation and "finding herself" - not about Bengal, India, and the British. . So why does Binodini simply disappear the day after finding Behari again? Apparently because during her stay in the Ganges she realizes that she does not need a man - any man - to define / complete it. She may be just herself. So she rejects Behari, who she threw herself in a few months (?) Before, and just goes out. Of course I'm not sure how she buys her next meal, but that's another question. <br /> <br /> The red shawl (Ghosh again) that she buys represents "revolution" and "passion." I'm not 100% sure why she puts the shawl on the woman who's dying, but maybe she's rejecting passion / revolution? The binoculars, which Binodini uses throughout the film (to watch Mahendra and Ashalata, the boat on the Ganges, etc.). She is being a voyeur to see a life that she longs for but can not have. In the end (I missed that!) She leaves the binoculars on the table with the letter, showing that she does not need them anymore - she's starting to lead her own life. <br /> <br /> Finally, Tagore's quote at the beginning saying how he apologized at the end ... Apparently Tagore wrote this as a series, connecting his readers with pieces of sexy widows. But in the end he sold himself to conservatism and made Binodini kneel at the feet of Mahendra and Behari, begging for forgiveness. One of his students (?) Wrote Tagore to question him about his exhausted end ... and Tagore responded with his apology for the end. In the movie, of course, Ghosh goes in the other direction.
