Seeing this show gives me respect for MTV, though I imagine MTV views this random material as its main selling point and is far less concerned with the relevant truths it expresses. <br /> <br /> I write and play music to live and this show makes me very excited. For me, Wondersershowzen serves a completely different function from most TVs. Instead of numbing or distracting the senses (which can often be really good), it awakens my spirit right and wrong. This makes me very uncomfortable, but in a very comforting way. <br /> <br /> I do not think many viewers absorb most of the content of this show, but if they do, compliments to viewers everywhere.
