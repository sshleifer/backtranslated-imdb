A group of teenagers who have invaded a huge department store are attacked by a crazed police officer. Exciting and full of suspense everywhere and refreshingly devoid of extreme violence and violence, but these Australian hairstyles and accents are a bit much to take home. And they can induce headaches. But that's still a good thriller. 7 out of 10.
