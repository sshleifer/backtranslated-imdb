While my kids liked the movie (and later announced they wanted to buy it later), I think I got more out of it than they did. The scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life (I did not use the cut-out comment aloud, but I thought about it). It's a half-life well-being movie, a little mellow and some scenes work less than others (why does the boy get Bruce Willis after he knows his mother is dying?), But that's okay. Also gave our family something to talk about - did my kids think my life was boring? What do they expect at age 40? How can you not like a movie that makes a good conversation with your kids?
