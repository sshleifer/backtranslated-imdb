The Child's Play series is not one of my favorites, but Bride Of Chucky is actually a great movie. This time we have two Chucky dolls and his ex-girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together, they go on a journey to find an object. There are some interesting scenes through the movie like the guy being hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending that allows another sequence to happen. It was not really a direct horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and it was a kind of parody of the horror genre. This made the movie better as the comedy does with many horror movies. All up, even if you're not a fan of Child's Play.
