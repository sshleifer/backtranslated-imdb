I was surprised how much I liked that. Of course it's a bit slow moving in parts, but what else would you expect from Rollin? There is also an abundance of nudity, nothing wrong with this, especially as it includes many of the gorgeous, Brigitte Lahaie. There are also some spectacularly eroticized women dead, a little more elusive, perhaps, but more effective. There is also a sci-fi plot with a brief explanation in the end, but I would not bother too much about it. No, here we have an interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to what extent the person is still 'alive' without memory. My DVD cover mentions David Cronenberg, and although that may not be as good as his best films, there is some similarity here, particularly with the great use of seemingly threatening architecture and the effective and frightening use of inner space. As I've tried to point out that this is by no means a thunderous thriller, it's a captivating, nightmarish movie that takes full advantage of its venues, including an impressive railroad backdrop at the end.
