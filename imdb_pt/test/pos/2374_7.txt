The last part shows Sho Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi (looking colder than ever in their reversible coat!) Launched against each other for a last battle, this time in the future. The plot owes a lot to Blade Runner, but made with the low budget, the frenetic and comical style of Takashi Miike. I felt it was the weakest of the three DOA films, and although the ending was still outrageous, it lacked the shock value of the previous two. Compared to the likes of Ichi the Killer and Q Visitor, DOA: Final is not nearly as extreme, but is true to the other two films in the trilogy. That said, the fans of the first two (and Miike fans) will gain a lot from this, as they unite the three films together and give a final explanation about the relationship between the two protagonists.
