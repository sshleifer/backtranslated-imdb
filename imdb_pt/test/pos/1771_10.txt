I saw this movie when I was very young living in Houston, Texas. I really enjoyed this movie and wrote to Jean Peters in Hollywood and I told her how much I enjoyed seeing her in this movie. She sent me an autographed photo. This film was directed by Jacques Tourneur, and in addition to Jean Peters in the lead role. Also starring Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget and Herbert Marshall. It was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes long. Jean Peters was married to Howard Hughes. She also starred in "Viva Zapata" with Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn, who won an Oscar for playing the role of Zapata's brother (1952). And she also starred in "Captain from Castile" (1947) with Tyron Power. Since then, I've been trying to find a place where it's available, but so far I have not been successful. Does anyone have any suggestions on where I can find and buy this movie? This comment contains spoilers, I'm not aware of this.
