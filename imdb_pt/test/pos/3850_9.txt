I'm not a big Disney fan, but my 7 year old is starting to get into them, so we built a collection and that's one of my favorites. We saw this a few weeks ago and we should see it half a dozen times! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of the plots, but there is more to a movie than that. <br /> <br /> Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind. The music is superb - my disabled son always insists that I pick him up and dance with him for "Everybody wants to be a cat," that says it all. And "Thomas O'Malley" is so nice. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why some people are so pessimistic about this movie that they do not like cats! And yes, he takes some of his 101 Dalmations tips, and maybe "The Lady and the Tramp" (It's been a long time since I've seen this, so I will not compare them), and while "101 Dalmations" is better in some ways, for me "The Aristocats" is much nicer. Is not that what these movies are about? <br /> <br /> In addition to "Peter Pan" (now that is a 10/10 movie), this is my favorite Disney movie. My 7 year old son loves it, his grumpy 41 year old father loves it, so you can not ask for much more from a family movie. <br /> <br /> Superb!
