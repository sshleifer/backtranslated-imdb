What could happen in a Texas town in the summer? Well, a lot of teenagers find out that some things can happen and happen. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the Mexican werewolf of this story is nothing less than el chupacabra, and the film, unlike the name suggests, is not a remake or appearance of American Werewolf movies, but something completely different. <br /> <br /> Overall, for an obviously low budget movie, not bad! Some clever camera work, effects of traditional creatures and horrible things, and for once people who do not know everything they can and do make mistakes, like shooting a colleague thinking he's the big bad animal, and they're puzzled by things they do not they could know Sit in this expectation of a billion dollar production, and you will turn it off with disgust after a short time. Sit down at this moment expecting a little entertainment and a relatively simple story, and it's very good! Overall, you get an 8/10 from me to be creative, taking OK acting and taking some good work out of the budget this movie had.
