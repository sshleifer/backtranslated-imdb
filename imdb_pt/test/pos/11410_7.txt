Simon Wests pg-13 thriller about a nanny who gets disturbing calls from the joke while sitting in a mansion is neither original nor exciting enough to be considered a good movie. While there are some elements of suspense, good eyes and decent characters, the film is just another one that I know what you did last summer as it falls short of being taken seriously. The performances were cool, but nothing special with this movie, I say jump, unless you're looking for a mediocre movie, you can find better movies than this in life, sometimes ok, maybe not life, but at least USA or something, haha. ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
