This movie is incredible, although not perfect by Hollywood standards, it encompasses a gentle look at the broad divide between rich and poor, black and white that is true in many parts of the world. He deals with the audience with fur gloves while offering a true view of society's problems. The children are beautiful, especially note the young man who plays Sipho. Friendships that develop are universally true, anyone can relate to the choices these young people have to make. The influence of adults is interesting - it seems to be drawn from real-life experiences as there are many conversations and interactions - just as a child would remember to have lived. I recommend this movie.
