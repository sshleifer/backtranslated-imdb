I've seen this movie for many years, I've tried to locate it, but perhaps, understandably, can not be found anywhere. It was so esoteric, and still one of the few movies that stays with you for a long time. I'm still not sure what the reality of the film is, and perhaps, as the Uncertainty Principle, obscurity is the ultimate thing. Acting is superb, the atmosphere is always filled with a sense of foreboding, a general melancholy permeates, and yet it is hard not to be absorbed in history. I rented it thinking it was science fiction (it was in the science fiction section with some totally misleading synopsis), but clearly it is not. Or horror, or even suspense. In fact, he is grateful that the director has had the courage to make a film like this, for which, of course, there is no solid audience. I know some people have complained about the small role of Klaus Kinski, but I think it's very appropriate - his limited exposure is key to the mystery of this movie.
