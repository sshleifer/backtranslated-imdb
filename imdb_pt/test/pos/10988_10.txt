What a great cast for this movie. The weather was great and there were so many smart lines, several times I was still laughing minutes after they were delivered. I found Manna From Heaven to have some amazing moments and while there were things I thought would happen, the way they came together was anything but predictable. This movie is about hope and correct mistakes. I left the theater feeling inspired to do the right thing. Bravo to the five sisters.
