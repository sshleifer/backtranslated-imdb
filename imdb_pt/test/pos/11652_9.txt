Tim Robbins makes a wonderful film. His wife (Susan Sarandon) gives a wonderful performance as Sister Helen Perjean who wants to help Mattew Poncelet (Sean Penn) who is accused of murder and who will also die of an injection ... 120 minutes of splendid acting and touching scenes is the you win. Great acting and it's a movie that gives something to think about! <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon deserves the Oscar for best actress of 1995. It is probably one of her biggest movies ever. <br /> <br /> I did not see 'The Craddle going to rock', but I'm sure I have to see more Robbins movies. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9/10 or *** 1/2 out of 4. Go and see .....
