SPOILERS Every great regime uses the country's media for its own purposes. Whether the Nazi ban on certain pamphlets, or Tiananmen Square's Chinese-televised alternative, governments have tried to influence people through different media since the beginning of time. In 1925, however, celebrating the failed mutiny of 1905, the Russian communist government supported the creation of this film, Battleship Potempkin. An important piece of film history, it remains powerful and beautiful to this day. <br /> <br /> Aboard the Battleship Potempkin, the crew is unhappy. In miserable living conditions and with food infested with larvae, they are angry with their upper class suppressors. Now, however, after rotten food, that's enough. Led by Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), the crew turns to their masters and fights for their freedom. <br /> <br /> As for advertising, "Battleship Potempkin" is perfect. Presenting a positive light on the first, unsuccessfully, communist riot, the film was a useful Soviet tool. Eighty years after the release of the films, the USSR disappeared completely from the map. The surprising thing about this movie, however, is that as long as the country to which the message was destined has disappeared, the film remains a powerful and dignified piece of cinema. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Sergei Eisenstein, the film is surprisingly a joy to watch. It is true that it is far from what we consider nowadays 'entertainment', but the film is a beautiful work of art. Whether it's the scenes aboard the boat or the often spoken scene on the Odessa steps, everything about this movie is done perfectly. The music is powerful and dramatic, the lighting is flawless, even the performance, although slightly exaggerated, is perfect for the piece. Basically, there is no way to criticize the final product of the film. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to know how the Russian people received this film after its release. Praising a country that has not existed for fifteen years, it is difficult for us to know the full spirits that the film inspires. As a work of art, it is magnificent. Beautiful from start to finish, it's far from an easy watch, but well worth the effort.
