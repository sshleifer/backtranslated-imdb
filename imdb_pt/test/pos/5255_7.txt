My sisters and my cousin (female) forced me to see this girl's movie. It's not the kind of movie I'd rather see, but it really was not that bad. I would not want to see this movie but after watching it I could not say it was bad, just not my kind of movie. It was very accurate in interpreting what the woman actually speaks and does in certain situations. As a guy, I was not much fun with the jokes, but dear women certainly were. They related to the movie and yes, it was funny to see it on the big screen. "OH IN GEE DO HAHA" I've never seen the original, nor do I care. If you're a girl, this is a must see, but maybe the girls would say that this movie sucks, probably. I do not see a 13-year-old saying, "Wow, I remember playing it when I was 30." <br /> <br /> No man would have this collection there, but I can not say it was horrible so meh
