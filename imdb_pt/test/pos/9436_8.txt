Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) begins this story in disguise, helping to smuggle the famous physicist "Dr. Franz Tobel" (William Post) from Switzer- land and under the watchful eye of the Nazis, who want their bomb plans. The Allies obviously want to, too, and Sherlock is there to help. Dr. Tobel invented an instrument that greatly helps in the accuracy of aerial bombardment. Holmes and Dr. Tobel arrive safely at Baker Street, but the scientist preferred to be alone for some mysterious reason, although he had promised the British to help them, not the Germans. He remains true to this promise, but there are some desperate moments for Holmes and the British along the way. <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie in which our famous detective uses not one but three different disguises. He needs all the help he can get when facing his arch-rival, "Professor Moriarity." One complaint: if Moriarity were this evil, he would have dismissed Holmes without blinking, instead of opening him to escape. It's very sad too, when the usual drastic Watson (Nigel Bruce) has to rescue his right death boss a few times! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some credibility issues in this story. but if you can put your brain on hold sometimes, it's a fun movie to watch ... and it's beautiful, thanks to the great restoration work done on this DVD. It makes the old impression come to life with some wonderful visuals, particularly the night shots. <br /> <br /> Another remark: those who did the English subtitles here miss or misinterpreted at least half a dozen words. It's a very sloppy job, not the first time I've found this by watching the entire series on the restored DVD.
