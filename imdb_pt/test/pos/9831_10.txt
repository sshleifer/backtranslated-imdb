I must be getting old because I've been fascinated with this movie since the first time I saw it. I'm watching again on HBO now. It's a very simple film about two people who fall in love after they found out that the spouses were having an affair. The plot is very fine, but the actors acted very well in this film. In the mix of Kristen Scott Thomas running for Congress and Harrison Ford being an Internal Affairs Officer, these two meet, under unfortunate circumstances and fall in love. I love the soundtrack. Perfect fit. One thing I can not understand, this movie had a budget of $ 68 million. Were they spent? The plane crash or the Harrison Ford salary?
