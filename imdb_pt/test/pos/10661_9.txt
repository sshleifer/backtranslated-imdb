Eisenstein created the Russian Assembly Theory, and this film is his best example. It took years before anyone could use their ideas and make them work (The Limey, 1999). However, the stroller scene really demonstrates the bewildering nature of the RMT. Granted, like most movies, it gets long in some parts, the beauty of the movie is incredible. One of the best silent movies I've ever seen.
