I just saw this movie for the first time last night. Wow!! What movie! This is the kind of movie you want everyone in the world to see, because it's so cool and so interesting. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give a single word about the plot because I think it would be better for people to go in the cold. DO NOT READ THE LOT SUMMARY BEFORE YOU SEE THE FILM! All I'm going to say is that Eastwood, Malkovich, Peterson and Jeff Maguire's script are top notch. I wish all thrillers were more like this.
