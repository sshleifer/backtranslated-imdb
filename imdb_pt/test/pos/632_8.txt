I do not know how this movie went unnoticed for so long. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on TV, I was flipping through the channels and I came across this unexpectedly well done movie. I missed the first probably 10 minutes but that does not matter .. this movie literally grabbed me, it's a real spine cooler. <br /> <br /> The absence of well-known actors in the film enhances the effect, you do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new. You never know when they will be killed or what they are doing. then it is much more tense. Even though there are many new faces, his performances were first class. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers touch your mind, revealing enough blood to imagine the rest. Shock, fear, horror and helplessness are also revealed by the characters in the film. Well written situations, fast camera moves, intelligent editing and excellent directing make it a great thriller. This film really alternates between the genres - thriller of suspense and suspense leaving the viewer clueless and tense. No doubt comparable to Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> I could not even get off the TV even during commercial breaks. I was the helpless tale of this superb film.
