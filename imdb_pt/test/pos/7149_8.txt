Leaving amateur work aside, I found this movie very different, and unlike all the blogs and posts I read, I've achieved something totally different than the others. The premise of the story revolves around a very religious family and their ties to the church. As they must adhere to all the strict rules and regulations, but the daughter seems to have trouble staying on track with unpleasant thoughts of others and their use of bad language. However, she prays a lot, as does her family. Then one day they are going to a picnic in the church and they are in an accident. From there, parents and brother change; what with being knocked out and "saved" by Jesus. WARNING: MAJOR Spoiler ALERT. Or we are led to believe. I think if you watch this movie just from the daughter's point of view, then really pay attention to the end, you'll see that what we the public think is a real occurrence with the parents and the son is actually dreaming , and from the daughter's point of view. This would explain many of the actions portrayed by the parents and son, which were totally the opposite of how they lived before, especially sex, and would also explain why Peggy was murdered, etc. See how perfect this pie is, but come back and look at the cake that Betty does. That is, unless Caroline removed all the evidence that the pie was tied. And also the fact that the scene in which she sees her dead parents lying in each other's arms and her brother, all of whom seemed to die very peacefully, even though they are poisoned, fit into a sequence of dreams.
