Susan Sarandon is, for lack of a better word, incredible. In my opinion (and yes I understand that not everyone will agree with me here), she is one of the greatest actresses ever and must have at least two oscars to her credit. I mean, that was an AMAZING performance in Lorenzo's Oil (but I think all her performance is incredible) and they gave Emma Thompson ... what was that ??? And by the time she got this Oscar, she was in the industry for about 25 years. I could not think of anyone who deserved more, especially for a performance as brilliant as his portrayal of Sister Helen Prejean. But again, she is above all Hollywood artificiality and does not need an Oscar - people know she's good anyway. <br /> <br /> This film brings some very deep and provocative messages, so unnecessary. say that it is not to be taken lightly. Tim Robbins, of course, can not escape credit here. You would think that, because of your feelings against the death penalty, the portraits made in this film would not be accurate. However, both sides of the debate on the death penalty are given weight. On the one hand, you see the interesting side of Matthew, the human side that makes witnessing your death rather distressing. At the same time, you see the way he attacked his victims and the constant torment of understandably distressed parents. One word for Tim - BRAVO. <br /> <br /> A brilliant film and, as I said, a well-deserved Oscar and awaited by Susan.
