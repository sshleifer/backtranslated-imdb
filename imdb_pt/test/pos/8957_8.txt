I bought this movie from my local blockbuster for 99p and it has been sitting on my video rack for at least a year. So tonight I decided to see, the movie was quite different from what I expected and found no humor in it all I saw was that it was a dismal look at people dealing with love relationships and sexual orientation and I actually see the plot of psycho killer really having a point other than adding tension to the end of the movie. I felt that the person who made the lesbian woman did a great job. I was following her emotions and what was happening around her. Some people would probably have seen some of the things she does as funny, but I really could put myself in her place, loving someone, but they reject you at every step, no matter how hard you try. I thought it was a very moving film and dealt well with all the different sexualities. I was expecting something like Bound & Gagged: A love story, but this is a very different movie. Not for fanatics.
