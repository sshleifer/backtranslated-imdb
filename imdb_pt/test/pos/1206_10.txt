I've seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and every time I watch it, the movie is as much fun as it was the first time! George Berger (played by Treat Williams) leads a small group of anti-war "hippies" from the 1960s to the present, living in New York. This small group happens to a young man, Claude Bukowski (played by John Savage), who was summoned to the US Army for service in Vietnam. Despite his best efforts to dissuade him, Claude ends up performing for basic army training. Still distressed for having left them, the hippie group stole a car and toured the United States to visit Claude "... for a few hours," in the words of George Berger (for a member of parliament parked at the airport gate). Army Base Claude is temporarily stationed in Nevada). The result is truly moving, so I will not ruin everything for those who have not seen this fantastic movie yet. The musical score is equally fantastic! Don Dacus (from the Chicago rock group), who plays the role of "Woof" - one of the hippies, is not a key character, but the movie would not have been the same without him. Beverly D'Angelo (who plays Sheila Franklin, a city girl who is friends with the hippie group) is sensational in her role! A MUST SEE movie !!
