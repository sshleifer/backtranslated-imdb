First of all, I've watched this show since I was a kid, and I've always loved it. Of course, maybe I did not understand when I was so young, but I still liked it! And now that I can understand this for several years, I love it even more. The score of this musical is the most wonderful score I have ever heard! Every note is perfect, I do not even need to hear the chant to enjoy it! <br /> <br /> Turning to this particular production - That's magnificent! Of course, no one could interpret Mme. Lovett besides Angela Lansbury, and she does it perfectly. And she should, she has played that role for several years. George Hearn is absolutely brilliant. The best Sweeney Todd I've ever heard. He has a wonderful voice but he can play his voice so well! Your "epiphany" is incredible, as you can tell by the public's reaction to it. The Judge, Toby, Antony and Pirelli are also wonderful in their roles. Everyone is perfect! Well, I still have to move fast through Johanna's birdie and birdie. She just does not sing that song well. <br /> <br /> This show can be enjoyed at all ages, but is not always accepted. I'm not your typical middle-aged theater lover, I'm only 15 years old, but Sweeney Todd gave me a greater appreciation for music than I got from any other musical.
