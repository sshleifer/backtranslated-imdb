This movie is broadcast sporadically, and I never watched, thinking it would be similar to Bruce Willis's movie "America," with the trivial story about American freedom, etc. But it was not; was much more! <br /> <br /> Of course, Martin Sheen is excellent; (I've never seen him in a movie I did not love, even though the script is bad because he's so talented). Kathy Bates is the arrogant mother and does a great job. The real surprise is Emilio Estevez, who was not always in the biggest movies, but also directed this film. Please, do not stereotype the movie "Breakfast Club"; he's much better at it, and I'd like him to make more atypical and non-commercial Hollywood films. <br /> <br /> The film is realistic, as we see Emilio at home in Vietnam during Thanksgiving. Kimberly Williams is passable as the sister, who feels that she is "dishonored and ashamed" by the returning soldier, her brother; he is quite alienated from the family, and especially at this point in US history, this story is VERY relevant. <br /> <br /> I learned a lot about post-traumatic stress, and you will genuinely empathize with it. character; This is not a violent portrait, journalistic, as "Platoon", for example, is more a study of character, which makes us even more intrigued and worried about the effects of war, especially when considering the young age of soldiers who are victims. With today's violence, it's rare for a movie to really make someone feel sad and shed a tear; this does it and deserves recognition.
