I saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who commented on it here ... I came back many times to see more and more ... I think 9 times in total. It's great as I would describe ... I was taken by the soundtrack, by the beautiful panoramas of southern France, the lifestyle that children started on their own. An ideal way to live is what they set up ... of course the powers they have to intercede, but when I forget this part I see myself wanting to be in the movie and live like this! So good it's available on DVD now ... it has not been around for years! <br /> <br /> TLW
