What is often neglected in Agatha Christie's stories is her progressive and anti-conservative attitude on a number of issues - from the role of women to the effects of tradition and to the belief of people in the supernatural. In "Nemesis," you can identify many of these subtexts - but you may also find an intriguing, old-fashioned mystery that keeps you in the dark for most of the time. Also raising "Nemesis" above other entries in the series ("They Do It With Mirrors", "Paddington's 4:50", etc.) is the fact that in the crucial moments before and after the killer's revelation you really can feel the suspense. And finally, Jane Booker is welcome to keep my body at any moment. (***)
