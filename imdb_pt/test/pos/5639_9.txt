Okay, so I'm a sucker for a good documentary, particularly where it tells a modern story of Don Quixote. One caveat: I met Mark Borchardt in the winter of 1995/96 while he was still working on the Coven. But I'll save this story for later. American Movie, which began production not long after, accurately portrays the person I knew, although in greater depth than I expected or believed existed. This is both a very funny and very sad movie, and it is brilliantly executed. Mark appears as his worst enemy: his childish ambition and optimism - which I admire - are undermined by his apparent artistic ineptitude as well as by his bizarre fiscal expectations. But he is also a charismatic guy. His faithful helper Sancho Panza is equally sympathetic: loyal, if exhausted, to the core. Like Don Quixote, American Movie presents an inefficient aspect of freedom often overlooked - that people will be attracted to professions for which they are not particularly suitable, regardless of repeated failures. It's a great movie.
