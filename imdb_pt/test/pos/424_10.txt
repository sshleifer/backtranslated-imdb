I love this show. It is intelligent and very well represented. David Morse and Andre Braugher have great chemistry. Writing is intelligent and subplots often give great comic relief. After each new episode, I am always impressed with the thought provoking and at the same time entertaining this program. My only complaint would be the absence of Donna Murphy at this time in Season Two. As David Morse's ex-wife, Heather, she added such a character to the show. <br /> <br /> I think this show is a credit to the crime / drama genre. With that said - I can not for the life of me understand why this show has such a low rating. Someone please, who gave this show a rating of 1 back with a review?
