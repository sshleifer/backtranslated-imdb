I read a lot of comments about the superiority of the miniseries. I certainly can not agree to such a generic statement. If you analyze all aspects of a video / movie production, there are countable areas where the film is arguably superior. <br /> <br /> Of course, many of the comments are valid for specific areas of the mini-Series. Specifically in relation to more segments (customs officials) and more developed topics (such as the Pakistani farmer and family). That said, I found the character of Catherine Zeta-Jones much more attractive as desperate women, from poverty to riches that "do not come back." This is a much nicer character than the cold women who did not seem to have as much reason for their swift change to evil. (And yes, I understand ... her children.) She was desperate, I just did not see her as being so desperate. <br /> <br /> In addition, while I appreciated some of the more elaborate story topics in the mini-series, Benicio del Toro's character was very attractive. An anchor for the movie. This segment has been changed (as an alternative to the Pakistani family) in nothing more than good manners. A fantastic adaptation. (Of course, I am skeptical that someone so pure can exist within such a system, but I do not know enough about the nation's policy to argue). <br /> <br /> After watching the first episode of the mini-series, I actually reviewed the movie. Because? I kept reading about the fantastic acting. I found the performances in the first episode of the miniseries as ridiculous. Of course, that improved as the miniseries progressed. Now that I have finished both versions in a few days, I can not agree that the performances in the miniseries reached the same level as, say, Benicio del Toro, who was brilliant in the film, although Ormand, Paterson, Shah, and Lindsay Duncan were very Good. I also feel that the police in the film surpassed the miniseries. I was not impressed with the Germans everywhere. <br /> <br /> Finally, the dialogue, as presented in the film, is much more subtle. Especially in almost textual scenes. "Be careful, you're starting to sound like your husband." unlike "HAHAHAHA! You look like Karl." Again, I found that some of the performances in the miniseries were very unconvincing. This was a great example. <br /> <br /> Other top aspects of the film, in my opinion: score, cinematography, editing. <br /> <br /> Should I complain that the movie was not longer? No. I think it was a fantastic adaptation, given the format. The changes made were on their own. I mean, you'd sit in a theater for 5/7 hours. Of course not. <br /> <br /> Miniseries: 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Film: 9 out of 10
