I would not be so sure of accepting DNA tests as irrefutable evidence against Anna Anderson. First, read Peter Kurth's book on which this film is based. Anna Anderson knew things only the true Grand Duchess Anastasia could have known (forensic evidence in favor of Anna). Second, compare photos of Anastasia and Anna Anderson. Anyone can see that they are one and the same person. Third, visit Peter Kurth's website (url below) where you can read detailed information about DNA tests, as well as why Franziska Schanzkowska and Anna Anderson are not the same person (go to the link, "ANNA-ANASTASIA NOTES ON FRANZISKA SCHANZKOWSKA "). Even Schanzkowska's relatives believed that her sister and Anna Anderson were not the same person. <br /> I always believe that HIH Anastasia Nicolevna Romanova and Anna Anderson were in fact the same person; I will never be influenced to the contrary. <br /> <br /> www.peterkurth.com
