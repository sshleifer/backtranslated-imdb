"Down To South Park" is a 1 hour documentary about South Park with interviews with Trey Parker and Matt Stone and all the other people who work in South Park. There is not much to say, it shows the history of South Park and what it takes to make an episode. It's basically a backstage show. It shows the different merchandise that the South Park did (it was actually the central comedy that exposed it). He also shows the controversy that was caused by South Park. He shows many funny clips from the show as well. It's a pretty funny documentary. Any fan of South Park should check this out. You can find it on youtube. <Br/> <br /> 9/10
