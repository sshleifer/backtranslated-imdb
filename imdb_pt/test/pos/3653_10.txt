A work of love. Each frame is the perfect image and grabs you. So pure emotion and storytelling lead you to a dream that stays with you long after the movie. The director grabs his heart and leads him through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are part of the character's emotional drive. I saw this movie in 2 festivals and it got with standing applause at every showing. The remarkable narrative transcends nationality and language and I felt that it was part of the drama unfolding before me. The cast is as perfect as it gets. Vijay Raaz, Camille and Benoit are yours. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this movie to all who enjoy good cinema. I can not wait for the commercial release of this movie.
