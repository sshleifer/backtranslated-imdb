This groundbreaking film is truly a work of art. I went to the convention show in Indiana with very low expectations, having already seen 2 other movies with "gamer" in the title (both were so bad that by the end of the second movie I had chosen one of my own eyes with my straw and a paperclip I found between the seat cushions). But from the opening credits "Dorkness" had me. The temperate setting of the Northwest made a beautiful backdrop to the drama around the frustrated game master Lodge (powerfully portrayed by Nathan Rice) and his gang of misfit friends who set aside the real-life dramas they face every day to face fantastic dramas in the lodge scenario provides for them. After the first scene (set in the fantasy world they inhabit), they are violently pushed back into the world that so desperately tries to escape. This drew so many comparisons with my own life that I was brought to tears. Rice's acting is of such incredible caliber that I actually believed in the first 20 minutes of the film that he really was a twenty-something man suffering from frustration, male-pattern baldness and an annoying group of "friends" who did not seem to understand . concepts as right and wrong. Lodge's friends are of some note here: Leo, the oldest and heaviest of the trio seems to be the only other character with a job, besides the lodge. However, he seems to gravitate socially to Gary, the youngest of the group. That just seems a bit odd at first until you realize that Gary is actually a sexually confused sociopath with very few prospects out of his "fantasy" world. This dichotomy serves not to confuse but to inform and raise the public about the importance of diversity in our society. My only complaint about this is that the actors who play Leo (Scott C. Brown) and Gary (Christian Doyle) seem to interpret the characters to laugh at times, as if they had been told they were acting in a comedy instead of a record hard. hitting action / drama. Speaking of action, Brian Lewis makes his movie debut as Cass, the third and most influential member of the Lodge's heterogeneous crew. the tension is always high when he's onscreen, both when he's passionately discussing his beliefs with Lodge and showing off his fantastic Martial Arts skills like "Silence," his fantasy character. Or even when he suddenly turns to face the audience and you lower yourself reflexively in the audience so as not to be hit by your fantastic chin. Lewis Turns the screen on, no matter what he's doing, and I expect to see more of him in the future. Once the action starts in that movie, it just does not come out. drama and action blend so perfectly at times that you can tell if you are in the middle of a frantic action sequence or a touching dramatic moment. Truly a thrill ride of epic proportions, I would recommend "The Gamers: Dorkness Rising" as the necessary viewing for movie goers. It was almost worth losing an eye. <br /> Chip Deedlenick
