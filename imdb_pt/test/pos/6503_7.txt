This film is essentially for those who had little or no introduction to hip-hop, specifically turntableism, as was the case with the director before starting this movie. It was cool to have the focus on the bay more than expected, because NY is always getting all the credit, but coming from the bay, Q-Bert worship is a bit out of control. This movie did not introduce anything new to me, but it changed my view that by going into that, I was weird about the prospect of giving the tables the distinction of being a genuine instrument. This movie must convince anyone that it's up there with the viola and the clavichord.
