I'm sorry, but "Star Wars Episode 1" did not do justice to Natalie Portman's talent (and undeniable cuteness). She was totally underused as Queen Amidala, and when she was used, her makeup was frighteningly terrible. For "Anywhere But Here," she loses her horrible makeup and acts normally. And not only can she act well, she looks good doing it. I'm a little older than she (she's only 18), and I have little or no chance to meet her, but hey, a guy can dream, right? <br /> <br /> Even though Susan Sarandon does not take a good turn in this movie, the film belongs entirely to Portman. I have been an observer of Portman since "Beautiful Girls" (where she was younger, but so cute). There are great things for her in the future - I can see that.
