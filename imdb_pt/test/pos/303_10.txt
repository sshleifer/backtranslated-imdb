I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was lucky enough to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981 while waiting for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert. He was very humble about the compliments I shared with him for this work of art, especially his interpretation of the young captain. This is undoubtedly a must see, a complete 10 and an important part of the history of American cinema. "Charlie does not surf." Robert Duvall's famous phrase (the other) need not be repeated as it has become a repeatedly repeated hymn and his character patonesco will long be remembered as a classic American war hawk in the tradition of John Wayne. It's a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks like.
