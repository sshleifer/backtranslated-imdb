Black Castle is one of those films that came into a collection of Boris Karloff and is mistakenly expected to be a horror movie. While some elements of terror exist within Nathan Juran's film, this is actually a multi-genre piece that is well produced and effectively portrayed. Joining Karloff, in what is a small but critical role are Richard Greene, Stephen McNally, Lon Chaney Jr., Rita Corday, John Hoyt and Michael Pate. It is produced, not surprisingly, from Universal International Pictures. The plot recounts that Greene's English gentleman travels to the castle house of the sinister Count von Bruno {McNally}. He is following an investigation into the disappearance of two friends, an investigation that is fraught with danger and surprise at every corner. <br /> <br /> This has everything fans of the subgenre dark house / castle could wish for. Genuine good and bad men, a pretty maiden, dark corners to do obscure scripts, diabolical traps, ticking the clock, and even have a good old buck-up in business. The cast is turning into effective performances, particularly Greene and the wonderfully contemptuous McNally. While Jerry Sackheim's writing is lean and devoid of the useless stuffing that has so often jammed similar films of this genre. A highly recommended film, provided Karloff fans understand that it's not really a Karloff movie, and perhaps more importantly, that horror fans do not expect blood to be the order of the day. A beautiful atmospheric history with a sense of fear everywhere, The Black Castle is a great viewing experience. 7/10
