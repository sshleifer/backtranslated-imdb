(A revision of the original 1950 version is not restored in 1980) In a land where the king dislikes no one and no one likes the king, a shepherdess and a chimney of two nearby paintings come alive and run away. A portrait of the king, who loves the shepherdess, kills the real king and takes his place. A huge bird, the wonderful bird of the title, acts as a type of hero and helps our two lovers. <br /> <br /> This is a weird strange movie ... not surreal, very, very, very surreal. <BR> <br /> The style of the background is very European, while the characters are Fliescher meet Warner, but arty Warner's early non-main characters. They move both in realistic form and in the form of cartoons. <br /> <br /> This is a strange movie and it takes a while to get in, but Peter Ustinov as the bird is a turmoil, his children and puppies are wonderful. There are cops in rubber ducks and a bear drawing that makes you smile. <br /> <br /> And there's a deep philosophy in the movie, about the existence of a world out there ... plus an underground metropolis city. <br /> <br /> This is a really cool movie. There is something so strange and unique that it will reward you if you stay with it throughout the ride. It's not perfect, but damn it. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to look for. If your local bargain DVD box has the capcom version (paired with Alice in Paris), buy it. It should cost less than ten dollars, probably around five and the price is worth it, especially when you realize that comes with two complete cartoons, two short cartoons and several well-organized commercials and other fun things.
