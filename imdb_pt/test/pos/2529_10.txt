Film about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults. Impressive impossibility to deal with the life and the means by which the children go to try to reach the life. Just living. Staying alive in a cruel world. A nightmarish world, we are afraid to watch because we are seeing the truth and we are afraid to see. Seeing a world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our own lives and even complaining about what we do not have when it is so trivial compared to someone else. They, the children of the film, are desensitized. They are more than desensitized by what is around them. They see sex as an act, as if they were watching a TV show. When the boy is with the prostitute, Pixote is sitting on the bed watching with an empty, unfeeling look. He wants to be a boy and have a family, but the prostitute also has no compassion and pushes him away. A "human" film, with "human" relationships and moral judgment in an ugly, frightened and cruel world. It reminds us that life is not fair, but you can still have a human connection.
