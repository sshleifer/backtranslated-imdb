Spin-offs, for those who do not know, are generally not successful because most of the original characters are absent. <br /> <br /> Here they are and you could not ask for a better set in what is essentially a silly little drawing, not meant to do anything other than entertain. JP Manoux, replacing David Spade, does an admirable job of retaining Kuzco's ego and yet does not look as annoying as Spade's character (a character Spade has been doing for decades and freaks out later of a time). He has a softer voice, but it fits in some way. Eartha Kitt, reprizing her role as Yzma, is brilliant. She has not received much praise since her turn as Batwoman centuries ago, except maybe for her vile part in Boomerang. It's funny how much the character looks like her, though. <br /> <br /> And Patrick Warburton. There's no way he's not funny except when he was completely wasted on Men in Black 2. I've been a fan of him since Seinfeld, but unlike this character, he plays a genuinely nice guy who is sucked into not doing it. Such cool things. <br /> <br /> The animation is really beautiful, as all Disney is, but sometimes the character design is a little too much. Oh well. Two out of three are not bad.
