An exquisite film. They just do not do it any more! We listened to a middle-class family in Dublin in the early twentieth century. They are hosting a dinner after Christmas for their friends and relatives. Your conversation at the table is just plain crap, but it's so well written that you're absorbed. Away from the dining table, some beautiful piano pieces help create an intimate atmosphere, as if we were there as one of the guests. Maybe a bit too perfect for an amateur player, the odd error here and there would have added to the magic of this movie. No real story but real entertainment and an object lesson for the filmmakers on the rise.
