Intense internal suspense with the mistress of the house (Lupino, excellent as always) threatened by a psychotic migrant cleaner (Ryan). The two masters of the genre are at their peak, erotic, as they face intelligence, emotions and wills in a bizarre hostage situation in the Saturday Evening Post. P & B photography with rich colors, with an unusual amount of close-up photos. The young lady who provokes Ryan is very well directed here. Unlikely but satisfactory suburban melodrama.
