Tweety is sent in his cage on a train by his old lady owner. In the same luggage car, also in a cage, is Sylvester. Soon Sylvester took Tweety, but a trainer comes back and hits the "furtive cat," as he calls it, back to his cage. He puts Tweety "in a safer place" on top and says to the cat, "Now, remember: no tricks!" Sylvester puts on his halo and looks innocent. Yes right. <br /> <br /> I found the funniest things, however, not involving Sylvester versus Tweety, but the "doggy" who is in another cage next to Sylvester. The cat stares at him and pays a great price in an extremely funny way. Sylvester just does not learn, but that's one of the reasons we love him! (I know a number of IMDb reviewers do not like Tweety, but I like the two main characters - they both criticize me!) <br /> <br /> In addition, the train and the passing landscape are beautifully illustrated here . - really nice visuals.
