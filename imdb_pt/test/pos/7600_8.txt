I just saw this movie a second time with my 8 year old daughter and I remembered why we liked it the first time. All these people who say it's bad are very tense and critical! It's simply a little fun movie, it's not supposed to change the world. I thought all the actors did a great job with their characters. (Except for Jeremy Jordan as Guy - he was a larva who seemed to seriously need soap and shampoo.If HE is supposed to be the hot guy at his school, then they have lean pickers.) But I digress- Drew Barrymore was delicious, as usual, and David Arquette was really nice, and I usually can not tolerate him, even if it's because of these STUPID AT & T commercials! Molly Shannon is always entertaining, and Leelee Sobieski did a great job as a tortured brain. Some parts were really painful to watch, reminding me of high school. Even though fortunately I did not enjoy myself, it made my heart ache for those who do. Movies like this are really good for kids to see - my daughter made several observations about the cruelty of some of the students and how wrong she was. This movie is suitable for anyone and a good way to spend 2 hours. If there is a time when you want to see a merry little movie with a happy ending where you do not need to think too much, then this is definitely a consideration.
