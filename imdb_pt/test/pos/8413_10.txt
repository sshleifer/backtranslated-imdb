Following directly from the last episode of the previous series, Yes Minister. Jim Hacker is now number 10 Downing Street as Britain's Prime Minister rather than a cabinet minister and a member of the government. He is now leading the government of His Majesty . All this after some malicious maneuvers of Sir Humphrey Appleby, after the previous prime minister resigned to the position of yes minister. <br /> <br /> Sir Humphrey Appleby is now the head of Civil Service. <br /> <br /> I thought this series was better than the first series, or that did not last as much as the first series, unfortunately.
