Nigel Balchin's labyrinth novel, "A Way Through the Wood," was adapted by Julian Fellowes, who also directs this thriller from a "terribly British" living room. It is a film whose effect depends on the cast that portrays the different benign / malignant characters and it is here that the choices of direction of Fellowes are superb. The story has a linear line that is easy to follow, but the beauty of the movie is the metamorphosis of each player as a single incident triggers a minefield of disasters. James Manning (Tom Wilkinson) is a successful business-obsessed lawyer in London, married to Anne (Emily Watson), who needs more in her life: the couple who have no children lives in country on a beautiful estate, assisted by Maggie (Linda Bassett). They participate in social outings and meet, among others, William Bule (Rupert Everett), the rich lazy, passive neighbor. Anne decides that they should entertain their neighbors and against James's rude protest, Anne goes on with the planning: James organizes "not due due to business." On the night of the party, there is an accident with which Maggie's husband is accidentally killed by someone in a Range Rover (she remarked). When James returns home, he sees a scratch on William Range Rover and suspects that William is the perpetrator. Anne discourages James from going to the police with the information - "what can you do good but ruin Bill's life as a socialite and the father and son of an important descendant?" From that first 'lie' the virus spreads: James confronts Bill who talks to James to go to the police, Anne confesses that it was she who ran Bill's Rover and is responsible, James convinces Anne to keep her cool because she would ruin his reputation, Anne confesses that she is having an affair with Bill, and the three agree that they will stick together in their big lie for the greater good. Anne eventually succumbs to the guilt of not telling her beloved Maggie that she is the sole responsible and Maggie, herself guilty of an earlier robbery whose life was saved by Anne's mercy to hire her anyway, is the agent who draws the story to its astounding conclusion. . Lies generate lies that generate lies, etc. The greatest impact of this intrigue is the way in which isolated tragedy impacts each of the characters involved. Each of them changes dramatically. Tom Wilkinson gives the best performance of a career full of brilliant performances: he is able to say more with his posture and facial expressions than any actor before the audience today. Similarly, the talented Emily Watson adds yet another role to her repertoire, as does the surprisingly grumpy Rupert Everett, who, despite being more of a wealthy British "gentleman", gives us a man of spirit and at the same time needy. And the well-preserved Linda Bassett takes on a small role and makes it discreetly central to the chaotic network of lies. The cinematography of Tony Pierce-Roberts and the musical score of Stanislas Syrewicz adds immensely to the multiple atmospheres that history finds. This is ensemble playing at its best, which always means that the director (Julian Fellowes) has a good understanding about the play. The interaction of these excellent people makes dishonest history work very well. Grady Harp
