Murder Over New York is one of Chan's best mysteries and I just saw it for the first time. <br /> <br /> In this, Charlie Chan is visiting New York to attend a police convention. At the same time, people who are involved with planes plants are being murdered and he decides to assist in the investigation along with his son number 2. These killings end up being the sabotage results in the aircraft factories and Chan helps to identify the killer .. . Charlie Chan is well played by Sidney Toler and the rest of the cast includes Sen Yung as his son number 2 and Marjorie Weaver. <br /> <br /> I quite liked this mystery and it's worth having if you like that sort of thing. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars and a half out 5
