Nana Patekar again proves that he is the best actor working in Bombay without a doubt. His recent films involved shouting his lines that do not bode well for the stage actor. One wonders why he is not always praised during the awards season. Shakti-The Power was one of his films that was a complete disappointment along with Kohram (a missed opportunity to create a screen magic with Amitabh Bachchan.) But Patekar exudes a cool calm in this film as a cop the Patekars character takes control of the screen (and the attention of the viewers) and never releases it. The edition is very rhythmic and there are no annoying songs to distract from the story. <br /> <br /> In the same vein as the modern cult classic "Company", the film is well represented, directed and should have a long shelf life on DVD. <br /> <br /> <br /> The final ten minutes of Nana and the main villain chatting in their overseas retreat will surely be part of the Hindi movie classics, and you will not be disappointed with this film of cops and thieves.
