When Alfred Hitchcock made STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, it was a harbinger for most of the film to go public that he was back to the top of his form. From 1946 to 1950, his films were not box office hits, and his contractual agreement with David O. Selznick ended because of that. In fact, it made some really good movies in the period, like NOTORIOUS, SPELLBOUND, CAPRICORN, ROPE and (in my opinion) STAGESTRUCK. But while NOTORIOUS and SPELLBOUND were appreciated, the public was discouraged by Hitch's attempts to experiment: his use of a sequence of dreams by Salvator Dali in SPELLBOUND was acceptable, as was the scenario among psychiatrists. But the experiment with long takes on ROPE confused audiences (ignoring the merits of that movie), and Hitch's willingness to have audiences fooled by a lie told by a main character in a flashback was unfriendly - much more unfriendly then he deserved be - in STAGESTRUCK. A bad weather issue for UNDER CAPRICORN (which was released as soon as the scandal of its star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini broke out) made it look like a failure (which it was not). The CASE PARADINHO was another failure - and that really had little in its favor. With STRANGERS ON THE TRAIN, Hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested him in recent movies. Instead, he focused on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity. Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith, the story was about how professional tennis player Guy Haines meets a fan of him - Bruno Anthony, a playboy - who is traveling on a cross-country train at the same time as the athlete. Bruno is talkative and flattering, and Guy sees him as one of the typical fans he's met ... if he's a bit eccentric with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket into outer space. But Bruno knows all about Guy's personal problems. He is married to a promiscuous young woman named Miriam and is in love with Anne Morton, the daughter of a senator. Bruno knows that Miriam will not divorce her successful celebrity husband. Bruno mentions how he can sympathize - he hates his stepfather, who constantly criticizes him. Then Bruno mentions (sort of improvised) an idea that he has about two men - technically strange - exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect and insoluble crimes, instead of searching them. Guy hears the idea - and agrees that's an interesting idea. The train arrives at Guy's destination and his last comment is like a validation of the idea. He just does not realize that the "eccentric" Bruno is a sociopath, and believes that Guy has just agreed to the two killing each other's enemy! <br /> <br /> It's a wonderfully simple plot indeed. Bruno, of course, kills Miriam, but he expects Guy to comply with the murder agreement and kill his stepfather. Guy is horrified - and worse, he thinks he is the prime suspect in the police department. When Bruno, to encourage Guy, mentions that he has the lighter (he pocketed on the train) and can plant it at the murder site, Guy finds himself in deeper trouble - how to avoid the police and how to control (if possible) the insane Bruno? <br /> <br /> Hitch has always carefully planned the filming of his film, so from the outset we see our two "heroes" standing up for the fateful encounter on the train with each other. There are constant cross-contacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each other's orbits. It is like the destiny that unites them. However, both have their own personality - and Hitch, with a typical twist, leaves the madman Bruno actually more attractive. His scheme can be vicious (he'll kill two people if he's successful, and he'll make Guy live by the deal, no matter what), but he has a taste for life. Someone suspects that since Guy also had one, but the failure of his marriage, along with his courtship with a socially prominent woman, made him more circumspect and annoying than he. <br /> <br /> The cast is also good. Robert Walker probably had his best part in this film (just a year before his death). He was a long way from the homemade boy from SINCE YOU WON Away or THE CLOCK. Her slender figure also looked quite elegant in short stories in various scenes. As Guy Farley Granger acts as a cousin to his co-murderer in ROPE, especially as circumstances make him increasingly suspicious to the authorities (as his previous role made his nervous behavior increasingly suspicious to Jimmy Stewart). As for the ladies, Kasie Rogers is properly sloppy like Miriam - allowing the public to be prepared for his death (in a famous sequence filmed in the reflection of his glasses), so that they are actually cheering Bruno on his evil act. Patricia Hitchcock appears as Anne's younger sister (Ruth Roman), who bears a strong resemblance to Miriam, and accidentally shoots Bruno on a social occasion. She performs this rare role well. Ruth Roman is properly in favor of Granger, but her role is limiting because she is the establishment in her past, and somewhat low. Other supporting artists, Leo G. Caroll as Senator, Marion Lorne (usually a comedian) as Bruno's mother, and Norma Varden as an unexpected recipient of Walker's violence are all shown to best advantage - all in the hands of a master .
