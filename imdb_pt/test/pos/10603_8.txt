I did not know what to expect. I've always considered Bam Margera and the CKY team a team of heads dedicated to doing stupid things for entertainment. I did not know they could take action. But everyone who has performed in this movie has performed well. The hilarity of 'aaaaagh!' scene mingles with Ryan Dunn's depression and his revenge against his ex-girlfriend perfectly. Sometimes the movie some scenes seem meaningless, but at the same time are funny. I recommend this to anyone who likes a good laugh but this movie can not appeal to those who prefer detailed story lines and a series of twists and turns.
