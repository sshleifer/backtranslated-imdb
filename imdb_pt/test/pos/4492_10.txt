While researching about Susan Harrison in reference to a Bonanza Episode, I remembered this gem. <br /> <br /> This episode is the inspiration for Dylan's "All Along the Watch Tower" (Hendrix's cover is probably well known and is one of his best), which is one of his best. <br /> <br /> So this episode is responsible for several 'best' - not bad for about 22 minutes of television. <br /> <br /> But that's "The Twilight Zone." Additional comments about the series are unnecessary. <br /> <br /> '5 Characters' is typical of Serling. Intense, dramatic, toward an end that is as inevitable in retrospect as it is surprising the first time you see it. <br /> <br /> This episode is spoiled in one sentence and is too good to spoil for anyone who has not seen it. <br /> <br /> But you will feel ambushed. And you will never hear Hendrix with the same ears again.
