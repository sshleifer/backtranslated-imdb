It's fantastic! A sick and distorted tale of coincidence and deceit. <br /> <br /> The story is meticulously and ingeniously built. It really is a perfect blend: it has everything from suspense to humor and the story is told with a lot of originality ... The film is built as a puzzle that is assembled piece by piece, and solves the story ... For the viewer there is many surprises to the end !! I also had a little impression that the director was inspired by some Hitchcock work. I've also seen movies before seeing the same event happening from different points of view, but this movie goes beyond that. In this movie everything is built on what happens to a body that appears and disappears and appears again in a different location. Each actor in the story has his own secret and we come to realize this in a way that contributes to the assembly of the puzzle ... I especially loved the black humor scenes ... which made the whole theater laugh ... This movie is a must see for everyone!
