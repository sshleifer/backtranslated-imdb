Maybe. I thought it was a bad start, bringing home the wrong DVD in the case of "The Intruder". Rental team! So I did not want to see this movie, but I'm glad I saw it. In all likelihood my chosen movie would not have been as good a movie as this delightful and delicate taste of what independents in the US and Europe can do together. Seven years apart, two heroine sisters embark on fantastic journeys through the post-student demo of the 1970s / Baader-Meinhof Europe. Sumptuously filmed in the Algarve, Portugal; and in Berlin, Paris, and Amsterdam (reminiscent of the feel of the exterior plans of Paul Verhoeven's masterpiece, "The Fourth Man"), is played in a touching way by Brewster, Diaz and especially Christopher Ecclestone. The story unfolds in an abstract plot, capturing the ephemeral emotions of these characters as they confront their relationships and see idealized images of each other and shatter each other. A movie with a lot of refinement and good taste. Not for fans of Arnie Commando, which is probably why the upstairs reviewer is so inaccurate in his claims that this is a female movie. Daft Criteria. Wrong too. Worth a try.
