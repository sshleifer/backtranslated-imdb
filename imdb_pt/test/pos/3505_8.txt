Ali G Indahouse has to be one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, and Cohen's portrayal of a British gangsta is hilarious. This movie has a cult classic written all over, and features some really great lines. Ali G Indahouse is a good party movie that will leave the viewer laughing literally from beginning to end. Definitely Vote Ali G and keep it real.
