For those who are still in the dark, I will not ruin this Christie as it is definitely one of his best jobs, and I emphasize that you should see him whenever you have free time! If any of the adaptations are observed before (or instead of) reading the book, I would suggest "After the Funeral" for the following reasons. <br /> <br /> I wanted to praise Monica Dolan's performance. (Miss Gilchrist), whose partner and employer Cora is brutally murdered at the beginning of the film. Her portrait of a shocked, nervous, insignificant woman is really moving, especially when she has a moment of personal connection with Poirot, another person who travels alone on the "journey of life." And when the killer is being revealed in the typical form of Poirot's denouement, Dolan's reactions to revelation are acting the best: you feel as angry with the killer as you sympathize with Miss. Gilchrist ... something unusual in the Christie tradition. Although there are some discrepancies between the adaptation of the novel and the film as usual (the business of the will perhaps making less sense in the film), the unbelievably prodigal re-creation of post-war England, of high caliber act, direct and preserve not increase) the mystery and intrigue of Christie make these discrepancies insignificant. <br /> <br /> Bravo Suchet, Dolan and the whole team to craft this masterpiece of murder mystery theater and producers who gave birth to the green light! Encore!
