Some of the critics here have judged this movie mute by today's political correctness standards. "Battle" was an excellent film for several reasons, correctly observed by more rational critics: excellent cast, lots of action, innovative editing and photography. <br /> <br /> His stars were in force at D.W. Griffith's stock company and for this silent movie fan, that's enough incentive to watch and have fun. <br /> <br /> I've seen this for many years and just watched it again on YouTube; this was a very poor quality impression, but along with my memory of a good impression on a real theater, I can justifiably recommend this to reasonable people and film historians.
