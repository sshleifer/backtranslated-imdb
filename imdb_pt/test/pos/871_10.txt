The film is a joy to watch, not just for the plot, which is thrilling, but also for the superb performances of the actors, Deneuve and Belmondo. Although considered a "failure" in its first release, it has become a critical success, and it is clear to see why. Deneuve's acting style adapted to the film brilliantly. she constantly gives the impression that she is holding or hiding something, and her character in this film is. I will not spoil it by saying what, although it will be released early on. Belmondo is lovely as the rather naive but passionate tobacconist. I would recommend this movie to all fans of Truffaut or Deneuve. It's a brilliant Hitchcockian-style thriller with thrilling twists and engaging relationships and characters that evolve as the film does. The movie is approximately 2 hours, so you feel you have not been short-listed. Deneuve steals the show in this film, and of course at the time of making the film Truffaut was very much in love with her. A definite must see for any filmmaker or moviefan. 10/10
