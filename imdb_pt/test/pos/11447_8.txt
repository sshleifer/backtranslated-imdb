Night of the Demons (1988) was another in a long list of "teen" horror movies that were released on video and pay-t.v. during this movie mecca in the eighties. But, unlike most of the crap that was being sold around, this was actually a decent watch. A group of bored "teens" decides to party Halloween with two bizarre sisters (Mimi Kinkade and Linnea Quigley) in the infamous Hull House. His usual cast of stereotypical teenagers is invited to the party. But an ordinary teenage bash turns into a night of terror as they try to survive on Halloween night, when residents of Hull House, undead, decide to topple the party. Who will survive this night of bloodshed and horror? <br /> <br /> A good horror movie that is best seen in the unrated version. If you watch the R-rated cut, you will lose all the effects of splatter and nudity. Stay tuned for the fun epilogue! A bloody movie that was followed by an equally fun sequel. Only for horror fans! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
