This was another great episode of South Park's 11th season. <br /> <br /> Cartman pretends to have Tourette's syndrome so he can say what he wants without getting into trouble. He is able to swear to other children in school. Kyle tells the director that Cartman is faking it. But she does not believe it. Chris Hansen is planning to have Cartman on Dateline to talk about Tourette's syndrome live and uncensored. But later, Cartman begins to get so addicted to being able to say what he wants, that later he begins to say embarrassing things accidentally. This was a funny episode about Cartman pretending to Tourette's syndrome. I recommend it to any South Park fan.
