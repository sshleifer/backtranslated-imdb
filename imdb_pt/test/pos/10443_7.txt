This movie was released when I was 15 and I could easily relate to the themes that the film portrayed. <br /> <br /> This has been for over 24 years and I have not seen the movie since. This time I cringed with part of the acting, but I still appreciate the movie for what it is. <br /> <br /> Life is not always fair and the good guys do not always win in the truth I think the film was well to reflect that, especially in adolescence, the bites always got better with many girls. Also no matter how good you are, you can not make someone like you. Girls / boys like who they want, no matter how hard you try it otherwise. Sometimes you just have to let go and say next. <br /> <br /> Gary does a good job showing the intensity of his feelings for Karen. This is so true for teenagers when they fix on someone. <br /> <br /> I remember sitting with colleagues laughing at us in some of the pranks. The acting is not much there compared to Fast Times at Ridgemount High, but it kicks ass about this movie simply because FTARH has a lame ending lame viewer where as this movie has a realistic ending. Nice guys finish last !! Gary appears as a material worthy of skepticism, but we all know such people, who are very sensitive. We all know a David, a fun guy who makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> Some people here end the finale, but hi the end is exactly what can happen in real life. Some puppies only come back for more, no matter how bad the guy treats them, especially at that age. I tried that first hand. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack too !! U2 "I will follow" - Jesus is so old like this ??
