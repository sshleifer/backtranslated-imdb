Do not Change Your Husband is, on the one hand, the beginning of a series of light marital comedies by Cecil B. DeMille. On the other hand, it's her first photo to be starring Gloria Swanson, probably the greatest actress of the silent-film era, and it's the movie that made her a star. While the old DeMille formula was beginning to change, and his films were becoming more elaborate and less purely visual, performing as expressively as Swanson, we recovered much of this style of silent narrative. Your character does very little, but transmits volumes through subtle gestures and facial expressions? with a special talent to look at with contempt. In real life, Swanson was nearing the end of his disastrous marriage to Wallace Beery, and it is possible that this fact boosted his compelling performance. <br /> <br /> As if it were the best complement to the talents of her actress, the use of DeMille framing and close-ups is particularly strong here. Does he use the cinematographic technique to show acting? often holding Swanson in long closes at key moments ?? and also to clarify the story visually. For example, when we are introduced to the character of Toodles, she is shown reflected three times in a vanity mirror. Your character disappears from the story, only to become important in the end. That first dose of attention helps us remember who she was. Later, at her birthday dinner, Swanson and her future husband, number two Lew Cody, are together in a single shot, while Elliot Dexter is isolated in her own frame. Besides that ?? and is this a sign of the growing sophistication of film in general? Is there too much use of reaction shots ?? for example, the bishop's disapproving gaze when Cody acts his intentions with the figurative wedding dolls. In contrast to DeMille's visual narrative method was the increasingly detailed screenwriting of his collaborator Jeanie Macpherson. As I have already commented in several other commentaries, Macpherson was able to muster a strong and dramatic story, but like DeMille, she used to expose her themes in a rather pretentious and extravagant way. And so we get these very long and almost philosophical title cards on the traps of conjugal life which, if they improve the story, is just because they are unintentionally funny. For example, only Jeanie Macpherson could create a phrase like "Fate sometimes hides in Christmas shopping". Fortunately, although in this photo, these titles usually introduce scenes instead of breaking them. <br /> <br /> Although the images he made at that time tend to be small-scale, it is at this point that DeMille seems to develop his taste. to the spectacular. You may see him start sneaking in apologies for a bit of razzmatazz as Swanson's little fantasy scenes being showered with "Pleasure, Wealth, and Love." It would not be until the early twenties, after the unofficial embargo on historical photos was raised that he would have the chance to go all out with the great spectacle. <br /> <br /> All in all, do not change your Husband is a decent picture of DeMille quite decent, although to be honest, it's just Gloria Swanson's presence that raises her above average. It's curious that this is supposedly a comedy, and Swanson was cast, at least in part, because of his experience at Mack Sennett's candy factory. She hated comedy acting, and here she gives a dramatic rather than a comic book performance. It makes sense, then, that the only direct drama she did with DeMille, Male and Female, was by far the strongest of her collaborations.
