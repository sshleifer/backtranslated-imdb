A beautiful, magical, thought-provoking and moving story. Excellent direction, perfect cast, wonderful script, excellent score, beautifully lit ...... need I say more? <br /> <br /> If you love movies that not only make you think but also warm your heart (some that spring in mind is 'Contact', 'Field of Dreams' and 'Groundhog Day'), then you will surely love the K-PAX. <br /> <br /> More highly recommended.
