I just saw The Big Trail at the Filmmuseum in Vienna for the first time. Immediately I was amazed by the high-quality optical images and unusual format and by its beautifully detailed story. Who has ever seen such a Western documentary with John Wayne? And a long time, you can actually look around the screen, there is so much to see! It is always grateful that the scenes are often static because every shot is so well composed and you want to catch it. Even the acting is good and fits well. The long time of the image is wonderful, you can not miss a minute!
