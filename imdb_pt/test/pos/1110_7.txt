This movie really used its locations well with some amazing, dark and disturbing photos, the movie moves very slowly but constantly keeps you watching. Modern Love performed well on the Gold Coast Fantastic Film program this year, offering the public a glimpse of an Australian cinema that is often neglected. Most importantly it is comforting to see Australian cinema not assume characters cliches and stories that we have seen dead by the end of the years. This film would complement any festival and open the debate after the exhibitions. The performances and characters are well developed, and the cinematography is fantastic. An interesting exploration of family relationships and environments.
