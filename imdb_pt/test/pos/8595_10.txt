This movie is the best movie I've seen in a long time. It is also the best film since it uses a drama to tell the story, without going to speculations like JFK, Nixon or Hoffa. He skillfully describes the clutches that Belgium had in Congo. It also easily provokes for us the European and American forces behind the power inflicted on the Congo today. The film would certainly specifically implicate the US, rightly, in the murder of Lumumba. This film could never be made in the US, because US cinema is rarely criticized in acts of imperialism and murder. (Save Stone's JFK) Also informs us about the problems that were present in the internal conflict of the Congo, between Lumumba, Mobutu and Katanga. We can see how precarious countries sit in the establishment of new governments when their history is of colonization and those who were colonizers continue to pull the strings of power and force. The film is excellently filmed with Eriq Ebouaney an excellent Lumumba. The cast is great and they really draw you to the feel of the Congo weather during that time. <br /> <br /> Again, this is a must see for those who love drama with a correct history. See my notes on Quilombo.
