I was born in Beijing, China and moved to the United States at the age of 9 years. I had lived in Beijing several times and loved it every time. One of the many things I love in Beijing is the people and the environment that they bring to the city. "You hao hao hao shuo" (which translates more accurately "if you have something to say, say good") captures in a charming and sincere way that feeling of Beijing. I suppose you would have to have lived and understood Beijing and its people to get the most out of this movie, although you can enjoy it regardless. <br /> <br /> The story is not complicated, intentionally quirky and captivating. I'll let it unfold by itself and do not tell you much except a few comments. Every detail, from the photos on the wall, to the decorations, to the streets and to the restaurants, is as if you were at home. (Zhang Yimou probably filmed everything "on the spot"). But most importantly, the characters - our "hero," the girl, the kind but unfortunate "laptop man" and the nightclub owner are both native to Beijing and adorable. in their different ways. Their conversations really capture the essence of each character. The story, mainly driven by situations and conversations (save the brilliant bafoonery near the end) is intriguing and always interesting. <br /> <br /> I'm 21 now. My parents and I love this movie. We are always so impressed with Zhang Yimou's ability to turn ordinary people into credible screen characters, and everyday life into extraordinary situations. <br /> <br /> "Keep Calm" - different. Hilarious. significant.
