This movie is really great. I do not know why. I always have a weakness for Damian Chapa. It's not Scarface, but I really enjoyed myself. This is a movie I can watch more than ten times. He really tries to make a good movie, but he just can not. I feel sorry for him, so maybe it's a vote of sympathy. I can not help but can not give less than 9 stars. Everyone should have seen this once in their life. To see how to make a cheap movie work. I live in the Netherlands and bought this movie for only a euro! That's $ 1.50. I would have bought it for ten euros, too. Great Great. On a small Dutch movie site, this movie gets 101 votes. Here's only a 260. That's not much more. So people all over the world. Buy this movie!
