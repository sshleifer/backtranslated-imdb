A poetic examination of the human condition carried out without dialogue. The anti-hero, the man builds a contraption to escape a bunch of looters, from the desert of what was once a civilization, to the ruins of the city to seek their survival. There he crosses paths with The Brute, brilliantly played by Jean Reno, from "The Professional" and "Mission Impossible". The man is rescued by an old mad genius who lives in a fortress of his own design. By using their intelligence, Man and the old genius can keep Brutus and his gang at bay, but they realize it's only a matter of time before their defenses are compromised, so they pause for it. This is a heavily underestimated tale of the desperate fight for life, with great action scenes and clever humor. Of all the films of the genre, such as "Road Warrior", "Omega Man" and even "Ultimate Warrior" (with Yul Brenner as a fighter), "Le Dernier Combat" is the best work. Copies of the video are hard to find, I'd give my eye ball one by one. If your local art house has a revival of this film, I strongly recommend that you break any compromise so you can see a great deal.
