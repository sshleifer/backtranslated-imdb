It may be a remake of the 1937 Capra movie, but it's wrong to consider it just that way! It was to expose Hilton's novel in a completely different way. As a musical is great. The setting is fantastic, the characters are good and anyone like "Leonard Maltin" who considers the music of Bacharach horrible must be completely deaf! I strongly recommend.
