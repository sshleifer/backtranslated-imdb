I liked this movie, the second Naruto movie. I liked the snow a little better, since I found the story here a bit unrelated as I was not sure where certain things should be going or when. Still, as in the first film, this also has a good run time of an hour and a half, plenty of time for a good well-developed movie with some pretty cool fights. The story begins with village ninja hidden in the sand in combat with unknown assailants. Then he sings to Naruto, Sakura and Shikumaru hunting a ferret for what they think will be an easy task. They soon find out otherwise because they are also attacked and Naruto is separated from his friends after he has a fight with a strange young warrior dressed in armor. Both are wounded and taken away by a caravan and soon after Naruto is invited to join this strange organization that wants to create a utopia. Of course, not everything is what it seems and there are many fights out there. My favorite was the one that involved Garaa fighting this strange woman who takes him very lightly, which is a big mistake. The final fight is very good too involving Naruto and this strange man who is a better villain than any other in the previous movie.
