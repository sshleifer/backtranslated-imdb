I saw this movie for the first time years ago when it was still new and I was satisfied. It's a great Hollywood story for teenagers. However, it is not realistic. As much as you want to believe, these stories never happen. That's why it's annoying watching movies like that. They play with the minds of teenagers, imagine how many girls still in school believed in this magic and were disappointed. I would not recommend this movie to my little sister or my cousin. The director should have spent some more time thinking about the plot instead of thinking about actors. Yes, they (actors) were good, but the idea is not worth it. There are a lot of teen films. So why do not we make it better?
