Mel Brooks really excelled in this movie. No one can deny that Blazing Saddles was a classic, and a breakthrough in this comedy movie style, but Men In Tights has become the pinnacle of his creative genius. This movie is a definite must-see. If you like this movie, I also recommend Space Balls and History Of The World. The reverse is true. If you've seen any of these movies, Men In Tights should be next on your list.
