I found this movie excellent. Jon Foster is one of my top favorite actors, he was perfect as Micheal Skakel. I found everything to be great, acting, costumes, production, direction, photography, screenplay and music, etc. <br /> <br /> Spoilers Coming Up! You've been warned! Martha Moxley, who told the story in the film, was beaten to death by her violent, troubled neighbor, Micheal Skakel. Micheal did this out of envy of his brother Tommy when Martha rejected him and took Tommy instead. Fortunately, they caught him years later and he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for life. Although, I think he should have been condemned to "natural life" without the possibility of parole. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the cast, crew and filmmakers. Two thumbs up.
