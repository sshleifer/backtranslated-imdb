Simply delightful feature of Nick Park's claymation and spoofing company as big names as "King Kong" and "The Wolf Man" has Wallace and Gromit as rabbit security, encountering difficulties solving a major problem in his village .. a giant rabbit stands feasting prodigally in the greenery of the citizens! What makes this even worse is that the big vegetable festival is about to begin and the citizens have all prepared themselves obediently to win the ultimate prize. What makes the situation even worse is that Wallace is the reason behind all the hustle and bustle of eating vegetables. He was testing a new invention about taking his brainwaves in an attempt to wash away brains caught in vegetables he did not like. What happens is catastrophic as some kind of hybrid rabbit is bred in the process ... and has more to do with Wallace than he could ever imagine. It will depend on your loyal (... and surprisingly clever) and quick thinking Gromit dog to save the day. <br /> <br /> This is a clever and imaginative effort by the team behind other Oscar winning claymation features starring Wallace and Gromit. Seeing the well-made ole-fashioned claymation is refreshing considering the CGI boom that has characterized fairly lackluster fare here recently as the industry spits out increasingly mediocre product. Here we have a complete feature with witty humor and some acrobatics with wonderful animations, not to mention the visual jokes.
