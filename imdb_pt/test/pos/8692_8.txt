Despite his age, this film retains its undeniable charm and appeal and is a good surviving example of old British cinema. It has an underlying air of eeriness, interspersed with mood swings that are not out of place and serve to demonstrate the assured direction and production values ​​involved. So many episodic type films are disjointed and messy, but this is not one of them. The pattern of acting helps a lot, and the various disparate characters seem interesting and believable. All in all, this little gem long forgotten is well worth the attention of anyone, despite the dissonant note in the film that, surprisingly, escaped the attention of the censor!
