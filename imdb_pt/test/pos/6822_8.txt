There have been many people who tried to make a movie that was identical to the story, Heart of Darkness. Some films were based on Heart of Darkness, like Apocalypse Now. In 1993, Nicholas Roeg directed a film that was exactly like the book. Heart of Darkness, the film is almost exactly the same as the book. This movie is full of action and adventure. Heart of Darkness is about the journey of a sailor named Marlow who sails along the Congo River to meet the super powerful ivory trader, Kurz. <br /> <br /> The Heart of Darkness, the movie, has the same exact beginning. and defining how the book. It happens on a boat on the River Thames, and Marlow is telling the story to four other men on a boat called Nellie. The whole movie is a flashback of Marlow's journey to see Mr. Kurtz on the Congo River. Marlow works for the Belgian company, which markets ivory along the Congo River. He tells about his account at the company's office and about all the maps he saw in his office. <br /> <br /> Marlow goes out on a ship to Africa. He arrives at Central Station, where he receives orders from the general manager. The general manager tells Marlow about Mr. Kurtz and the ivory trade Marlow would be making. Marlow soon discovers that the general manager does not like Kurtz because he fears Kurtz will replace him. Marlow waits at Central Station for months because his ship has been destroyed and is being repaired. Marlow sees the harsh treatment and enslavement in Africa while at Central Station. When the ship was finally repaired, Marlow, another African character named Mfumu, and other crew members boarded the Marlow steamer for Kurtz. <br /> <br /> Along the Congo River, they are attacked by African natives in the desert. As Marlow's crew is attacked by the African natives, they end up firing and killing Mfumu. When Marlow finally arrives at the station of Kurtz, he knows a Russian that explains the power and the glory of Kurtz. Marlow is then taken to the Kurtz station at home. There, he sees many maps and photos that Kurtz painted. Finally, Kurtz enters the room and begins to tell Marlow everything he has done in Africa and talks about his lover. Marlow soon discovers that Kurtz is insane with power because Africans call him god. Marlow is annoyed by the harshness and slavery he sees in Africa. After Marlow finally meets Kurtz, Kurtz begins to die. While Kurtz was on his deathbed, he called Marlow in his room. Kurtz's life begins to shine before his eyes and his last words were "The horror, the horror". When Marlow returns to Europe to see Kurtz's fianc√©, Marlow tells her that Kurtz's last words were her name to hide the darkness of Kurtz's life. Heart of Darkness was well directed and turned into an adventure film. I recommend anyone to watch this movie because it is full of action and mystery. The movie is slow at times, but it's really interesting. Heart of Darkness will really broaden your mind and will teach you a lot about how to interpret different scenes.
