Dekalog 5 can be considered a violent charge against the death sentence, according to the fifth commandment "Thou shalt not kill": it does not happen by chance, it puts the concept of a State fully in accordance with the provisions of an unjust law in the same plane that the figure of a murderer. "But the law may not imitate nature, you can correct it," says Piotr, the defense lawyer, a true catalyst character, "punishment is a form of revenge aimed at returning evil to evil without impeding crime. in the name of whom the law takes revenge? Really in the name of the innocent? "The horrifying and detailed sequences of the last half-hour of a man sentenced to death value the futility of the deterrent function applied to the death penalty in order to intimidate all the potential criminals. "Desperate dangers do not require desperate remedies," says Kieslowski in his message, teaching us how unjust can be the act of disobedience to a God commandment that judges punishment in the same way that the crime is tried. There are three different moral attitudes here: the Killer's innate sense of rebellion in order to awaken the hostile torpor of the environment; the strong sense of chronic indifference of the VICTIM inclined to laugh at the demands of other people; the worthy behavior of the COUNCIL FOR DEFENSE always ready to fight adversity in favor of human life. The struggle for life is relentlessly vivisection all the time; the characters plunge into scenes of distress and distress, in an urban landscape accented with greenish tones and seen in their own reflections through the windshield of a taxi. Everything in "Dekalog 5" conveys a terrible sense of estrangement and isolation: descriptions of a waste of violence and madness, scenes of poor working conditions, sinister apparitions of buildings immersed in an anonymous aura of desolation, aimless wanderings through disenchanting environments. Jazek, the main character, is forced to fight with an opponent stronger than he: a city completely shrouded in deep indifference, seemingly hostile, deaf to all his silent requests for help, while a faded picture of a girl in a first Communion dress continues to bite your soul. He is hopelessly directing his steps toward a disconnected route to the damnation seen through the 18 mm deformations. wide-angle lens with the purpose of distorting all details, changing reality, making it disappear in remote and strange echoes. Kieslowski does not have extenuating circumstances tempered with melodramas of honey in favor of the defendant, unlike some Hollywood stereotypes like "I want to live" (of Robert Wise). He does not slip into the banana peel of useless pathetic scenes in order to alleviate Jazek's guilt and mitigate the brutality of the crime by not focusing on near-psychological motivations to justify any display of extreme or violent behavior and refusing to include any useless legal charges . process. In other words, according to Kieslowsky, "a crime is always a crime": according to the principle of "par condicio" he places the prosecutor on the same plane as the condemned, using many signs or symbols to represent a society seen in the light more sinister. And we can not remain indifferent: even if we do not agree with it, Jazek's cries of anguish touch our hearts with pity in the same way that Terri Schiavo's eyes do.
