I own a copy of this movie and have always loved it. I comment here, however, because I saw the PBS presentation of a concert version of Sweeney Todd earlier this week. This production was made by the San Francisco Opera and starred George Hearn and Patti LuPone. In the early 1980s, Hearn replaced Len Cariou as Sweeney (Cariou won Tony for his performance). I saw Hearn and Angela Lansbury (who also won Tony for his performance as Mrs. Lovett) performing Sweeney on Broadway. They must have made the film around the time I saw the show. To this day, the most moving moment I can remember in theater came when Hearn sang "These are my Friends." ("These are my friends, see how they shine." "My arm is full again!") Hearn's performance in the San Francisco Opera production convinced me that he lost nothing in almost twenty years. since the first time I saw him do the play on Broadway and then in the movie. What a talent! He is nice, funny and scary - all at once; and he can sing, boy he can sing. All of this reminded me of how wonderful the movie is. Highly recommended. Ten out of ten.
