This movie is not what it seems to be. Clint Eastwood is not Dirty Harry or a "cowboy" here. The appeal of the film comes from its careful manipulation of the atmosphere and theme. It is a gothic tale set in the Civil War and as such, the whole "action" of the film, or lack thereof, takes place inside a house inhabited by Southern Bellas of all ages and forms. <br /> <br /> The horror comes from seeing the whole story through the eyes of the character of Clint Eastwood. Seeing him trapped in the house and held captive by women is a very "seductive" experience. And who is "deceived" here exactly? Are women seduced by the incredible looks of Eastwood? Are we spectators attracted both by their sexual fascination and by the potential deviant sexualities it triggers? Or "seduced" refers to what the director does here - fascinates us with a short space just to (perhaps) let us go? Don Siegel does all the above in one of the most memorable and disturbing films I've had the pleasure of watching.
