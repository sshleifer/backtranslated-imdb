I saw this emotionally painful portrait and it was fascinating. The conflict between Williams' public and private faces and the pressure he underwent is illuminated in a way that even those who knew something about him would be surprised. The cast acted superbly, but Michael Sheen was excellent. I just realized it was him when I saw the previous review. He seems completely physically different in this role, from any other role I have seen in him or himself. Williams' autobiography differs markedly from his diaries, as depicted in this film. The film is sometimes harrowing to watch, because of the emotional anguish displayed. However, it is a worthwhile experience and a movie that can be highly recommended.
