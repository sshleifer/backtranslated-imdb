I absolutely, positively loved the movie. I just saw and can not wait to go on DVD. It is a beautifully designed masterpiece. I am always impressed by the intricate work of the Ghibli studios. <br /> <br /> Others commented on Sosuke calling Risa by her first name. He never calls his father by his first name unless he's talking about it to someone else. I did not have the impression that Risa was his mother. Never been mentioned or implicated by anyone. It's obvious she's your stepmother. That's why he makes her promise to come home and why she gets so upset when she finds her car empty. His mother must have died when he was a baby because he mentions being breastfed by Risa. This along with the fact that his father is at sea is why he has problems of abandonment. Everyone also talks about how mature he is. This usually occurs when a child loses a parent.
