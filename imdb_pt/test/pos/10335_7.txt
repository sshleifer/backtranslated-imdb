"My German soldier's summer" was one of the many TV movies that became a small-screen clip in the 1970s (others were "Brian's Song," "Sybil" and "Someone's Watching Me!"). He portrays a Jewish girl (Kristy McNichol) making friends with a German prisoner of war (Bruce Davison) in World War II-era Georgia. One of the things the film shows is that many of the German soldiers were not really Nazis but were only recruited. Watching the movie, I have a real sense of how things must have been in the South of that era; I mean, can you imagine being a Jewish person accused of supporting the enemy? <br /> <br /> So, I certainly recommend this movie. I believe it's always important to show the things pictured here. Occasionally, overactivity prevents the film from being a full-scale masterpiece, but it usually works very well. I hope the movie goes out on DVD. Also starring Esther Rolle and Michael Constantine (the patriarch "My Big Fat Greek Wedding").
