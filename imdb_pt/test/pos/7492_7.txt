When I watched this movie I had no idea what it was, and I had never heard of it before. But I must say I was positively surprised. The first few minutes are almost the funniest of the entire movie. The clerk in India is very funny! Anyway, the story is not much to talk about, but I think it's okay. The acting, on the other hand, is very good, and yet the only actor I recognized was Mickey Rourke, who was not really in the movie until the end. And the end is where the turn-off is, I guess, not bad, but I do not feel like it really ends. I feel it should have been something more. A final battle somehow. I do not know. All in all, this was a good movie and I recommend it to everyone in Tarantino-type movies with a lot of violence and dark and sinister humor! I value 7/10.
