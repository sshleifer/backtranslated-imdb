What some confuse with blatant dialogue and / or discarding as archetypal characterizations accurately represents the way people spoke, lived and lived before World War II, let alone at any time when "The Big Trail" plays in the movies. <br /> <br /> The movie took my breath away the first time I saw it years ago. Reading the boards here helped me understand why they lost at the box office and why movie goers took the benefit of Wayne at B Westerns for another ten years. Wayne was, in my opinion, better on "The Big Trail" and Bs years than most of his stars after 1939 with Ford's incredible trilogy of "True Grit" and "The Shootist" being major exceptions . <br /> <br /> What theaters of shame lost the boat in 1930. If the film had been released, we could have enjoyed more movies with more realism and less hokum. In my opinion, this is not just one of the best Westerns ever filmed with accurate dialogues and accurate character-building, but among the best representations of a passage of any kind that has ever been released in the movies. <br /> <br /> take your breath away. Especially the dialogue and precise characterizations of types that simply do not exist anymore. Some celebrate the superficial homogenization of our culture which, in fact, hides the greatest cultural degradation (in "people like us" and "people like them") and political divisions (corporativists vs. major streetists) in US history, but to me "represents a time when our superficial differences were more obvious, but beneath them most people wanted to solve the failures of the nation and most people aspired to build a great culture and a great nation." The Big Trail "is an epic of the cauldron moving toward the American Dream. Certainly the best film of this path I've ever seen, this subject has already been filmed.
