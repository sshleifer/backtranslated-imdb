This movie is surprisingly good. The ninja fight sequences were unbelievable. I have not seen all the films of Sho Kosugi, but this is probably the best of those I've seen. Probably the most impressive fighting sequence was in the beginning, when ninjas killed about 20 people, this was one of the most impressive ninja fight sequences I've ever seen. Another good fighting sequence was at a police funeral, where the ninjas provide more people to bury. The last fight was also very impressive. I also liked the soundtrack of this movie. The story was good enough for a ninja movie, actually it was kind of different from other ninja movies. So, if you're a fan of ninja movies, you'll probably like this one.
