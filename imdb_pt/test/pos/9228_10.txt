I found this movie in one of my old videos, after "Godzilla vs the Sea Monster" (which should give you an idea of ​​the tone instantly) and I had not seen it for some time, so I decided to watch it. I did not remember much about Rainbow Brite except that I liked the cartoon and it was cute. Most people feel that way about her. You probably do. <br /> <br /> Well, when the movie started, I wondered if it was right! It did not fit the Rainbow Brite mold when I remembered it. But it turns out she kicks ass! This has to be the weirdest animation ever! I can not believe these characters were so popular (the series is not much different) being so bizarre. As soon as I watched this movie again, it became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> I really do not want to give too much. I just know that if you see the movie in the store, rent it and watch it. No questions asked. You'll have fun with it. Especially the scandalous character of the princess. And the robotic horse. And the hypnotized sprites. <br /> <br /> If you can not tell, this is an 80's cartoon that is really an undiscovered "head" movie in disguise! Have fun!
