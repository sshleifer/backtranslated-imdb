THE ASCENT (1976) by Larisa Shepitko is an extraordinary and exhaustive account of the Nazi supporters' struggle in German-occupied Belarus. The Ascension reflects Russian obsession with the horrors of the Great Patriotic War, but it is steeped in religious symbolism and ready to acknowledge the existence of less than great Russian collaborator. The real battle is not with the Nazis, who hover in the background as mere extras, but between the Russian Nazi investigator and Sotnikov, the captured partisan who finds the spiritual strength to go unbeaten to death. With its many references to the Crucifixion, history takes on heroic proportions glorifying the sufferings of the martyr and its influence on future generations. A remarkable work.
