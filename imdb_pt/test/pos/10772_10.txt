When it comes to movies, I do not easily distinguish between crap, sheer crap and masterpieces. I believe this film is an absolute masterpiece and it's hard to keep me entertained for over 90 minutes. This movie ran slower than the Mystic River and Harry Potter 3 combined and I still managed to get riveted to my place. For me, it was the passion that Eric Bogosian put into his performance. It is extremely difficult to do such a trick and achieve some positive effect. Bogosian probably preached one of the hardest performances of a man in modern cinema. I have no respect for Bogosian until the end of the movie. All the monologue minutes before the inexorable climax was the turning point, it was the key that made me spin. This man reached such a low point that he knew he could never recover from it. The corporate lads congratulated him on his performance. His exhilarating prose made even the leanest of the ride shake his head in admiration. This made me realize that personal integrity and hypocrisy do not matter in the radio world, even in the corporate world. Stone may be pushing some super-liberal agenda, but it was the film and the production that caught my eye. Oliver Stone is a minor moody master. The final third of the film probably had the best lighting and cinematography I've seen in any movie. Stone artistically makes the DJ booth look like a five by seven cell in a 19th century prison. Visually speaking, it seems Bogosian's only friend is the black foam that absorbs his routine vitriol. He speaks and does not speak back. It is a sad metaphor considering the way he treats the people who gave him his success. Stone and Bogosian recorded an impressive film of a man who is trapped in a prison of walls and a prison of himself. This man is confined to his own will and he can never escape it. The scene that made me realize his riddle was when he was not willing his ex-wife back. He preferred his own prison instead of the outside world. Every story has a conflict and reached the simplest of all conflicts: the man against himself. 'Talk Radio' presents this conflict in an intelligent, exciting and artistic way. There are no hidden messages in this movie and the progression of events should be expected by any astute viewer. I just leaned back and let my mind be understood by this movie and I loved it. It is not disclosed, it is invisible and it will never receive due recognition. Let's hope this continues because the gems deserve to be found and then hidden again. It's a gem, because I found it in the discounted DVD drawer at my local Wal-Mart store. For $ 5.50, it was worth the half hour that I spent trying to find. I did and I got more than the value of my money. This is one of the best movies of all time and it's worth just ten reasons. Ten reasons give ten points. <br /> <br /> Here ends my speech!
