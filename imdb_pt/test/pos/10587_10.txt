I was hoping to see this movie for so long and finally I arrived yesterday. In summary, I'm glad I finally did. The humor is off the hilarious wall. The plot is so incredibly believable that it has to have at least some truth to it. If something stood out in this movie, it's definitely the coffee scene. I've been there every single time. You're dumped. You find out that your ex was mistaken for a guy you're sure to be an idiot. Now, every time you see something in the next few days, you will have horrible thoughts about it in all the wrong areas. She's fucking everyone and everyone knows that. I could probably see that man licking and strumming his wallet all day and looking at myself and laughing for being there too.
