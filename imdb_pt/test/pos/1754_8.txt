What I liked the most in this animated feature film of 1941 is the great feeling it gives to the early 1940s. It's the songs, the clothes, the cars, the jargon of the day's buildings, etc. You feel like you've gone back in time. <br /> <br /> From reading some of the reviews here, I see that this was difficult. -luck film, being released a couple of days before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Wow, no one would be interested in going to the movies for a cartoon during those hectic and shocking days, I'm sure. Too bad, because people missed a good animation would have really impressed at the time, nearly 70 years ago. The colors are nice, the designs are good and the story involves how we hoped for the bugs led by "Hoppity" and her cute "Honey" girl to make him happy forever and out of danger. It is also about all of them finding a grassy spot that they can live on and not worry about humans trampling them. <br /> <br /> But there is a nasty villain - "C. Bagley Beetle" - and two of his henchmen. These helpers ("Swat, The Fly" and "Smack, the Mosquito") are comedians, complete with their Brooklyn-ese accents! The story is familiar, in which a nasty old man wants to marry a sweet young woman and uses unscrupulous means to force her hand. The good guy, meanwhile, has the ornament stacked against him, but in the end, of course, prevails. <br /> <br /> My favorite part - this will sound worse than it was - was when a cool guy "Hoppity" was temporarily electrocuted and danced in black and white. That was fantastic animation! <br /> <br /> You know, it's a good thing I do not see it as a very small child; I would have been scared to play outside and smash all those nice people! You never know what (or who) is in this grass under your feet!
