This was unusual: a modern movie that was ultra-cool. In fact, it was so good that it was hard to believe in parts. As I watched this story based on real life, I was thinking, "No one is so good, so tolerant." Mostly, I was referring to the role of Ed Harris as "Coach Jones". I think they were a little overdone on their character, but this is better than the opposite: showing him worse than he was in real life. Strange to see Harris playing the role as well, since he has a long resume of playing unpleasant and profane characters. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I never complain about a good and good movie, and it's cool to see a lot of good, well-meaning people. These people direct their friendship, love, and compassion to "James Kennedy," better known as "Radio," a mentally slow high school kid played by Cuba Gooding Jr. The story is set in the mid-1970s in South Carolina. does a good job with paper as well. However, as Sean Penn's role of a mentally challenged man in "I Am Sam," an hour and a half of such a character is enough. After that, the volume of these guys gets tiresome to hear. <br /> <br /> Note: It was interesting in one of the documentaries of this DVD to discover that in real life it took years for "Radio" to make its transformation, not months as shown in the film.
