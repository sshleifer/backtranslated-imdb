I saw the movie at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (world premiere). <br /> <br /> An intimate and solitary portrait of Solitude, and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something darker. <br /> <br /> The acting of the two protagonists (Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage) is excellent, and makes a wish that you knew these characters before they became so damaged. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of the works of Atom Egoyan (Exotica) and Raymond Carver (where I'm calling from). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette, Toes Torto) is excellent and reinforces the moments of the film without drawing attention to itself. <BR> <BR> I recommend the movie and the soundtrack.
