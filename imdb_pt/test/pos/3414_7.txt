A warmly sentimental tale by The Waltons author. If someone brought the material for me, I would probably reject it as too corny. But the dramatization runs a tear here without the expected embarrassment. No one in the fifties was better at hay peanut than Arthur Hunnicutt. His appeal here is consummate as a mountain man stubbornly loyal to a loyal hunting dog. Their destinies are linked as inseparably as any human bond. Good. I see a subtle environmental message here. All creatures go to heaven, because how can we condemn any poor devil who simply follows the instinct to stay alive. There is no mistake in the realm of animals, and yet with what cruelty we treat them often. An eerily satisfying episode that confirms this important message.
