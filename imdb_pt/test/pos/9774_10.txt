This would have to be by far the biggest show I've ever seen. I watched vividly every Sunday night and bought the box set as soon as it was available. This is a timeless piece written by a fantastic Australian with which people of all ages can relate, whether Australian or not, however, for those of us who are Australian, it does indeed bear the typical Australian icon. A must see 10/10
