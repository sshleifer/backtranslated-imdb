Susie Q is a great romantic graduation film. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great actress. I think she did a great job. I hope that at some point Disney can put this movie on DVD. I think it's cool and a bit hilarious. It's kind of sad when Susie Q dies in a car accident early on in the beginning makes you want to cry or sob. But in the middle, when no one suspects Susie Q, it's kind of funny and surprising. There is a bit of mystery in this movie, but not much. But I still recommend this movie to the whole family if they like comedy, mystery or romance movies. It's great! I think Amy Jo Johnson as Susie Q is cute.
