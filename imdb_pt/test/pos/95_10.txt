Animated shorts simply do not get much better than this wonderful Canadian movie. This little feature is replete with Canadian references and therefore this movie will probably be appreciated by Canadians, above all else. But the basic story is universal, and is told with love by the writer Roch Carrier. It's a hilarious story I've known for a long time, and recently I was lucky enough to see her again, so I simply HAD to write a warm recommendation to her. This is a masterpiece, and one must see if you are Canadian or not.
