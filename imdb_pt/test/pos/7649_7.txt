Not having heard of this movie, it was a surprise when it was shown on Cable recently. Gary Ellis, the talented director of "Tough Luck," does wonders with the play written by Bill Boatman and Todd King. The film engages the viewer from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Archie, the young crook at the center of this story, has been involved in all sorts of petty crimes. In fact, we witness a confrontation in the beginning that makes him leave New Orleans as fast as he can. It ends at the carnival that is directed by the mysterious Ike. Archie falls in love with Davina, the woman he should have been wise to stay away from. The result proves a fatal trial for Archie, who then becomes the object of double crossing around. <br /> <br /> The director should be praised by the cast of Norman Reedus, who is obviously loved by the camera. In spite of his nature, feel for him because we know that his heart is in the right place. The beautiful Dagmara Dominczyk is perfect as the exotic Divana dancer who, despite being Ike's lover, instigates Archie to fall headlong with her. Armand Assante is hardly understandable with the strong accent he speaks during the first half of the film. "Tough Luck" shows a new director, Gary Ellis, showing that he will do bigger and better things because he knows what he is doing.
