I could not disagree more with those who say this is a bad movie. Me and my friend went to see him during the Stockholm Film Festival and this was actually one of my favorite movies during the festival. Dolls being used in horror movies are not something new, but I have not seen that many movies have been as well executed as in this movie. The atmosphere, the scenery, the actors, the camera work ... everything is just beautiful. And they really work well with each other. Now, if you expect this movie to be another Grudge or Ring, you probably will not like it. But if you're out for a good stylized fright, then it's perfect. Even though it is quite predictable and sometimes laughable I still recommend this to anyone who likes horror movies. Go see that. Now.
