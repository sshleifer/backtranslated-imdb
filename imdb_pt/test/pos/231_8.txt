The most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors, the sense of camaraderie in their dialogues and dances. This typical ascension musical has an overwhelming plot, even for 1944, but because of the actors it is still fun to watch. Hayworth is not much of a dancer, but she has a lot of "inexperienced" charm that fits into her character. Kelly plays her usual authoritative role, while Silvers provides a lot of self-deprecation and laughter. The movie can also be very serious at times. No need to see, but recommended if you like the actors.
