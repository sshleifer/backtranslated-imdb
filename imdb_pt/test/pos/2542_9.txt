Gray can make the English language jump through hoops like no other. He reports a series of events, linked by his writing a manuscript (the "Monster" title), some sad, some incredibly funny, all in their characteristic and sarcastic way. If you liked "Swimming for Cambodia" you will love this. I really thought this was a little more interesting and better than "Swimming for Cambodia". A true work of art.
