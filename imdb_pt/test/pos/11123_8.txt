We like a movie like "Fame" because we imagine we are there - students of music, dance and theater, enjoying our self-expression. This movie had humor, entertainment and should be an inspiration for young people to have fun in the performing arts. Bravo "Fame". Certainly worth 8 out of 10! <br /> Chris
