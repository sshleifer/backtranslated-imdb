I think this was the most prominent thriller I've seen in a long time. The search for the film was complete, the writer Kelly Sane did not leave any loose end. The cast was experienced (fantastic performances throughout the game). Omar Metwally was excellent. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is poetic, enchanting music and general effect highly satisfying. <br /> <br /> Surrender enters a territory that even the media fears to tread. It's really a warning to those involved in spying and the cool web that is the "War on Terror". <br /> <br /> A woman left the theater and asked me "does this really happen"? That in itself speaks of Gavin Hood's masterful achievement.
