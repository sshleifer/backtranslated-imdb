I have not read Anne Rice's novel on which this film was based, but who knows how to read the book is cheaper than renting QUEEN OF THE DAMNED and is probably better for your health. It's not that this movie is necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very relaxing and certainly carries the active part of your brain more than this movie. You can count the number of Anne Rice pages I read in one hand, but after seeing this movie and Interview with a Vampire, I get the impression that she writes really good novels. The plots for both films suggest a whole sea of ​​deep, intertwined vampire stories. Even so, Stuart Townsend's narration is far more annoying than Brad Pitt's vampire narrative ever did, and you might say that the limited production capabilities of QUEEN OF THE DAMNED barely give enough meat to the plot of Anne Rice. While the interview has decided to go with lace and elegance, QUEEN relies on low-budget special effects that strive hard to be taken seriously. One can see that the original novel had potential as a film and that the production team focused its attention on the wrong places. The costumes and the rock and roll stage could have been replaced by more blood and a stranger soundtrack. <br /> <br /> However, I will give credit where credit is due. The soundtrack is great. Korn and Disturbed shook me with the disease shaking my position as Butthead. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a really cool mount of zoom and Goth-rock splitter, but after the first ten minutes, the direction degenerates. quickly. It's as if the film was so long that the director realized that there was not enough time and money to make a Anne Rice novel. What results are some mediocre vampire scenes and many cheesy special effects. Unfortunately, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED does not do justice to the genre, just as his John Carpenter colleagues can not impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where's the light blue makeup? Scene after scene, I shook my head reminiscing the days of Salem's Lot and Fright Night when the low budget was done correctly. <br /> <br /> There are redeeming qualities that save this movie from being junk. Props to Aaliyah, and may his soul rest forever in peace. She could have become a renowned actress if her life had not been taken from us so prematurely because she gave this film a decent performance with a lot of belly dancing. Did I mention that the soundtrack was good? Let's see, what else can I say? Did not take too long. Anne Rice's novel could easily have been a three-hour film if an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola laid hands on him. There are some twists and turns here and there in the plot. But, after all, it was a legitimate rock-and-roll addition to the sheer number of second-rate vampire films out there. The director of this film went on to direct a new Battlestar Galactica miniseries if that told him anything. <br /> <br /> Jimboduck-dot-com
