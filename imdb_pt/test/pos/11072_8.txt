I lived in that area (Hoboken and Jersey City) for about ten years. This film certainly captures the feel of that time and place. The dialogue is very good, the music is right and realistic scenarios. As another poster said, it looks almost like a documentary. <br /> <br /> I like the way it humanizes these children, who probably would have been born in Westchester, but would fall into what children fall into. Turns out the area is very rude. <br /> <br /> They exaggerate the demonization of the police, but this is to be expected. I'd say the acting is good too. <br /> <br /> It gives the viewer an idea of ​​how this idiocy is caused and becomes out of proportion. I hope the new mayor of Newark is making progress.
