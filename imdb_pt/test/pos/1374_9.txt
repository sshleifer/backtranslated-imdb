Got it on the other day of the creators on DVD. I saw this advertised in a free magazine while the family was stopping at a hotel, had never heard anything about it. After reading it was filmed on Balmedie beach I just had to buy it. I used to take the kids to the dunes in the movie all the time while living in Aberdeen. <br /> <br /> First, I'm not a big fan of science fiction (which appears Star Wars) I was really wanting to see what they had done with the location of the movie, I was surprised. This did not become a standard Sci-Fi, more like a mixture of science fiction and survival horror. <br /> <br /> He had a good plot, which was different, had great special effects for the budget. which was produced with Â£ 8,000. Acting was better than average for a low budget movie. The way they edited the entire coastline to make it look like the dry desert planet on which they stand was fine. <br /> <br /> The guns in the movie were realistic and the creatures were cool as a predator in the invisibe mode. <br /> <br /> After all, I'll buy any future releases from these guys, maybe a horror to follow (Hint Hint). The extras on the DVD were very informative on the background for the producers, I would like to see some of them as extras on an upcoming DVD release. <br /> <br /> Great job, keep it up
