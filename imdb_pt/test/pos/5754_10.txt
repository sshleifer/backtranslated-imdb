I own this movie on DVD and watched about 10 times and it's still funny. The jokes will never get boring and I often burst into laughter at inappropriate moments just thinking about them. The premise is that Richard and Eddie's Bottom fame own the cheapest hotel in Britain next to a nuclear power plant. They are desperately in need of money and when a movie star hiding comes to stay the luck of them could be in <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and not get completely bored or angry you first need to like the mood. Some would say that only hardcore fans really enjoy watching it. But overall it's a great movie.
