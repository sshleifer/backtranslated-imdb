A look at three geishas that have already passed its peak. Now they look back on their past with care and mourn their gift. Kin (played by Haruko Sugimura, from the Weeds Floating group), swears the men and made a good living as a moneylender; everyone on the block owes it. The other two, Nobu and Tamae, would like to be able to land husbands, but they are not foolish enough to believe they will never succeed. Meanwhile, her children - one has a son and a daughter - are about to get married (not one with the other). Tamae is annoyed at how much more beautiful her daughter has become than with her, and bitterly tries to persuade her not to marry the man. Nobu's concerns about his son are more legitimate by nature, but they are also (understandably) selfish. After her son leaves, she'll be alone. A little bit in the movie, two former Kin clients have been looking for her, a man so obsessed with her that she tried to make her commit double suicide with him, the other of her most handsome clients. Unfortunately, it comes to her money, not her love. The way I described the film makes it look ruthlessly depressing, but it really is not. Sad, but not fatally. It is more bittersweet. Unfortunately, I only marginally enjoyed the late chrysanthemums. The story looks better when I look back, but it's very slow and bland. I actually nodded twice during the movie, and I was not tired before I started. This is the kind of movie that I can enjoy more than I like; this reminds me a lot of my reaction to some of Ozu's most famous films. 7/10
