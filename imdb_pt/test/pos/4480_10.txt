Honore De Balzac's genuinely bizarre tale, on which it was loosely based, receives a disturbing, though breathtaking, treatment here as a kind of forbidden love that flourishes over a period between man and beast at the beginning of the XIX century. The English actor Thin and very blond Ben Daniels plays the part of a young soldier during the Napoleonic wars that are lost while escorting an exiled French painter (?) Through the steep and dangerous landscapes of the Gobi Desert. After literally turning circles, the two men give up trying to reach civilization again, so each one decides (against the better judgment you) to follow separate paths with the promise of both returning to the same exact point when and if a source of water is actually found. Of course, this is how the character of Daniels finds the creature (a savage and wild leopard) and eventually forms a seemingly unbreakable bond, or rather love, with which both save his life and almost destroy it at the end of the film . The exquisite cinematography, the minimalist dialogue, the somewhat demented story that unquestionably suggests the possible bestiality in about three scenes, are what lead professional critics to view the film as pretentious and excessively long litter. Although it's a film that is not exactly to everyone's taste, I think it's a subtle yet decidedly center-left fantasy mix with a surreal and sumptuous atmosphere, enhanced by the fact that by more than half the actor Ben Daniels is forced to stand in front of a wild animal (four leopards were used in opposition to one), that common sense and a light theatrical knowledge dictate that it must have been a maddening and very difficult work. which he managed to draw very brightly if you ask me! Overall, I think "Passion in the Desert" takes a while to warm up, but if you are a patient person who is willing to give some time, actually cast your unique and original spell on you, after all ; and unlike most platonic human-animal relationship stories, he need not require a pig, a monkey or a furry dog ​​to keep his interest everywhere.
