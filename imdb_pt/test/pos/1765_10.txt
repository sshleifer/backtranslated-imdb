In this 34-second short, produced by Thomas Edison, we see Annabelle Moore playing "Serpentine Dance", choreographed by Loie Fuller, in two fantastic and fluid robes. <br /> <br /> Moore was one of the biggest stars in the world. the end of the Victorian era. She appeared in several short films of the Edison Company, including this one, which was among the first Kinetoscope films shown in London in 1894. <br /> <br /> Loie Fuller had actually patented the Serpentine Dance, which Moore plays here in robes as well as whole paintings) that are often hand-painted in the film, foreshadowing one of the most common symbolic devices of the silent era. Supposedly, Moore's films were popular enough to have to be redone frequently (including rework). The version available to us now may be a later version / remake. Moore became even more popular when it was said that she would appear naked at a private party at a restaurant in New York. She later starred as the "Gibson Bathing Girl" at the Ziegfeld Follies in 1907. She appeared there until 1912. <br /> <br /> The short is notable for its moving frame, which, especially during the "second half ", becomes almost abstract. In a way it resembles a Morris Louis painting, although that is almost 60 years before Louis's relevant work. <br /> <br /> You should be able to find this short on DVD in several anthologies of old movies.
