Reality before the reality show? Copy of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"? A forerunner of "Say Anything" that is sharper? I can not decide, but the soundtrack * is * 80s - Blondie, Journey, REO Speedwagon, Devo, Lionel Richie, and U2 - I can not believe it, they would never play all these genres together in a teenage movie today . <br /> <br /> I remembered this as a teenager-especially the sex parts and not a hint of altruism. Because? Watching again, I just can not describe how much I love this Rose, played by Kimberly Richardson, who became the voice of "Pepper Ann" in the 90's, and she was almost 30 years old when he was on Last American Virgin, playing alongside 16 year olds - fantastic! Full cheese, reality, fantasy and comedy - with a sincere cherry on top.
