Although the video box for many copies of this film claims that it is about people turning inside out, this is a total lie. In fact, in addition to the opening segment, the film is not even a horror movie. With its sunken treasure, legions of fish people and crazy scientists, it's much more like an adventure movie than Doug McClure. Obviously, this movie is not a work of art, but it's fun to watch ... Just be warned the beginning is pretty bloody.
