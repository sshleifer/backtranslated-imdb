And a perfect movie to watch during the holiday season, as the winter / Christmas atmosphere that Burton creates for Gotham City is pretty cool. It's strange that Warner decided to release it as a summer movie. Does not fit. <br /> <br /> But what's even stranger, when you consider the content of this movie, is that it was family-oriented. A high-class family throws their mutant baby through the sewer, a socio-phobic billionaire dressed in leather like a flying rodent, a solitary secretary dresses in leather like a feline, and an aberration rushes to a political post. And S & M and bondage are presented in a very perverted way. But Burton left. Your visual style in this movie is the best. <br /> <br /> This and Batman: Dead End are the only live-action incarnations in the comic book. It's true that the animated series was the closest to the original material, but compared to the Batman Forever and non-nomenciable after that, Batman Returns is the best of the four. Darker and more violent than the original. first film, the feeling of gothic pathos reaches a new record. I really liked Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne (or tell me about George Clooney!), He showed the right balance of a lone weirdo and a cool crime fighter. Michelle Pfieffer is great as Catwoman (much sexier and more realistic), she wears these leather clothes better than Halle Berry. And Danny DeVito was as convincing as the penguin that his scenes were disturbing to watch. And Christopher Walken is brilliant as the scary Max Shreck (if you think he recognizes Chip Shrek, is none other than a very young Leatherface / Butterfinger). <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman's score is also even better than the first time. return. His powerful and engaging themes are far better than the scum that followed in the last two Schumacher films. This movie is the Batman phenomenon in his Zenith. Forget the following sequences and follow the animated series after that. Let's hope Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale bring some integrity to Batman's live action with his movie next year. <br /> <br /> This DVD was one of the first DVDs released by Warner (almost 7 years ago! !!) and as a result, there are no features and the case is a snapper. Get it cheap like I did and hope for an SE in the future.
