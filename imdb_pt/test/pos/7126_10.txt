I was laughing so hard that most of the time I had people staring at me because they could not hear my laughter. I literally fell from my place at a specific point. <br /> <br /> I am a Bartender and Bouncer to live in the Real World (note my use of the term Real World, unfortunately always has to come first), and whenever I tell someone that I play RPG, it is usually followed by one of two questions: 1. What, like D & D? I played it back in Junior High. <br /> <br /> 2. Really? I've been looking for or a group forever! Do you have room for another? Very rarely do people not know what D & D and Gaming are. <br /> <br /> That said, almost everyone who watches this movie can get anything. Even if you are not a gamer, there is probably something in your life where you can be ridiculed in a light manner, and that means you can relate to hijinx in this movie. It's just happy happiness in an hour and a half.
