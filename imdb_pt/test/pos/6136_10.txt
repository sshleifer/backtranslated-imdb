I have been looking for this mini-series for a long time. I saw this movie when I lived in Russia for many years. I am curious to know if anyone who has the recorded copy of this movie can send me the copy. I'm willing to cover all expenses and pay for extra tapes or DVDs. This is one of the best TV shows I've ever watched. I would recommend it to anyone who was a little interested in the history of Israel and World History after World War II. I'm also trying to find a book (I've heard it's even better than the movie), however, the new one costs about $ 50 on Amazon and I've never bought a used copy. My email address is yurets777@hotmail.com Many thanks for your help.
