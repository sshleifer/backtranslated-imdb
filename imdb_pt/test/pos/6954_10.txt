I'm not sure how IMDb's "weighted average" ranks so low in this movie. It is in my opinion and for all other accounts a neglected gem of a movie. Rip Torn is fantastic as the stubborn Noel Lord, and the Cardinal Tantoo as his superlative companion. Torn and Cardinal are both underrated actors who finally receive an internship to work their craft. <br /> <br /> Their relationship is not always pleasant, but it's very real. This is not the "humerous and heartwarming love story" is announced as in the DVD jacket. In the end, it's a tragedy. Lord simply wants very high and ignores all the advice to take the money offered by the energy company to move. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic, just like the sets of the period.
