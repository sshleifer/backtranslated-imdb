I absolutely loved this movie! It's my favorite number one. Although there were some flaws (what movie has no flaws?), This movie was very well written, directed and produced. The characters in this movie are very real and believable. They made all the characters fit into a specific role. I think the most apparent thing about "Here On Earth" was the love triangle, as well as the other emotional situations brought to the film. It's not one of those movies where you just can not relate to anything, because they are situations where everyone is or has already passed. There are so many different things going on in this movie that it's hard not to relate to it. this. I'm only 18 and I can relate to that. It was heart warming and painful at the same time. "Here On Earth" will make you laugh, cry and sometimes angry. I give this film an excellent review and recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion!
