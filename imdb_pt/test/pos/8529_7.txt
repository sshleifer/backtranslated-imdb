The year 1983 saw a strange phenomenon; two rival Bond films. "Octopussy," starring Roger Moore, was part of the official Cubby Broccoli Bond franchise. "Never Say Never Again" by a rival producer, is, in addition to the terrible "Casino Royale", the only Bond movie that is not part of this franchise. His big attraction was that he brought back the original Bond, Sean Connery; his title supposedly derived from Connery's observation after "Diamonds Are Forever," that he would never play the role again. Some complained that Connery, at age 53, was too old for the role, but in fact he was three years younger than his successor, Moore, who not only made "Octopussy" in the same year, but made yet another James Bond film . "A View to a Kill," two years later. <br /> <br /> The film owes its existence to the settlement of a lawsuit over the rights of the film to the work of Ian Fleming. It may be regrettable that the terms of the deal included a clause that the new movie would have to be a remake of "Thunderball," since it might not have been the biggest of the Connery Bonds. (A remake of "Dr No" or "Goldfinger" may have worked better). The plot is very similar to that of the previous film; The terrorist organization Specter, acting in concert with a megalomaniac mogul named Largo, stole two American nuclear warheads and is trying to keep the world's governments in ransom, threatening to detonate them unless they receive a large sum of money. It's up to Bond, of course, to save the world by tracking the missing missiles. <br /> <br /> The film is fortunate to have not only one but two of Bond's most beautiful girls, Barbara. Carrera as the most lethal seducer Fatima Blush and Kim Basinger as Largo's girlfriend, Domino, who turns to Bond's side after learning of her lover's evil plans. Several James Bond films have a plot that depends on the hero's ability to win the villain's lover or accomplice - there are similar developments, for example in "Goldfinger," "Live and Let Die," and "The Living Daylights." . In the official series, Bond's ally is usually considered the female protagonist, but here Carrera, playing the villain, is billed above Basinger, who was a relatively unknown actress at the time. Basinger, of course, has become one of Hollywood's biggest stars while Carrera is one of several Bond girls who have vanished a bit. <br /> <br /> From the villains, Max von Sydow makes a success. Blofeld effective, the boss of Spectra, but Klaus Maria Brandauer seemed very mild and non-threatening as Largo, except perhaps during the "Domination" game, a more sophisticated variant of those violent computer games like "Space Invaders" that were so popular at the beginning of the eighties. Brandauer may be an excellent actor in his native German, in films like "Mephisto" and "Oberst Redl", but he does not appear so expressively in English. <br /> <br /> One of the characteristics of the film is that it follows the normal Bond formula and sometimes part of it. There is the worldwide pattern in danger, chase sequences, a series of exotic locations, glamorous women, sinister villains and a song theme specially written based on the title of the film. There is, however, no extended sequence of pre-credits, and we see some familiar characters in a new light. For example, the boss of Bond M becomes a languid arrogant aristocrat, his American colleague Felix Leiter is shown as black for the only time, and scientist Q is portrayed by Alec McCowen as a disillusioned cynic with (despite his characteristically Christian name of upper class) of Algernon) a distinct working-class accent. There is also an amusing appearance of Rowan Atkinson as a clumsy British diplomat. Although Connery may not have been very good here, as he was in some of his previous films on paper, this sounding the changes in the familiar theme makes this one of the most memorable titles. 7/10 <br /> <br /> A goof. The character of Rowan Atkinson claims that he is from the British embassy in Nassau. As, however, the Bahamas is a Commonwealth country, Britain would have a High Commission in its capital, not an embassy.
