Batman Returns It's my opinion that the first Batman in the Batman series was only half the movie that Batman Returns is. In Tim Burton's first Batman we had only Batman and The Joker both performed wonderfully by Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. <br /> <br /> In Batman Returns we have what I feel is the most perfect movie in Batman (yes, even better then Dark Knight). Keaton returns as Batman and is perfect in the role that will never surpass the character Batman, who is perfect in this film when it comes to the two villains he faces. First you have Danny DeVito who is incredibly insane as the Penguin. So you have Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, who I dare say is one of the most interesting and complex villains in Batman movies. I feel that way about Pfeiffer because of the way she becomes the Catwoman she starts out as the pathetic Selena Kyle and then dives into the dark side of her mind and what you get is a brilliant performance from a woman going to try be a hero to a villain and then I guess back to a hero in the end. Also in this incredible cast you have the evil businessman Max Schreck played by the incredible and legendary Christopher Walken. While in a supporting role there is something about that role that I love and it may be the look of Schreck in the film that makes his performance so much better than it already is. <br /> <br /> I have to say that Batman Returns has a lot more going on this time, unlike the first Batman. Part of the reason I loved this story is the fact that Burton dared to go in a much darker and distorted direction as opposed to Nicholson's more extravagant. You have the story of the penguin and how he tries to fool the people of Gotham to make him the new hero and prefect of the city. So you have Catwoman and her struggle to decide who she really is and what she should do with her new person. When it comes to Batman, I feel like in this, he is more the leader of the ring that keeps the two stories together, but of course kicking the butt at the same time. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was the film is dark and atmospheric, as well as the story that is taking place within it. Gotham City has never looked as good as Blu-Ray and HD, so if you have the chance to see it that way then by all means this really adds to the overall Batman Returns experience. So I feel like all the Batman Returns movies believe or not at the top of the Dark Knight for me because while I liked that movie for Heath Ledger's amazing performance as the Joker I felt that the film was missing something. Batman Returns has nothing, so if you want to see an incredible movie with what I feel is a perfect cast, then this is Batman to turn on the Bat signal.
