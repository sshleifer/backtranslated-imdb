Hello. Hello and goodbye. But before I go, I want to talk to you. I just want to briefly mention a few key points about this movie. the first being erotic. especially homoerotic. <br /> <br /> Yes, well. Let's get started. When a man and a man love each other, they merge into a spectacular movie explosion, which we call a venice merchant. <br /> <br /> Homo erotic love was sensual at worst. and even more sensual at best. was hardcore and emotional. touched me inappropriately and I'm sure I played it back. and when no one was looking I touched a bit too. <br /> <br /> I laughed because portia was denied. she was the second in the queue of our friend, erotic homo love. oh antonio antoni. just toni. I love you. More than you loved that guy. whos name may or may not have contained a "B". he was very ugly. <br /> <br /> Antony was very greasy. he lathered his body in a wrapper of his own hair grease and juices and began to squirm at the sight of the screen and introduce himself to the guy with the name I like the movie in conclusion, go see the movie if it was not for the homo erotic connotations, for the love of a man like Antony. just toni.
