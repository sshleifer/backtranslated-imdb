This is a great romantic comedy about love, work, the taste of the public and middle-aged crises. The main character is a talented film director who decides to make a silly PG-13 movie to get out of the hock with the IRS. He has an excellent cast, a wide range of humor (from blank to pastelay) and good writing. It is also an ironic presentation of the film industry. The metacommentary includes several excellent cuts between reality and the film being made, and in some places the film moves away from strict realism. The result is a multidimensional masterpiece of ironic middle-aged humor.
