In this offer, just see the current annual offer of the Westminster Kennel Club to see the parallels. Outrageously funny and captures the true essence of competition. One can only imagine the wit of the producers and the incredible capacity of the artists. I also named this movie for a Globe and I feel it is one of the funniest I have ever seen.
