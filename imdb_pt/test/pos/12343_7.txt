Julie (Meg Tilly) is a "good-and-two-shoe" schoolgirl who, determined to prove herself, is allowed to undergo the rituals of "The Sisters," a small-scale clique presided over by snobs, homecoming kind of queen Carol (Robin Evans). The sisters propose that for Julie's final test, she spend the night in a mausoleum, preparing to take Julie to the wall, but not knowing that Raymar, a recently deceased and malicious psychiatrist, is buried and plans to wreak havoc beyond While this Tom McLoughlin debut photo ("Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives" and "Sometimes They Come Back") is limited by its obviously low budget, that's what McLoughlin and his team are. able to make it count. It is genuinely creepy and unsettling. it might have frightened me a lot if I was less than 10 years old and even at my current age I still got to a certain degree. <br /> <br /> Some of the effects seem cheesy. but decent-looking corpses and gangs are created by Tom Burman, an experienced makeup effects artist who, while tending to be overshadowed by more famous names like Winston, Baker and Bottin, has a good resume with other films such as "Cat People ". "(1982) and" The Beast Within. "<br /> <br /> What I liked the most was a real sense of foreboding and atmosphere, one aspect missing in some of the current horror films that are being shown in our multiplexes. <br /> <br /> Tilly is cute and attractive in her role, having recently completed her debut work on "Tex" before joining this production. time prior to its release in theaters in 1983, where she actually did decent business during her first few weeks.The other actors do what they should do enough, familiar faces in the support cast include the equally attractive veteran singer / actress / announcer Elizabeth (aka EG) Daily, Kevin Peter Hall, for once * not * interpreting some kind of creature character, but unfortunately ends up with very little screen time, and none other than Adam "Batman" West. who would play Lizbeth in "Jason Lives," appears here as the space girl in front of the arcade. <br /> <br /> It's a horror entertainment worthy of B-level, maybe too cheap for your ambitions. and maybe not so slippery (hey, McLoughlin * was just getting started), but definitely good for some creeps. <br /> <br /> 7/10
