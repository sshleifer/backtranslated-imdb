An introspective look at the relationship between Hawking and the contingent space / time. This film exposes Galilean and Newtonian laws and relates to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. The film is directed methodically, exposing details of the man (Hawking) as well as his work (Black Holes). Interviews with your family are a little too long, so unfortunately there is less development of your theories and ideas. <br /> <br /> A soundtrack by Philip Glass superbly complements the film. Only another man could compose these haunted instinctive melodies (Jean Michel Jarre). <br /> <br /> Overall, I highly recommend this movie based on Hawking's 'nuggets of wisdom' and its proper explanation of an Event Horizon!
