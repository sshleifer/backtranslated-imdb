"Half Empty" is a hilarious musical about the eternal optimist - in this case, a self-help writer who goes to Germany mistakenly thinking it's popular there. Instead of a beloved audience, he finds himself adrift in a world of tired misanthropes, including the woman who should be his advertising. His attempts to make friends in scenes that are largely improvised lead to one big date after another, when he is verbally abused by nihilist musicians, coarse gangsters, and so on. Over time, he manages to conquer his publicist, both his heart and his mind - but his own worldview is shaken when his hero, a much more popular self-help writer, turns out not to be exactly what it seems. The action is punctuated by several musical numbers. <br /> <br /> We saw this at the DeadCenter film festival in Oklahoma City and were amazed. This is an inspired and entertaining small-scale indie production. You could argue about some technical things (like lighting, which is a little dark), but the piece is funny and inspired enough that you do not mind too much. If Voltaire wrote "Candide" today, the character would be a self-help writer.
