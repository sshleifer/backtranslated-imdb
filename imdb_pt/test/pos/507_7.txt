Overall, I give this movie a decent 7.6. To begin with, I will say that I love how the character was portrayed and adapted on the screen. If you read comics occasionally or just watch DVD extras, you'll see that the Blade character is dramatically different from the one we see in the movie. Among the changes, Blade is now more important half vampire, thus acquiring "all his strength but none of his weaknesses". The credit for that goes obviously to David Goyer, a fellow fan of the darker genre of comics. Thanks to him, Blade has become a much more interesting character and I find him one of my favorite anti-heroes. Wesley Snipes was born to play this role, although some have probably perished Dezenel Washington or Will Smith (lol). His performance here does not have to be exactly Oscar-winning, for the character, but I'm glad he decides to play DayWalker in both sequences. Also starring is Stephen Dorff as our main villain and Kris Kristofferson as Alfred de Blade, so to speak. The acting is good indeed and the action keeps the plot for sure. The opening scene of the club is one of my favorite parts that I have to say. As much as they enjoy this movie, there are few things that bother me, that take from this movie with something like "Spider-Man" or "X-Men". Stephen Norrington had the villains portrayed in a way that I did not like honesty so much. His lines were so full of dirty-mouth comedy that it did not look like a comic book movie to me. More "La Magra" a little disappointing as the ultimate villain, but the intense sword fight makes up for it, I think. Not to mention an extra sense of non-realism: a black man in a leather jacket with a sword taking out the # $% ^ of a cop in broad daylight, somehow, as passing unseen by the walking crowds looked fine .. . good. ..idiot. Moving away from some of its flaws, Mark Isham's music was great and fit the film well. Luckily all of these problems are fixed and improved in the stunning sequence, "Blade 2".
