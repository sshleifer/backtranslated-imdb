Here's what you have to remember about this movie .... IT'S A CHILD FILM !!!!! I do not know about the rest of you, but I'm an eighties kid. I was obsessed with Rainbow Brite. So naturally I love this movie. But if you watch the other Rainbow Brite movies, this is by far the best. But, like I said, it's a children's movie. You have to judge it as a children's movie. It does not matter to kids whether the acting, animation or screenplay is fantastic or even good. All they care about is what happens to the characters. If the good guy (or girl) wins, then it's a great movie. If not then it is bad. You all know what I mean. You were all the kids once.
