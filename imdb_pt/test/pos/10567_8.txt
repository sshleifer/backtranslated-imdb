This movie is definitely one of the best in the genre. A love story with the age of Victrion and Courage. The depth of your plot is one that will stir the innermost emotions of love and hate, with some very interesting twists, this is a must-see for not only the lesbian audience but, for all viewers. I can not say much more or I will ruin the experience for a new young audience that may be coming out. Another good job for Sarah Waters. It's also a great way for Sally Hawkins to conquer the audience who only have a brief glimpse of her talent in another Sarah Waters' work on "Tipping the Velvet" .. It's also a must-see.
