I especially liked the end of this movie - I really felt what the characters must have felt, which I think is a mark of good direction. I was impressed by how the new record store contractor ended up - great character development there, even though his "role" was probably considered minor. <br /> <br /> I was also impressed that the whole movie, while obscure in its subject matter, was free of gratuitous nudity, swearing and violence. Sadness, sexuality and darkness can be communicated (often better) by what is not said, but it seems that this is often exclusive to really "fancy" movies and actors. Congrats to the filmmaker for this.
