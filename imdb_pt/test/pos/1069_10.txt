I saw this movie for the first time about 15 years ago and since then I fell in love with it. It is such a good experience that I could happily watch it at any time of the year. However, for me, it's the last Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The fact of being in black and white is irrelevant - although I often wonder what the color would look like. You can simply feel that warm and bright feeling by attending Christmas events. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck and Morgan are perfect together, and Greenstreet is the antithesis of their usual character, Sakall is a joy to behold. <br /> <br /> It's a light relief and certainly no tax. the brain, but it makes you happy to have seen it. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for it to be available on DVD in the UK. I will certainly be in front of the queue to buy it.
