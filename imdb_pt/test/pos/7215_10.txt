This was the best film ever seen at Germen's Cine Club (Buenos Aires). This film is a realistic critic of the society of the past and the next century. This makes a very good impression for all Germen's Cine Club partners. I recommend this movie to all Troma fans and to all people who like good movies, not commercial movies.
