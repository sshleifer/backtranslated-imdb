Since coming to the Outer Banks for the first time and filming the movie (I've lived here all my life), I've waited for the movie to come out. And I want to say waited and waited and waited more than a year and a half for this movie and for me, it was worth it. <br /> <br /> The film is different from the book, but in my eyes, it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book. In both of us I cried, there were moments that ripped me apart. I laughed and smiled as much. It's a great movie with a great storyline. <br /> <br /> It's about never giving up finding the one, the one that will change you forever. He who will shape your soul and awaken you to a whole new vision of life. <br /> <br /> I have to say that it is possible to find someone and make them change their lives forever, which is what Gere's character did for Lane. I knew the love of my life and at the same time I was completely captivated that I never forgot him or how I fell in love with him until I met him again a year later. For me, I could relate to this movie with all my heart. I think if you listen and watch the movie with your heart and your hopes you'll see what I'm talking about. It's never too late to find your true love, great work, Miss. Lane and Mr. Gere!
