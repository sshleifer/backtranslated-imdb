A tiring watch, but one of Bergman's best movies. Interesting to compare this with The Hour of the Wolf, since both present the same main actors as artists (or an artist and his wife) who took refuge in an island. In the earlier film, it is largely internal demons that lead to von Sydows' disintegrating personality (at least that is how I read it), whereas here there are many circumstances beyond his control. <br /> <br /> Much has been written about the unfriendly central. characters, particularly von Sydow. For me, there are flashes of a good man (if I fail) at the beginning of the film, but one who deals poorly with adversity. Failures become all that remains while their humanity is gradually eroded by one horror after another. <br /> <br /> I watched The Passion (Ullmann and von Sydow on their island again) shortly thereafter, and was surprised to recognize many of the same places. And then there's a dream sequence ...
