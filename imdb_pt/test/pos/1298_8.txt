I really liked this movie. One thing I've noticed is that Korean TV dramas are so much better than giving you the whole story. I watch movies when I do not have the time or feel like going through 16 to 30 episodes. The movies seem to be in a hurry, and if you do not watch closely, you may miss something. <br /> <br /> I feel like this was rushed and I had to get back some parts to try to find what I missed, especially in the end. If you like good love stories, I still find it cute, and if you have extra time, I still think it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> It is always good to go back and follow the actors in different films as we can not follow them from when they begin, as we do producing producers and directors in our own countries.
