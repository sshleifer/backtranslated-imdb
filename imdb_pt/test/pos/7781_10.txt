This is my favorite love story and it has all the elements that a good love story should have. Poetry, jazz, friendships, ups and downs in relationships. Finally, a film that shows positive aspects of the black community. Larenz Tate was great I can not imagine anyone playing Darius. He recited that poem as if he himself had written and wanted to say every word. I own this movie and if I had the time I would watch every day, it always makes me feel better and that's what a good movie should do. In addition, the Savon character could not have been better deal with the subject of marriage. We all would love to find a Darius out there, but most of us just settle for watching this movie. My vote is 10/10
