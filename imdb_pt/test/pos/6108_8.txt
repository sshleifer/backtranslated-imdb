Pink Flamingos: A Picture of the Past Pink Flamingos Society, a film directed by John Waters in 1972, is a very disturbing picture of the negative impact a traumatized childhood may have on the afterlife. Babs Johnson grew up in a non-typical home. Clearly, you can see the impact this has had on society through her actions until the end where she swallows dog feces. Was this film just a sickly distorted perversion of incessant distressing occurrences, or did it symbolize something much deeper? Side with the first would be the easiest way and the side with the latter may seem insane, but possibly true. The film bears some credible resemblance to the actual events of our social past. Every leader whom we, as people, consider "horrible" presents characteristics similar to those of Babs Johnson. Ivan the Terrible, Genghis Khan, Adolf Hitler and Joseph Staling all had a "disturbing" childhood. Babs Johnson had a disturbing childhood and therefore is associated with the same class of all the rulers mentioned previously. That is why many of his actions during the film can be seen as disturbing. However, her actions were either her fault or society's for letting her grow up the way she did. In addition, each character in this movie represents a leader or past event. Another coincidence is Edith's obsession with eggs. With an open mind, this may be linked to genocide and Hitler's attempt to annihilate the Jews. Some see Hitler as a genius, others a mad man. John Waters must have seen him as a madman because his depiction of Edith was indeed mentally ill. The son of Edith Crackers and Cotton's traveling companion are symbolic of what was wrong in our own backyard, slavery. Both names are slang terms that represent a period of time that most of us prefer to forget. These characters are crucial in terms of that at times our society in America was no better than we often see as horrendous acts of social attack in other cultures. The chicken scene is the epitome of what was wrong in our society in this time period and is still wrong. Chicken, is a slang term for women of 1970. Therefore, it may be possible that John Waters was trying to bring the subject of rape through actions of Cotton and Crackers. The antagonist family, if a single antagonist can be determined in this film, was Marble's. Marble is often mentioned in association with wealth. So this can be symbolic of the struggle between the poor and the rich, a struggle that continues today and is likely to continue forever. Pink Flamingos is a monumental film for its disturbing scenes, but it should also be noted for its camouflaged political agenda that Waters has shown so affluent in its entirety.
