'' Meet Sherri .. for a night of pleasure and terror! '' Cheap special effects, cheesy lines, yes her original 1978 film '' Nurse Sherri '' beginning Geoffrey Land as Peter Desmond and Jill Jacobson as Sherri Martin and directed by Al Adamson. <br /> <br /> The movie is about an old evil spirit who has a nurse in a hospital, so she starts killing doctors one by one. The performance was good, but part of the performance was robotic. The plot was good, but the sex scenes were probably played there to get more views. The direction was bad, And the special effects looked like a drawing, the effects did not deceive anyone. The death scenes were very good, but the director mixed a lot of things that did not make sense, such as sex scenes, nudity, soccer player, and many more. <br /> <br /> Overall it's a good movie, but not the best. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
