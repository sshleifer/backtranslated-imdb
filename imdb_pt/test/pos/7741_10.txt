I love this movie and all aspects of it, well directed as a comedy and as a drama. The acting is tremendous, performed by a cast of stars who plays the high society of New York perfectly. The scenery is amazing, totally breathtaking. I also love the story: a successful New York architect who is going through a middle-aged crisis leaves his wife cheating and rushes to a Greek island to hide with his daughter who chooses to go with him. <br /> <br /> I just can not express my love affair enough about this movie. "Show me the magic."
