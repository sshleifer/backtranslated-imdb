This is undoubtedly one of my favorite episodes of Columbus. The acting is very well done, the music is very captivating, the script is ingenious and the direction is fabulous. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk, who plays brilliantly in every episode of Columbus, performs particularly well in this episode. <br /> <br /> In addition, great performances by Stephen Caffrey, Gary Hershberger, Alan Fudge and Robert Culp. <br /> <br /> The ending is absolutely brilliant and I love the way Columbus describes it. <br /> <br /> This is a Columbus movie that will not go amiss.
