When Northfork debuted at the Cannes Film Festival, many people did not like it because they felt it was boring and too slow. Although I agree that it was slow (one of the slowest movies of the year), it was by no means annoying. As Roger Ebert said, "there has never been a movie like Northfork." I usually do not agree with Ebert, but for the first time he speaks the truth. Although John Sayles' Sunshine State may have some of the same immediate themes, nothing I have ever seen or seen can be compared to the striking originality of the Northfork of the Polish Brothers. Northfork is a perfect example of how often it is better to travel a few extra minutes to go to an art film instead of the latest Jack Black movie. The plot is not a banal and hacked plot; is so incredibly original. A small town in Montana called Northfork has a nearby dam that is about to be overthrown. Therefore, the whole city must be evacuated. Some people, however, simply do not want to leave. On a secondary plot, a young orphan (Duel Farnes) is very sick and bedridden; he is being looked after by Father Harlan (Nick Nolte). The boy imagines himself as a fallen angel, so to speak, that helps him out of his time of sickness. <br /> <br /> Although much of the film is direct, part of it could give David Lynch a chance. There are strange weather patterns, a strange and huge dog thing and a symbolism that would make Fellini proud. It's not as confusing as a Lynch movie, but it's still pretty weird. That's what makes Northfork so great: it's so out of the ordinary and yet so simple and plausible. Northfork has a magical feel: it's almost as if you're watching something that you're not sure what it is, but you feel overwhelmed by it. As I said earlier, I agreed with Ebert about how this movie is unlike any other. However, I disagree when he says it is not fun. He goes on to say that it is just "captivating." Maybe he just thought he should make good reviews because everyone is, but instead of how slow it was, I still found it a lot of fun, something that many dramas can not do now. <br /> <br /> Northfork may not be the fastest movie or the most popular movie, but if you can get to it, you'll be extremely surprised, as I was. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br/> <br /> PG-13 score for short sexuality.
