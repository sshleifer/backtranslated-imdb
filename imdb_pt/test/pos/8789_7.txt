NO SPOILERS !! After the success of Hitchcock's first American film, Rebecca based on Daphne DuMarier's exuberant novel of romance and gothic intrigue, he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early British period - identity error and espionage. As the United States settled into World War II and the large-scale "war effort" of civilians building necessary airplanes, armaments, and other militias, the film entertainment business began producing paranoid and often war-themed pyrotechnic films . These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skillful operators working in the shadows between good and respectful citizens. Knowing that the director was at ease in this spy genre, producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock about running a property he owned dealing with corruption, sabotage in wartime, and a helpless hero wrapped in a vortex of misrepresentation and identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the acumen of literary expert Dorothy Parker (during her brief period in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in New York), who co-authored the screenplay, were a perfect match for Hitchcock's sensibility. This often overlooked film tells the story of the unfortunate 25-year-old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) who, while working at a Los Angeles Aircraft Factory, meets new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) and moments later is framed for committing sabotage . Fleeing the authorities who do not believe in his absurd history, he finds several characters on their way to Soda City, Utah, and finally in New York. These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful freaks and a popular outdoor model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) who, during the worst crisis of her life, as well as national security, falls in love madly Of course in the land of Hitchcock, Patricia, kidnapped by the supposed saboteur Barry, falls in love with her abductor, adding romantic tension to the mix. In good shape for this exit, Hitchcock manufactures a national network of Old Reclassions, ordinary Joes and respectable businessmen who act as secret terrorist agents who harbor criminals, pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things in motion. It's a fantastic plot that takes your time to move forward and once lit, culminates in one of Hitchcock's most memorable finals. Look incredibly for life as the tourist attractions of New York (all of which were recreated by art directors in Hollywood due to the 'ban on firing' on public attractions). While Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock's best-known films, it's a popular movie b that is certainly solid and engaging with many clever twists and as usual - great Hitchcock villains. Remember to look for Hitchcock's appearance outside a pharmacy in the second half of the movie. The original idea of ​​Hitchcock filmed (he struggling in sign language with his "deaf" wife) was cut short by the Bureau of Standards and Practices who were afraid to offend the deaf!
