Jeff Lieberman's "Just Before Dawn" is definitely one of the most underrated horror films ever made. The film, although slightly influenced by "Deliverance" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre," is extremely scary and memorable. The cast is excellent, Deborah Benson and Jamie Rose are great female protagonists. Inbred twins are truly scary and ruthless. The film is beautifully filmed - in fact, it was filmed in Silver Falls State. Park in Oregon. There is very little blood but a murder, when Verchel is stabbed in the groin, is quite unpleasant and unpleasant. A must-see for slasher.10 fans. 10-what else?
