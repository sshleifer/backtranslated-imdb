I recorded this as a teenager in the mid-1980s based on the synopsis of the cable guide (the aspect of treasure hunt attracted me), having no knowledge or expectations of the film. What a pleasant surprise when I saw this! this was such a fun movie and I remember watching it over and over again. I thought the concept was well executed, I enjoyed the harmless competition between different groups, and I thought the hunt itself was pretty clever. sometimes it seems like people have very big expectations for the movies. not all films will have a "message" of weight or stellar performance, production values ​​or special effects. Sometimes movies are only meant to entertain and be entertaining, and this is successful on both levels. It was very cool to read the comments from the actors who played the twins. I have not seen this movie for years, but if I did I think I would have a reaction as warm and enthusiastic as I did as a teenager. as I type this, snippets of still-appropriate cheesey theme music are going through my head: "When the midnight madness begins to come to you ... no matter what you say, no matter what you do ...! "
