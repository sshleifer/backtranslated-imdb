This performance leaves you destitute. We saw this in Offenbach, Germany, and it is breathtaking. We just got the cheap tickets from far behind but still had a vision over everything that happened. If you've ever had a chance to see this live, then go! It's worth the trip and if I were you I would expect a good half hour after the show to 'cool off'. The performances are breathtaking and throughout the tent there are artists dressed in bright colors that are there to distract, help, smile and generally make the whole tent come to life. The music - live music !! - it's as good as the CD version: perfect! I bought a DVD later, but the show that was filmed had less colorful costumes. It is the atmosphere in the tent that sweeps you from your feet. A great trip for old and young, and a great movie too
