When the movie "The Cure" begins, we discover a young man named Erik (Brad Renfro). Erik is a teenager who lives with his paranoid mother and who lives next to him is a boy named Dexter (Joseph Mazello). One day, Erik and Dexter connect and head to the grocery store, where Dexter tries Butterfinger for the first time. When Erik discovers that Dexter has AIDS, he tries to make tea leaves and water to improve. But when the cover of The National Enquirer says a New Orleans doctor has found a cure for AIDS, the two boys will stop at nothing to get to New Orleans for the cure. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Cure" is easily one of the best friendship films ever made. He shows unconditional love between a boy, his (new) best friend and the mother of his best friend. Everything is so well done, nothing needs to be changed. Not only do I give this a 10/10 for being a fantastic friendship film, but it's also a sad, but humorous and fun AIDS movie. And the tragic ending to Dexter's AIDS contraction is enough to make me shed a tear. Well done.
