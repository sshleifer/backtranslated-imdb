The biggest movie of all time. <br /> <br /> How's this for a dispute? However, if we look at it in purely cinematic terms, it is clear that the Three Colors Red is a masterpiece. It's not enough just to say this - Three Colors Red is the masterpiece of world cinema. If you accept that Citizen Kane is not human enough, if you accept that Star Wars is not really very good, if you accept that Ozu and Mizoguchi have to step back - then Three Colors Red is the main work of all the times. As a discussion of human morality, Three Colors Red works on an intensely metaphysical level with a depth that no one can match. Blue went almost as far into the human psyche, but stopped as if to take the rabbit out of his hat. The white women forced us to reflect on the humanity of equality - this, in retrospect, was even better, but it was not there yet. Red, however, is the real thing. What he expresses in this film is an expression of what it is to be human. In fact, what he expresses is what it feels like to be human. It forces us to examine even the smallest details, the very nature of our souls, our ethical selves. In red one can find meaning on one of its various levels. At the first level, Red reaches a high level of verisimilitude - we could not have trouble calling Red an exceptionally entertaining story. However, the inherent coincidences of the film and its concepts compel us to examine the film as a film. It is as if Kieslowski was saying: "Ceci n'est pas la réalité". Indeed, in pursuing a humanistic goal, Kieslowski can also challenge reality. It's a trick that Kieslowski has been trying since Le Double Vie de Véronique, but not until this, his last film, has he finally achieved this divine interweaving of fate, philosophy and circumstance. Actors and actresses also seem to be at the mercy of a greater power. Valentine (Irène Jacob), is aptly named, for she seems to represent an almost pure love. Meanwhile, the idea of ​​first impressions is contested by Judge Kern of Jean-Louis Tritignant, a grumpy man who in the end becomes an observer almost all aware of events - a character who symbolically seems to possess the power to unite the characters . - a power to make people happy, a power he could only achieve through Valentine. <br /> <br /> We have the ability to view movies more than just a series of images. In fact, movies have the potential to have more meaning than literature. This is not going to happen, of course, but at least we have the power to see this movie, knowing that it gives us the power to achieve something we can not define, but we all have. A synopsis of this movie read, "A movie about a woman running over a dog." Well and. <br /> <br /> Is not it? <br /> <br /> Simeon Huxtable <br /> <br />
