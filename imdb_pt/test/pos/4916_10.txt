L'Homme Blesse is not for an impatient audience and looking for adventure. There are no explosions and the drama is not direct. Like Lynne Ramsey's films, the director is working more deeply with humor than with storytelling in a way that is effective and incredibly moving. Because it does not depend on free nudity or superficial pop culture. story lines, this is frankly one of the best gay foreign films I've ever seen (see also Francois Ozon, Pedro Almodovar). "Do not Look Now" by Nicolas Roeg gets a lot of bad publicity because it's sold like a horror movie. This movie, like L'Homme, is more than what the box can get you to believe. If you feel like sitting down and being absorbed by the subtle and transformed powers of the movies, you will love this movie.
