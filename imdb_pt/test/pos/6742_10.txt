This is undoubtedly one of the best pieces of Neil Simon that turned cinema. It is full of great characters and a memorable dialogue. Johnathan Silverman makes a great screen version of young Eugene (he was played by Matthew Broderick on stage). This is the first of Simon's autobiographical trilogy, followed by the wonderful "Biloxi Blues" and ends with the TV movie "Broadway Bound." . If I had to say that the film has some flaw, maybe the characters sometimes speak in obvious dialogues, but that's okay, because it's a great dialogue. Rent this little gem, you will not regret it!
