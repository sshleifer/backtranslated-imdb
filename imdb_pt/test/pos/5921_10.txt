This is a great story. While there are some parts of Jimmy Stewart's cornball, for the most part it is a compelling tale about an individual with an attractive drive, vision and sense of adventure - to say the least. The bottom line is that it's one of my favorites to watch and I've probably done it dozens of times - that is, until someone stole ours from a bag I left on a plane on a flight to California! <br /> <br /> Some have commented on many flashbacks, but I do not know a better way to keep a long interesting flight. For those of us who actually fly, the flight can be hours of boredom punctuated by moments of terror. I did not want to see the flight shortened. The overwhelming need for sleep and the hum and surrounding solitude is part of the story. <br /> <br /> There are many parts that I particularly like, including the take off of Long Island and the night landing in Paris (Wow, things have really changed with us and the French ever since!). The plane's construction scenes and record San Diego flight are interesting, as is the incident over the Atlantic on ice (which I understand is not entirely true, but it happened on the San Diego flight). <br /> <br /> One has the impression that one of Lindbergh's greatest assets is his enlightened adepts as well as his persistence. <br /> <br /> Some of the lines that pop up in my head from time to time include "Pull the shims!" on the takeoff scene and "I hope I do not have to use it that way" by describing the "periscope" resembling a submarine for the lady who lent her a mirror so that she could see her air instruments better. <br /> This movie is not for everyone, but it certainly is for me. I hope they are released on DVD so I can replace my stolen version!
