I try to be diverse in my watching movie. I can enter into "Pride and Prejudice" as easily as I enter "Missing Acts". Love Jones is my all time favorite, it is the standard by which I judge any Romantic Modern Urban Comedy. Filmed very nicely, the photo of Nia and Darius climbing on Lakeshore Drive on the Motorcycle is one of the classic 3 second movie scenes of all time. Of course, no one will ever remember that. When it came out, I thought it would be a new paradigm for modern urban cinema, good actors, no guns and so on. The film industry has disappointed me to some extent, will you have your occasional Drumline, or Roll Bounce, or Tyler Perry's "Why Did I Get Married"? So whenever I need to see "my personal" presented on screen in a very professional and elegant way, I use Love Jones. There is no best movie ever, for many people and opinions for this. But it's my personal best. My favorite quote from Love Jones "Baby, I just want to come up and talk !!"
