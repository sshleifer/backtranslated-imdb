The Helge Schneider phenomenon challenges easy description or rapid categorization. However, for the international audience he does not know, it can be said that it is something like a crude mix of Weird Al Yankovich and Andy Kaufman, adding a positive point to the jazz music and clothes of the 70s. While his performances on stage are already eccentric, their work in the cinema are simply hilarious. <br /> <br /> "00 Schneider" is, in my opinion, the best Helge movie. He stars in the two main roles - police detective "Kommissar 00 Schneider" and the villainous assassin "Nihil Baxter", and also in a precious smaller role as the doctor "Dr. Hasenbein". In the opening In the scene, we see how modern art loves Baxter accidentally kills circus clown Bratislav Metulskie, from whom he bought a used faulty Jaguar, when a beloved sculpture escapes from Baxter's hands, beating fatally in Metulskie. When reading about the incident in the newspaper, 00 back from retirement to investigate the case with the support of his loyal companion, Lieutenant Koerschgen, who is played by an elderly actor of the same name. They pick up Baxter's trail quickly, and interrogate him in his strangely decorated mansion (one of the best scenes in the movie!), But initially they can not collect any evidence. The story goes through many shifts, with several scenes that do not always contribute to the progress of the plot, but are entertaining, such as a reverie around 00 (including the most unusual view on the crotch of a man running in the movie theater story), a party of the police department during which Koerschgen comes into conflict with the boss and has to be hospitalized, and a visit to the aforementioned Dr. Hasenbein. Baxter, then, is finally caught trying to escape to Rio de Janeiro on a plane. <br /> <br /> Always worth mentioning Andreas Kunze, who in this case plays the wife of 00, as he usually appears in roles of women who play drag. In Helge's films. <br /> <br /> So, all of you out there looking for new laughs, I strongly recommend this movie. The footprint? You have to understand German (as I doubt there is an English version out there) ...
