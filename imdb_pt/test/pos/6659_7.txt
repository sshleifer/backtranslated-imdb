This movie worked for me because I see this movie as an exact opposite of "Gone With The Wind". Owners of farms instead of owners of plantations. Scarlett fights and conspires for what she wants; Ada gets depressed and turns inside her until Ruby, (Renee Zellweger), appears to save the day. More or less, in a circular way. Deserters instead of cops trying to get back to their families, the lists go on. Even the love story was the opposite. If this is what the producer and writers were trying to achieve, it was successful with me. <br /> <br /> There are only two things I did not like about the movie, the rest I thought was well done and I really enjoyed recommending it to friends. First, I could not see the attraction between Inman, (Jude Law), and Ada, (Nicole Kidman) as being strong enough for Inman to defect to get back at her. Inman said that he had only written to her a few times where Ada wrote to him almost constantly. Second, something or someone being killed or dying in almost every scene was a little too much. I must say I was full of action because of that, but after the second scene I knew something or someone would die in the next scene. I like to be amazed at the next scene, not knowing what will happen before it happens. <br /> <br /> I thought the whole performance was very well done, with Zellweger, the best. She deserved the credit she had for it. I thought she played the country girl very well. She must have done her homework. Zellweger even said in the movie that she was smarter than people thought she was. I think that was true. Law did well with his part with everything he had to go through to get back to Kidman. It must have been much more loving to go through all this than I thought. Now he showed a lot of emotion in his face during his tests. Kidman's part may have something to do with the fact that I chose her performance after the other two. Except when she was depressed, she did not show much emotion, I do not know if that was how the part was written or if that was the way she saw the part. She still did a good job, I just thought the other two were better. <br /> <br /> I liked the scene with Zellweger, Kidman and Rooster, even though it was one of those scenes I mentioned above. I thought 'House Guard' was exactly as they probably were back then. Even if we did not hear much about them, they were part of that time. I thought the scenery was beautiful. The film had everything to be a good historical novel.
