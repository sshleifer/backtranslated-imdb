This story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is told in a subtle way, something that sets him apart from most movies with this plot. Mr. Lam (Jacky Cheung) has a relationship with Choy (Karena Lam, who was also so good at "Koma") in what at first seems to be an inexplicable situation. He is married 20 years ago to Ching (the great Anita Mui, in his last role before being cruelly taken from us), and it seems to be a loving relationship. When Ching offers to take care of her and Lam's former teacher, Choy and Lam have the opportunity to be together. What makes the movie so good is the beat of director Ann Hui. It takes time to discover the secrets of Lamsm and it all makes sense. The film is very dramatic and touching. You do not feel any revulsion for the teacher / student situation, something that elevates this movie above many with the same plot. It's moving slowly, but keep it. Also, have fun with the wonderful, glamorous and beautiful performance of Mrs. Mui. She was and is someone truly special and in this movie you fall in love with her one last time. It's worth the time to witness and just be there with her.
