College professor Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) has been a blockbuster since his ex-wife Margareth (Kate Mulgrew) ruined him, stealing his novel that became a bestseller. He does not hide his hatred for Margareth, disturbing his girlfriend Beth Ryan (Kim Greist), who is an anthropology professor at the same college. While teaching creative writing, he is pursued by student Owen (Danny DeVito), who wants to know his opinion of the tale of crime. Larry says he did not like it, and explains that in every mysterious tale, the killer should eliminate the motive and establish an alibi, otherwise he would get caught. In addition, Larry suggests that Owen watch Hitchcock's films to understand the structure of a suspense story. Owen, who wants to kill his obnoxious mother (Anne Ramsey), watches "Strangers on a Train" and misinterprets Larry's advice, believing that his teacher wants to trade the murders to eliminate the motive. Owen travels to Hawaii and while on a ship, Margareth falls to the sea disappearing into the sea and is considered dead. However, Larry does not have an alibi and becomes the prime suspect, while Owen torments him to kill his mother as part of his alleged deal. <br /> <br /> "Throw Momma from the Train" is one of the biggest hits. funniest 80's comedies and a big tribute to Alfred Hitchcock. The direct reference is "Strangers on a Train", but there are jokes with "Vertigo" (with the camera turning), "Family Plot" and other movies. The lines are excellent and there is an interesting point when Larry says every great novel or mystery has a train. Anne Ramsey is amazing in the role of a nasty and abusive domineering mother and the viewer will surely feel sadness and understand the insanity of Owen. Kim Greist is very pretty and Kate Mulgrew is the perfect bitch. Billy Cristal plays a character obsessed with many silly and irrational attitudes, but necessary to the plot. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Play Momma do Trem" ("Play Momma do Trem")
