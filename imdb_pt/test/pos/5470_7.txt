And I would have rated above 7 of 10 if it were not for Barbara Hershey's seriously unequal Irish accent in the lead role of Madalena. The accent came and it was unfortunately that I found more than a little distraction. <br /> <br /> However, the performance of William L Petersen in the role of Joad was excellent, he brought a warmth and depth to the character, despite some false periodical dialogues. Captivating and genuine, I found it rather surprising in the way he captured the character. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is quite simple, building a forgotten staircase in a church. It is based, very vaguely, I believe, on a real story and I had heard of this staircase before seeing the movie. <br /> <br /> It was a phenomenal engineering feat for its time - a double floating propeller made without nails or screws. It exists to this day, although it is now privately owned. <br /> <br /> ** Minor Spoiler ** Good supporting cast and Barbara is dying so well in all her movies and here she does not disappoint. Many special moments. <br /> <br /> 7/10
