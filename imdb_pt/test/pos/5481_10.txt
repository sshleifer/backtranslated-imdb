I really love action / adventure movies and this is one of the best. Of course, we love the stars of this genre, Bruce Willis, Stallone Sly, Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell, Arnold Schwarzenegger and the rest, but it's the story that really counts. The best ones are a bit viable, but we can tolerate those that are a bit "exaggerated", as in the action style of the comics. As more and more twists and turns, more terrible situations the heroes are involved and the most shocking moments in the film; the more we, fans of action and adventure, appreciate them. "In the line of fire" has all the elements needed for an action thriller. He has Clint Eastwood as a Secret Service Agent who is almost retired and whose only bad moment of failure is chasing him. He has one of John Malkovich's most evil, despicable and maniacal villains, the type you can not wait to see him, "get what you owe." Has Rene Russo as the "love interest". It has twists and turns, an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor. It is extremely well rhythmic by director Wolfgang Petersen and still has a soundtrack of the great Ennio Morricone. This is a true roller coaster ride of a thriller! Do not miss it!
