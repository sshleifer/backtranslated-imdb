I saw this movie at the Boston Women's International Film Festival last night, and I was saddened to hear Mrs. Troche tell us (in her Q & A after the screening) that she does not expect to see much US distribution due to its insistence including all so-called "gay content". It was a FANTASTIC comedy comedy, and it seems to me that the American public might like it the way they liked The Full Monty, so it's really lamentable and a little ridiculous that some photos of two kissing boys are keeping away from the main theaters. Wonderful cast, FABULOUS screenplay and, of course, the direction of Rose Troche make this movie one of the funniest I've ever seen.
