OK, so I'm not usually one that runs out and rents foreign movies ... especially foreign black comedies. I think I can count on a hand the number of movies I've found genuinely hilarious from beginning to end. This movie will be added to the shortlist. Even the dark comedies of Hollywood sometimes push me away because they demand an incredibly dry sense of humor. But this one had my eyes full of tears. My sides hurt. I had not laughed that much in a long time. This movie was recommended by my mother and I did not think I would have even dreamed of seeing it if she was not enthusiastic about it. Do not be afraid to read during your movie - you will lose a hilarious and well-made movie.
