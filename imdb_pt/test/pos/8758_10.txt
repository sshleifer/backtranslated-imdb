Four stories about drug trafficking in Europe intertwine throughout this six-part miniseries. In Germany, a businessman is arrested on drug smuggling charges, and his wife tries to save her family by continuing her husband's illegal trade. Meanwhile, the British Home Secretary travels to Pakistan to negotiate a package of aid that he hopes will stop the flow of drugs from that country. Even when he does this, however, his own daughter succumbs to heroin addiction, destroying his family. This is the miniseries the American film and miniseries was based on. The original is far superior to its two decendents. The poverty and despair of the Third World are portrayed very well. It is blatant, uncompromising and brutal.
