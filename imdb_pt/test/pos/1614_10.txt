I first saw "Death in Venice" in 1971) about 15 years ago, I thought I was moving deeply and I often thought about it. Watching it again a few days ago, I realized that it is near the top of the great movies. With almost no dialogue, he captivates the viewer with beautiful cinematography, good acting and, above all, Mahler's music, without which the film simply could not exist. "Death in Venice" is an impressive adaptation of Luchino Visconti from Thomas Mann's novel about a famous composer (in the novel he was a writer, but making him a composer in a movie was a great idea which works admirably) Gustav von Aschenbach (loosely based on Gustav Mahler) who travels to Venice in the summer of 1911 to recover from personal losses and professional failures. His quest for beauty and perfection seems to be complete when he sees a boy of incredible divine beauty. Ashenbach (Dirk Bogard) follows the boy everywhere, never trying to get close to him. The boy, Tadzio, belonged to very rare creatures who possess an enigmatic and inconceivable power that captivates, enchants, conquers and makes of you its prisoner. Ashenbach became one of the prisoners of the charms of Tadzio. He became addicted to it; he fell in love with it. Was it a blessing or a curse for him? I think both. He died of an unattainable, impossible, but beautiful love, whose object was perfection itself. The last image that Ashenbach's eyes captured was that of the silhouette of the boy surrounded by the sea and the golden light of the sun. Nothing could compare to the beauty and charm of the scene and take it with you to the grave is the death we can only dream of. If he could, Ashenbach would probably have said, "I could witness one of the faces of perfection, I could not bear it, but I was chosen to learn that it exists here in this world and I can die in peace now because it happened to me." <br /> <br /> Unforgettable music, Gustav Mahler's astounding adagietto of his Fifth Symphony found the perfect use in a perfect movie. It reflects all the emotion of a main character - sobs, craves, begs for hope, and sums up the idea that once you are blessed to find beauty, you are doomed to die. I can get to hundreds of movies that use classical music to perfection, but nothing compares to "Death in Venice". I daresay Mahler's music is its main character - it would change and sound different depending on what was happening on the screen. It sounded triumphant when Ashenbach returned to Venice, for what he thought would be his happiness, but it turned into his death. It sounded bleak when he first entered Venice from the sea. You can hear so many different feelings in him - tenderness and adoration, confusion and self-loathing, adoration and melancholy, but always - LOVE that gives the purest happiness and breaks hearts (literally). The movie for a viewer is similar to what the boy was for the composer / writer / elderly artist. We are enchanted and captivated by his power and beauty, just as Achenbach was by the mysterious charm of the boy.
