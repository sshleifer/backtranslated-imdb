I've been a "big" adrenaline fan since "moving pictures" and this concert is simply and an example to all who are fans because Rush is so popular. They have completely admitted that they have made their biggest show yet, and despite the rain in a football arena, they still manage to perform well from start to finish. A real example of this is that during "yyz," the whole crowd begins to sing in a real classic way, in perfect harmony. They actually play all of everyone's favorite songs with a powerful "lust" that rarely happens anymore. You get the best place in the house for one of their best shows. The second DVD is a fascinating documentary of the band while they are in Brazil and shows many of the things backstage and allows you to see them not only as musicians but as real people in their daily lives. This DVD gift set is a must for any young and old Rush fan and is definitely a keeper for your DVD collection. Yours is a show cd for those who just want to listen to the song. This DVD is worth it!
