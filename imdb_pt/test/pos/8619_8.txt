Another fabulous film by Catherine Breillat, this time about the difficulties of filming a sex scene in a movie. Using comedy? a new genre for Breillat? we have a behind-the-scenes view of the cinema, but in the documentary style. The character who plays the director in the film is based on Breillat, the sex scene in question is taken from his previous film "A Ma Soeur" as the main teen actress. But the film, like all of Breillat's work, is not just entertainment. It is filled with philosophical observations about the nature of sexuality, as well as showing a devotion to "purity" (as opposed to pornography), which is the cornerstone of Breillat's work and a devotion to real emotion. We see the character director talking openly about the young actress and actor to bring out the best of them, hypnotizing them to the parts they need to touch, bringing out part of themselves that the director can see in them but they can not see in themselves until that reach the heights of acting that it demands of them. She makes significant films, not titillation, but does she show the work that is needed to produce this, and thus gives us insights both on the film production process (decidedly French) and male psychology? sexuality.
