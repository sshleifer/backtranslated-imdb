This is one of the best talkies Marion Davies - and one of the few to allow her to exhibit her ability as a physical comedian, who was so nice in her silent films. Okay, so she does an awkward number, but even the Ruby Keeler dance of the time does not hold up for the younger generations. The problem here is the script. The story falls into an unbelievable melodrama on the last roll. It is quite stage, and is obviously adapted from one piece ... but not enough. Still, there are some dialogues and antics all over the place. Worth a look.
