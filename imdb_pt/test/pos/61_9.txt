The centerpiece of Lackawanna Blues is the character Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, who runs a boarding house and offers unwavering support to a boy, Ruben, the film's narrator. Based on the experiences of writer-actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson, the film lovingly recreates the upscale pension of New York State and evokes the cultural climate of a transitional world in the 1960s. The first half of the film is virtually non-stop music. The second half deals more fully with the various characters in the boarding house. The nanny's ability to "pick up fragments and make them whole" affects everyone in their sphere. An especially vivid scene is when she confronts an abusive husband, telling him firmly, "If you ever play that kid again, let's dance!" According to actress S. Epatha Merkerson, this line is so strong and full of such determination that the husband with the trigger temperament is frozen. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, Merkerson offers an imposing presence. Your character connects the disparate lives of the borders of your home. This was a touching and heartfelt film with a wonderful cast. As interpreted by Merkerson, the nanny character simply radiates love. This is a cinematic experience that I will remember for a long time.
