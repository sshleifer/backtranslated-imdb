Even though some unreal things happen at the end (that is, a police officer shooting a gun at a crowded carousel where any innocent number could be killed), this was still an intense and enjoyable thriller, one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films. Robert Walker is excellent as the crazy creepy, really convincing giving a fascinating performance that is almost too scary at times. His co-star here, Farley Granger, is fine, but it's no match for Walker, either in the acting or the characters they play. It's the typical Hitchcock movie with some odd camera angles, immoral themes, the innocent man gets into trouble, etc. Unlike many of his other films, I found this to be a fast story with very few bland points. Being an ex-tennis player, I enjoyed his shoot of some excellent old network games that featured some good rallies. Hitchcock's real-life daughter, Patricia, has an interesting and unique minor role here. She not only got the job because of her father; she can act. Also noteworthy: the DVD has the British and American versions and there have been some differences in the story. This is a classic movie that is still referred to in modern movies, even comedies like "Throw Momma Off The Train".
