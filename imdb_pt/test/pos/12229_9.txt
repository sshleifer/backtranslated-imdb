A film that represents how our daily lives are a catalyst that leads us to change our thoughts, behaviors and emotions in people we are not. This story is a love story in which true emotions arise. I credit Malcolm Jamal Warner (Win) and Challen Cates for extraordinary performances. A movie definitely worth seeing, a holiday trip that turns into an emotional round. I suggest seeing this.
