I've seen this movie twice and I'm very impressed with it. <br /> <br /> The conversations between Nimi and his mother, besides Nimi and Matthew, are very touching. The Nigerian community is shown in a very true and colorful way as it usually is. <br /> <br /> Although certain things could have been done with a little more explanation; If we knew why Matthew was in southern France, the scenes after Matthew being found in his car would be more understandable. Fortunately, Optimum Releasing has a website that details production notes. that help make these scenes better to understand. <br /> <br /> I would like to see it again but unfortunately had a limited release in London and is no longer available for viewing. I hope the video release reaches a larger audience because the film deserves it.
