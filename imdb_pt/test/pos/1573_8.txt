Screenwriting director Dean Bell offered many surprises and engaging moments in this modest but compelling, road movie. His dialogue was grumpy, and his use of very short flashback sequences was especially effective in the narrative structure of the film. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the film is the character of Alice, who is fleeing her New England. spent in a desperate effort to reach Florida. Along the way, she travels with a couple of eccentrics, Bill and Sandra, who unbelievably make the attempt to prepare Alice as a prostitute who makes money at truck stops. <br /> <br /> As a newcomer acting in her first screen role Emily Grace as Alice is sensational. There is no misnomer in your character choices. But it's worth watching the film, above all, by the cunning and sensitive character of Sandra, masterfully created by Judith Ivey. There's a particularly clever subtext in almost every moment that Ivey is on camera. As a spectator, I found myself stopping the tape, rewinding and reviewing his scenes to try to discern the psychological subtleties. <br /> <br /> The film raises the following question about the characters: Are Bill and Sandra? good Samaritans, or are they an evil pair of Dickensian predators attacking young Alice? One of the strengths of the film is that it never fully answers that question. Alice seems more self-confident than she started as a result of her experiences with Bill and Sandra. But is she really a better person? <br /> <br /> Part comedy, part road picture and part adulthood drama, this carefully crafted film manages to engage us on many levels.
