I've been waiting since October last year to see this movie! (should be leaving October 98) and now I finally saw that I am not disappointed. Bloody wonderful! OK, it was a little slow at first but once it started, it's a very exciting time, Robert Carlyle is so different from Gaz in 'The Full Monty' and Begbie in 'Trainspotting') that it's hard to recognize him! And Johnny Lee Miller, who is no longer with her Sick Boy of 'Trainspotting' blonde hair, plays her dashing gentleman with the right mood and sensitivity that is easy to see because Liv Tylers Rebecca falls in love with him. A great movie. Like Hades at Disney, Hercules would say, "Two thumbs up !!"
