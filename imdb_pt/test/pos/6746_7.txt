This is a very somber movie. Noir, indeed. The title character is smallpox, brought to New York City without knowing by Evelyn Keyes. <br /> <br /> She is on a mission when she arrives and in a more brutal after she has spoken to her she is no longer an innocent sister. But she herself is not intentionally a killer. That does not mean she does not kill. That does not mean that his presence somewhere among eight million other people does not throw the city into turmoil. <br /> <br /> Keyes is excellent. The support cast is also very good. There are several little-known people involved in it - the included director. Do not be discouraged. It's a movie to be reckoned with! (And how nice it is to see a photo of Columbia. Columbia and Republic produced wonderful comedies and noirs, yet we rarely see them anymore.)
