This movie features some of the best works I've seen in movies or on stage. The actors interpret each other with a skill and liveliness that in no way can be achieved through editing. <br /> <br /> "Love Jones" is a good story, period. But it is also an excellent portrait of the middle-income, twenty-something African American set that is not always seen.
