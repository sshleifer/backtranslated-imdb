I was 19 when I first saw this movie, in the theater. I have a vivid memory of a different ending. Not completely different but significantly. I watched the movie last night and I was wrong, so I guess the following can not be called a spoiler since it never happened. The end I remember was that the boy was hiding in the house completely naked, Frances Austen found it easily and after she confronted him, she slowly fell on her knees and came down on him off the camera. Only his face was on the board and it was pretty obvious he was letting it happen, albeit against his will. But nothing like this appeared in the movie. Sandy Dennis was 32 when he made this movie, Michael Burns was 22 years old. In the film, he complains with his sister that Frances does a big deal about sex. Yes? Well, then go to bed with the guy and get it over with. WTF
