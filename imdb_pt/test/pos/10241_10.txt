This movie was very well written and was a lot of fun. There is great acting in it too. Luke Perry did a very convincing job. (as it always does) If you are looking for a movie full of events to watch, this should be at the top of your list. There is a mix of comedy, drama and action. You can literally feel what the actors are feeling in points. I was very impressed with this movie. The special effects were very well done. The whole movie was very convincing. This movie is one of my favorites. What happens is that North America can be torn apart and Jack and his team have to try to prevent an eruption by destroying North America. It was a very cool and creative idea. I loved this movie and I know you do too.
