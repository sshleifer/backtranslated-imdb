This is such a fun and funny movie. Highly entertaining in every angle. It features a strange assortment of memorable, psychotic, but lovely nuts. We get; the judge, the Sargent, the boy, the scary old lady, the whore, the clown. And unfortunately they all live in a large house that has no padlocks and is insufficient. So for our enjoyment, we get to see them running, playing and being dangerous. We also learn a lesson along the way ... never give your patient an ax! <br /> <br /> That was before the Cukkos Nest, And overcome that. At least on the fun level. You even have your sweet moments. "Love is pure Love is grace Love is strength You love me, your love is pure You always love me Now who could resist that? Nuts are human too. Just a few loose wires. Be a little careful, or you'll get an ax in the back! Children playing. Hehe. The man on the phone repair was very funny and his reactions to the crazy and malicious boss were genuine. All the characters in this movie are tremendously well played. And I really found them funny. No, HILARIOUS! They can even give you dirty thoughts of how you can take advantage of them. Or how they can take advantage of you. <br /> <br /> This is really a very smart movie. There is a brilliant twisting end. I must say that I expected this to be good, but I never expected that. This is horrible. "The court has made your decision, you are no longer in control!" I love it. The end is so, so perfect ... you'll shed a tear. <br /> <br /> I'm so thrilled after watching a movie like this. I'll never forget that now. It's not just a cult ... it's a classic cult. Whatever you do ... Do not look in the basement !!!
