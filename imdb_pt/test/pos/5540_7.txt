Michelle Pfeiffer is ideally chosen as the frustrated mafia widow in this colorful black comedy. Matthew Modine plays an awkward FBI agent who took an interest in her. Dean Stockwell steals the show as the big target that continues to pester Pfeiffer; Mercedes Ruehl is dynamic as his jealous wife. It's all very eighties, but this just adds to the fun. A nice little movie, though not to everyone's taste.
