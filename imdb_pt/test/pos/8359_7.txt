When the episode was made and went to the air Eisenhower was president. Kennedy was the president-elect. <br /> <br /> As for the episode, it was an acceptable if not a serious episode. "The Professor" does not show much reach here, and the whole thing seems a bit rushed (many episodes of TZ do not seem to fit the schedule, some seem to be crowded and rushed, some with little or nothing to spread out over the sock hour, and some, of course, fit). I think you just expect a little more tension than being taken back to some rooms and drugged. But overall a decent episode. In fact, the "what if" motif of time travel is a nugget in itself and sets the table with a basic interest. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10, considering that many episodes of TZ were not so good, and some much better.
