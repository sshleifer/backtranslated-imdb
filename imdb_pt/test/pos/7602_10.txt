I thought this movie was great, not just because of the plot, but because it was very portrayed by the excellent cast. I read that Drew Barrymore was not exceptional like Josie Geller because she is beautiful. Yes, she might, but in the movie she threw herself out, which brought a simple girl in search of who she is in the world. The story is sweet and definitely for the hopeless romantics out there, I most certainly am. David Arquette is crazy as his brother Rob, and Michael Vartan is gorgeous as Sam Coulson. Leelee Sobieski did an excellent job as her companion Aldys, someone who was not afraid to be herself. I think this movie should have more credits than being labeled as a "bippy teeny"
