Unlike some of the former commentators, I was (and am) an avid Carpenter fan. Face it, Christmas would never be Christmas without the carpenters. That said, I believe the film did a good job, not great, on portraying Karen's life. The movie was enjoyable to watch on TV prime time, but the content got a bit short. I suggest you all look for some of the Carpenters 'specials that were shown in the' 70s. You can not believe how amazing the drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent. Besides, Karen was beautiful, but she had a bad hairdresser. My choice for playing Karen is Hilary Swank. I would love to see a more substantive story, because there was more to Karen than the eyes when we heard We Only Just Begun. I have tons of un-tossed Carpenters music, and it's absolutely excellent.
