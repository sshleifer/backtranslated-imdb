I was at a friends' house for Thanksgiving and watched a DVD of the movie, Eddie Monroe. I've been a fan of Indie Films for almost 20 years (I loved the McMullen brothers) and was impressed by the quality of this film. My friend, who works at Magno Sound, told us that this movie was filmed in Super 16. The picture was so good, it looked like it was a 35mm film. In addition, the music combined with the direction of Fred Carpenter was art. The plot was original and led to an end that surprised us all watching ... very cool. The acting of the whole cast was good, especially the actor who played, Uncle Benny. He was incredible. This movie was a pleasure for a nice vacation, and I was very happy to be one of the first to see a movie that many will be seeing in the future.
