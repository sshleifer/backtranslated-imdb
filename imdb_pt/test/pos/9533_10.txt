Edith Nesbitt's best book has been adapted into a truly magnificent film, I love it. The film itself has beautiful cinematography and good achievement of the subject. The end is enough to have you in tears, as it is so well done. Lionel directed some truly excellent films, such as the incredible Mr. Blunden, but this is his best directorial film by a mile. The costumes were absolutely adorable, which matched the beauty of the countryside, and the glittering and conveniently faithful script helped in everything. However, it is the acting quality that holds this film together, since it is nothing short of incredible. Dinah Sheridan is appropriately sincere as the mother, a much needed character trait, and Bernard Cribbins was hilarious as Perks. In fact, I preferred Perks to the movie, since he is not so funny in the book. The children were perfect. Gary Warren and Sally Thomsett gave witty performances, but it was the charming portrait of Bobbie that Jenny Agutter most impressed me. Another special mention is the beautiful song by Johnny Douglas, the title song reminded me of Charlie Chaplin's Smile. In conclusion, a funny and poignant masterpiece, which is better than the book, I think. 10/10. Bethany Cox.
