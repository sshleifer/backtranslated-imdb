Ghoulies 4 is a macabre sequel. The ghoulies look very different from the first three ghoulies, but it's still cool. There are some nice flashbacks, from Ghoulies the first movie. Jonathan is back on this one again. It was not in parts 2 or 3. The movie is low budget sometimes but fun to watch. You have Tony Cox as Dark Ghoulie and Arturo Gil as Light Ghoulie. The ghosts in this movie are really good rather than evil like the first three movies. Both Ghoulies are very funny characters in the movie. Then you have the very hot Alexandra! It's a great dark and funny comedy! Any fan of ghoulies movies will enjoy watching Ghoulies 4. The DVD is finally coming out in July 2007! I hope one day Ghoulies III is on DVD in the USA. I really would like to see a sequel to this movie one day too. I doubt that will happen. It's 2007 now and there's no sign of a sequel yet. If there's ever a sequence, I hope Jim Wynorski can. <br /> <br /> Dou Ghoulies IV a 9/10
