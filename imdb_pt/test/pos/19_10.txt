This is one of my three favorite movies of all time. My only complaint is that the director, Peter Yates, had many cuts showing the actors individually rather than together as a scene, but the performances were so great that I forgive him. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are absolutely wonderful; bright. The script is great, giving a good picture of life in the theater during World War II (and therefore, as it was in the 1930s too). A lot of subtle touches, lots of big, exaggerated features, all done perfectly. Scene after scene just pulls me away, and then there's the moving climax.
