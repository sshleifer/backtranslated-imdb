Well, my dad drove Lee Evans back and forth in the hotels, so I could see a few being made. It's a brilliant movie! Bob Pugh went through a shed with a lawn mower and he accidentally let go and went to a fence and he fell. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans was also funny when he saw me and said you're cold I said yes and he said, "Well, hit your hands in your pockets!" I think it was very funny and it's going to be a well-known comedy. Like all the other Lee Evans movies! They were really great people. they seemed to be well educated and funny. I would like to meet them again one day. Brenda Blethyn came out of her caravan with blood down and branches in her messy hair and I was very scared as I did not notice her until she was right behind me
