A funny and forceful critique of Russian society and culture during the communist transition, OKNO V PARIZH also shows the West in an unfavorable light. A group of Russians living in St. Petersburg (also known as "the west window of Peter the Great") finds a magical portal that instantly transports them to Paris. Mamin's film is truly hilarious, and just "strange" enough to constantly keep the viewer tired on his fingers. The songs, the dream sequences, and the deliciously disgusting margins of the society of both cultures mingle to create a memorable and meaningful film. Anyone who tries to understand the change in Russian cultural feelings since the fall of the USSR must begin here.
