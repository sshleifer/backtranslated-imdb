This film offers many delights and surprises. When Achille and Philippa sing beautifully a duet of "Don Giovanni" that perfectly describes their situation in the film, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film. The story unfolds in the 18th century in Jutland and the use of vintage music played in period instruments is just one more special touch. You share the delicious delight of General Loewenhielm while attending Cailles en Sarcophage, although you are only watching a movie - but you just want a small taste to savor. <br /> <br /> Babette is an artist whose medium is Food. Perhaps no other form of art allows the artist to share his creations so directly. The main theme of this film, the potential that food sharing has to transform the way people see each other and how they see the world, is very much like the theme "Chololat," but "Babette's Feast "does not hit your head with your message. The people of the city are puritanical conservatives, but not overly oppressive. You come to understand them and respect them, and finally to appreciate your humanity. Many questions are raised for you to reflect on: the nature of art, the contemplation of paths taken and paths not taken, the relationship between the spiritual and the physical, the effect of the environment on behavior, to take life to give life, among others. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment for me was General Loewenhielm's speech, delivered at the climax of the meal. I expected deep and sincere observations, but I received some vague mystical ramblings. The speech had such a minimal impact I hardly remember it. <br /> <br /> But this discreet movie leaves a lasting impression. The heat it generates is in contrast to its stark background. You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.
