This is the latest Ghibli movie and it is also a MAJOR output of the studio's established style. Firstly, this film was obviously aimed at young children, much more than any of their previous films. Lacks depth of other movies and presents a new style of animation much less realistic ?? and yet it is always so much fun. Although there is nothing to attract adults, I still found myself drawn to the screen and totally immersed in the story. The secret of the film is brutal honesty in relation to the plot and the characters. The story and the characters are very direct with their feelings / intentions, etc., but this makes them even more enjoyable. Special attention was also given to the soundtrack, which is absolutely incredible, despite being quite different from the previous Ghibli soundtracks. I get caught singing fluffy music all the time like anyone who sees this movie!
