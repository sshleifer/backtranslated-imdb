Hardly any movie experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor. Geena Davis is a housewife who suffers from amnesia. She's even in the PTA! But then a car accident wakes up the woman she used to be, and it's HOT! Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as the private detective tries to help Davis find his past, only to find that he is in the way of his head. Davis also has some hilarious lines, and the interaction between her and Jackson works surprisingly well. Search for Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lechter and David Moorse finally getting their TV picture from St. Elsewhere. The film is directed by Davis's husband, who almost seems to have built the entire film around him, but it works. <br /> <br /> I take this DVD and watch it many times. I still love the makeup scene. Is Geena hot or what?
