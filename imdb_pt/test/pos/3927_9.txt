I never saw the original "House Of Wax", so I really did not know what to expect when I went to preview the new movie. After a rather hesitant start to introduce our young characters, "House Of Wax" shifts and becomes an extremely effective horror outlet. The plot does not really matter much here - I think most people know by seeing this, these beached kids are going to meet a nasty killer and find some horrible things in the wax house. It's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch. Spectators who enjoy their horror films with a lot of blood will be satisfied here, but there are other macabre effects as well. The production design and sets are excellent, and the cast takes full advantage of their underwriting roles. <br /> <br /> Of course many people are probably wondering how Paris Hilton performs. To be honest, Hilton acquits herself pretty well and does not portray herself as "herself" as many people are predicting. Her character is sexy and sweet, and I think her good work will change many people's opinions about her. Elisha Cuthbert is also good, rising from her previous film, the atrocious "The Girl Next Door." Her character is heavily criticized and Cuthbert proves to be a grumpy heroine. Chad Michael Murray, like Hilton and Cuthbert, is pretty to see, but unfortunately not very convincing as the "bad boy" of the group. <br /> <br /> I predict good things for "House Of Wax." while the audience at the screening I watched screamed, shouted and applauded many parts of the film. Congratulations to the cast and crew for a job well done. <br /> <br /> And congratulations to Paris Hilton for proving that many people were wrong. As she always says - "This is hot."
