Mel Brooks really got over with this stand-up hilarious story of Robin Hood. The cast is perfect, and Cary Elwes does a great job in her role. In my personal opinion (plus the fact that I'm a fan of Cary Elwes) this movie is the best and funniest I've ever seen! This will make you laugh every time you see it!
