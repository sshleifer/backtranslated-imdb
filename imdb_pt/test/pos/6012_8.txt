After spending five seasons on the big screen in 1976-79, George & Mildred moved to the big screen in the mid-1980s. Instead of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke keeping their roles as writers, Dick Sharples was hired as a writer. Unfortunately, this film adaptation does not seem to have reached the point with the public. Shame. I liked it, better than the series itself, actually. It was guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> "Mildred Roper" (Yootha Joyce) is keen to see if the sloppy husband "George" (Brian Murphy) remembered the wedding anniversary or not. Obviously he has not, but to try to convince his wife, otherwise he registers a table in the restaurant where he proposed marriage to Mildred several years ago. <br /> <br /> Upon arriving at the restaurant, they discover that the place has changed hands. Eventually, seeing through George's lies, Mildred insists they celebrate their birthday at a pretentious hotel. Upon arriving at the hotel, George is mistaken for the bandit "Harry Pinto" (Stratford Johns) for a ruthless killer, who wants a rival to be exterminated! <br /> <br /> It's not an exceptional comedy as such, but rather good fun piece of fun anyway. Plans to relive the series after the screening of the film were sadly ended when Yootha Joyce died on August 24, 1980 from alcohol poisoning. <br /> <br /> Funniest moment - George talking to his favorite garden gnome. His neighbor, Tristram, appears behind him and says, "I think it's time we talked." George, thinking he has developed the power of speech, leaves the gnome in shock! Merry Christmas for IMDb users, in particular 'AdamFontaine', 'Cyril Blake' and 'TheLittleSongBird'. Have a nice day!
