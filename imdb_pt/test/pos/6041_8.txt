Jack Webb finally gives something beyond his usual Indian wood performance. He touched the epitome of the pitcher's head, washed his brain, invaded the beaches, always idiot military idiot. The Body first of all, even humanity. This great movie showed the idiot of the training camp to the max. 4 stars.
