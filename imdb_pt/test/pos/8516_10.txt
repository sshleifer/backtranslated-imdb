There are many similarities between Never Say Never Again and Thunderball not just about Sean Connery but also about the story and the plot. except the actors all others are equal like kidnapping of atomic bombs, asking for ransom, nuclear weapons trafficking in a ship, etc. Only difference are place of occurrence in the ball plot is in the Bahamas in Never Say Never Again is about North Africa. And in thunder NATO / RAF itself carries nuclear weapons on the plane and in Never Say Never Again it is traded for a "red arm of Ax" and the air falls on the US and is stolen in the Caribbean. Almost 99% is the same. If anyone wants to dispute this, they are most welcome.
