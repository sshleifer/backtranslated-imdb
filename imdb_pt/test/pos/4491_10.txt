I will never forget the absorbing effect this show had on me when I first saw it. From the moment the Major is surprised by the Clown, to his anguished attempts to make sense of the situation ("We are alive, we are people, we must have memories!", Inaccurate but near quotation), to his intelligent attempt to improvise a medium of escape, this is a fascinating drama. <br /> <br /> The little touches stay with the viewer for a long time after watching it. The moment when the lovely dancer dances for everyone, for the turn off button, squeaking bagpipes of the Scottish musician; the Vagabond's melancholy remark, "A fault is as good as a mile," the Major's shaken conclusion that they must be in Hell. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant episode, beautifully written and rendered. Susan Harrison's breathtaking beauty enhances the memorability of the strange and touching story.
