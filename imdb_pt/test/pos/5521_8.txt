A man named Jerry comes into possession of an ancient Aztec doll. However, this little figure is possessed by an evil spirit, who takes Jerry's body and pushes him to shed blood ... I have seen two other horror films " The plot that is "Dripped Blood" and "The Kindred", made by Stephen Carpenter, Jeffrey Obrow and I should say that "The Power" also does not disappoint.The plot is slow, but there are some effective and somewhat human effects. a tabloid reporter being attacked by guns coming off a mattress is a hoot. I liked that low-budget horror movie and you should too, if you're in the horror genre of the 80's.
