Rent this, I own the DVD, I bought it for $ 9.99. A robbery being so underestimated. Of course, there are better movies. Films with less or no holes in the plot or action. But I do not have this problem with this movie. For me, if a movie remains true to itself, honest and exploitative of its flaws (and virtues, obviously!) In the name of entertainment, then it fulfilled its purpose. I have to care, because their manufacturers cared. The whole movie is absurd from start to finish, but its creators took the whole company seriously, and I did not feel manipulated to take the film seriously. And this is so true, because I want to take each movie seriously yet many, oh so many, let me down. Despite all its nonsense, this movie is almost perfect and completely entertaining! What a funny script! It also became dauntingly relevant in light of the events of September 11. By no means do I try to minimize the loss. But this movie embodies the tradition of the WTC collapse before it happens in a way we would never see if the movie had been made after these events. <br /> <br /> "... or gone forever, or here to stay." "do not you agree?"
