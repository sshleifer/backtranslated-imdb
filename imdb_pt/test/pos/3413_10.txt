Of all the seasons and episodes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, after seeing all the great and stunning stories, stimulating, this one stands out. That's right. This story, titled THE HUNT tops the great number of the best scripts in television history. <br /> <br /> It is true that there are no interplanetary space flights, no cracks unexplained in time. There is no living nightmare, no sudden configuration changes. There is nothing out of the ordinary for our protagonist to deal with. <br /> <br /> The main character, played by veteran actor Arthur Hunnicut, leaves his hut in the hills, accompanied by his faithful dog, to hunt raccoon. Because the raccoon is a predominantly nocturnal animal hunt is in the moonlight. <br /> <br /> The man and the dog soon find a large raccoon jumping on the dog's back and trying to drown the dog in a pond. The man leaps to help his dog. There is a kind of almost faint, after which the two are seen on the beach, in an almost dormant position. <br /> <br /> Calling your dog by name, (Rip, I think) the old man leaves to go home. When he arrives, he finds his wife crying and does not respond to their conversation. He also watches visitors coming and going to his house, paying homage and giving words to comfort his wife. <br /> <br /> Still looking intrigued by the strange reception and comings around the Home Cabin, Man and Rip take off. on a long walk down the road, where He watches out loud that he did not remember such a long fence in those parts. He finally comes across a rather large fellow, dressed in a similar fashion to his overalls, hat, work shirt. They are at a gate, which leads to an area where much smoke is rising freely. The Gatekeeper is overly eager in his persuasive speech to try to get the man inside. Rip sounds displeasure. The Gate Man tells the Old Man that he can enter, but the dog would have to stand outside, offering to watch the animal for him. The man will have none of it and the two will continue on their way. <br /> <br /> After a little more walk, they arrive at a second entrance door, where the Guardian of the Gate recognizes the man and receives him. When the Elder reports what happened on the road, telling him how the guy at the other gate tried to separate the Man and the dog, and added, "No dogs allowed, this must be hell of place!" The 2nd Gate Keeper claimed he was right! "That's exactly what it is!" <br /> <br /> Our family had lost our first dog, Lady-a Lab mixed in October 1981. About 6 months later, as luck would have it, the wife (Deanna) and I along with our 2 daughters (Jennifer 9 and Michelle 6) saw this episode on TV, WGN TV, Channel 9 Chicago. Well, it all made perfect sense to us at that moment. <br /> <br /> We are sure that anyone who has had this relationship with a family dog ​​would agree. The episode still brings a watery eye condition to this 60 year old writer.
