Watching this movie caused an emotional reaction. That's what today's documentaries are. It's refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and revelations are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It is a fine line between personal truth and exploitation. This film follows very carefully and successfully. <br /> <br /> One might think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give rise to pessimism ... but that does not happen. Quite the contrary: it made me feel good. I feel that I now know more about marriage ... about women. <br /> <br /> Definitely check this out, this will make you think - exactly what a good documentary should be made to do.
