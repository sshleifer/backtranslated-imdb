I hate sports movies. I think the pre-made Hollywood sports movie is a bit hard to swallow because it follows the most identical ideas every year, what I'm trying to say is that there is not much creativity in this genre. Use the "A" view ?? "The Game Plan" as proof of this, if you will. So needless to say, I was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the element of the sporting theme but at the same time I could not wait because I love surfing documentaries like "Step into Liquid" and "Billabong Odyssey". I took a step, plunged into the unknown, and to be honest I was not happy at first. I did not like the direction, the people or the style that the film covered to introduce these young sports entrepreneurs. With my first preview, I thought the story could not be recorded in its entirety, so I thought that Stacy Peralta was putting together movies with fake actors acting like they were from the late '70s. The music was intense, it matched well. Peralta had made a mixed tape of this generation for our enjoyment, but the visuals were anything but stimulating. The elongated scenes, while using incredible music to support, seemed flushed and too long for my attention. I wanted to meet the pioneers, not just watch them skateboard for ten minutes in an empty pool. I wanted a combination of who these kids were, where they went during the rise of fame and where they are now. It seemed like I was watching the birth of our nation with a great score for settlers just paddling their boats all day. I wanted to meet the men behind the myths. So, thinking that I would have another negative review, I watched the movie again with Peralta's audio commentary. His passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this movie impressed me. This suddenly became the movie I wanted to see. Peralta lets us know more where these children are today, what they are still doing and how difficult it was to put some of them on the camera. He had not seen many of them in over 20 years, so hearing these challenges brought the human element back to the surface. He was sincere; he was sympathetic, but he showed so much dedication to this project. Although I disagree with everything he chose to do (ie, Sean Penn's mess is not PUNK ROCK), he revitalized that movie for me. It was due to this comment that I rate this film much larger than originally thought. <br /> <br /> Jay Adams. Tony Alva. Jeff Ho. Peggy Oki. Wentzle Ruml. These are just a few of the names that need to be mentioned, and continually praised if the skateboard is to continue the fast growing trend you currently see. While Tony Hawk's name sells products, it's these guys, those soft-faced pavement bums who have redefined an entire sport. Of course, others were probably doing it in the stone ages, but these guys did it with style, grace, and moved to the next level. This was a hobby for them, but it also propelled them in a direction in which I believe none of them were ready. "Dogtown and Z-Boys" is the story of evolution, being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted and about friendship. We have seen so many stories over the years that show the progression of mankind, and this is definitely a story that should be added to it. I can not say that I loved this movie, nor will I, but it should be a standard view for everyone who is learning or want to experience the growth of the skate trend. It was sad, it was exciting, and these guys are not multi-millionaires again? They are people with a passion, and very rarely do you see it in documentaries. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not watch this movie again, but I will suggest this to friends and family once in a while. I think the downfall of that movie, to me, was the filming? the attempts to be avant-garde with style, we finally moved away from the characters and events. As mentioned earlier, there were some creeping elements that left us with little or no time to know where these guys were now. Peralta obviously had a passion for this sport, for the people, but he seemed out of focus at times. The music was intense and worked perfectly with the movie. Sean Penn, though decent with his voice, was not necessary. They could have spent the money somewhere else. On the positive side, the audio comment captures everything the regular movie was missing. Peralta's voice instead of Penn's voice brings a stronger human element to the scene as he tells us better stories of people, places, and events. Watch this movie, but do not expect to be surprised. Listen to the audio commentary; I think you will be impressed. <br /> <br /> Grade: *** Â½ out of *****
