I believe I share the same psychological perspective of the world with Kieslowski. He is Polish, I am Dutch, but we share a synthetic mind: the world is not empty of metaphysics amidst total coincidence. Hardly ruled by man or perhaps by a poet-prime minister, so that as an 'area of ​​low social and cultural pressure', Poland could play the role it played in World War II, being critical even if Christian with regard to Jews , but no less critical of itself. . There is innocence and guilt in Kieslowski's world view, like the symbols of Catholicism: the white against the black Madonna. In Rouge, the Black Madonna is the one the judge fell in love with when he was young. The flashbacks are magically realistically intertwined with the present, though totally coincident, like the camera simply swaying across the street or the red jeep of the then young judge passing by the girl's car now after accidentally hitting her dog with it. That we jump through time in these same camera movements, is what we realize later. His love was not answered, so his life was not as he had planned. He has lost his ability to love other people and animals. Being a judge, he feels he is actually spying on other people's lives and when he retires, he simply continues to do so by spying on his neighbors this time around. The innocence and sense of justice of the younger woman (literally) accidentally entering her life reinstates her best judgment and it is because of her that he spontaneously confesses his espionage behavior to his neighbors and the police, accepting and even clinging to the stones thrown through their windows. In the process, history repeats itself between this man and the woman he loves, although this time he is old and the woman is not the same. Kieslowski may have struggled with this, for the old judge is his alter ego, and it is said that he was in love with Irene Jacob. Both women play the same essential role in their psychology, the one who (!) Possesses their heart and soul and therefore can do it or break it, even as an old man! It is as if the "powers in the air" were, or God is, gathering them. Coincidences are * also * coincident to be just chance or even good luck. There must be some mystical, supernatural, or theological source influencing these profoundly unfathomable decisions of life. The study book dropped and opened on the exam question page is another example of this. Or the moment the old judge spoke his heart to the young woman, the wind outside the opera house suddenly knocks the doors open and breaks the windows. The gigantic image of the young woman happens to predict the one of the TV, after the accident of drowning in its crossing of the Channel. These moments are effectively accentuated by the human voice of the liturgy or by what it seems (Van den Budenmayer).
