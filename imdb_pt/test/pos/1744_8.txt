This is a very modest movie, very beautiful, with a great track of Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser, with a number of prominence, We are the couple in the castle, which is totally evocative of the period and refers to the Penthouse Serenade as well as the opening The premise (the arrival of Hoppity) may have inspired the opening of Fred Saidy and Yip Harburg (Woody's Coming) in the Rainbow of Finian six years later. I totally agree with those posters that have noticed that the name of Disney added to that it would have reached the status of 'classic' instead of having fallen into negligence. It is wonderfully inventive, never more so than when objects barely noticed in the 'real' world take on much greater significance - both pro and con - in the world of insects. In fact, it's a classic, albeit minor.
