I've always loved this movie. The music, the history and the action. I particularly love the opening and closing of the movie. The music stayed with me over the years. The war battles of World War I were great and the comedy is typical of Blake Edwards. Slaptick is your forte, after all. Julie is singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen. Scenarios and scenes are wonderful. The characters are attractive. I loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and Julie singing to them. I wish she would sing for me in Vietnam. I also liked the old cars of the period and the music of the First World War. I was happy when the DVD arrived. Now I can whistle in the dark watching again and again.
