This movie got better with time. I can not believe it's been forty years since I saw this at the age of 15 years. Yes that's right. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so any teen could get into any movie. Imagine how it was for a child my age to see Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King were just killed, but the following summer there was a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the Woodstock country's chance to put him in the man. You'll see where Robert Downey, Jr. got his sarcastic glow. His father was an instant hero to children like me. No punch is pulled in this classic, and aged hippies will rejoice when they revive this era. Hopefully, new children of flowers will be encouraged by her, and this current era of fascism will be under the same scrutiny to which my era was subjected.
