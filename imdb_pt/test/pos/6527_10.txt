This is the first American movie I've seen this year and I think it will be the biggest movie because of the feeling. As a teenage singer in America, Aaron is not as pop as before, most Americans I met said his music was fake and he did not even know how to rap. But attention, everyone, he's a child, how many people can understand him. Being a fan of pop is difficult, and being a pop star is more difficult. I think this time Aaron (JD) showed something real to us. And I think people should learn to understand each other. On the other hand, I really like the song from the movie. I remember that the first song that appeared in the movie is "Saturday Night" and also includes a live show from Aaron, and the second is "One Better", so I guess you like this movie, maybe you're a pop fan too. Finally, I hope you have a lot of fun ^^ A voice of a Chinese boy.
