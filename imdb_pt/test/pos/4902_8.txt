One of Warner Brothers' best and biggest box office during the 1930's was this charming family drama about a widower who lives with his unmarried sister creating Four Daughters. But not four daughters a day. They were all trained by their father musician on instruments and one as a singer. They make beautiful songs even if it's for the long hair set. <br /> <br /> You can watch the endless variety of roles that Claude Rains has played over the years and still marvel when he shows you another aspect. of his creative personality. The opportunist Captain Vichy in Casablanca is as different as the scientist went mad in the Invisible Man, as the patient and wise work at Skeffington. All the same man and everything so incredibly different. <br /> <br /> Here he raises the four girls with love seasoned with a bit of grumpiness in their willingness to accept modern music. The Lane Sisters and Gale Page can get to know Beethoven, but they are also cats and can beat Daddy eight in the bar every time. And if Rains get a little pissed off than Aunt May Robson can put it in her place. <br /> <br /> With the Four Single Daughters at the time, you know that this will change. All sisters develop romantic interests in Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, Jeffrey Lynn and John Garfield. Of course the mating process gets a little complicated and one of the sisters suffers a tragedy, but it promises to work when the movie ends. <br /> <br /> Four Daughters is also known as John's debut film. Garfield. In addition to a small participation in Footlight Parade years before, Garfield had no other roles in the movies. But he was acclaimed on the New York stage for his performance in Golden Boy and Warner Brothers signed with him and found the film's debut role as the cynical musician who does not get a good chance at life. He earned the nomination for Best Supporting Actor in 1938, but he lost to Walter Brennan for Kentucky. <br /> <br /> This film was so popular that it practically spawned a small cottage industry for Jack Warner. Sequences with cast members like Daughters Courageous, Four Mothers, Four Wives, all cleared at the box office before World War II. And Warner Brothers remade with Frank Sinatra and Doris Day playing the parts that John Garfield and Priscilla Lane originated. Now, the two made some beautiful music. <br /> <br /> Still, a timeless cast was created in Four Daughters and the film remains 70 years after it was first seen.
