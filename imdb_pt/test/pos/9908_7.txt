This film was recently shown with subtitles and was not dubbed, in the Special Service of Broadcasting of Australia. I thought I read here that sometimes there is an assumption that * Revenge of the Rats * is a sequel. In fact, rats are getting revenge for something that is done within this film, or in the history of mankind. There is no prequel as far as I know. <br /> <br /> Now let's get Pied Piper from Hamelin out of the way. Maybe this story went through my head when I watched the movie, but that's all. There was the use of the word "coffers" at the end of the film. A stunned mayor tries to justify his actions by saying "the coffers were empty." "Safes" is not a word you hear a lot these days, unless you read popular stories to your kids, like I do. Since I saw Revenge of the Rats, I read two versions of The Pied Piper of Hamelin. Now I see the comparison. A metaphorical fat, but the prefect, literally ugly, promises more than the city can afford, to get rid of rats. This is as far as I can follow the analogy. Children are not taken to a door on a mountain, with a lame boy left behind to speak of a land of winged horses and fountains where it is always spring and everyone is always happy. <br /> <br /> There is a lot that is quite mainstream about this movie. Romance and resolution especially. Female characters have potentially powerful roles in society, but are really very powerless. Where this film is rather rebellious (compared to American cinema) is that it is anti-authoritarian. The helicopter pilot is dismissed by the mayor for "doing good". The mayor and local government are portrayed as corrupt and greedy for a lot of money. Finally, it is up to a doctor in Frankfurt to solve an epidemic of fatal and contagious disease. Apparently, there is no national infectious disease authority to coordinate things or send backups. <br /> <br /> I'm not a terror buff, so any horror I see is usually mixed with humor. From the mouse on the blood bank you can see that this will have the right balance of horror and comedy for most viewers; the sheer number of rats is impressive and horror fans seem to be satisfied as well.
