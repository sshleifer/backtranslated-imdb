Hari Om is about an impossible love between a French tourist and the driver of the auto-rickshaw, who agrees to take her on a date with her indifferent boyfriend. A sort of third-world road movie, ranging from the exuberant reverie to the crazy comedy, is distinguished by Vijay Raaz's stellar performance, which has become one of India's busiest actors after his appearance as an event planner at Mira Nair's Monsoon Wedding . <br /> <br /> In an interview, Raaz proves to be quite untouched by his success, responding cautiously and thoughtfully to the questions. He discovered a love of acting and joined a great theater troupe while in university, but for one with both formal training is surprisingly inarticulate about his craft. He speaks of honesty and purity as the sources of his approach, and the seriousness of his desire to communicate something authentic to the public is clear. On the screen, Raaz conveys emotional integrity and dramatic security that elevates his characterization to an extraordinary level, and director Bharatbala has thrown it and directed it perfectly. He has a wonderfully expressive face that the camera loves; close-ups of this face are as convincing as the photos of Camille Natta who is beautiful as the French Isa.
