I am very impressed with the comments I read about this film - generally well read, thoughtful and informed - obviously by people who like and think a lot about movies. I could not add anything to the excellent review work that the IMDb members have done. If I may, I would like to correct a small, but widespread, misunderstanding that appears in many of the reviews: Mr. Baseball was American and behaved in an ugly way, but he was not an ugly American. The original Ugly American was Homer Atkins, one of the heroes of Burdick and Lederer's 1958 homonymous novel, and the exact opposite of Baseball. Homer was an American archetype and an archetypal engineer - he went to Vietnam to work with people, he respected and liked the people he knew, he used appropriate and sustainable technology in cooperation with his hosts, and he was appreciated and respected by them precisely because he exemplified American democratic values ​​and virtues. His ugliness was purely facial, merely superficial; his personality and his humanity were deep and genuine. Mr. Baseball exemplifies all the rudeness, ignorance, and insecurity that we, Europeans and Americans, so often inflict upon other cultures; Homer Atkins, the ugly American, was the other side of our currency, representing our humanity and decency. I believe that ugly Americans still far outnumber Mr. Baseballs; they are still our last and best hope.
