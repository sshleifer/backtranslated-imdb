Jazz Singer is one of several films made in the late 1940s and 1950s about the Jewish experience in the United States. In addition to Crossfire (1947) and Gentleman's Agreement (1947), which dealt with anti-Semitism, they generally had a history of musical theater. These films included The Jolson Story (1946), Jolson Sings Again (1949), Eddy Duchin Story (1951), Eddie Cantor Story (1953), Benny Goodman Story (1956) and Margorie Morningstar (1958). The main actors in these "Jewish" movies have always been interpreted by non-Jews. For example, Larry Parks, a non-Jew, played Al Jolson and Gene Kelly played Noel Airman on Marjorie Morningstar. This casting was probably made to make the Jewish theme palpable to a primarily non-Jewish audience. The Jazz Singer (1952) is no different. Danny Thomas was a devout Catholic and Peggy Lee was certainly not Jewish, although she plays a non-practicing Jewess in the film. The clue to her past is when she attends the Golding family meal before entering, she says, "I have not been to any saddest service (Easter) since I left home." The movie is about a singer. son who has just left the service after seeing action in Korea. His dilemma is to become a singer, a family tradition or be a singer in musical theater. His choice of theater leads to an inevitable conflict with his father. <br /> <br /> However, there is much more to this movie than that. This film was made after the judgment of Rosenberg during the hunts of McCarthy and the blacklist of Hollywood. Therefore, in this film the Jews are shown as good loyal citizens and are quintessentiously American. The synagogue choir prefers playing baseball to practice. Singing friends also talk about baseball, in fact, one of them is a Major League referee. The synagogue itself dates back to 1790 and George Washington is said to have visited it. Therefore, the Jews are presented as part and parcel of American society. Nobody in this movie has an Eastern European accent. Peggy Lee appeared in a few movies. In this movie you can see her singing "Lover" and "Just One Of Those Things" wonderful. Danny Thomas is quite credible and he acts and sings very well the part. The comic routines could have been left out. Yes, the film is schmaltzy and sentimental, but worth seeing. I liked very much.
