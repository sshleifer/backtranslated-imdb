I was at the world premiere of this movie, and even met Todd a couple times in town (once at Olive Garden). Todd is not a bad guy, he's just a small time filmmaker with little to no budget and big dreams. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it's good if you like zombie movies with very little plot and lots of blood and guts. You get to see some Kansas City locations and lots of raw meat, what could be better? :-) Look for the same 2 dozen people playing different zombies (with only one change of clothes or hats). You can have a good drinking game with this movie, take a picture whenever you see the same zombie in a different shirt.
