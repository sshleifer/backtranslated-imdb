I must admit, I did not expect it to be as good as it was. I also did not expect Samuel L. Jackson to play slide and sing blue as well. <br /> <br /> The Cinemark of Beaver County PA does this often. They announce movies in the lobby, make you all excited to see it and then disappoint you for not showing it ... <br /> <br /> I hoped that with such a large cast of Jackson and Ricci and even one former N'Syncer (Timberlake), that this movie would have at least shown for a week. But no, at the time, as I recall, the MI3 was appearing on 3 screens (or some other kind of blockbuster). Like Blues Brothers and Crossroads, this movie incorporates the mystic and the legend of what blues music is. Passion and hard times. Religion and Sex. Dogs from the hell of the past. Redemption. I mean, a lot of elements go into the blues to make it work. <br /> <br /> That was just a good story. Of course, many people will not see it because there are no pirates or oscillating spiders. But there's Samuel L. Jackson ... <br /> <br /> Think about what happens to the Jacksons character from Pulp Fiction after he walks on the ground and sets out and essentially describes him for a "T". /> <br /> Great and underrated, but are not they all good anyway?
