When I first saw the poster for this film, I discarded it as another low-budget movie aimed at young people. After a few days, when it finally hit the theaters, one of my friends told me it's a good one. <br /> <br /> A year later, the first time I saw the ad, Anand was to be broadcast on television and the moment finally arrived as I flipped channels and for a moment I stopped to watch and this is what I ended up watching the entire movie. <br /> <br /> And now, 3 years later I watched the movie at least 7-8 times and I really do not watch movies again and again !! <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it tries to be different, when all Telugu movies were composed of 6 songs and 4 fights. <br /> <br /> It's a simple movie, a bit slow, but a very moving script, there are no loose ends in the film, very well versed dialogues, which is really very difficult <br /> <br /> music is both classic and relaxing, great renditions of Radha Krishnan, some great kirtanas also appear in bgmusic throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Cinematography deserves mention. The editing is not good, but suitable for a romantic like that. <br /> <br /> But what really impresses you in this movie are two things: 1. the way each scene was treated with the greatest respect, the now famous Shekar Kammula. <br /> <br /> 2. The beautiful letters of Veturi. <br /> <br /> And one more thing deserves a special mention, Kamalini, part of his success attributed to Sunitha, for lending him such a beautiful voice, to really tell you, the voice does wonders to <br /> /> The other actors are equally good, Raja in the title character and the little girl, and the way she screams when she gets a new dog. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I can tell you that this movie is about to be another classic with those classic romantic classics, along with another classic and romantic piece from Kammula, Godavari.
