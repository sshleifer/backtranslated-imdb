I loved this movie !! Jack Black and Kyle Gass probably made one of the best comedies since Up in Smoke. This movie has something for everyone: rock, drugs and Satan. What more could anyone want? I suggest this movie to anyone who wants to sit back and forget all the problems in the world and have a good laugh. Even if the film does not do well in theaters, it's sure to become a cult classic. I suggest everyone watching the movie catch the first D album because a lot of the jokes are just made funnier if you've heard the songs (like JB's obsession with Sasquatch and the epic battle against the devil). is guaranteed to laugh even if you have not heard their music, but the songs are so good that you can not pass up.
