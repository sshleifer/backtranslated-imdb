I recently read the story to see how these two combine, and if you can believe, this movie improves Balzac. History is moved, I think, to convey the idea that Colonel Chabert is a man who has suffered greatly and yet comes home not as a hero but as a pariah. <br /> <br /> As someone mentioned I was initially confused if Chabert was similar to the return of Martin Guerre. No. It is firmly established by Balzac that Chabert is the real deal. What's interesting, though, is not it, is not it, but how does his wife and society treat him? <br /> <br /> I think this is a timeless story of men struggling for country and when they get home time has left them behind. Chabert is a tragic figure made even more moving by the incredible Gerard Depardieu. I do not care that he's in 1 million movies, he's captivating. <br /> <br /> Fanny Ardant has a horrible character to play. Once a prostitute, Rose used her feminine wiles to climb the social ladder. Are your emotions true for Compte Ferraud? I think they are and maybe couple with that with your social position at the time, and you begin to feel some empathy for it. <br /> Fabrice Lucini is slowly infiltrating my heart. He is exceptional here as Derville. <br /> <br /> I think if you can get your hands on this gem of a movie, you will not regret it. French cinema at its best.
