Airplane aside, I do not think I've ever laughed much of a movie in my entire life. <br /> <br /> I love football like crazy but I hate almost any song or movie about football as they tend to be unrealistic. That was not it. <br /> <br /> I watched it once, it was over 2 years ago and it was brilliant. Everyone I know loved it. I remember the gay physiotherapist, the 45 degree tilt angle, and 'Shoes' (a so-called player because he showed up to train in a new pair of sneakers). Brilliant, that's what happens in park football. <br /> <br /> A definite 10/10. If anyone in the TV industry is reading this, considering all the crap you repeat on English TV, please have the good sense to show it again (and the Muppets while you're at it). Also anyone knows if this was shown on BBC or ITV. I think it was ITV, so it's worth asking if they intend to show it again. They should do it.
