This TV series is about a foolish and unconventional English gentleman who faces all kinds of merry mishaps. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing Mr. Bean with my family in 1990, when I was a child. My family was laughing so hard at all the episodes, and their content still appears in our daily conversations twenty years later. The memorable scenes that are still in my head include Mr. Bean trying to get out of his parking lot, turning out the lights, counting sheep and him in the pool. We bought all the videos of Mr Bean on VHS, no matter how expensive they were. It was worth it because we watch them again and again! It is so rare to see a very funny TV series that is suitable for all ages.
