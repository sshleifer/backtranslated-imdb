A jewel of a British comedy. Poor American Pinky Green (Richard Jordan, playing another villain but this time a lovable one) leaves a British prison and tries to move on, but his job as a banker is too attractive to his criminal friends who have never reformed. , led by a really nasty Ivan (David Niven in one of his last roles). Pinky resists, but the attraction of all this money is too much for him. Things unfold and unfold and everything is pleasurable to watch. Jordan must have played 20 bad guys in his career but he has never played the same twice - this is just too kind to hate. Niven never played a bad guy, whole oil. Two great actors that we lost and I wish we had back.
