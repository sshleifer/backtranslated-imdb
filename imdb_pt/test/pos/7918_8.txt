It is important to realize that Eisenstein was a committed Marxist filmmaker who held some very specific and particular theories about what the film could achieve, and how. <br /> <br /> It is simply useless to compare Alexander Nevsky to anything from a similar period in the USA; this film comes from the oldest film school in the world, from another continent, from a totally different approach to cinema. <br /> <br /> To enjoy this film a bit more, try to discover the theories of Pudovkin and Kuleshov's montage. , for example, or read Wikipedia's entry on Marxist film theory. If you are feeling really bold, you can even investigate the triadic forms of Hegelian dialectics. <br /> <br /> It follows that if you watch this movie without some understanding of Eisenstein's ideas and ideals, you probably will not. this. In Alexander Nevsky, the main characters are not interpreting themselves, they are made to distill the character of their nation. Nevsky and his generals are deliberately shown in larger size than life because they represent heroic and stylized aspects of the entire Russian people. <br /> <br /> The performance is not wooden but rather polite. It represents a school completely different from the more naturalistic narrative style that Hollywood adopted quickly. Eisenstein's films are specially designed to be realistic. If something seems a bit "obvious", be it enlightenment, language or a pose struck by an actor, it is to be so. Eisenstein was one of the earliest proponents of cinema as an art form, not just entertainment. <br /> <br /> If the editing sometimes seems to consist of a clash of images, well, that's the idea. The shots are made to contrast with each other, Eisenstein's films contain and incorporate elements of a political / philosophical argument, that is, the Marxist dialectic. <br /> <br /> So sit down, yell alive for Russia and your defenders of the popular hero, boo nobly cowards and teutonic invaders, and enjoy the difference.
