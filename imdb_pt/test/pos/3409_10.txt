"North & South," the television miniseries is for the 1980's what "Rich Man, Poor Man" was for the '70s. <br /> <br /> It's a fabulous adaptation of the first classic novel in the trilogy of author John Jakes. The story itself covers the two decades leading up to the election of President Abraham Lincoln and the imminent proclamation of the Civil War - North versus South. Intertwined stories evolve around the families of Risks (the 'North' in the title) and the Mains and their two central figures of George and Orry who form a friendship as they embark on their training at West Point in 1842. <br /> <"North & South" is a wonderful historical timeline and as I age (and more wise!) I am very interested in learning about the contrasting attitudes toward controversial aspects like "Slavery" and "Abolitionists", and how these attitudes originated. The series also portrays some major characterization developments as we meet the friends and enemies of George and Orry's life, as well as the women who stole their hearts when they were young. This aspect of the story also reveals a romantic tale that is set for the turbulent scene of the American Civil War. "North and South" along with "Rich Man, Poor Man" is overshadowed in 1977 "Roots" as the greatest miniseries of all time. However, it comes in second / third close and also shares the same timeline type and themes as "Roots". But do not let this escape, even if only to see the great scenery, costumes and the brilliant cast of stars including Gene Kelly, Johnny Cash, Elizabeth Taylor, James Stewart, Olivia De Havilland and Lesley-Anne Down. et al. <br /> <br /> The series is very well crafted and tightly linked to real historical events and it's a shame that the Emmy and the Golden Globes have not honored the actors and actresses much for their portraits. Patrick Swayze and James Read, the two key virtual actors unknown at the time, have compelling performances as Orry Main and George Hazard, respectively. However, it is the fascinating performance of Kirstie Alley as George's 'Abolitionist' sister, Virgilia, who steals the show many times. In addition, Terri Garber, David Carradine and Philip Casnoff as Elkanah Bent are the delightful villains of the play you simply love to hate. <br /> <br /> Books 1 & 2 "North and South" are already available in two sets of DVDs. .
