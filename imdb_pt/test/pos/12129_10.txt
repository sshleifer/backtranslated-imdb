"Let me ask one more question" Ha! that great soon .. this brilliant film was brilliant acting, great screenplay. The only reason no one noticed was because of the low budget that everyone agrees with me that it's a cult like "Donnie Brasco", shows a young Joe Pesci once again as a mafioso, this movie is his with the cults. had some sopranos and some good friends chased his idea to the sopranos when he watched it and Scorsese found Joe Pesci while watching, it proves that it must be a great I'm right or I'm wrong 'eh? I have to admit they showed a brilliant scene where they were throwing peanuts at a camp piano player "Stop with the friggen peanuts".
