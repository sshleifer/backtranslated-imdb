I found this movie to be filled with irony. But watching the movie you can almost see what will happen. Leila is a confused and bored wife who is constantly looking for happiness. When she thinks she finds true happiness, she clings to it, leaving behind all that she knows. But she finds herself almost comparing notes between her ex and her current husband. She had learned that if she had communicated more about what had bothered her in her previous marriage, she could have been recovered much more easily than she had intended. She realizes that words are nothing without action, but she finds that far in her second marriage and finds herself looking back and waiting for change once again. The main conflict in this film is Leila vs. herself. You can not have true happiness without being truly happy. I liked this movie but I would only recommend this movie to women, I can not see a man actually finding pleasure in this movie.
