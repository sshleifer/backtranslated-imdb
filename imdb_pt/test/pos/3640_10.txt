This film, based on a real story by Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best movies I have ever seen about race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson from the turmoil of the 1980s in South Africa. I place it on the scale of American History X in that it is a representation of how a young man can be seduced by Aryan doctrine and how the "right" of the Christian church taught a false doctrine about race to justify an injustice. <br /> <br /> It is a strong message of forgiveness and redemption, it is one of the rarities in the movies of today. Violence is well done to show the gravity of Gerrit's crimes and the magnitude of his transformation. <br /> <br /> A word about Jan Ellis who represented Gerrit Wolfaardt. He takes you through the darkness of Gerrit's early days to his enlightened transformation. He has been to some dark places as an actor and should be praised for his acting. <br /> <br /> Another highlight was Mpho Lovinga, who plays Moses Moremi, a victim of Gerrit's crimes. He was able to pull from some places of pain that really touched you as you watched his performance. <br /> <br /> Very good movie to show teenagers.
