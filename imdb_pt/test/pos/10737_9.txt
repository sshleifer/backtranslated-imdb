I consider myself lucky to have watched a wonderful movie with two wonderful actors. "Kramer vs. Kramer" was great for me because I think I could relate to it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, my parents are divorced. Even though I was older than Billy in this movie, I felt his pain and confusion. Having two parents you thought happy and ending up hating is the worst. Through this movie, in fact, I think it made me realize that my parents are people too, and they had as much pain as my sister and I had. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie, that was a good idea. 1. Yes it is dated and Meryl and Dustin are very young. But I would recommend this to many people because I think most can relate in some way. There are funny, sad, happy and relieved moments that are taken away by these great actors. It's a good movie and deserves more credit than a 7.5. <br /> <br /> 9/10
