Critics and audiences practically criticized this movie, but I really did not think it was that bad! Even the critics I usually agree with the thought that was crap, and I usually scorn "PG-13" horror movies. So that means one of two things: or (1) I'm very easily satisfied, and my taste for movies has declined over the years, or (2) 'When a Stranger Calls' is not as horrible as it is made to be. Now to be fair, some of the film's criticisms are true - there is not much character development, and not much happens in history. But dude, people alive, how much were you expecting from a movie about a babysitter being chased? Cut them some slack! As an ex-nanny who was watching this movie late at night with the lights off, I can safely say that the stalker guy was a scary mold! Who knows? I think things like that make me crazy. <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit that I enjoyed watching this, and I do not care about the large minority that puts me in this;)
