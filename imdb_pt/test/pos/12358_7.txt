It is a mistake to refer to any movie of that time as a horror movie. Most early German films with supernatural themes are not so much horror movies as they are dark fantasies borrowed from the works of early German romantics like E. T. A. Hoffman and others. In "Der Mude Tod" by Fritz Lang (also from 1921), personified death takes a young man away from his lover, but in Lang's film the fate of the characters can not be mitigated by behavior. None of the young lovers deserve to die, but they are destined by circumstances to be gathered only in death. <br /> <br /> In "Korkarlen" by Victor Seastrom, however, repentance is always an option. Destiny can be changed - and death postponed - through the choices of the characters. Although scenes from the Ghost Alliance collecting souls are genuinely sinister, these ghastly images of Death as the great leveler are compromised by the offer of redemption from Death to the true monster of that story, David Holm, a brutal drunk who, because of a perverse hatred of mankind it spreads tuberculosis and emotional misery to everyone with whom it comes in contact. <br /> <br /> A New Year's Eve is slaughtered in a fight with a drinking companion. As the first person to die in the course of midnight, Holm must become the Ghost Chariot driver and collect souls during the new year. The Ghost Transport, directed by an old acquaintance who had initiated Holm on his way to ruin, comes to seek his soul and leads him on a journey of self-discovery. Along the way, Holm sees the horror he inflicted on his family and the people who tried to help him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps my disappointment at the end of the film is a criticism of Selma Lagerl√∂f's novel in which the film is based. But I would rather see David Holm unable to escape his fate, and see his regret come too late to prevent his wife poisoning her two sons and herself, and to see Holm suffer for the consequences of his sins by being forced to do so. Collect your souls. It would have been an appropriate punishment and a horror more than testifying to the abuse he inflicted on others. In the film, however, the unalterable nature of fate is not the message; redemption is. The chauffeur of the chariot allows Holm's spirit to return to his body, and he rescues his family in the nick of time. His regret reeks of Scrooge's regret in "A Christmas Carol." <br /> <br /> If the banal and sentimental ending does not offend you, there is still much to admire in the film's images. Special effects are astonishing when measured by the patterns of the day, and still hold, which is more miraculous when one considers that these double exposures were created within a crank camera. In addition, the restored movie on the new Tartan DVD looks fabulous.
