Jon Cryer reprises his role as a neurotic guy in Two and a Half Men, which he perfected in this series. He wants to have a good relationship with a girl as his co-worker has developed, and tet-a-tet between him and his partner's best friend is pretty funny. Then they realize they are attracted to each other and start dating. On one of the funniest lines on TV - I think in the final episode - he and his partner are arguing that he wants to propose to the girl. <br /> <br /> Your partner prepares you for the moment by suggesting, "What's the worst that can happen? She says no." <br /> <br /> Armed with the newly discovered optimism, he proposes his dinner. To which she replies, "GOD, no!" <br /> <br /> I laughed so hard that I cried.
