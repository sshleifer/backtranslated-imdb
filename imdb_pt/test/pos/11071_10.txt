WOW I love this movie. This is definitely added to my list of Ghetto Movies. <br /> <br /> Juice - Starring Tupac 'I do not giva F ***' Threat II Society - O-Dawg 'I'm going to smoke Anyone, I just do not giva F ****' New Jersey Drive - Hey they steal cars in broad daylight, they obviously do not giva f *** New Jersey Drive is the best cover movie ever. He is at the top of the list, the society threatens II is the second, and the juice is the third, Clockers is really stupid. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of New Jersey Drive is Pwnage also Mac Mall & Young Lay - Everything about my fetti is heard in the movie. <br /> <br /> Lords of the underground <br /> Burning rubber, another good song, and so is the Ill & Al Scratch - do not hang up on a player <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of GTA- SA, will love this movie, and the incredible soundtrack. The soundtrack is basically Rap about stealing cars ^ _ ^ SWEETTTT Movie!
