I'm not sure if discussing the television series is exactly where comments should be taken, however, it's on television where The Lone Ranger really made a name for itself. Not even referring to the original radio broadcasts of this masked pilot of the plains, they went though referring to a point where in a boy, about 9 or 10 years old, I was to see the movie, "The Lone Ranger" and never forget it. I remember I was in a line or we were moving towards the Paramount Theater - the theater was located in the theater district, if I remember correctly. It was directly on the other side, going from east to west of the building that has the ball falling on the New Year - of course, if anyone does not know, New York City.High Above the street on the roofs there was a time and maybe even today even huge billboards would announce what was being shown and so on. It was at that moment that I looked up and was never more impressed as I was when I looked at that billboard to get The Loner Ranger, on the other side of the roof - It was great - impressed and never forgotten.

It was in this movie that we learned that the Lone Ranger will not shoot to kill, but to hurt, so as to allow the law to be the judge. This kind of thinking is worth it. so we can learn something from history. It is here that we learn that Tonto discovers the fallen Archer and sees the symbol of childhood friendship that The Lone Ranger established years earlier when he, as a younger person, was an advisor to a child. Young man wounded in Tonto - To the given advisor, Tonto gave his faithful friend, a symbol of his thanks which was now part of a necklace that Tonto recognized. Fool said, "You are Kemosabe." So Lonto tells the story of this "rusty squire" (the meaning of Kemosabe) I think the Lone Ranger is one of the true heroes of the silver screen and one of the great It must also be stated that these highly respected individuals Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels sought to live there lives according to The Lone Ranger legend-It may well be that there is an inspiring story in the history of the Lone Ranger and his faithful companion Tonto.I was so pleased with the ability to find and buy the DVDs that I stayed up every Saturday morning and watched the many episodes now available.Long Live The Lone Ranger and his faithful companion Tonto-Hi-Ho Silver-
