This movie is probably the best of Hal Hartley. The subject, of an unusual originality, is treated (this is common with Hal Hartley) with great humor. This characteristic is by no means the only quality of this film: the demanding composition of the picture (everything is parallel, even the smallest details), shooting angles, lighting, giving a more supernatural dimension to these blurred images (Jesus' could be filmed in a conventional way), the acting falsely "poser", are qualities that make this re-reading of the Bible, realized in the form of an essential apocalyptic delirium.
