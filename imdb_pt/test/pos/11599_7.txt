I saw this movie at the Locarno Film Festival in part of Italian-speaking Switzerland. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai is very similar. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 7/10 because of its good times. <br /> <br /> * spoilers ahead * <br /> <br /> There are some really nice cinematic moments, especially in the end. <br /> <br /> Although my general feeling This is very long (more than 2 hours and 40 minutes) and containing many dialogues. And there is almost no dance. <br /> <br /> Clearly, a Bollywood movie like Lagaan or Devdas is a kind of movie quite different from Chokher Bali.
