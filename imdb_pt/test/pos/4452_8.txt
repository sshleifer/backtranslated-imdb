I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of the development of stories and characters. Fulci was a master at creating a horrendous atmosphere using inventive camera work, vivid cinematography, and yes - wonderfully explicit gore. <br /> <br /> This movie is no exception, however, compared to his later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2, Town near the Graveyard, etc.) the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis runs away from the supernatural and is more about the suspense created by a classic dunnit among the green hills of Italy. The setting is at times reminiscent of cherished folklore and then immediately contrasted by mud and blood-drenched terror enveloped by ruined ruins. The blood in this film is not as prevalent and seems contained in comparison to the later films of Fulci, however, fans of splatter and giallo will probably be satiated by some close-ups of exuding wounds and the last 5 minutes of the film. > Overall, a fantastic and mature film from one of our great Italian horror directors.
