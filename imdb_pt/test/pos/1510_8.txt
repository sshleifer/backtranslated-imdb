Un Gatto nel Cervello, or Nightmare Concerto as it is most commonly known among the English speaking public, begins when director of horror films Lucio Fulci (played by the man himself Lucio Fulci) is going to have lunch after filming a scene very bloody and violent, however he asks for steak and has a horrible vision related to cannibalism. Grotesque visions, hallucinations and dreams continue and begin to affect his mental state, Fulci decides to seek help and contacts with Professor Egon Schwarz (Dvid L. Thompson) for psychiatric help. Schwarz states that Fulci can not separate fantasy from reality and agrees to help him, however Schwarz has a ulterior motive more sinister as a serial killer begins to brutally kill prostitutes and Fulci thinks he may be responsible .... < This Italian production was co-written and directed by Lucio Fulci, who also starred in the film as a director of horror films called Lucius Fulci, who did not really feel much effort, however Un Gatto nel Cervello It's cruel if nothing else and just for that I liked it. The screenplay by Fulci, John Fitzsimmons, Giovanni Simonelli and Antonio Tentori is nothing more than a shredded excuse to edit together many bloody images from other Italian films. It serves its purpose well enough I suppose & see Fulci on the screen has a certain fascination if you are a fan of him or are familiar with your films, the ending is very rushed almost as if they ran out of money because he only has a police officer telling Fulci they killed the killer and that's it. Another thing about that ends when the two policemen put the white sheet on the dead murderer in the field and then they leave leaving him there without any other police presence, I mean, the police in Italy would leave a corpse in the middle of a field for own account? It moves at a good pace and if you like your blood then you have to see this, although if you do not like blood then you will hate it with a passion, it all depends on your willingness to have the staff it's your choice. <br /> <br /> Director Fulci has never been the most artistically adept filmmaker and shows here how his filming is bland, flat and looks like it was filmed for TV, the filming of the other films (7 in total) does not match with the footage Fulci shot and it is obvious that this was patched up from different films. If you are looking for blood, you have the jackpot, people are dismembered with chainsaws, placed on meat grinders, faces are melted, there are some decapitations, there are some carved throats, someone's body is crushed under a car, a tongue is torn off, someone has a crushed throat when a wheelchair passes through it, there are many stab wounds, somebody has their entrails removed with a hook, there is a rotten corpse full of worms, somebody is cut off, someone has a crushed head In his eye drops, a bloody death by the piano wire while cutting someone's throat, there are a lot of severed limbs, scattered blood gallons and a scene of some cats eating brains and there's more too. Having said that some of the special effects are a little fake and look extravagant. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 100,000, this is very cheap, has no visual style or artistic merit, but then again, why would you want this when you could see a sequence of orgies Nazis and one wall to wall? The acting on it is terrible, including Fulci. <br /> <br /> Un Gatto nel Cervello is a cutting edge movie, if you are a gore-hound like me, however, if you are looking for something with a little more substance or even any substance then this is not for you. This is the kind of movie that divides people right in the middle, or you love what you do or hate you.
