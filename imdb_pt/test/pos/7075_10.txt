A great story, though we are certainly familiar. Meryl Streep proves she is truly the best actress in the cinema today. So much fun, and just what I expected. Do not go see this movie unless you are prepared to be used and manipulated emotionally, but if you have that expectation then you will enjoy the ride .....
