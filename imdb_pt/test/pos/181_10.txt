While Boris (Aleksey Batalov) goes out to fight in the war against the Germans by his mother Russia, his beloved Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) marries his conniving cousin Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin) in a moment of weakness shortly after his parents are killed in a air raid over Moscow. Through various judgments and betrayals, Veronika will wait for the word or the letter of Boris, no matter how long it takes, holding the hope that he will return to her. <br /> <br /> Powerful piece of film production has simply amazing photographic work by director of photography Sergei Urusevsky. Some of the many framed magnificent pictures include the scene in which the camera follows Veronika through a crowd of loved ones saying goodbye to each other as she runs through the crowd of bodies to say goodbye to Boris ... and fails to reach him . even as we watched Boris looking impatiently at the unlucky swarm. The sequence after the airstrike in which Veronika climbs the stairs that go up circling the destroyed building that she called home and the scene in which Mark does his lust in Veronika while another attack continues outside the building while the wind stirs the curtains and the flashes The light emanating from within are just two of many examples where Sergei Urusevsky shows his genius at framing images that will last forever in the movies. But without the power and tragedy of the story of how war can forever shape the fate of a deeply loved couple, this film could not just stand the beauty of the visual. Together, however, we were left with an incredible film ... simply an astonishing masterpiece of the Soviet Union after Stalin breathed his last. I feel honored to have seen such a good movie.
