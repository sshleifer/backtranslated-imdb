Sweet young nurse Charlotte Beale (a charming performance of the ravishing redhead knockout Rosie Holotik) will work in a remote rural asylum run by Dr. Geraldine S. Masters (the excellent Annabelle Weenick). Among the motley variety of crazily colored patients are the insatiable and aggressive nymphomaniac Allyson King (the luxurious Betty Chandler), the loquacious Judge Oliver W. Cameron (a gloriously mischievous Gene Ross), Vietnam's paranoid veteran Sergeant Jaffee (kindly played by Hugh Feagin), Gentle Giant Sam (the nice William Bill McGhee), and the old crazy Mrs. Callingham (the extremely annoying Rhea MacAdams). Such patients are dangerously encouraged to portray their fantasies by Dr. Masters, which, of course, results in a series of brutal murders. Director S.F. Brownrigg, working from an intelligent script and appropriately drafted by Tim Pope, does a specialist job of creating and sustaining a suffocating and somber atmosphere of bursting madness and oppressive claustrophobia. Robert Farrar's scary prank, the dirty scenography, some terrible murders, the frenetic cinematography of Bruce B. Alcott, many delightfully robust histrionics and unusual sets of an unnamed game (Ross in particular is a total eye and the shocking surprise surprise of the bloodbath add up even more to the troubled and troubled fun of this cheap and despicable piece of regional cinema of low-budget horror exploration of the 70s.
