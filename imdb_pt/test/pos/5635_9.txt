When we are young, we all choose an ideal occupation for ourselves: artist, actor, writer, rocket scientist, etc. While most of us grow out of our dreams, the main character in the American movie, Mark, still needs to let go (and in his thirties too): become a rich acclaimed director. Despite the fact that Murphy's Law will not leave Mark alone and something always seems to go wrong, Mark is able to persevere during each incident with an even greater boost to achieve his goals. His desire to be a director controls his character in such a way that he sees any person or thing in his life as something to be explored to achieve the goal. While I noticed that other IMDB commentators are criticizing Mark's selfishness, I think it's a kind of selfishness almost justified because for Mark not to become a famous director is tantamount to death. He talks endlessly about leaving some kind of brand in the world, and he sees the cinema as a way to do it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately any viewer in this movie realizes early that Mark has a zero chance of achieving his dream. Is he aware of this? No, not at all, and none of your family or friends want to let you into the secret (actually, even some of them believe in it). Strangely, however, the disappointing future that the viewer feels will certainly occur for Mark does not preclude the ability to find humor in the film. This is a very funny documentary. Most of the laughter comes from when Mark is shooting scenes for "Coven." There is a scene where an actor has to have his head breaking a locker, and it just is not working. Another scene has Mark's very old uncle, saying a few lines to the camera; Needless to say, after 20 takes of a lot of headscratching and line-stumbling Bill finally decides he's had enough. A lot of humor comes sadly from Mark himself. His script, which he seems to think is a Pulitzerer, is laughable: "All right, all right, there's something to live for, Jesus told me." <br /> <br /> "American film" is, contrary to what people might think, a documentary that anyone can appreciate (even though my sister, who watched some scenes, seemed to think it was completely bizarre). The fact that Chris Smith can successfully bring to the screen a film that inspires both the sadness of Mark's depressing lifestyle and the hilarity with scenes with Bill (which unfortunately passed away before the film was released) tells a lot about him. I wonder how the dreamer Mark considers this documentary. Does he realize that this puts him in a bad light? Or who prepares to show you like a fool in many scenes of the movie? Or does he see this as something that will be shown before his own segment of A & E Biography? It is an intriguing subject of admiration, and I hope that the latter becomes true to him someday. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie: 9/10.
