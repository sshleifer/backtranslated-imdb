No doubt about it. This is the short animation that put Uncle Walt on the map of success. When Walt's older brother Roy suggested that the next Mickey Mouse short should include sound, Walt grabbed the chance. The result: Steamboat Willie was a big success in 1928. It was, after all, the first short animated track with a synchronized soundtrack (mainly music and sound effects, since the dialogue was minimal). It does not sound like a wet blanket, but the short one is far from perfect. Before 1935, the animation was a shaky and somewhat herky jerky (but when the equipment made improvements and better artistic techniques emerged, the rest was smooth), and the sound was primitive (Disney wanted to use the then well-known RCA Sound System , or the Western Electric Noiseless sound system, but was declined by the two companies, prompting Disney to use the Photophone system that PA Powers was experimenting with at the time. The plot (is there a real plot here?) Concerns Mickey (as the aforementioned Willie) is the pilot of a steamboat, who is terrified by Black Pete (Captain Pete for you), and decides to make a jam session in the ship, using various animals on board as musical instruments (ASPCA, note). If you do not think much about the technical deficiencies, Steamboat Willie can be eight minutes of fun (and a piece of history).
