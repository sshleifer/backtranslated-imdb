If you liked Butterfly Effect, Donnie Darko or The Machinist, you'll love K-Pax as well. <br /> <br /> For me, this movie was very entertaining and depressing in the end. Spacey offers great performance like Prot. In addition, we can not forget the appearance of Saul Williams in the film, of whom I am a big fan. <br /> <br /> After watching it, I recommended the movie to many of my friends, and everyone was practically exploding. though. <br /> <br /> But even so, it is greatly underestimated, perhaps because of the lack of action and explosions. I'm sorry, this is not a movie about blowing things up, it's about how humans behave, and how people live in worlds that do not exist. <br /> <br /> Go ahead and enjoy.
