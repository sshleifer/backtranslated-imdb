Not only was this movie fun but it took me back to the memory with its true soundtrack of life. Those were the things we were saying, and doing ... these were the songs we were listening to ... all during that same time period, around the same time, right in Southern Alabama. I may not have been one of the skateboarders, but I was definitely one of the observers, sitting on the curb with the old transistor radio, listening to Neil Young, watching the bravest of what I expected, as they put spinning on his boards surfing on wheels, applying the tricks of Alva and Adams, hoping that perhaps for a brief moment they would adopt the Zephyr style. It just shows how we all were on those wonderful days. ~ KLJ
