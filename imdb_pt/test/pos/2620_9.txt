This episode of Charmed changed everything! The show is about to end the third season, and all hell is loosening up in this episode. The Charmed bring an innocent named Dr. Griffiths to the manor that protects him from Shax, the killer of the fountains. When Shax attacks, he explodes like a tornado and then corporealizes into his demonic skin. He explodes Prue threw a wall that totally knocks her down and practically kills her. Then Piper blasts threw what's left of the wall. Phoebe comes from the attic and says the spell of maturing before Shax comes to kill the doctor. But being the One Power, it just hurts you. Leo comes to heal the other sisters and Prue wants to find Shax and destroy him for real. Phoebe, meanwhile, is in the underworld trying to find Cole. When Prue and Piper go out into the street to find the demon, the demon finds them. After the battle, the witches realize that a camera has taken everything! When they return to Manor trying to fight the media and after they win Shax, a witch who leaves, shoots Piper. Prue uses her telekinesis to get people out of the way so she can go to the hospital. But they are late and Piper dies. And just when Prue is about to be shot, time is rewound to where they take Dr. Griffiths to the Mansion. Shax blows and explodes Prue and Piper. But Phoebe is still in the Underworld, so Shax kills the doctor and explodes out of the Manor. When Leo finally arrives, he can not cure Prue. Prue is dead and so is the Power of Three. For now. In person. This episode was sad. Prue was the strong point of all of them. I would love to have your telekinesis power. I really do not think Phoebe should have gone to the underworld because if she did not, Shax would not have killed Prue. But Paige brings the power of the three together again and I'm happy with the progress of the show
