I came across this movie on TV. I had not heard of it before and almost changed the channel, but quickly got addicted. <br /> <br /> The story of the Burmese people's struggle against a military dictatorship was provoking. The level of brutality that some are willing to use to maintain power is hard to believe. I am grateful to live in a country where the government is not prone to throw people's streets. <br /> <br /> The story of Laura Bowman was a good discussion to keep the history of the political struggle together.
