For someone accustomed to comedy on television now - be it sketch, sitcom or animation, it's good to watch something really refreshing. <br /> <br /> The Chaser has to be the best comedy of this decade, with Seinfeld the ultimate triumph. . It follows the urban crusades of the hosts to correct situations, make "road tests" and try to get the facts of our politicians in the traditional way. <br /> <br /> Despite being very controversial at times, the show shows excellent quality. , from the well done and really funny opening credits up to the sketch style investigations (sketch style only in time, they are not scripted, at least not those on the other side of the joke) are certainly worth watching. Even the most cynical and intellectual spectator will not be disappointed, and the show deserves ten stars. <br /> <br /> Alright, well done to ABC for showing it and I highly recommend it.
