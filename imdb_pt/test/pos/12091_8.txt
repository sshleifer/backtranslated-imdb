'Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul' is one of the best music documentaries I've seen lately and it's more than a movie about music. It is also a declaration of musical love about a fabulous city, one of the largest cities in Europe and the world, one of the most important cities in Europe's history and for Islam, the city that can fill Europe and the Middle East in the future . can once again signify, as has already happened in history, the precipice between two worlds. <br /> <br /> Then there is the music. The film's interesting approach to music is that it starts with modern music, and we hear a lot (good) rock and rap in the first third of the movie. Then, as a backward movement in time, the soundtrack takes us to roots, traditional Turkish music, commercial novels and exotic instruments that are basic elements in the landscape of Turkish music. In a country as complex and conflicted as Turkey, the film does not avoid some political aspects, such as the censorship introduced by the military regime in the 1980s or the relevance of minority songs, especially Kurdish. One of the best musical moments is actually provided by a Kurdish singer with a fantastic voice singing in a hamam in the shape of a cathedral (Turkish bath). <br /> <br /> It is possible to love the city and its music until the end of the viewing and hearing of this film. I've never been to Istanbul, but having seen this movie, I'm sure I want to visit this place soon.
