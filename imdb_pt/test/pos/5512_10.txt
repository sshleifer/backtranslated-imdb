Dee Snider was inspired to make a two part song for a horror movie. This film he wrote / directed / produced and starred in detail on the themes of those songs (Horror-terria, from TwistedSister / Stay Hungry). People commented that he must have a sick mind to put something like that. I do not hear anyone making such comments about Stephen King, Wes Craven, Dean Koontz, or in his own time, Alfred Hitchcock. The film traces a modern psycho created by current trends in society. Personally, I thought it was done very well by sheer imagination and inspiration, also without the benefit of a large budget and interviews with actual victims / criminals. This movie is perfect if you want something to give you nightmares and make you shrink with the possible and probable. IT COULD HAPPEN!!
