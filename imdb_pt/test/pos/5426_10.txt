This movie is about humans. This movie was like my favorite short film of all time for years. <br /> <br /> Are not the simpler things that make life so much more interesting? We humans are so gentle, compassionate, funny, caring for each other in a moment - we invent the most beautiful and incredible machines to kill as many people as possible with the least effort in the next. In our short lives, we destroy our world, one another and many times, our own lives, than to spend the rest of our lives trying to mend what we have destroyed. Sometimes there's nothing left to fix! <br /> <br /> This movie can entertain us, educate us and even help us to realize what is wrong in our lives! Life is short and can be even shorter! The end is very optimistic, I'm scared. <br /> <br /> I love the mind of Richard Condie and what he does happen to that! <br /> <br /> Enjoy <br /> <br /> H.K.
