How this film is no longer widely considered is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I got him for Â£ 1, and I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the best pound I've ever spent on a movie. <br /> <br /> The thing that usually allows movies about the club scene is the music or the actual scenes filmed in clublandos. <br /> <br /> Here, the music and club scenes are completely credible, using some great melodies of the time, and filmed in real clubs, with people really looking like they want to be there. <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are of a high standard everywhere, although Jason Donovan in particular for me stands out (he was playing Frank N Furter on The Rocky Horror Show in London around the time he must have been filmed, so his drag phase was in full swing!) And of course, Tim Curry, who is eloquent The head of the pharmaceutical industry is compelling. <br /> <br /> Put simply, if you are a fan of British films, you have to see this, no matter if you like nightclubs as the film is strong and not as a story anyway. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
