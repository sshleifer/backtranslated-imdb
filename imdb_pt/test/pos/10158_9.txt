I've been into the Hitchcock series lately. I find myself always renting one of his movies when I'm at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video. As I said before, Hollywood is losing the touch incredibly, I needed a reminder that there are wonderful movies out there. Not to mention, I want to be a movie buff, not a movie buff. Is there any better way to do this than with Alfred Hitchcock's films? The man who has met a lot is another great and thrilling thriller starring James Stuart, Alfred's favorite leader and the woman who steals the show Dorris Day. They play husband and wife on vacation with son, but when a spy tells James some information that may hold another spy, his son is kidnapped and kept in ransom. James seems to only doubt Dorris and her ability to have ideas on how to recover her son, but she makes a great comeback and ends up being the hero of the film. <br /> <br /> The acting again, I would say that it was Dorris who overcame the entire cast. James did a great job, together, these two made you sit down and never move during the movie. I loved the bit of comedy in the end that Alfred added. You'll see what I mean. I always recommend this movie, although it's not Hitchcock's best movie, it's still a treasure. <br /> <br /> 9/10
