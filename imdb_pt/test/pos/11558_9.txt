When Melville's "Pierre; or The Ambiguities" hit bookstores in 1852, its first publication since "Moby Dick" a year earlier, the public response was similar to that found in IMDB's "POLA X" reviews. Newspapers even posted headlines such as "Melville Insane!" which of course he was not. But when one compares the writing styles found in "Moby Dick" and "Pierre," one finds in the latter a marked departure from the simple and often declamatory style found in the first. Clearly, he was mimicking the overflowing style of the now-forgotten Victorian novels that were easily surmounting his immortal "Moby Dick." He was not happy, however, to reveal the kind of product his publishers wanted, and he certainly would have sold. His version of a Victorian novel was perhaps distorted, cynical, but brilliant in its synthesis. The alternative title "Ambiguities" is quite appropriate. As Pierre seeks and thinks he finds the truth, we are becoming increasingly uncertain about what and who to believe. As you seek happiness, you become more and more unhappy. <br /> <br /> "POLA X" is a fascinating adaptation of this novel, set in modern or almost modern France. Although in some ways it leaves little to the imagination and shows us graphically the incestuous relationships that Melville could only suggest, the ambiguities that make the novel and its message so seductive are perfectly intact. The questions he raises are those few movies have thought of doing, but the answers are left to the viewer. <br /> <br /> I recommend a reading of the novel, which is much shorter than "Moby Dick", before seeing this movie. I hope more people find this movie tempting.
