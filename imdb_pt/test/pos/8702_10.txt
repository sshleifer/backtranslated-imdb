the subspecies series is always the best vampire films of all time. there's something about them that makes them special, I think it's the feeling you have when you see them. <br /> <br /> they are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they were in the 1700`s or 1800`s think it has something to do with the set that is used if yes, then it is work keep you face :). <br /> <br /> In a quick round up of What Happened in the First Part - Radu was allegedly banished from his homeland years ago by his father and he decided to go back and pick up what he thinks is his birth rite. the blood stone and all his father has, then he kills his father, who is played by Angus Scrimm (the tall man of the Phantasm movies). and takes the stone of blood that has power of emensa for who has it, because who has it never needs to kill someone again because the stone supposedly must drip the blood of the saints and each time Radu takes a drop of it, it is going slowly insane. (that's all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire was not bad enough). Well, Radu's brother, Stephan, tries to put an end to their perversities, trying at the same time to prevent themselves from clashing with a tourist who is staying in a house / fort belonging to a friend of his. <br /> Well, one thing leads to another and the two brothers are shocked and well, you will have to see the movie to see what happens from here. <br /> <br /> I will review / comment on the other sequences soon. The difference between this and buffy is buffy is very commercial and this is not so it will not appeal to everyone but this has a much higher buffy atmosphere although Radu does not look as good as the complete marvel Sarah Michelle Gellar :). <br /> <br /> rating for this 10/10 movie a good example of how a vampire movie should be done :). <br /> <br />
