Cleopatra (the delightful Monica Bellucci) is challenged by Caesar (Alain Chabat): to prove that the Egyptians are better than the Romans, she promises to build a fancy castle for Caesar in a period of three months without any delay. She calls the architect an Numerobis arm (Jamel Debbuzi) and gives him two options: be covered in gold if he fulfills his mission, or become crocodile food if he fails. Numerobis will ask for help for Panoramix (Claude Rich), Asterix (Christian Clavier) and Obelix (Geraard Depardieu) (with Ideiafix). This movie is very funny, especially the parts where Obelix and the Pirates led by Red Beard participate. However, the screenwriter and director should have noted that French is not a universal language like English is. So jokes with words (as in the Austin Powers movies, for example) do not work well for people unfamiliar with the French language. The French and fluent people in French will certainly enjoy these jokes, but they do not make sense to me, they do not speak French. My vote is seven.
