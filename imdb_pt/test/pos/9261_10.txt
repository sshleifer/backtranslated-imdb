Homicide: The Movie proved to be a good ending to a well-written, well-directed, well-performed series. The loose ends were tied and were not properly addressed at the end of the final season. The entire series, and especially the film, provided a true view of life (and death) in Baltimore, a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate. My attraction to the series began long before I moved to Baltimore, but once I experienced life here for myself, I realized how realistic it was. And the film certainly kept that spirit. I will certainly miss the new series' original episodes, but I am very grateful to NBC and the producers and the cast for giving us one last glimpse of the dark side of Charm City.
