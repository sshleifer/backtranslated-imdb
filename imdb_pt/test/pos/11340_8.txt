For a long time I did not know how long I liked this movie or not. This is surprising, because I usually know, but since the movie was not going anywhere, I was a bit confused. <br /> <br /> Two people move into a common home environment. Finding your spouses working constantly or out on business trips, your attention, out of sheer loneliness, wanders between you. After a case of platonic love, the male protagonist played by Tony Leung Chiu reveals that he has a lover on the side. Su Li-Zehn, played by Maggie Cheung, is injured, although his love affair has not been physically consummated. Chiu leaves the country, only to return years later, when everything has changed. <br /> <br /> For the role of the cynic, the film is correct. For never playing actively or really part of love, but only approaching, the film, admittedly, says more than so many others on the subject. It is also true, I think, that nothing good could have happened if they had the case. At least that's the feeling I have. If we want to believe, however, when Garica MÃ¡rquez writes that "... love is a state of grace, not means to anything, but the alpha and the omega, an end in itself, "So this movie falls far short of that, just like everyone else. Or, if you're inclined to the wholly incomplete minimalism, hit the mark. Which films in history have reached, addressed, or sustained this phrase for a brief period? My honest feeling in the memory is that about two. When Harry Met Sally effectively suggests this romantic perfection; and getting is all in just getting there. It is interesting that in When Harry Met Sally, this is done in the course of courting, not in its accomplishment. Can anyone say something good about love after having been reached by two individuals? Nicholas Spark's recent film, The Notebook, comes closer to this perhaps than any other film; we must believe that, once love is reached, it flies by radar only to exist in perfection in some other dimension, or, perhaps truer, to become a latent vehicle for other purposes? <br /> <br /> In Mood for Love is an honest film, with a dazzling and generous cinematography worthy in all respects of the best that Almodovar has to offer, but all it can say in the end is that "life is sometimes this way. "Now, this is by no means a shy thing to say, especially if well said, but the problem really comes at the end of the last act, when Kar Wai Wong tries to complete the film relating, only for the second time, a broader film. historical theme that touches the bottom of the relationship that just happened. This is a valuable endeavor, and the variation of the musical theme played throughout the film is quite brilliant, but the relatively free theme charge has little role to have much more than a superficial effect on the holistically inclined audience, letting the viewer split the film. difference, an error in any movie. A director must know where he is going and how to get there. But in all honesty, it's just a wrong turn. However, as everyone knows, a remarkable imperfection is enough to ruin the perfect barrel of honey. <br /> <br /> The effort, however, is definitely worth it; trying to let a historical theme enlarge and complete the film and elevate it beyond the micro-meaning of the couple, but without any real prediction, is the crucial error. In a word, and unfortunately, it's a bit too late. It is also, I think, a very big challenge for the non-Asian viewer who is not familiar enough with China's history to fully appreciate this radical blow.
