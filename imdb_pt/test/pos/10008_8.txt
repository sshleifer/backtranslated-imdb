"Stopping" can be as much about the exit of a preordained identity as about the withdrawal of drugs. As a rural guy who comes to Beijing, class and success must have struck that young artist's face as an appeal to separate from his roots and far outweigh the success of his peasant parents. Problems arise, however, when the new man is too young, when he demands a great estrangement from family, history, nature, and personal identity. The consequent divisions and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the common and the heroic are, on the one hand, the material of an intestinal examination or, on the other, the complete escape from the self. Hongshen slips into the latter and his long lonely road back to himself can be somber. <br /> <br /> But what an exceptionally convincing director of particularity, honesty and sensuality, Zhang Yang, and his actors, bring to this journey. No cliches, no stereotypes, no rigid gender roles, no scenes of necessary sex, romance or violence, no street language needed, and to start with, no money to float acts and whims. <br /> <br /> Hongshen Jia is in her early twenties. He is a talented, impressionable, vain, idealistic and perhaps emotionally hungry actor. The perfect recipe for your facilitators. Soon he is the "legal" actor, idolized by the youth. "It was hot in the early nineties." "He always had to be the most elegant." He needs extremes and goes into heavy metal, takes earrings and a scarf. His acting means arts, friends and roles, but not the type that offers any challenge or personal contribution. And his self-criticism, numbed by the immediacy of success, opens the door to irrational self-doubt, self-hatred - "I did not know how to act" "I felt like a phony" - and readily available medicines to fight them. He says, "I had to get stoned to do what the director wanted." Thus, his superficial identity as an actor becomes, via drugs, an escape from identity. <br /> <br /> Hongshen's withdrawal from drugs and his false life is very gradual, intermittent - and stubbornly self. Solitude, space, meditative thinking, refusal of speech, substitute therapy. The summary is out. And much of its change takes place outdoors - not in idealized places, but mostly in green stretches under Beijing's highways, bridges and skyscrapers. The physicality is almost romantic, but it is not. Bike rides to Ritan Park, long spontaneous walks, sun drenched rain and rain, lawn picnics, celestial patterns and parrots that absorb your reflections are very specific. He shifts to arrive, all the time picking up clues to a more realistic and realistic identity. "I started to open up," he says of this period in retrospect. And the contact seems to start with his slender body designing a type of dancer positioning (clumsy, graceful, funny, revealing) in a current circumstance. If the mind or spirit is missing, your legs may force you to walk all night. <br /> <br /> Central to your return is the rejection of defined roles. To punctuate his acting end and his determination to a new identity, he crushes his videos and TV, and bangs his bloody head against his "John Lennon Forever" poster. He has let down his iconic anti-establishment artist - but he is the only viable guide he knows. He even imagines himself as the son of John (Yoko Ono) and adopts his "Mother Mary" as intercessor in his "hour of darkness" and "time of trouble." (the painful, shaky pain in the park - hallucinatory and skidoid) "Music is much more real than acting," he says. And he speaks of Lennon's influence as "showing me a new way." At the mental institute, life-saving apples (resistance, nourishment) reflect Lennon's presence, as well as Hongshen's need to hang back his hero's poster in his redecorated room. <br /> <br /> If Lennon's influence is witty, that of Hongshen's father's influence is paramount. Although father and son are actors and users (drugs and drink), it is Fegsen's differences from the son who subscribes to his change. For the father he is safer in himself: he accepts that he is Chinese, a peasant in a line of peasants, a director of rural theater. And he exercises control over his habit and his emotions. It is this recognizable identity that leads Hongshen to treat it as a sounding board, sometimes with anger and anger, sometimes with humor (jeans, the Beatles) and passivity. In his most mad and violent exchange with his father, in which he accuses him of lying and false, he exposes more of himself than his father: "all the acts that I had practiced before were bullshit ... life is bullshit. "And to the emphatic" you are not my father, "he responds gently," why can not a peasant be your father? " <br /> <br /> Under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother, sister, friends, inmates at the rehab center, he makes some tangible connection with a real (not integer) self. As the long-term effects of the drug subside, so does its old identity. Indebtedness replaces pride, distrust of trust. Integrity bane your black cloud. All its edges soften. "You're just a human being," he repeats indefinitely after being released from failure to refuse medication. Back home, peasant soap is fine with him now. And his old "rare and true friendships" begin again, as is evident in the back of the sad scene of about a lap with his musician friend. Hongshen says about this movie: "It's a good chance to think about my life". And I must add, become a new actor, one connected to art and life. Like Lennon, he succeeded without loss of identity.
