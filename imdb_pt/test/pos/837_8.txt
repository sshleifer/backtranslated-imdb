After finishing the Zero Woman series, I was looking forward to the Female Prisoner Scorpion series; both comic-based by Tooru Shinohara. Unfortunately, I could not see them in order, as this is the third in the series. <br /> <br /> It starts well when Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) is running away from the police. Detective Kondo (Mikio Narita) managed to put a handcuff on her, but she cut off his arm and ran away. If that is not bad enough, later a dog digs its arm and is seen trotting down the street before finding a place to enjoy its delight. <br /> <br /> The scorpion could go back to prison like life. It's not a picnic outside. First, a local Yakuza Tanida (v) threatens to put her back if she does not quench; and then the gang leader catches her when she gets rid of Tanida. But, they do not hold her for long before she escapes and is looking for revenge. <br /> <br /> Soon they're falling like flies. Some certainly deserved this for wearing gaudy clothes with shirt collars so large that they went up to the shoulder. You (Reisen Lee) surrender to avoid being killed. <br /> <br /> Police arrive at their last kill and trap it in the sewer. She's been there for a week and police officers find out that a friend (Yayoi Watanabe) is providing food for her. (The story of Yuki (Watanabe) and her brother is a subplot that is very interesting, but only incidental to the movie.) They try to burn it, but this is The Scorpion, and it has some unfinished business. <BR> It is not the usual mix of sex and violence, this is a slow tale that is beautiful everywhere.
