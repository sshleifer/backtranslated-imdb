I do not know why all the critics say this was a bad movie, this is one of my all time favorite movies. Tommy (Chris Farley) and Richard (David Spade) are a great game. Tommy is the stupid one who spent seven years in college, finally passing with a D +. Richard is the smart kid who was hated by everyone at school. How can you not laugh when the two are singing "The Superstar" of The Carpenters passionately and suddenly the hood pops up? All in all this is a great movie, I recommend it.
