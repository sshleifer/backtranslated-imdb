I was a high school student when "Flesh" hit the big screens, but was fortunate enough to see it in midnight movie theaters in New York just two years later. <br /> <br /> Meat is the first part of a movie. the so-called "trilogy" of films, featuring Joe Dallesandro, as an object of desire. It has the name "Warhol", but it is more the work of Paul Morissey. Essentially, the story worries about the exploits surrounding a day in the life of a male street crook (played by Joe Dallesandro). Joe is young, handsome and a bit naive ... but he manages to bring the bacon home to his wife, for reasons that should not be explained to enjoy the movie completely. <br /> <br /> Moviegoers are that this movie (along with the two remaining trilogy), had no script by itself. Warhol's superstars simply received a premise ... and the words and actions that the viewer sees are quite natural (even sometimes ridiculous or non-sensible). But overall, this works ... "Rolling Stone" noted in their review that the film was better than "Midnight Cowboy," a film of the same year, more polished by Hollywood (winner of the Oscar for Best Picture), with great talent (I also admire the movie) ... but FLESH, being improvised, was somehow more distressing and realistic, without the need for complex subplots and any "cause of celebrity" ... or for any reason everything! The film grossed more than $ 3 million and was an absolute sensation, particularly in the German market (which, ironically, thought they received a "censored version" of the film because of the post- edition ... see note below). <br /> <br /> Curiously, the movie is very "cut and paste" with "pops". "clicks," "flashes," and literally cut off dialogues in the middle of the sentence. It's almost as if Warhol / Morissey was stating a simple truth that it's a superstar's "day in a lifetime," snippets to his voyeuristic tendencies. Much better than Warhol's earliest eight-hour sleep, and the Statue of Liberty as a film of more than 20 hours. MEAT, in my opinion, is the first of Warhol's truly digestible films (given a wide palette) and the first legitimate Warhol / Factory response to Hollywood's "stardom" phenomenon. Like the first of a "trilogy," he portrays a young, desirable, naive, sought-after male icon, responding to invitations to please his family. Subsequent movies would show the "same character" with a different set of values. (See "Waste" and "Heat")
