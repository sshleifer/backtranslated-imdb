As a longtime fan of Studio Ghibli movies and especially Hayao Miyazaki, I went to the movie on opening day. When I left the theater, I had the strange feeling that something was missing, this "magical" feeling that I had been experiencing in every Miyazaki movie before, but I could not say why it failed this time. After I thought about Ghibli's other films, I might know the reason: this movie had most of the elements of a great Miyazaki anime: cute characters, wonderful key animations, a great soundtrack composed by Joe Hisaishi and the warm story telling sensation of watching a high quality Japanese animation film. However, it lacked two elements: a deep history and dramaturgy. The purpose of this film was obviously entertaining small children with a simple storyline as in the case of "Totoro", so a complicated story as told in "Spirited Away" or "Princess Mononoke" is not really necessary, but on the other hand, this story was simply too shallow. I could not connect to the main characters because there was no character development, dramatic scenes were limited and did not last long. I really hate giving only 7 stars to a Miyazaki movie, because I would give 10 stars to all previous movies immediately, but this time it simply was not that wonderful "ghibli experience".
