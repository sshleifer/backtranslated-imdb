For my money, probably the best movie - or at least the most purely cinematic film - that director Ford ever made. The dialogue is quick, cropped, to the point. The story begins at the beginning and ends with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs and photographs them with a vibration and a sweep of epic proportions. Extremely realistic, warmly entertaining, brilliantly portrayed (hard to believe that Johnsonj could not become a protagonist after that) with the best photography and editing in any black-and-white American film. It has a lot to do with Sergei Eisenstein's editing technique, but never as coldly impartial or "scientific" as Eisenstein did often. It's a great musical score. A magnificent panorama of an important and misunderstood episode in American history. <br /> <br /> A little pun: it is not clear why the film involves Mormons, which, as far as I know, have never been the pacifists, the Quakers. and the Amish were. This confusion leaves a bitter taste a bit bitter. <br /> <br /> However, the rest of the movie is a party, this is easy to ignore. In all other respects, a true masterpiece of American cinema that needs to be revived and looked at again (and again and again).
