You can find an anti-war statement without looking too much; this layer is banal. Or you may find a comment of neutral value on the madness of war (stripped of "judgment"); this layer is completely uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Or you can watch this for the good entertainment value of Duvall's one-liners, but that's just a coating for commercial chewing. <br /> <br /> You can try to see this as a "realistic" Vietnam war film, but ask any veteran and he will end this idea - most veterinarians will say that it stinks. <br /> <br /> Or see it as one or it will not play with morality - nothing rich there. <br /> <br /> Where I found the value was in superb self-referral. Coppola needed a large enough container (the war) to suit the greatness of the talented multi-dimensional actor who plays "a great man." <br /> <br /> Brando, the man, was as rebellious as Kurtz. character. The studios were uncomfortable with his acting method, but he always stood out and won praise; the "generals" feel uncomfortable with Kurtz's "foolish methods," despite his strategic genius. <br /> <br /> So, Coppola makes a movie about Brando's greatness. To get it right, he puts himself in the movie (like Hopper, a maniacal photojournalist laden with multiple cameras) to make his compliments. Brando himself is seen only in half-light and silhouettes - the brilliant cinematography of Storaro which only increases the power of the actor. And it comes out as the bull of the sacrifice to complete the narrative equation. Ah, yes: "the horror ..." Other pieces of interest: the great use from the point of view of the camera prospects, including "being in the shooting" long before "Soldier Ryan"; the innovative use of sound, notably the sinister flanger scans and the sound representation of an acid journey. <br /> <br /> Do not get stuck in the outer layers; the rich part that you must strip away of this is the bright core of sound, vision and self-reference.
