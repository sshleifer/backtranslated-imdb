Kar Wai Wong's incredibly impressive novel is perfect for me. Set in the 1960s in Hong Kong. As we are shown, this is set in a turbulent time. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung play Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan. A man and a woman meet in an apartment in Hong Kong, where they both move. Chow Mo-wan works for a newspaper company. Su Li-zhen Chan is a secretary. Two very different people. Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan create a special bond after they both discover their spouses, and are constantly engaging in extramarital affairs. Together. <br /> <br /> The characters of Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan are nothing short of amazing. Both Leung and Cheung can achieve such incredible chemistry with each other, it's better than any Hollywood novel published today. Combined. The film is about the focus of the two clues and their feelings after the infidelities of their partners. Kar Wai Wong manages to create such a strong character development between these two characters, you really start to feel for them. Leung and Cheung are both incredibly astounding, they are better than any Hollywood couple shown onscreen today. Combined. <br /> <br /> There is nothing more to describe Fa yeung nin wa than beautiful and energetic romance which also features a temperamental and atmospheric piece with stunning cinematography. So many elements of this film help create to be flawless. Like Kar Wai Wong and the acting, the cinematography of Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee is astounding. Beautifully discreet. The shots of Kar Wai Wong help your mind create a world of its own. A world that creates these characters. Original, melancholic and nostalgic. This movie is unbelievably unforgettable. <br /> <br /> The costumes created by Kar Wai Wong's William Chang are absolutely beautiful. Cheung, who wears an elegant dress with ankles and beautifully patterned in every scene. She's a scene stealer. Her fantasies tell a lot about her character and an emotion is adjusted in all her colors of dresses that are vividly and intelligently worn. Highly original Chang, also the production designer creates a brilliant backdrop for the humorous piece of movies. Especially with the help of the wonderful music used in scenes and magisterial film editing, again by Chang. William Chang seems to be incredibly versatile and is an unknown hero to this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is one of the best of this millennium. Incredibly attractive and full of nostalgia. The shots are fascinating and astounding. Kar Wai Wong proves to be a master at the top of his game. The acting; music; cinematography; edition; Production; costume and direction, everything helps to create A small, perfect movie. A masterpiece in romantic cinema. Visually spectacular. Overall, a masterpiece to make movies. A movie that reminds me of the old Hollywood classic was what it never was. Never forget Fa yeung nin wa. I know I will not.
