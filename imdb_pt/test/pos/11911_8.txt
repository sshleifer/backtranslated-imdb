Being brought up at the time this movie was released probably influenced my shallow mind, but still, this is not a bad movie at all. It is a film about a hostage situation involving a preparatory school populated to some extent by captivating teenagers who seem to be unable to get out of trouble. What's wrong with that? It does not have great special effects, but so what? Who needs special effects? The decline of the cinema began at the same time when the special effects were popularized. A coincidence? I think not. It turned the films with potentially good tangles and feelings and turned them into a great show of light without substance for innocent children and for those who self-medicated. Well, you know, not all movies need special effects. About three-quarters of the IMDb top 250 films do not have special effects, but almost every Top Grossing movie of all time has special effects. Think about it: Star Wars, E.T., Ghostbusters, etc. All good movies, but the rest of the highest grossing films are usually clich√©s with nonsensical passages and lots of eye drops. Well, some movies do not need that crap. <br /> <br /> Excuse me for going off on a tangent, which I usually do, but I'm so sick of that special effects junk. Getting back to the point: Toy Soldiers is simply a great movie. I'll admit, some of the content is a little hokey and stolen, but so, every movie rips another to a certain extent. Think of Resovoir dogs. Numerous sites of "appreciation" dictate the fact that beloved Quentin Tarentino, who I admit, copied many, many films in the production of his first great film Reservoir Dogs. Many say that the whole plot is ripped almost scene to scene of movies of Japanese and Chinese gangsters that Mr. Tarentino loved so much and probably still loves. Sorry, once again on the tangent. <br /> <br /> Toy Soldiers is fun. He has all the insubordination of teenagers to unwanted members of authority, namely, hostage takers. It's fun to watch children take on when they're being held up in something they do not want to do. Hell, rebellion inspired by teenage angst was the key topic for a great majority of the comedies of the 80s. In addition, there is the tension and the excitement of having the characters use firearms and eliminate villains, etc. In addition, there are some emotional points in the film. When one of the characters dies, the others have to deal and adjust. It's not a perfect performance, but it outperforms most of the other stuff out there. <br /> <br /> In short, Toy Soldiers are exciting, interesting and fun. How dare you tire the blowhards to misclassify this movie! Shame on everyone! Personal Rating: 8/10
