"Lights of New York" originally began as a short two-reel Vitaphone reel that eventually snowballed in the first whole talkie film. Helene Costelle was supposed to be one of Hollywood's most beautiful actresses and sister (in my opinion the real beauty) Costello Dolores, who seemed to have all the breaks. Poor Helene is best known for appearing in this very sad movie that bought a revolution for Hollywood !! <br /> <br /> Two smugglers on the main street convince two small-town barbers to try their luck. Broadway. Barbers Eddie (Cullen Landis) and Gene (Eugene Palette) do not realize that their barbershop is soon a cover for illegal smuggling activities. They soon realize this and repent of the day they left their small town. The only thing that keeps them moving is the loan that Eddie's mother gave them and that they desperately want to pay back. Eddie becomes familiar with Kitty Lewis (Helene Costello), a girl from his hometown who made it to Broadway. Kitty is worried about "Hawk" Miller (Wheeler Oakman) who is always hanging around her, but Eddie innocently thinks she is exaggerating since "Hawk" already has a girlfriend Molly (Gladys Brockwell), but to reassure her he gives you a little weapon to scare away unwanted admirers. "Hawk", who killed a cop and has the "Feds" approaching, decides to frame Eddie. Meanwhile, Molly is getting quite fed up with her treatment with Hawks and after a showdown where he tells her that he is after a chicken and not an old chicken, the stage is set for - Murder !!! <br /> <br /> The fact is that it is not completely horrible, apart from gangsters and showgirls speaking in their best voices of utterance and that was still happening in films in 1930. Gladys Brockwell (if a little melodramatic) and Eugene Palette (quite natural) were well and were the most experienced actors in the cast. There was no John or Ethel Barrymore to be seen-Cullen Landis and Helene Costello soon returned to the darkness from which they had come. I also did not notice much of the "hidden microphone" - where people had to be grouped around different objects ie a phone or sitting on a couch before they could engage in a conversation. The people who saw him in the movies probably began to think that the whole cop spoke in that monotonous, monotonous tone, as this trend continued in many early talkies, namely "Little Caesar" (1930). In any case, they were probably intrigued by the novelty of a fully spoken film - with some singing and dancing - in 1928. Recommended.
