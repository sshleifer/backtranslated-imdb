Rich businessman Bill Compton (played by Dennis Patrick) accidentally kills his daughter's hippie boyfriend after an argument. Aired in panic, he takes refuge in a bar and meets Joe Curran (played by Peter Boyle): a fanatic by the loud, angry mouth that is bitter about how his beloved country has become. Unwillingly, Bill allows Joe to find out that he has just killed a hippie. And this is just the beginning. "Joe" is a classic movie of an unlikely friendship. A bond between two men, one from a white-collar background, the other from a blue-collar background. Bill and Joe have one thing in common: they are dishonored with how crazy the world has become. Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle gave a very realistic representation of their characters. Director John G. Avidsen with this "pre-Rocky" effort directs this low-budget gem with the same subtlety of a $ 100 million budget film. The script is loaded with excellent character development and very fast and realistic dialog. Despite its strengths, this film has its weaknesses. The script falls asleep 3/4 of the way, but wakes up well in time of the violent climax. This film also features a very precocious and uninspiring performance of Susan Sarandon, 24, as Bill's daughter Melissa, along with her hippie boyfriend Frank, portrayed in a very mild manner by Patrick Mc Dermott. One could only thank him that he was killed at the beginning of the film. Despite its few shortcomings, this is one of those forgotten 1970s movies that should not be. Although "Joe" is very old-fashioned by today's standards, the chemistry between Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle is quite relevant nowadays, and it's the glue that keeps the whole film together.
