(Contains spoilers) <br /> <br /> Russia in the thirteenth century. The opening shot shows the relics of the last invasion: moldy uniforms, human skulls and a horse skeleton. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) expelled the Swedish army and impressed the mongol ruler to the point that he proposes to promote it to the position of captain. But Nevsky replies, "Die in your native land, but do not leave it." He intends to fish, build ships and trade. But he warns a more dangerous enemy: closer, more stingy and without possibility to buy: Germany. Its purpose is Novgorod. They have arrived in Pskov: mothers and daughters suffer for their parents and children. Looting occupation forces distribute the amount. Rich merchants want to buy their freedom (always a place for some anti-capitalists, P.R.), but the "common people" are ready to fight. They want Alexander as their leader. Pskov is burned to the ground. The Teutonic knights feel invincible and have only a smile of satisfaction for Russian women who witness helplessly as their parents and children are massacred. Babies are thrown into the fire while senior church dignitaries look and remain inactive. In Novgorod: Olga Danilovna has two admirers: Gavrilo rich and moderate and Vasili loud and cheerful. She promises to marry the bravest. Vasili calls Alexander Nevsky in Perejaslav. The prince decides not to wait for the attack, but to attack immediately. Even the women wear chain armor ... The invaders want to attract the "Russian bear," but Nevsky's ploy is the test: Lake Peipus is their war zone: their men know the territory, but the Germans, which are heavier, will break through the ice ... <br /> <br /> Open your eyes and see the most impressive battle scenes ever filmed. It is not only the multitude of extras (who were, I think, pressed in this patriotic exercise), but Eisenstein's masterful management of such a large number of individuals: he shifts divisions like pieces on a chessboard and almost all resemble the composition of a painting by Rembrandt or Rubens (including horses in fantastic clothes). Russia in winter seems intimidating in itself, but Eisenstein's visual imagination is unbearable. Lots of corpses are immersed in cosmic light under an endless horizon. At dusk, Olga and other women look for torches for survivors. A dedicated hawk sits on the corpse of his master as a crow waits for the right moment to choose the eyes of the deceased. Eisenstein's direction and Prokofiev's score make ALEXANDER NEVSKY the "Rolls Royce" among the propaganda films. Nevsky is, of course, Stalin's alter ego, and the Russians are tall, handsome, heroic and have perfect hairstyle. The Germans are wild bearded and seem members of the Ku-Klux-Klan. The actor who plays Vasili performs a performance of one man and four characters: first, a suspicious hero, heroic and young, and a comic relief. Cherkasov's main duty is to look heroic. In the end, Nevsky-Stalin shows his generosity: he forgives the "little soldiers" and trades the knights for soap. Only a bearded killer and a traitorous cleric are delivered to the mob. He does not forget the last warning: whoever comes with the sword will die by the sword ... He kept his promise. 10/10
