Okay, I'm a big fan of Traci, so she just being in the movie automatically makes him stay in the 8.5+ rating. But even though I was in it, I thought it was a good movie, especially as it was an HBO movie. But I'm afraid if you take Traci out of the movie, everything will be fine. But a person can not do that and she is a wonderful actress. It's only getting better and better.
