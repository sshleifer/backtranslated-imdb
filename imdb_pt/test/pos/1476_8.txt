Sam Elliot is brilliant as a tough San Francisco detective, Charlie Fallon. When his partner is killed while meeting a Fallon informer, he knocks the informant to death and throws his body into a river. The next day Fallon is assigned a novice partner, and given the task of investigating the killing of informants. Sam Elliot does a good job portraying a man who tortured himself with the guilt of his own murderous actions, and grieve over the death of his partner who may have been involved in police corruption.
