I watched this movie without knowing anything about it. I assumed it was a science fiction movie of some sort. How wrong I was. The plot is captivating and clever, the cast is all charismatic and the whole movie just makes you think for a change. Some of the puzzles left me completely confused, but in the end the answers were quite simple. I'm really puzzled by the low score of this movie, as I thought it was rather unusual. If you liked the movie Se7en (Seven) with Brad Pit or The Matrix, then you'll enjoy it. There are no great special effects or chic tricks here. It's all about the plot, about building the characters and building an atmosphere. It's a movie however, it does not ultimately provide answers that might annoy some people, but I thought the ending was great. I'm still not sure if the movie is based on a true story or not .......
