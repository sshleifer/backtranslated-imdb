From the outset you'll like the character of Sam Elliott (Falon): a trusted cop who is remarkably loyal to his partner. But too loyal and too vengeful to see his dead partner in an alley because he kills who he thought was the bully before giving him a chance to explain. Falon is an alcoholic, and this tends to influence him not to have self-control, although he is able to direct his attention to discover who really is behind the death of its partners. He brings along a rookie as his new partner (which seems to be seen in movies), but Esai Morales does well with Sam Elliot, though intriguing pieces begin to fit in where Morales initiates a self-approved investigation toward Falon; he wants mostly to find the answers, since Fallon does not let him enter the whole story, and does not like what he finds. There is not a last minute showing who the bad detectives are, which is fine; and they are not able to convince Falon to join them, leading to a dramatic ending. Well acting all around, with a touch of humor from Paul Sorvino, who is the captain of the detectives. It's a good movie that will make you want to see it several times; so it qualifies as -see to see- and a good addition to a collection of films! (Filmed in San Francisco)
