Last year was the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species", so it's fitting that Jon Amiel's "Creation" was released. The film focuses on Darwin's lifetime (Paul Bettany) as he writes his famous work, and the slight tension that this put into his family life. <br /> <br /> I think the film exaggerated the tension of Darwin with his religious wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly), and his guilt for the deceased daughter Annie, but I still like the idea of ​​Darwin's theory to act like a coup of karate in religious dogma. As it was, the US was one of the last countries in which "Creation" encountered a distributor, due to the debate creationism-evolution (yes, it is still happening). <br /> <br /> In short, this is not a masterpiece, but I recommend the same way I recommend "Inherit the Wind". I hope that, one day, the debate about creation-evolution is not a problem. If this movie helps end the debate, then more power for everyone in the movie! Also starring Martha West, Jeremy Northam, Toby Jones and Benedict Cumberbatch.
