true love. the true love. crazy Love. Beautiful love. ugly love dirty love sad love happy love silly love intelligent love, beautiful love mute love love love love. Minnie Moore understands that what she really needs is a man who trusts her, trusts her, and loves her madly. Of course when that man appears ... she tries to flee, but seymour, wonderful seymour, he trusts her, he believes her, then he will fight for her against her. I want to be like Seymour Moskowitz. I want to be that kind of man. A man willing to love without fear of failure, but willing to fail. This is a kind of hero. this is my kind of hero ... and minnie moore is my type of woman. Viva cassavetes and all your lovely bunch!
