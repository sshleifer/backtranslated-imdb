A brief review without spoilers follows. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie yesterday at the Cannes Film Festival. My initial reaction is one of admiration and happiness. I'm so happy that movies like this are being made in our blockbusters era. <br /> <br /> Roy Andersson's new film, "You, The Living," is nothing less than a complete play. You, The Living consists of about 50 pictures filmed with a static camera. I'm not going to give the content of the scenes here, because I hate it when people spoil even the smallest details. But, yes, most of the scenes made the 1000 people at Claude Debussy's theater absolutely confused and amazed. When the movie ended we applauded for several minutes, we had no choice. <br /> <br /> So what's the score with "You, The Living." Hm, Andersson is not afraid to ask the heavy questions; History, guilt, gand The Holocaust during World War II are great themes (and these themes work very well together). <br /> <br /> The images created are brilliant, the depth sometimes surpasses the "Songs of the Second Floor". <br /> <br /> Well, sorry for this criticism, praising. Look out for the Flying House on the Start Staff! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars - a Masterpiece (I never play this degree out).
