In recent months, I have seen many criticisms of The Italian Job, many of them negative. The gist of almost all of these pessimistic critiques is that, for all its modernist bravery and high-budget technology, the film does not have much substance where it matters. Look, guys, it's just a funny movie. This is the kind of picture where you should sit back, relax and enjoy the steady pace of the movie. Like Ocean's Eleven (2001), you can focus on the characters and the plot at the same time without having to think too much (lucky for some of us). Granted, "Ocean" is a better movie, but who cares? The plot may have a few holes (there is a huge about 3/4 of the way), the action may not be as gratuitously free as the trailers did to be, and some of the dialogues may seem useless and cheesy, but again, who really care? Cool characters, Mini Coopers, Big Bangs, Charlize Theron. What else do you want? I think it's time to let the fake Roger Ebert find the Gene Shalit show and have fun for the first time! Oh, and one other thing, whatever you do, do not compare with the original because, to reiterate what F. Gary Gray told the press a million times, THIS IS NOT A REMAKE !! My advice - if you are interested in choosing a humorous and entertaining film, do not bother to see The Italian Job. But if you do not have a severe inferiority complex and / or want to see Ed Norton being attacked by a bunch of Ukrainians, go ahead. The Bottom Line, my movie buddies, is: Lighten Up and Have Fun, Dammit.
