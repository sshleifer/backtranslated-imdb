It's out of the question that the real Anna Anderson was not Princess Anastasia. In addition to very distinct differences in physical appearance (Anderson's eyes are perceptibly larger, thicker lips, larger nose and apparent at the end ... etc), Anderson is unable to speak Russian it was a ridiculous to say ...... It is That's why I detested both Anna Anderson and her confederates. There are not many crooks who have the audacity and resistance to fraud for over 60 years with such an unsustainable scheme. <br /> <br /> But, to a certain extent, I have sympathy for Anna Anderson. Life must have been difficult for a young Polish peasant in those days. And posing as another woman for over 60 years is a chore for anyone. She had to hold her fleshy lips all the time to mimic Anastasia's thin lips, and she had to occasionally go lunatic to make people believe that her entire chaotic memory was merely a result of the mental problem. <br /> <br /> Anna Anderson was an incredible woman on the wrong path. If she had put her good looks, learned elegance, endurance, acting skills in proper use, she could have made a first-class actress. <br /> <br /> On a side note: Some main characters of this two-parter seem to be loosely based on real numbers. Prince Erich could be a mixture of Gleb Botkin (believed by many the most possible brain behind the whole scheme), Duke George and Leuchtenberg's Dmitri, and several other figures. And Darya Romanoff seems to be based on the beautiful princess Xenia Georgievna Romanova. But, unlike the real confederates, Prince Erich was unmotivated in this program and supported Anna for love and sincere belief in her, which is touching. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great show. It got a bit confusing, but still remains true to reality. The power of Amy Irving's acting is in that she has successfully represented Anderson's self-confidence, the mix of impersonating others and being herself is intriguing. Just as Princess Xenia said about Anderson: "She was herself all the time and never gave the slightest impression of having a role." Highly recommended.
