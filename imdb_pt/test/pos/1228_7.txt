I'm not here to say that "Armored" is Kubrickian, Hitchcockian or Fellini-esquire. No. Referenced directors are more like Don Siegel ("Charlie Varrick") and Walter Hill ("The Warriors"). Those two helpers did not play with subtleties like putting women in their movies. No skirt needs to be applied. They shamelessly made movies face. Weapons, many weapons. The men met violent death with a jaw contraction. His films were like a sap in his head. Do you want a friend? Get a dog. <br /> <br /> "Armored" is a face movie. Dueling armored trucks? Bloody wounds? Exploding money? If that does not excite the part of your lizard's brain, stay away. <br /> <br /> At 88 minutes, "Shielded" is all muscle without an ounce of fat. We met six security guards who drive armored trucks, three by truck. The six, led by Matt Dillon, plan a false kidnapping involving two trucks. His mission, one day, is to hand over $ 42 million from the federal reserve (I think). The idea is to take the two trucks to a warehouse, hide the money and stage a kidnapping. Of course, the police will suspect them, but if they stay together they will get through it. <br /> <br /> The problem is that one of the six, played by Columbus Short, is an obstacle. At first. But he faces eviction. And he is the guardian of his confused younger brother. He needs bad money. <br /> <br /> Matt Dillon chases, persuades the holdout. There is no blood in anyone's hands. A clean haven. All right, not bad. You will be rich forever. Blue skies smiling at you ... <br /> <br /> Right. <br /> <br /> Everything goes to hell, of course. It's one damn thing after another and the stakes keep going up. And almost everything happens claustrophobically inside an abandoned warehouse somewhere in Los Angeles. In fact, the film goes out of its way to project a scenario of industrial urban decadence. It turns out that I like industrial urban decadence. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Matt Dillon, who plays the best bad dog. It goes from charming to disappointed to frustrated to outraged to totally insane in the course of the movie. Love this guy. <br /> <br /> In addition, credit is due to John Murphy's ominous, throbbing, blistering, and utterly sinister electronic soundtrack. I'm guessing he's heard some Tangerine Dream albums. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is surprising that this is a PG-13 movie. Did I get one ?? 1! ??? f-bomb throughout this movie about thieves of violent bullies. On some level, I like that. Take the kids. <br /> <br /> The director is Nimrod Antal, a Hungarian who made a fine noir in Budapest's subway system called "Kontroll". Writer is an out-of-nothing guy named James V. Simpson. <br /> <br /> Many people in this movie are just getting started. I am willing to bet that the esteem given to this film will increase as time goes by and these filmmakers advance in their careers.
