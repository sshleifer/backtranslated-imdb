For those who enjoy the intersection of silent movies and social commentary, this is a unique movie. In part homage to German expressionism, part allegory, the film is replete with visual symbolism and an artistic style that rivals anything seen since the 1920s. In addition, the attention to detail of the period and the visual composition of the scenes as a instrument for the advancement of history is impressive. In addition, the plot offers an interesting commentary on the role of media in society and its effects on voice, perception and social opinion. In fact, it is not so much the silence that permeates the film as the loss of voice and loss of words to communicate and express the thought that inevitably follows. In short, this movie is something that is often not seen and, as the film producer said in the Q & A that followed, will leave you thinking about its meaning until the next day.
