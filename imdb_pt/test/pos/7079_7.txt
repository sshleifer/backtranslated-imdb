I love this movie. To be fair, the movie starts very slowly, with none of the characters being terribly nice. It continues like this for a good half of the film. <br /> <br /> But if you are patient you will be greatly rewarded. What the first half of the film does not have in character development and / or sympathy is adequately compensated in the second half. It's a bit like roller coaster riding - a slow and arduous climb, and then speed, twists and more surprises. <br /> <br /> As usual, Meryl Streep is wonderful. She is the best actress of our time. William Hurt is good, although a bit of wood at some points. Renee Zellweger does a very good job, showing that his performance on Jerry McGuire was not a fluke.
