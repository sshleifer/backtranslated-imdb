The movie is really about choices. In the state of oppressed things, as seen in Fire, where good women had to be obedient and do what was right in the eyes of tradition, there seemed to be few options for Radha and Sita. However, he admitted that it was not his only option. What is life without desire, Radha questions Ashok. Yes, it is true that life offers us several options, but how many of them we can assume depends on several external factors. When her world is confined to a small Indian family, being a daughter-in-law obedient to a silent but attentive and powerful matriarch, an obedient 13-year-old wife to a man who vowed celibacy for not being able to have a child, a man who just wants you lying next to him to prove his strength in eliminating his desires. I felt that the ladies had little choice but to find solace in each other's company. I think the fact that so many women applauded Ms Mehta's work was because it gave them the option to think for themselves. An option to do what might be unacceptable. The lesbian scenes I felt were merely to show that point. All the scenes of the film, from the first in the Taj Mahal to the last in the Mosque, are etched in my mind. How frustrating to be a prisoner of your feelings and desires. Feeling that you had to renounce the human touch to be an obedient wife just because it is expected of you. Have to suppress any desire you may have and desire the human touch. What then is the meaning of our existence? In the scene where Sita is crying alone in the room and Radha comes in to console her, her lips accidentally rub against each other and this arouses a feeling in them. Something that both were private. <br /> Bravo to Ms Mehta in translating her vision so clearly. I especially like the flashbacks of young Radha trying to "see" the ocean. It is a metaphor for freedom. Freedom of choice, freedom to transport us to places we would not normally reach. In these scenes, we are gently told that his sense of duty was also conveyed by his mother, who I presume lives within the rich Indian traditions of duty in marriage. The film is beautifully filmed and enhanced by A.R. Rahman's soundtrack. Since the film, I have become fervent fans of the two leading actresses and director. I look forward to more future productions of Ms Deepa.
