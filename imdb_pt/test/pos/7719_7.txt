My comment is mainly a commentary on the first commentator (the extra on the film) and his unfortunate assessment of the movie. I think your perspective indicates why an extra is an extra and a director is a director. The film was sweet, the acting was enough, the experience of watching it a good detour from a busy working week. It was not "The Hours" (acting), or "The Matrix" (Special Effects), or even "The Color Purple" (Direction). Most movies will not be. But neither was the party that "vinny ..." would lead you to believe. Sorry man, just my 2 cents. <br /> <br /> As for the movie itself, it was in the end very gay claiming (+ # 1). It showed a world full of different and less perfect people - you know, just like ours (+ # 2)! It opened a door in a culture without excluding other cultures (+ # 3). And I liked the song (+ # 4).
