I saw this movie late at night on an open channel, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Being a fan of horror movies, I often watch these midnight movies during school holidays. More often than not, the horror movies shown during this time are usually gross nonsense. 'Campfire Tales' certainly does not fit into this category. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales is basically an anthology of tales based loosely on known urban legends. They are reunited with a scenario involving teenagers telling these stories around a campfire. This bonfire scenario has a mysterious plot in itself. However, this particular story is weak and confusing, obviously used predominantly to create the other scary tales. <br /> <br /> There are three short stories in this movie (four if you count 'The Hook' at the beginning), all of which are truly scary and well made. I especially liked the third tale ('The Locket') involving a guy whose bike breaks in front of a mysterious house. This particular story works well in actually scare you with flashbacks of the history of the house. Also, the end of the tale will completely shock you! The first tale ("The Honeymoon") was also very scary, although the second tale ("People can lick too") was a bit lacking. Being a veteran of horror movies, I do not usually get scared. This movie certainly did the job well! What I particularly liked about this movie is the fact that it is divided into three shorts. This means that the film will not go through an hour or so of character development and establishment establishment before the actual bloodshed begins. This makes "Campfire Tales" perfect for pajama parties, parties, etc. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales is a creepy horror movie that will make your heart stop more than once. Certainly better than the crap you'll find in theaters these days (Blair Witch 2, Urban Legends: Final Cut ...). Find a copy and watch ... if you dare! <br /> <br />
