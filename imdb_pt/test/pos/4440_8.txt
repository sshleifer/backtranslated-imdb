My impression, after seeing this documentary, is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than before making the film. <br /> <br /> It took him five years to do this, a labor of love and longing. I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process, what to leave in, what to take. <br /> <br /> His father, the renowned architect Louis Kahn, seems a very selfish, egocentric man to be emotionally available to a woman who is not alone. But, like many men of his character, he attracted women who were charmed by estrangement and fascinated by creativity. <br /> <br /> One of his lovers said he was "accessible" but this is never explored. Other comments from people who knew him well suffer the same fate. A feather. <br /> <br /> The tension between the three half-brothers in the room of a house designed by Louis is also palpable. The unspoken hangs over the conversation. The only tracks his father left were the buildings he left behind, some great, some not so much. <br /> <br /> I was captivated by the music ship and the Salk Institute. Saddened by baby mothers who were forever seized by their insensitive impregnations, it was never more exemplified than what he told the director's mother to be informed of his pregnancy - "not again!" <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, beautifully filmed, genuine. <br /> <br /> It seems, at least in this case, that the son is not the father of man.
