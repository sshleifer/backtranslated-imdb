I loved this. It starts out as a fairly normal and slightly heavy French art film, and suddenly halfway there is the head. This part is brilliant as you realize that you have watched 2 plots not one. Unfortunately, the ending does not make much sense, which is a great shame. Oh yeah, and it's brilliantly filmed.
