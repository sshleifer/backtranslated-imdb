The film Haggard is one of the funniest movies of all time. It features the cast of CKY (the movies) and also has a great soundtrack. If you have seen some CKY or Viva La Bam, you will notice that all (of those two) are in it. Including Bam's parents and many others. <br /> <br /> The story is about Ryan Dunn's girlfriend, Glauren (Jennifer Rivall), cheating on him, and he trying to get back at her. He does this by having Valo (Bam) and Falcone (Dicamillo) vandalize his house. There are many different characters with many different stories. <br /> <br /> There are great songs on the soundtrack. Bands like Him and Her, CKY, Gnar Kill, Daniel Lioneye. Iggy and the Stooges Pop and New Order. <br /> <br /> If you do not like Viva La Bam or CKY (the movies), I doubt you like it. If you like these things ... this movie is great.
