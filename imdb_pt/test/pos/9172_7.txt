While the concept of "dating doctor" is the only thing that saves this movie from being a normal romantic comedy with a standard storyline for the genre, I found it pleasant enough to raise my opinion of it, so I ended up enjoying it much more that if it had only a mediocre plot without many twists. Will Smith does a great job, as always, acting like Hitch, the man who dedicates his life to advising men how and how not to win women ... since his failed attempt to keep his girlfriend in college. There are lots of laughs as he tries to help his latest patient, overweight, asthmatic Albert Brennman (Kevin James) successfully to beautiful work colleague Allegra Cole (Amber Valetta). Also, when he decides to get rid of a woman he finds in a turkey bar that just does not seem to get her want him around, he finds himself attracted to Sara (Eva Mendes) - seems to be a great deal with him , so I guess since college he never actually practiced his own rules about himself. Unfortunately, Sara is a gossip columnist who is interested in "the doctor" who has picked up a seemingly stupid guy like Albert along with Allegra - especially after Vance Munson (Jeffrey Donovan) smashes the heart of her best friend (Julie Ann Emery) and hints at the date when the doctor he saw angered him when she did not realize he had refused to see him. Still, the problem follows and Hitch is stuck on the left wondering what to do with his own relationship, though it will not be of much help to Albert as he tries to figure out what else to do in his. The acting is good, there is a lot of humor and a few other points with meaning. Hitch's character is witty and wise, sometimes managing to be both at the same time. Is it true that the misunderstanding that the woman is confronted with something that the man did not really do (why they always show it?) Is common and irritating - I think it would not have been if it was the first, not the fifth, I've seen it - but the rest of them were brand new. I just wanted this movie to be longer - I remember being able to watch 3/5 of it while playing a restaurant TV once - but I still approve. It is definitely worth the money to pay for its brevity.
