8/2008. When I originally wrote my comments, shortly after watching this movie, I had a critical eye, thinking that Lemmon and Matthau had basically "phoned" their performances, which matched them in a way they had done several times before. But upon seeing it again, it looked different, especially since neither of the two major mega-stars lived much longer after its launch. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Spiner, all eight directors are experienced performers, and equally inevitably very "harder" than we have seen in many of his other films and TV. works. But is not it just about everyone? Seeing this again, while certainly not considered a "classis" in any of their careers, is a fun movie with a lot of interesting scenery. From my point of view, this reminds me that many films, plays, etc., can often be seen from a very critical point of view, or looking at the lighter side, without waiting for film to be another "Citizen Kane" , "Casablance", or (in terms of the two tracks), another original "Odd Couple". It will also provide a continued nostalgia for Lemmon and Matthau as well as the others in the cast.
