Coming from Oz I probably should not say that, but I think a lot of the local movies do not have that cohesive flow with a weak plot. This comedy has nothing. Great story, no exaggeration, no melodrama, just brilliant comedy as we know that Oz can do it. Do yourself a favor and laugh until you fall.
