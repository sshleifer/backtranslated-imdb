I saw this movie yesterday and I can not stop thinking about it. I moved to Norway four months ago and have since tried to discover the source of the strange emptiness I felt. When I saw this movie, I was struck with the brilliant portrait of this society. Yes, this is all true !!! I also found a great job at a great salary, and I live with my Norwegian boyfriend in a beautiful apartment in the city center. But so far everyone I've met has left me with that empty, tasteless feeling I've never had before - that's what this movie is. Dinners with nothing to say to each other, but emotionless comments, long silences, no stress, a frightening calm, and frozen smiles of kindness. This Scandinavian nightmare is perfectly translated into Den Brysomme Mannen. Watch this movie !!!
