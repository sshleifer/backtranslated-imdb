Sandra Bullock paints a credible picture as the troubled detective, though seeing her as a cynical male-eating victim who has become a stalker requires a leap of faith (or two). The two frightened children are adequately portrayed by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. <br /> <br /> I have a little trouble putting Ben Chaplin in the equation (the same problem came up when I watched 'The Truth About Cats & Dogs') (http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0117979 /) I mean, when you put an English into an American movie, should not there be at least one reason to put it there? Should not there be some story that led to the fact that an Englishman is serving as a detective to an American police force? Should not there be some dialogue pointing out and explaining this obvious fact? Or even some jokes about him being so English? <br /> <br /> He seems out of place here, as he seemed out of place in "The Truth About Cats and Dogs". Producers should really notice, distract and annoy the audience (at least I do). Nothing wrong with Chaplin's acting, it's just a matter of making an actor that's out of place 'believable and not putting him anywhere without a good reason or a plot. <br /> <br /> The movie itself: well, thrillers, especially those who are negotiating g with solving a complicated crime, require some suspension of disbelief. This is no different; in fact, it requires a little more effort than usual. In order to make Bullock clever enough to unravel the case, despite all the pressures that require her to release him, some unrealistic assumptions are being made about the evidence, and I'm sure many people who have attended have had a few moments. from "Come on, this is highly unlikely under the circumstances" or even "Hey, you can not put aside the evidence to wrap this movie!". <br /> <br /> Like I said: reasonably fun and watchable. Just do not use this as a preview needed for detective exams. There are no shortcuts there.
