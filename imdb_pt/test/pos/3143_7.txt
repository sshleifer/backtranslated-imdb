Perry Mason: The Fatal Fashion affair finds Perry and Della Street in New York receiving an award from the American Bar Association. An undefeated trial record should get some recognition that I would think. Anyway, a friend of Della, fashion editor Diana Muldaur is arrested for the murder of a rival, Valerie Harper, and in fact, Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale witness a confrontation between the two in a luxurious restaurant. <br /> <br /> Two rivals do one thing that makes Hedda and Louella look like schoolgirls. Of course Harper has several other people who loved her equally. <br /> <br /> The same aggressor also criticized a stylist who could have exposed the individual. This attacks Perry with his trusted investigative attorney, William Moses, in an alliance with some mobsters. It seems that the stylist was the cousin of a mafia boss who also wants to do justice in his usual way. <br /> <br /> One thing I could not understand is that when Moses and the mafioso Robert Clohessy track the assailant, I can not believe that the police have not vigorously pursued the case either. Of course, Clohessy has some access to sources the cops simply do not have. <br /> <br /> But the best part of that particular entry from Mason is Scott Baio as the young man, instead he himself assistant District Attorney presenting himself to Raymond Burr telling how he studied all his cases and longed for victory it. Foolish Boy. <br /> <br /> In fact, my favorite scene is Burr and Baio in a sidebar with the judge. Baio wanted to reopen the case and add a witness, ready and prepared with precedents. Burr takes him by surprise and says he does not object to the new witness and then proceeds to demolish the witness on interrogation. Absolutely invaluable. <br /> <br /> Scott Baio is the best thing in this particular Perry Mason movie and should be seen only for him, if nothing else.
