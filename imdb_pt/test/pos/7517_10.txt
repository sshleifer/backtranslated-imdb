Absolutely corrosive! Director Arthur Hiller and writer Paddy Chayefsky dismantle the American hospital system with this comedy / drama / whodunit. The hospital represented here is fraught with problems ... of protesting against neighbors and angering patients at a potential serial killer on the loose. George C. Scott is the best doctor who, on the verge of his own nervous breakdown, engages with Diana Rigg and her eccentric father Barnard Hughes. Alternatively depressed and noisy, THE HOSPITAL features some of the most acidic dialogues imaginable (note how Scott describes his love affair with Rigg). He also has many great vignettes: Chief Nurse Nancy Marchand, who is Scott's, after one of the subalterns accidentally kills a doctor; Frances Sternhagen, grumpy administrator, desperately trying to collect information about insurance in a waiting room full of sick people; Scott receiving sober advice from the hospital psychiatrist after telling him about his lamentable domestic life. All the acting is top quality. Scott and Rigg are dynamites and Hughes is a real surprise. The film is a masterpiece with Chayefsky's script winning a well-deserved Oscar (about a competition as fierce as KLUTE & Sunday, BLOODY Sunday). The opening narration is invaluable.
