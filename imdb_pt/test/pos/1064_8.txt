Be sure to make this delightful comedy part of your holiday season! If you admire Dennis Morgan or Barbara Stanwyck, this movie is fun to watch. They really work well together as you would see in this movie. The whole cast was a lot of fun. Since I'm a fan of Dennis Morgan, this movie was a real treat! But ... everyone can have fun! Recommended!
