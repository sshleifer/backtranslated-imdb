When I was young, I was a big fan of the Naked Gun movies, but recently I watched the Police Sqaud show! and I think it's great! Leslie Nielson is amazing, Alan North is cool, and who the hell is Rex Hamilton? But anyway, it's a silly show. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of this show when they make the scene freeze frame during the final credits. I think my favorite is when Norberg (not O.J.) comes in during the scene and he tries to fit into the frozen frame. Classic! <br /> <br /> The only problem for me is that the cigarette gag gets very old (when Drebin shows a cigarette to someone and asks, "Cigarette?", and the person replies: "Yes, I know") . I think they've used this many times for anything. <br /> <br /> Good acting, good jokes, great show! <br /> <br /> 7/10
