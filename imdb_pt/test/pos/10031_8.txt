The second Warner Brothers historical drama, with the Civil War and the Battle of Little Big Horn, General George Armstrong Custer, they died with their Boots (Warner Brothers, 1941) was the more accurate of the two; especially when contrasted with SANTA FE TRAIL (Warner Brothers, 1940), who did not really set the pattern too high. <br /> <br /> ALTHOUGH the two photos were starring in vehicles for Errol Flynn, there was a cast change on General Custer's part. Whereas it was the "Dutchman" himself, Ronald Reagan portraying the extravagant and egocentric Cavalryman in the previous photo, with Mr. Flynn playing Virginian and later Confederate Hero General, J.E.B. (or Jeb) Stuart; Errol took over Custer's part because THEY DIE WITH HIS SHOOTS. Once again, Warner Brothers' propensity to use a large number of trusted character actors from "Warner's Repertory Company" is employed in giving the film is a kind of authenticity, and everything is really happening right before our very eyes . Elizabeth Bacon / Mrs. Custer (co-star Olivia de Havilland), Ned Sharpe (Arthur Kennedy), Samuel Bacon (Gene Lockhart), Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) ), "Californy" (Charlie Grapwin), Major Taipe (Stanley Ridges), General Phillip Sheridan (John Litel), Callie (Bacon's Maid, Hattie McDaniel). <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is packed with uncredited people, although experienced players like: Joe Sawyer, Eleanor Parker, Minor Watson, Tod Andrews, Irving Bacon, Roy Barcroft, Lane Chandler, Spencer Charters, Frank Ferguson, Francis Ford, Guilherme Forrest, George Eldridge, Russell Hicks, Hopper Hopper, Eddie Keane, Fred Kelsey, Sam McDaniel, Patrick McVey, Frank Orth, Eddie Parker, Addison Richards, Ray Teal, Jim Thorpe Minerva Urecal, Dick Wessel, Gig Young and many, many more. <br /> <br /> The film moves very quickly, particularly in the first steps; then delays the need as the story progresses into the Civil War years, the appointment of Custer as Colonel in the 7th Cavalry and the final destination in Little Big Horn, Montana. Under the guidance of the director, Griffith Veteran, Raoul Walsh, the film reaches a very varied range of emotions; very serious and exciting battle scenes and compelling historical scenes; looking like they were civil war photos of Matthew Brady. As with most Walsh films, he scores and speeds the end of many scenes with a little humor; but do not exaggerate and thus risk the chance to turn the film into a comedy (farce, in fact). <br /> <br /> As mentioned earlier, this is far more factual than its predecessor, SANTA FE TRAIL (last time I'll mention, honest Schultz, Scout's honor!). However, this is not to say that it was not without some small bits of "Artistic and Literary License, as indeed, virtually any Biopic will have." It would be impossible to make any similar type of film if indeed all the facts and The incident should be included Perhaps the most erroneous inclusion, as well as the more obvious invocation of the Literary License, is that Custer's business was accidentally promoted to the post of Brigadier General, but the "gag" helped the film proceed, while was the highlight of all the light, the unconcerned feeling that permeated the first part of the film DIRECTOR Walsh and Mr. Flynn collaborated to give us what appears to be a characterization of this legendary Civil War hero who was very close to the man in real life, and they did so upon the re-creation of an incident, being the Lakota Sioux Massacre, the Cheyenne and the Custer Fukowi and their 7th cavalry in the little Big Horn. On June 25, 1876, "Custer's Last Stand" was an incident and shock as great for the American National Psyche as the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941) or the Islamic Fascists' New York's Twin Trade and the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces at the Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia, on September 11, 2002. JUST LIKE many films from this period of World War II. (and the years immediately preceding), there were so many incidents that were, if not intentionally, made, demonstrations of virtues that would be needed at the time of another Global Conflict, as when we were in the time when THEY DIE THE BOOTS ON was ending its original period of theatrical release. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
