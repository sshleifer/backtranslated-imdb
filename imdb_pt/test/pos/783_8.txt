A British twist on Harold and Maude, Driving Lessons, features Rupert Grint and Reed and Julie Walters. Although it is true that Grint has a stone face like redhead Benjamin Braddock in the first half of the film, this does not stop the family film - there are things going on that are outside of your character's experience and that would create bark shock reaction. The chemistry between Walters and Grint carries the film, although Laura Linney's hard work to make her human writing stereotype also be remarkable. These performances combined with a fun poppy soundtrack, featuring artists such as Sufjan Stevens, John Renbourn and Salsa Celtica, make this children's popcorn movie a Saturday afternoon.
