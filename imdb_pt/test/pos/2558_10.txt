my girlfriend, as we walked on the cold London night in Leicester Square after the movie, says: if they did not speak English and did not show the stadium, you might have thought it was a slum in a South American city. or some other favela anywhere in the world, not Queens in New York. Ramin Bahrani is, at the moment, my official hero because he seems to have dedicated his work to show not the other face of American but the true face of America. <br /> <br /> Ramin Bahrani's films are like Ladri di biciclette, or Germania anno zero, or Roma citta 'aperta. Chop shop is reality turned into film, it is more realistic than a documentary, in fact I think Ramin Bahrani's films are more realistic than documentaries. This is a great movie, but do not expect any car chases or shots. This movie is about tragic lives on the fringes of the richest and richest country in the world.
