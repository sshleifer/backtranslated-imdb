This new version of the Child's Play series does not have a scary scene, but tons of hilarious jokes such as a junkie witnessing Chucky giving him his finger and saying "rude f-king doll" and many references to the series: "you can kill but I I'm coming back, I always come back. " The title of the film was probably thought before the script and was written around it. This is totally different from all the other films in the series. Not even Andy, the central character of all the previous ones. Chucky seems to interfere with the characters from another movie, a novel about two teenagers running together to get married. There is an elaborate legal death scene involving broken glass and water pouring everywhere. The film is very bloody, very funny and has references of the pop culture of Martha Stewert to Jerry Springer. DO NOT SEE THIS BEFORE SEEING THE OTHER THREE. This will really ruin the effect, since the first one is truly scary. Lots of fun and foolish fun. <br /> <br />
