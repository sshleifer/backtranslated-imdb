This was truly one of the nicest specials I have seen on TV. He is just an incredible artist. His personality shines in every one of the songs he does. I really wish this was available as an uncut DVD, so I could watch it multiple times without the -beeps- for explicit language. I did not get a chance to see it live, but that's something I really want to do now. I can not forget their backup singers. They really added a lot of substance and humor to the show. With their exaggerated style and extravagant dance moves, they really complement Dan's true talent. I wish there were more of the songs on the live CD, which is also amazing. It's refreshing to see someone like him perform. Just so incredibly nice and real, I really can not say enough good things about Dan and this show. Once again, I just wanted this to be available as an uncut DVD.
