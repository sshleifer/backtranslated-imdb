David Suchet, (Poirot), "FoolProof", '03, gave an excellent performance as a perfectionist in almost everything he did or said. If he had a cocktail, he always had a napkin to cover the excess in his mouth with unbelievable perfection! You could just see the expressions on the detective's face and see that he never missed an item of importance in the behavior of the suspects. The beautiful colors of the Inland Waterfalls were simply breathtaking. Megan Dodds, "Bait", 2000, gave an excellent performance as a very sexy, wild woman who was able to keep very important secrets away from Mr. Poirot. A very nice film if you really like the acting of David Suchet as Mr. Poirot!
