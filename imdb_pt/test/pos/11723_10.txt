While he was great at Boogie Nights, I think that was Burt Reynolds' best performance. He is also a great director and made a violent and tough film that did not contain himself (the death of a hooker by 12 gauge) and is a great detective story with some great actors (Brian Keith, Bernie Casey, etc.) excellent jazz soundtrack. 10 out of 10
