I hope that from his seat on the comic throne of Heaven, Spike Milligan can see and enjoy this film, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said "almost drove me crazy" in a joy of watching. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of the Irish town of Puckoon and the problems that followed when the division between Northern Ireland and the Republic is elaborated, making its way through the center of the village and, more painfully, in the middle of the church cemetery. This causes some dead, buried in the cemetery of the Catholic Church, to be now in the Protestant north - and therefore the local priest, aided by a large variety of eccentric local inhabitants, seeks to expel bodies disguised as darkness, avoiding British bureaucrats . border guards. <br /> <br /> It was an inspired work to launch the Irish comedian and poet Sean Hughes to play the role of Madigan. He brings an innocence to the part, especially in his camera parts (which is usually where he interacts with Richard Attenborough's narration, supposedly interpreting the writer / director of the film). Daragh O'Malley, who plays Father Rudden, also deserves considerable praise; and the rest of the cast, from names like Elliott Gould and Griff Rhys Jones to people with what would normally be called 'small parts' - like Spike's daughter, Jane, who plays Madigan's wife, give it 100%. not a small part, to the wonderful characterizations given by Spike in the original book. <br /> <br /> I could argue that the film is a bit too long, or that Elliott Gould's Irish accent left a bit to be desired, but those would be only minor points and would not take anything away from the excellence of this film.
