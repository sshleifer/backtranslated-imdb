This film is much better than the first "Asterix et Obelix contre Caesar", but it is far from perfect. The adaptation of the comic book is good, some of the photos and dialogues of the film are the same as the book. But there are few things that made the film not as interesting as the animated film released in 1968. For example, the fight between Numerobis and Amonbofis. This was neither necessary nor even credible, nor for Asterix's little love story. There were also some missing things like the songs that are in the animated movie, and a few other things ... I'm fooled by the movie because they cut the things I was expecting to see and they showed things I did not want or needed to see. I know it would have been very difficult to make the film exactly the same as the comic book or the animated film, but that's what I expected. In conclusion, even if the movie is good, I still prefer the animated film, which in my opinion is much better.
