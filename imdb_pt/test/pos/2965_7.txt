To summarize this story in a few sentences: A teenager (Amy) uses her warm and "supposed" virginity body to lure a troubled young woman (Matt) with a potential scholarship to provide her with a "full outing" out of town. . Come discover that she has a good reputation and slept with many football players in the past, hoping they would offer you the same deal. Both children came from troubled and dysfunctional homes. Matt's mothers, an alcoholic who repeatedly embarrassed him in front of his friends and Amy's mother, had a bad reputation and got pregnant with Amy as a young man. Matt falls in love with Amy and tries to straighten his life out for her. Very predictable end. The actress who plays "Amy" is actually 33 years old trying to play a teenage girl!
