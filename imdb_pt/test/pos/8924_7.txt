This film was clearly an initial attempt for a new director but still managed to be original and entertaining as well as in some thought-provoking moments. However, I have to say that the story would not have turned out so well without Paul Anthony's stellar performance as Pip. He has made the well-written parts very believable and affected, and the more poorly written parts are much more bearable. Also, I have to mention the performance of Alan Cumming. It was refreshing to see him in a party like this. He brought a weight to his role that provided a very fundamental element to the film. As for Paul Anthony: Who is this guy? Why did not I see him? Someone give you more papers, please!
