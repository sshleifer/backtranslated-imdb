There are many, many old movies that deserve to be transferred to the DVD format. This is certainly one of them. A triumph of Anthony Quinn! Dozens of films portray the victims of Nazi atrocities before and during the war, but I do not think any of them have plunged into the psyche of the victim and the predator, just like this one has. Anthony Quinn was truly a man for all seasons. He had the ability to portray the humblest creatures devoid of any human object to a creature of extreme animalism and to remove them as believable to the audiences they attended without thinking of what they have just witnessed! Truly one of our greatest artists. He is lost.
