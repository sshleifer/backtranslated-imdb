Even though this movie is 11 years old, I rented it yesterday, and I thought it was a really moving film. The story of true friendship before a very real monster is an inspiration and quite touching. <br /> <br /> Although I did not care much about the amount of language used by some of the young actors - especially Renfro - I understand that art is imitating life. Renfro once again does a magnificent job of the rough and tough bully (his role in The Client comes to mind), and Mazzello does a wonderful job of the witty, rather weird, Dexter. - a child who realizes that his life must end too soon. <br /> <br /> Although there are so many exciting and funny moments in the movie, I have to say that my favorite was when the boys were cornered by Pony. in the abandoned church, and Dexter (Mazzello) cut himself off, saying his blood was poison. Although very ingenious, and a little fun to watch an adult man running away from two small children, it is one of the hardest scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> Definitely check this one, but prepared with your Kleenex - you will need it!
