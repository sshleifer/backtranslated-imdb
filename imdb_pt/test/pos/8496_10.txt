This is one of the best movies I've seen in years. I took myself to a new time and place. It was as if I was there with Ray through his many trials and triumphs. Jamie Foxx became Ray. During the film he was Ray. In addition, Kerry Washington, Sharon Robinson and Regina King were superb. The film was well released and directed, the music was fantastic. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie four (4) times with different people and the last time was as enjoyable as the first time. I'm going to buy the DVD as soon as it's released. This is a movie that will be seen repeatedly over the next few years. <br /> <br /> Thank you for a great experience.
