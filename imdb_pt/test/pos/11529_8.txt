If I look closely enough, flaws can be found in this movie, especially with the script. I found Wolf's character not totally convincing. However, those were my only "complaints". Because when this movie started at Cable, I was going to record it and watch it later. However, from the beginning, with the mysterious music and Cameron Diaz making her dance the 60's, I was fascinated. I never got up until the movie was over. It seemed like I never even blinked. <br /> <br /> The performance of Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster was excellent. The scenes were beautiful, the girls were beautiful and the music was amazing and touching. The story was quite original and sometimes had a surreal quality. The viewer would tend to like the picture better if he had a good understanding of the mood of the young in the 1960s and 1970s, especially in America. Many of the scenes basically managed to show something of that era that is difficult to define. It was a bit more complicated than the simplistic claim that they wanted to change the world and they were disappointed, although that may be the most obvious aspect. Phoebe learns more and more about it as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> One aspect that does not seem to be addressed by the other reviewers that can be mentioned is the way the two daughters seem to live for life. after the death of his father. They both adored him and his presence had been a stabilizing factor in their lives and, of course, he had loved them very much. We read a lot today about boys who lose their parents too soon, just to get lost. This film covers the cascade effect of the loss of the father on the daughters left behind, first on the older sister, Faith, and then on her younger sister. Your mother feels inadequate to try to be a father and mother. This kind of dynamics is not covered in almost any other film, especially in so many different layers of plot and subframe. The internal struggles of reality against Phoebe's perceptions are gradually peeled like layers of onion. <br /> <br /> Speaking of plot, this movie must be higher than here. I was waiting for a big conspiracy to find out about Faith's death. How this was solved surprised me, even though others may have guessed much earlier. <br /> <br /> Maybe not for everyone, but I could watch this movie many, many times.
