Who can ask for more? Taking my 2 and 4 year old children was a risk, I admit. But it's worth. They were delighted credit credit, with their parents next to them. <br /> <br /> I took the kids to movies before with mixed results: very scary, very boring, very sophisticated, anything. With this film, however, I was happy to see a clever film with humor, style and a sense of passion emanating from the screen. Any film that takes 5 (!) Years to produce, whether good or bad, deserves some respect for the bravery and patience needed to film a movie like this. <br /> <br /> O.K. I'm gushing a little. Then again, why should not I get excited? Looking through the list of movies today I just remembered the poor quality of the films that are distributed. At least for now Regardless, W & G is a well made movie. Perhaps the originality was not the most inspired, however, well told and well rhythmic. Very adult humor? Many sexual references? Perhaps. Although my children did not catch them. Very young. So in my case, I did not really realize. <br /> <br /> Well, it goes without saying that I liked it.
