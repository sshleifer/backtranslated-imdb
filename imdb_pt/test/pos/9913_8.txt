Kirk and the crew visit a mining federation on a remote planet rich in mineral resources. The Devil in the Dark is Horta, a very unusual silicon-based life form that runs through solid rock. Horta has killed miners and, it is decided, must be destroyed. But how? <br /> <br /> It's hard to continue this review without writing a spoiler, so instead, I simply focus on the technical aspects of the episode and play on its themes. The special effects are good, but many of the scenes with Horta seem a bit absurd. The performance is quite average for the TOS. Some of the miners are a little awkward. Nimoy has the most difficult role of everyone in Devil in the Dark, and he does it well. <br /> <br /> Why is this still one of my favorites? <br /> <br /> The Dark Devil is really a game of anthropological and ecological morality disguised as adventure. More than many episodes of this great TV series, this brings to light the importance of keeping an open mind and at least some degree of empathy towards others. In addition, it involves one of the most interesting, if not likely, twists of the original series. <br /> <br /> Have fun!
