Having seen "only" about 200 Hong Kong films in my time, I must say that this movie is among my favorite favorites. Not only is the plot involved (and, to some extent, surprising, which is now rare for any movie), but the chemistry between the two main actors is superb. High-grade casting! And while HK's more serious films often have a bit of humor between drama and action, often spoiling the mood a little, here the jokes are kept subtle and intertwined in the plot, enhancing even the relationships between the characters . The music is also very well made, and the two main themes are very beautiful. With the release of the HK special edition, they even cleaned the image (the first release was grainy) and the subtitles even though the translation quality is still missing (nothing new). All in all, if you have to see a HK movie that is not directed by John Woo or have Chow Yun Fat on it, this should be at least on your short list! A truly fascinating and fun watch!
