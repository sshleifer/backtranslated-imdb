I've seen some movies from the Far East recently ..... some were excellent (Battle Royale, Infernal Affairs, the Eye), and some were not so good (Versus, The Triple Cross). Then there are those like Uzumaki and Returner, who, though imperfect, still liked it. <br /> <br /> The basic premise involves the mysterious and horrific effects that a growing obsession with spirals has upon the community. Does it look silly? Yes, that's what I thought. First of all, the good things. Direction was top notch, certainly a bit over the top in places but never the less interesting and elegant. Second, the story was original and as other writers commented very lovelace-esq ... it was interesting. What reminded me the most, however, was the beginning of Cronenberg; movies like Shivers and Videodrome. <br /> <br /> The performance was not great, but it was not horrible either. To be honest I was really bored on some occations ... I felt the pace especially initially was a bit slow. My main problem was that it was too silly and funny to be a real horror, and still not enough to be considered a comedy. * SPOILERS * below. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * Some good scenes (washer =)) and I liked the final shot / voiceover. At first I thought it ended very abruptly, but about 20 seconds later I realized the meaning and liked the ending. However, because of the lack of seriousness in the story, combined with the top scenes, such as the school report, I did not care much about the characters in the end. The final scene that might have been a bit touching, while in reality I could not really care about her girl or her boyfriend. * SPOILERS END * So I liked this movie, but it frustrated me and I think there was real potential beyond some good scenes. Some other points, the main girl is very pretty and cute, and the song that plays in the end is also good. I rated 7/10. <br /> <br />
