The chemistry between Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy was incredible. They were completely convincing and genuinely nice in their roles. Imelda Staunton interpreted conniving Mrs. Sucksby brilliantly. Despite the fact that she was a vile opportunist, she somehow managed to get you sympathizing with her in the end. Rupert Evans played the slime-ball gentleman with pure charm and sarcasm. He was a scene thief. The story itself was very original, as was the way it was told. The setting of Victorian England featuring two main lesbian characters was intriguing and charming. There were some fantastic and unexpected twists that really kept the audience involved in the story. A wonderful cast and excellent story made this film superb.
