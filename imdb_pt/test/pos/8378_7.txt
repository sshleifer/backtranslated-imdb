There is a "Third Man" look in the somber black and white photograph of STOLEN IDENTITY, a thriller produced by Turhan Bey, a former movie star at Universal during the 1940s. It is a cleverly filmed story of envy that leads to murder when a famous pianist (FRANCIS LEDERER) becomes overly possessive of his wife (JOAN CAMDEN) and soon intends to make a scheme to assassinate a man with whom he is having an affair. /> A taxi driver (DONALD BUKA) is giving a ride to the woman's lover as he leaves the hotel to talk to a worker coming down the street. Lederer uses the sound of the drill to muffle the sound of the bullet he puts on the passenger's head from outside the back of the car. When Buka returns to his taxi, he finds a dead man in the passenger seat. On the way to report the murder to the police, he changes his mind and decides to change his identity with the dead man who has an American Passport that means Buka could fulfill his ambition to return to the United States. The plot of stolen identity becomes thicker when the man's girlfriend (Lederer's wife) shows up at the hotel to accuse Buka of being a dead man. It's the kind of plot that viewers have seen countless times, but it gives a good workout here, with many tense scenes while Buka and Lederer's wife plans to flee the authorities until a final showdown with the killer and the police. <br /> <br /> It is extremely absorbent, well done. and maintains interest everywhere with an excellent atmospheric photograph of Vienna that will remind most cinephiles of "The Third Man." <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
