I really like this movie. I like it not only because it's a great movie from the 80s with a great soundtrack, but I discovered that it has a few instigating moments. They are only moments; not the whole movie. It's definitely not like "Less than Zero." <br /> <br /> The scenes deal with the typical peer pressure and also with more difficult problems, such as the betrayal of trust. These problems are not easily solved or forgotten by the characters. Certain scenes will stand out and invite reflection on one's own teen experiences and how those experiences may have affected the character and perspective of a person as an adult. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie and think about the problems that young people face. and about their own experiences. Or you can just pay attention to the boys' quest to get away with it! :) Anyway, it's a good movie.
