This documentary about the life and comedy of Bill Hicks presents excerpts from Hicks' "Revelations" and other stand-up shows. He also presents interviews with fellow comedians and industry people who knew him, as well as reporters and journalists who talk about how his political commentary was crude and brutal. <br /> <br /> I really liked it. I had seen "Revelations," but the comedy clips were still refreshing. It's a good balance between comedy and documentary that will explain Hicks's popularity to non-fans and please those who are already familiar with him. <br /> <br /> I rated it as a ten.
