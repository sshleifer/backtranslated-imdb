I saw this movie by chance in Paris. I entered the wrong theater by accident and when I realized it was not a preview or a short film, I was hooked. <br /> <br /> Paulina does a phenomenal job of holding her attention with her acting. I can not say enough how impressed I was with her portrayal of this truly deadly woman. The rest of the cast also performs well. Do not get me wrong, this is not the biggest movie of all time, but since I did not know anything about it, I got a lasting and very positive impression. <br /> <br /> Finally, DO NOT speak French in France was worth it at once! I did not stop talking about this movie for 3 weeks after seeing it.
