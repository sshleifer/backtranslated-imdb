After all these years, I'm intrigued by the reason why Julie Brown (West Coast) is not a household name or an extremely famous comedy star. She's one of the funniest women on the planet. In this parody, she takes on Madonna, who is one of her favorite targets. She is Medusa, a hugely successful singer, like Madonna, who also had the documentary "Truth or Dare." Julie Brown cheats Madonna as Medusa, who came from Wisconsin, the land of dairy and beer. I remember the segment where she went to Wisconsin to visit her family and a tomb. I can not remember if it was a parent or your pet. I remember someone saying that Medusa did nothing original. She was just copying the others. I have to say that I hope this fake documentary is available on DVD somewhere. Julie Brown was at her best teasing and mocking others.
