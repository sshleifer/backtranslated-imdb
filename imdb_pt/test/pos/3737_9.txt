I think this show was right on the money for me. I watched him on the plane, but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from ripping all over the place. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane was very convincing (fantastic action on both sides)! I loved how Diane Lane's daughter also performed on the show. She showed maturity and how she became during the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could be in real life. <br /> <br /> I loved this show from start to finish. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!
