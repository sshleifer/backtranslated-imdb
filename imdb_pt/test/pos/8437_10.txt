James Bridges "The China Syndrome" is a first-rate thriller; a model for those who want to make a genuinely terrifying thriller, but do not know how. <br /> <br /> Most thrillers end with the shoot-em-up and standard chase ending with the villain getting what he deserves. But Bridges understands that this standard ending is not the case in some scenarios. "The China Syndrome" is exciting in a way that no one would expect. There's the kind of ending that's so unexpected, but still so logical. The film stars three current Oscar winners Jack Lemmon (Best Actor in 1973 for Save the Tiger), Jane Fonda (Best Actress 1971 and 1978 for "Klute" and "Coming Home" respectively) and Michael Douglas (Best Picture 1975 for producing "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest." This is not his "spot the star" movie that became so popular in the 1970s. strong that we forget who is playing the roles and believe that the characters are real people.This is a testament to the collective ablations of all three actors.These may be stars, but they are actors first. score in the movie.In addition to some background music from jukeboxes or TV shows, there is nothing.B Bridges does not allow any directional style to appear on the screen.It is simply to present the material directly.With a strong dramatic story like this, We do not need a score to distract us. looks like a predecessor of the Dogma 95 filming started by Lars Von Trier in 1997. He focuses on characters and history instead of style. <br /> <br /> The story is about a nuclear power plant located in Southern California. ** SPOILER ** An accident seems to have happened and basically the movie is about Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas try to expose the truth. In a way this is not a spoiler, since the trailer, TV spots, video boxes and comments give it all. But from this seemingly simple premise, a surprisingly complex morality game springs up and suspense comes from human nature and people's actions, rather than from a villain to frame another guy (although this is an element in the film). That's what makes the "Syndrome of China" so good. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
