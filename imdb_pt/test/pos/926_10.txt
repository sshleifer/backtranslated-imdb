Master Kieslowsky came up with an idea in 1993, the idea was to portray how human relations are in the world today, going from White (a visual work on a woman's life) to White (a visual comedy film about marriage) and finally arriving at Red (A masterpiece that deals with human interaction). <br /> <br /> Although I will not ruin the move, I can easily say that Red is the best movie of the 90's because it has one of the strongest messages in a screenplay I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film starts a bit slow, but thinks it's a pace early enough to keep you entertained throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The presentations are perfect, sublime. since the characters are completely realistic and are not clich√©s at all and you can not expect less from the actors and no one is disappointed ... seriously, I believe Jean Louis Tringtignat deserved at least an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> The music of Zbiegnew Preisner is incredible, it is one of the best musical notes of all time. Piotr Sobocinsk Cinematography is also notable, he received an Oscar nomination for it (and deserved to win). <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is a perfect 10 and will be loved by people who love foreign cinema and people who do not. Do not miss. <br /> <br /> How terrible the Pulp Fiction surpassed this masterpiece in Cannes is beyond my comprehension
