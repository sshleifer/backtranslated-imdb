"Subconscious Cruelty" has to be one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. It's still extremely bleak and bloody at times, so fans of mainstream politically correct terror trash should not bother. The film mixes many wonderful visuals with a lot of sleaze. and gore. It's extremely strange, vicious and disturbing, so bizarre movie fans will not be disappointed. My favorite segment of "Subconscious Cruelty" is "Human Larvae" which shows us a distorted relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister. The delivery scene is particularly unpleasant and is not easily forgotten. The last segment "Right Brain / Martyrdom" is incredibly hard and blasphemous with scenes of genital mutilation and terrible torture. We see Jesus Christ captured by three naked women who mutilate him, tearing flesh from his chest, licking a wound in the knee and pissing on him. There is also a statue of Jesus with a projection of a swastika on it. "Subconscious Cruelty" is a truly memorable movie that must be seen by extreme movie fans. Check out.
