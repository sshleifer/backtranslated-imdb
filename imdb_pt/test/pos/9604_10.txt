As you can see, I have sent 2 comments on this program since 1991 ... and no, ITV has not yet made it available for general release. <br /> <br /> THEN I recently contacted ITV to see if there was any way to get a copy, and that was your answer ....... "Unfortunately there are no plans for this program to be released on DVD / video.You can however, get copies from our Requesters department for viewers.The email address is: viewers.requests@itv.com ". <br /> <br /> I hope everyone has the opportunity to enjoy this short comedy classic again. <br /> <br />
