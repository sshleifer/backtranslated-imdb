BROADCAST NEWS opens with a series of short vignettes that are a clever way to start a story about TV anchors that have no clue what they are reporting. <br /> <br /> In a speech before a group of people - if reporters, all bored with their presentation, most of them come out. When the latter leaves, the co-host of the event says quietly to HOLLY HUNTER: "I do not think there will be any Q & A." Subtle line in a discreet comedy brilliantly written, a farce on the aspect of show biz from the anchorage to the TV. <br /> <br /> WILLIAM HURT is the inept news anchor who finds himself working with HOLLY HUNTER as the anchor of the network. Hurt badly needs help in corrective reporting and Holly refuses to bite the bait - in the first place. He knows he's only capable of looking good, but he's not a reporter. It proves to be a quick study while your headset is working and it is getting all the information from the executive producer Hunter. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Holly's other anchor friend (ALBERT BROOKS) helps feed the information she's passing through. Of course she is conflicted about her feelings by reporter Brooks and equally strong attraction by the host of Hurt boys, who is having her own flirt with a staff member. <br /> <br /> You have to wait up to twenty minutes. before the movie ends to find out which man she'll end up with. Brooks tells her that Hurt is the wrong person because he represents everything against her. In this unpredictable comedy, there is no way to know who Hunter (the neurotic heroine) will end up. Appropriately, HOLLY HUNTER, WILLIAM HURT and ALBERT BROOKS were all nominated for an Oscar (Brooks in the supporting role), as was the film itself and director / writer James L. Brooks. In all, seven well-deserved Oscar nominations. <br /> <br /> The script does not opt ​​for a conventional happy ending - and in that case, that's the only flaw in the brilliant script. I felt cheated and a little disappointed at the melancholy conclusion.
