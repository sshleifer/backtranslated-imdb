What I've seen from the films of Wolfgang Petersen has been very good. He knows how to direct the action, create suspense and interest you. Eastwood tends to be great, sometimes excellent. This is true both for your performance and for your direction. Both deliver solid work here. The concept is not bad and the game of cat and mouse works well. Malkovich does very well, and his and Eastwood's are added to the film. I suppose this does not introduce anything new, really ... but he never claims, nor needs. They are two great actors, each playing a basic type of role that they have proven at other points in their careers, who can manage remarkably well and with a magnificent director at the helm. It really is fun, well done, and simply offers. Editing and cinematography are good. Acting and writing characters is also. The movie can be full of suspense and intense, and if you allow yourself, you'll probably be entertained and involved, even if there are superior films out there. The pace is very good. I recommend this to any fan of the main actors, the director and / or that kind of movie. 7/10
