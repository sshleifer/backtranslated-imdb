Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments, but I have to disagree about some things. First of all, this movie is nothing like the cars that ATE Paris. No IMHO. Nothing like this. <br /> <br /> I think the film had elements of surrealism, but I think the filmmaker's basic approach is not "surrealist" itself. So it's not really like Paris CARS, I think more like a strange Euro work, with some scenes with the mark of "strange" not surreal. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I think Heuzenroeder's music is brilliant. They used whistling, that old sound of country and western records, and it's far better than most Australian movies that usually bring the filmmaker together with an indy band that the company wants to push. <br /> <br /> For the name of the movie - I do not know why it's called Modern Love, I was kind of hoping that David Bowie would appear dressed in drag and lipstick ... opps I'm starting to show my age.
