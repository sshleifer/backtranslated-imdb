Four Friends is one of those movies you go to without any expectation, just to be hit by a loop. You kind of file, but then you hear Ray Charles's song "Georgia On My Mind," and vague images and feelings start to flash on the edge of your consciousness, and then you remember that crazy movie that made you laugh and cry, almost at the same time. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so memorable? First, at least for the people who have survived all this, because it captures the content of the times so well-their frustrated hopes, their successes, their sincerity, and above all, the emotional roller coaster that leads to poignant nostalgia. And then the acting is so incredible. Danilow, all anguish and passion, Georgia, as difficult to understand as a wisp will ... but charming, however, and Louis, the flawed roommate with charm to spare that attacks life with gusto and takes every moment with an ironic smile, because he knows full well that it may be the last. <br /> <br /> How much time has passed since you saw a movie that made you care about the people of the story? Even if they were far from perfect? The film features people whose choices are not necessarily commendable, but the film never moralizes, it only allows us to appreciate the human condition in all its variety ... even the secondary characters have a well-defined personality and a history, which is why that this movie looks so real even when some of the actions and reactions may seem exaggerated ... because that's how life is when you think about it. And why does this movie involve you with a complexity that is defined by the character. Truly an amazing and rewarding experience.
