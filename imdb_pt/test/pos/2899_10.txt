Personally, I consider "The Egyptian" in an extremely favorable light. <br /> <br /> It was introduced to me by a well-known Australian commentator and film critic named Bill, famous for his insight and wide view of people. and places and particularly of movies. This movie fit perfectly into Bill and I began to appreciate his comment and enthusiasm for this film that emerged even more as I watched, since I was literally drawn to it minute by minute in addition to his introductory comments. years ago. <br /> <br /> For me, it was boosted, layer upon layer, within half an hour, in a fascinating and intriguing production! Yes, I am aware of your failures! But was it so attractive? the young idealist learning and inspired by his father? the peasant treated as garbage in his suffering? the opportunist friend but failed but still loved by his friend, the central character Sinute ?? and to be sure, an imperfect hero too, like many of humanity in all societies and at all times, but kind and love-worthy too! Yes, I believe in a Christian God, but also, I acknowledge the rights and respect that should be owed to any good-hearted human being who does not disrespect or disrespect the rights of his fellow man without just cause. As such, I endorse this film and its presentation of a man of good heart and conviction in his belief in the sun-god he was dedicated to. Such people will always be welcomed in my world view, and hopefully in many more beyond. So, too, the drama in the ensuing film I watched with as certainty as it touched my heart and soul, as sure as it seems to have infuriated the critics of his day. It is captivating, watching the struggles and sadness and loves of Sinute, the doctor! When I watch it again, I always remember my friend Bill Bill, the movie critic, who dared to oppose ALL critics long ago who rejected him. Did he add criticism from many critics? that they make statues to honor the stars, on the screen or in history, but they do not make statues to honor the critics! And on top of all this, I remember every performance of a SUPERB & TOUCHING show, a beautiful and well-presented drama, which was not only relevant to the 1950s or to a bygone era. It was made for you and me, through time and place, for all men and women and children and for your personal aspirations of love and freedom and overcoming obstacles to misunderstanding and gross injustice and tragedy, appealing to those of simple faith of many religions, it seems that many consider the cause of war! Take a night off from invitations or unfair violence, from prejudices and prejudices against others unfairly executed and consider the merits of this offer. Not for the sun god, or for the power that proves that time is and again to be so transcendental .. let this EXCEPTIONAL movie wash over you like waves on a beach, like the passing hands of time ?? as life should be. And maybe you find yourself in your world of possibilities! Lost offers no more! 9.9 out of 10!
