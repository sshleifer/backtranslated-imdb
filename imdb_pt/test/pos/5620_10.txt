The story itself is routine: a boy runs away from home and ends up at a music school for children. He convinces a famous violinist to sponsor the school. The film is a splicing of shootings over 11 weeks, and leaves many fun holes that the observer viewer can find for himself. <br /> <br /> No matter how long the plot mustaches may have been, the film is justified. for their music and performance. There is a lot of music, with classical works played by Heifetz and the Orchestral of the Meremblum, one of the main symphonies of the youth of that day, and that the music is excellent. By itself, it would make the image worth seeing. The functions of regency and punctuation were placed in the best hands: those of Alfred Neumann. <br /> <br /> Acting is a contrasting study. The children of the orchestra, most of whom had little or no experience as an actress, must have fooled director Archie Mayo by looking at the camera, exaggerating the parts they had and following the instructions given to them. But the spontaneity that results from his lack of training adds an interesting charm to the image. The veteran actors were wonderful with the material they had to work with. Walter Brennan was perfectly chosen in his role, one that he imitated in real life. Joel McCrea and Andrea Leeds were ideal for their parts. And the supporting acting was a true "Who's Who" of character actors: Marjorie Main, Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey, Charles Coleman, Perry Ivins and Porter Hall in their typical role of weight - all ideally chosen. And the musicians: Jessie Arnold, John Hamilton, Marjorie Wood, Jimmy Flavin, Dulcie Day, Lee Phelps, in a serious voice, in their usual role of police officer and many others. If you are a fan of character actors, this movie will bring back many memories. <br /> <br /> Overall, the picture is very nice and recommended, even if you are not a fan of classical music. .tvcatcat
