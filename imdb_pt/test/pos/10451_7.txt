Yes, it is a wannabe of Fast Times, but it is still decent entertainment. <br /> <br /> Some of the parts of the comedy are really funny. The scene in which the three boys visit the Spanish is hilarious, with a bit of flamenco music in the background. The reaction when her sailor husband comes home is a riot. The feats of guys when dealing with crabs are also funny when they try to "drown" them and when they visit the pharmacist. <br /> <br /> The abortion scene is also a ripoff from Fast Times, but it does a good job at capturing the terror of the situation. You really feel for what Karen is going through, and for Gary in his crazy dispute over money to pay for abortion and accommodate his recovery. <br /> <br /> The ending is painful to watch, but pleasantly realistic. First-time viewers will not be prepared for this, and it will be a shock. <br /> <br /> There is a decent look at the boys with girls and the Spanish girl, but heterosexual guys will probably want to skip the penis measurement competition. <br /> <br /> Underrated soundtrack too. Check out early, early U2 (!), The cars at their peak and a tearful song appropriated by James Ingram for the ultimate surprise. <br /> <br /> Some people will hate it and it is a bit dated, but those who like teen movies or grew up in the early 80's should like it.
