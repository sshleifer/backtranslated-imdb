I saw it when it first came out, and I thought it was a work of some genius; but I must confess that I was clearly in the minority at the time. <br /> <br /> For me, the progressive madness of the owners of the Guest House Paradiso gets better and better during the film, with one of the most hilarious climaxes to a movie of all time. <br /> <br /> But I would not recommend this to Mom. <br /> <br /> Lovers of coarse comic book humor will appreciate this movie; there are subtle jokes hidden, but are usually quickly flattened by a comedy frying pan. Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson are superb, and the unexpressive guests are equally excellent.
