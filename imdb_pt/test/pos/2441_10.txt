This movie has not been seen by me in a few years. Came on the Disney Channel in the early hours of the morning. I stayed awake to watch it and found it even more fun than the first time. The story, the setting and the characters are as good as they come. I know if anyone takes the time to see this movie, they will definitely find it worth seeing a second time around. It is very memorable in more ways than one. I would recommend this movie to anyone because it is fun and educational for everyone involved. <br /> <br />
