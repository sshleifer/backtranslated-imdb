I saw this movie on a small display. Though low on budget, creative direction and cast intelligence helped turn this little gem into a movie. It is April 8, 1994, each of the characters are in their "mid-twenties" and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn about the suicide of singer Nirvana Kurt Cobain. They are quickly inspired to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend Cobain's vigil. This is where the film really picks up and brings a lot of funny and emotional scenes. Highlights include: a visit to the tomb of Jimi Hendirx, Kurt Cobain's original childhood home and a campfire singing along. An honest and original work.
