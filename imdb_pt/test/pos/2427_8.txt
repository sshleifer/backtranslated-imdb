What I find remarkable about this fantastic film is that Altman, the crazy, wild guy he is, took the novel The Cold Day in the park and the character Sandy Dennis was originally a man in the book. He was a mentally insane, insane gay looking out his apartment window when he spotted the cheater. It's strange that Altman fans are not aware of how clever he was to change the sex of the main character; thus avoiding the homo-erotic taboos of gay life in the 1960s and actually making the reclusive type of Dennis madness work even better at transposing. If you see the movie again, it will be clear how Altman's wiles work ...
