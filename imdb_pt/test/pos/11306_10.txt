Normally I try to avoid the Barbie movies, but this one was unmistakably incredible. Congratulations to the characters' graphics and voices. Everything flowed well. This charming tale is a great spin off from the others, but worth buying! I do not have children, but the children that I'm a nanny (including the boys) find intriguing and love the extra features of the DVD. I honestly do not know why this is rated so low, but for children, especially their 8 year old Barbie love will love this. It is not straightforward and predictive like most movies are. This "childish" movie has excellent moral and shows teamwork. No swearing, bits of romance (if you're old enough to figure this out) and a well written story. That's why I'm giving it ten in ten!
