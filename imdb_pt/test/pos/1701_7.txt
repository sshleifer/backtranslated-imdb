OK, most of us agree that this is a weak attempt of a remake, but at the same time it is also a different movie by itself. Do not get me wrong, 'American Werewolf In London' is a top film, but 'American Remake In Paris' is a decent movie as well. <br /> <br /> First, the only real similarities are TITLE. , 2 American BACKPACKERS and WEREWOLVES. In addition to these 3 things, 'American Remake In Paris' stands out largely on its own with its special blend of humor, action / adventure and horror. Most people who say this movie is better than the original are the young generation today who think any movie made before 1990 is total crap. While those of us who grew up in the 1980s can appreciate older movies and what they have added to today's horror films. What many people fail to realize is that without the classic old movies, including the B & W films, horror would not be what it is today. Now I'm getting a bit out of the ordinary way ... <br /> <br /> An American werewolf in Paris is a good attempt to recreate a classic, but it will never outgrow the original, ever. With that said, this is still a very fun movie to watch and I highly recommend it. I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. Maybe that's a bit generous, but I've seen far worse attempts at trying to re-create a classic.
