Story about three eclipses (maybe even Indigo, ha) kids beginning their love for murder. Oh, and the people who are "hot" on their trail. <br /> <br /> Bloody Birthday, a very mediocre title for the movie, was a pleasant surprise. I was not expecting a movie that would deal with bloodthirsty psychopaths. And I can say that it's also one of the best movies I've seen with children as villains. At the end of the film, I seriously wanted these children to die horribly. <br /> <br /> It's a really solid 80s horror movie, but how these kids are getting away with all this chaos and murder is just something you can not not think about. Even the smallest number of investigations could easily reveal these ailments as the killers. But there seems to be only a couple of cops in the city, well in the end, just one, and he looked like an idiot, so I guess they might have escaped that. Haha, yes, and I am a Chinese jet pilot. <br /> <br /> However, this movie delivered some evil children who were more than amusing, too much sex before marriage and a decent amount of boobage. No kidding! If you stay out of the title less than stellar, get out of your mind and give this movie a try. It's a horror film from the 80's that is highly commended and underestimated.
