A movie of high intelligence and activity. In addition to being a strong time and personality capsule of the 1960s, the film is also a surprise in its innovative themes and unique presentation of the power system in a group. William Greaves is named for the role of authority in the group. He asks his members to film and film and continue filming. First the two actors, then the crew filming the actors, then the whole set, including spectators, cops, and finally a homeless who lived in shrubs in Central Park for 9 weeks. Greaves edits the film (thousands of feet) together and surprisingly makes a strong narrative with an interesting bow and motivations. Do not expect to get bored with this movie. Each of the crewmembers makes for engaging talkers and is often expressing the thoughts that the viewer has watching this movie. Greaves does well in integrating multiple camera leads using three-in-one synchronized photos and other methods of shifting attention. In the end, the film will really only be effective if it's what you're looking for: if you're looking for some abstract artistic film that feeds your self-indulgent ego while never having a point, look elsewhere place. If you are looking for a film that will make you talk and think long after about the desire for honesty and sincerity in the documented "reality" and the inevitable transparency that comes from it, then this is the perfect movie.
