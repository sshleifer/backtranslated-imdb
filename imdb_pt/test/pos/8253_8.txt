Delicious! He never pretends to be a masterpiece, but it's a small gem of the 1970s British comedy. Since the producers wanted to sell him abroad, he starred in an American (the late actor Richard Jordan), but at least he's not the common type of Hollywood. Surrounding him is the cream of the acting talent of the British character, led by a wonderfully naughty and superior David Niven. <br /> <br /> Ivan the Terrible, from Niven, naturally gets the best liners and the best reaction scenes. It can also be surprisingly threatening and intimidatingly dangerous. The moment at the pool club, as it knocks over the charming facade and threatens Richard Jordan, will shock moviegoers who think of Niven as just a comedy star. He is full of genuine power and cruelty as we see at once how Ivan earned his nickname. Even more surprising, considering how sick Niven was at the time. Shortly after filming this production, he lost his speech powers to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (known as Lou Gehrig's disease). This is the last photo that Niven did where you can hear your own voice being nicknamed by the impressionist comic Sid Caesar. Beside him, you can see several well-known faces from film and television from the seventies. Elke Sommer (blinking her breasts in the politically incorrect bimbo mode of the '70s), Oliver Tobias, Michael Angelis, Brian Croucher, Davy Kaye, etc., etc. Davy Kaye gets one of the loudest laughs while holding a security guard caught on the phone. turn on. "Who are you playing ?! ... Bloody Dial-A-Disc! You dumb dunce!" <br /> <br /> Great photos of the streets of London; making the film a time capsule of the period patina of red telephone boxes with thick round manual handsets, black cabs driven by "Color blimey, gov!" cockneys, and ladies and gentlemen modeling all kinds of retro leisure wear and dishonestly deep seventies and hair styles. <br /> <br /> Unlike Ealing's classic comedies from an earlier era, the 'hero' can escape his crime and escape to a life in the sun. How times have changed! The code of morality by which bandits in movies always had to be seen as punished had passed through the seventies, with anti-heroes like Pinky Green gaining status through their insolent anti-authoritarianism and determination to "catch a sea bass" in a stuffy capitalist . establishment of fat businessmen adapted to the cat. We are encouraged to cheer as Pinky flees, unpunished and free as a bird with its ill-gotten gains. Compare this to the end of The Lavender Hill Mob! <br /> <br /> Highly entertaining, picturesque in his fashions and attitudes, and the material of the vision of early morning cults. Perfect to watch at midnight after the pubs have closed; if you are of a certain age, you are feeling a nostalgic touch, and have always wanted to see David Niven in a branch of McDonalds, silently intimidating an American through the use of a retractable telescope!
