To be brief, the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth and an incredibly young Phil Silvers keep the film afloat and sometimes elevate it to the air. Some of the songs are terrible clunkers ("Poor John" is a train wreck), but most of them are a lot of fun, and the Hayworth scene playing the absurdly big set for Kelly's rival has to be seen to be believed. Another treat is the perfect faux-nyc set in the best Hollywood tradition. <br /> <br /> Another attraction, if you consider such attractions, is the horrifically gruesome male "chivalry" toward women. The oily and transparent obsequiousness that passed through the masculine charm at the time (in the movies, at least) is presented in its most lugubrious form here. Some of the men are like a cartoon wolf. <br /> <br /> One small disappointment is Eve Arden trapped in such a small role that she barely has a chance to do anything. I can imagine a lot of potential comic interaction between her and Silvers - a missed opportunity.
