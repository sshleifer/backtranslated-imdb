To say that this is a good spectacle is to say absolutely nothing. After all, this show is made by the same team responsible for the plane and other hilarious and brilliant films. Writing is excellent. Even if the show is built in one-liners, they do not become arrogant or irritating. Leslie Nielsen is flexing her comedy with all her strength, as if to say: You have not seen anything yet. The format was definitely polished to introduce the Naked Gun. When watching these movies, notice how many messages are taken from the TV show. The bright part is that they do not need to be changed too much. The show was really a testing ground for bigger and better versions coming later.
