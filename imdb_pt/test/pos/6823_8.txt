I think I was one of the people who found that other pearl of roth. his performance as an award winner was impressive. the story that was told so eloquently by Francis Ford Coppola 25 years before, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop. Roeg again proves that it does not have to be a war scenario to be interceded. In a wonderful location, there is a history of contrast. Ruthlessnes and beauty go hand in hand, while loneliness must become her best friend. It shows a more sinister past of a little kingdom of the golden age that lands on a rich coast to a first world country if you send the right men. All in all, a beautiful film directed by Nicola Roeg with a sublime cast.
