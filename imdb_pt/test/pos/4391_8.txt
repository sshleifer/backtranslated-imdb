I originally saw this several years ago while I was sitting on the couch and got stuck watching on HBO. With the remote control out of my reach, I decided to go with him and was waiting for a miserable movie that I had been avoiding for a year. Then it started and I was not very optimistic about it, but after ten minutes I found myself laughing. The complete opposite as I was expecting. The comedy was clever, the acting was very good considering, the cast worked really well together, and the story (though a little clumsy and fake) was actually a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Three condemned brothers manage to escape the sentence and eventually go in search of their fortune. The film is set in the 1930s. So along the way, they find a number of funny and interesting charlatans. Everyone has a different story or achievement that they are striving for. Actually most of the movie may seem random. Some might say it was useless and boring, but if you look for the clever (and sometimes stupid) comedy that's integrated into the movie, I'm sure you'll like this. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the performances given by George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. They all did very well in their roles, and worked very well together. But to finish this, "O brother, where art thou?" is an intelligent, fun and cinematic adventure that I would not miss.
