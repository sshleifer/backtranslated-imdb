This is the first movie I ever had on video, and 14 years later, I still have the same copy. Elizabeth Taylor was as radiant at twelve as ever in life, Mickey Rooney gave real size to Mi Taylor, and Donald Crisp was solid as Mr. Brown. The incredible Anne Revere, like Mrs. Brown, seemed to be the wisest woman in the world. After almost 60 years, the heat, humor and excitement of this film still affect the viewer; we still laugh at the jokes, we cheer for The Pie and we love Velvet for the spirit and capacity for love she displays. I love it as an adult, just like I loved as a child. A must for every collection of family videos.
