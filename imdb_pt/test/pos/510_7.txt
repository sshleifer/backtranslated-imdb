I admit that I go more into the traditional vampire tale, but this is a real winner. Lots of outgoing graphics and good story to go with them made for an interesting 2 hours. There was a lot of blood with vicious blood suckers attacking mortals and even each other for control of the world. A good one for all of us vampire lovers.
