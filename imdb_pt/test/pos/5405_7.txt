"Imaginary Heroes" is a 2004 film starring Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels, Emile Hirsch, Michelle Williams and Kip Pardue. <br /> <br /> The story is about a dysfunctional family that becomes even more dysfunctional when the eldest son (Pardue) commits suicide. <br /> <br /> "Ordinary people" has often been mentioned in relation to this film; is a kind of "ordinary people" with a reversal of roles. The mother, in this case Sandy Travis (Weaver) is more approachable than her father, Ben (Daniels), who is clearly devastated and unable to deal with it. As "Ordinary People", the younger son Tim (Hirsch) is the focus of the film. <br /> <br /> For me, the film was absorbing enough to keep watching, but it has a curious detachment about it. There were some wonderful interactions - mother and son, mother and neighbor, brother and sister (Williams) and some good unusual moments. What he never clicked was Ben being part of this family or having some chemistry with Sandy. This seems to have been the goal of the director / writer Dan Harris. In a scene at a grocery store, the box boy checks that Sandy is "about 30" and gives him his phone number. In almost the next scene, Daniels asks Sandy if she wants plastic surgery for her birthday. Weaver was 55 when this movie was made, actually probably 54, and looks phenomenal. So, what is Ben looking at? However, there is something indifferent about Ben's complete detachment because the viewer does not really see how Daniels joined this family. <br /> <br /> The ending has some twists and turns and some moving scenes. Everyone is very nice, with Weaver and Hirsch being the highlights. <br /> <br /> There is not a tremendous amount of dialogue in this film and many looks. The script could have been sharper. But "Imaginary Heroes" is a good effort.
