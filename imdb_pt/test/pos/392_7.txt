Dylan and Bobby are childhood friends and are in love the way kids sometimes are. But Dylan has met a girl and is starting to put those things aside. Bobby knows he's not interested in girls and misses what he had with Dylan. <br /> <br /> Told as part of the 1980s pop video, part of the home movie, memory of a video in part, this film tells a confusing and sad but often true story that will hit the home of many who see her. <br /> <br /> This film brings a lot of memories and played me very well, but I wish the filmmaker had gone a little further and left a happier note. Yes, we all love and lose, even when we are young, but there is always tomorrow, especially when we are young.
