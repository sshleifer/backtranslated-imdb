I did not expect to enjoy it. in fact I watched because a friend knew that a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but was not credited. Knowing Dylan Thomas, and really enjoying his poetry, but conscious and rather disconcerted by the man, I did not feel I needed to see an adaptation of his bare bohemian life. and it was not. critical and yet appreciative was. made me cry. kiera knightley was superb, even with that slightly strained Welsh accent, and it's a sad tale they count. Dylan Thomas is not the hero, unfortunately he has not been throughout his life and nor is he really the so-called "quarrelsome woman" of the professional branch. is cillian the movie william. a man who leaves the woman he loves to fight a war they ignore. His challenge of rediscovering this indifference is what is of real interest to this film and what a beautiful performance of that actor. I think this movie is underestimated because it was marketed so badly. Dylan Thomas fans expect something more from their flawed hero and they earn less, and that's how it was marketed. is not a movie about Dylan Thomas and is much more interesting to him.
