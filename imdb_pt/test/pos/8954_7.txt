I watched this movie on Saturday afternoon. Dude, I dragged it. I have the metaphors, symbolism and all these things. No, I did not care one way or another about the sexuality of the characters. But the rhythm of the story and the script almost made me sleep. <br /> <br /> That's ... until Ruth Marshall was naked. If you are a man who is not homophobic, you may want to rent it. Ruth has a lesbian sex scene that is very hot and then a straight sex scene that is a bigger notch than most standard movie fares. Their D-cups hocks made the film tick the clock. <br /> - The Powerful Avatar
