I saw this movie at the Rotterdam Festival and I was pleasantly surprised. The picture is so stylish and beautiful, and the story is not just your ordinary mafia movie, in fact this plot is practically in the background. It is more the personal journey of a middle-aged man who is trapped in an existence he was forced to live. The actor, Toni Servillo, is superb, he surpasses this "quiet man". The girl, Olivia Magnani, is the granddaughter of the Italian actress Anna Magnani and lives up to the family surname. <br /> <br /> If you're expecting your typical Italian movie where everyone is yelling at each other in large families, this is not your movie. There are no ordinary clich√©s and definitely worth seeing.
