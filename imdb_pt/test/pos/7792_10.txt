I've watched this movie probably more than 20 times. The jokes are now 10-15 years old, but every time I watch it it makes me fall out of my chair. Two of the best actors, Salman Khan and Aamir Khan, play the lead roles here. Even though Aamir Khan is a much better actor and got the best role (smart guy) in the movie Salman Khan and sometimes performs even better as the dumb face. All the characters are memorable. This movie is full of funny phrases and funny situations (probably a little silly). Do not try to look for logic in this movie. Let your brain relax for a while. I promise it will be an experience to remember.
