There's a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to have Karen sing for the studio owner. <br /> <br /> Richard picks up the wrong key for Karen to sing, so Karen is singing over her natural reach. You can see a look of perplexity on the owner's face; he thinks she really can not sing. Richard quickly notices his mistake and tries again on a different key. The next thing you hear is the incredible and beautiful voice of Karen, and the owner does an invaluable double. Well done! For some reason, I've never forgotten this scene. <br /> <br /> The story of Karen Carpenter chronicles the meteoric rise of the Carpenters and Karen's struggle to overcome anorexia. Many things are covered up. This is not a documentary, and the film left me with many questions. Very little is mentioned about Karen's solo venture (the CD was released only a few years ago.) If you buy it, you'll wonder why they waited. But it was a great recording, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I heard you might be listening to cheap radio in the middle of the Third World. <br /> <br /> This seems to produce more static than But when a song from Carpenter comes on the radio, you think you're listening to a $ 1,000 Hi-Fi drive. Watch this movie!
