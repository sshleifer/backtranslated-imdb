This sitcom was a major public attraction in the year 1984-1985. This was a time when people could see deserted streets in most overcrowded Indian cities whenever there were sitcoms on Indian television screens. All of this was the result of the creation of television broadcast stations throughout the Indian nation. This was one of the essential elements of the modernization of the strategy of the Indian television network adopted by the late Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. It was also continued by his son Rajiv Gandhi. This series provided clean entertainment, which a large majority of the Indian television audience watched on their black and white television sets. One funny thing about this series is that it was sponsored by an indigenous company that deals with Ayurvedic products. A couple of days ago I saw a few episodes of this series, but the general equation of laughter was missing. This continues to prove that it can be with the ever changing passage of time entertainment material lose its charm and hold people's minds.
