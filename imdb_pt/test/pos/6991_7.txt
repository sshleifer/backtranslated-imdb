Even if this movie starts with the usual: something goes wrong, accidents with spaceships, people get stuck, etc., it is still triggered and presents the viewer with some new ideas. Riddick is a little convinced and modified his eyes so that he can see in the dark that it is a much sought after skill due to the situation of the ship's crew and he enters. The cut in the film is very good and emphasizes the mystique that involves the protagonist anti-hero and masculine: "Riddick". The story in Pitch Black is, as already mentioned, to some extent very un-original and unsatisfied, but the cut and cut in the film mixed with some surprising elements that have been added to the story, still helps you stay very well and a is then left behind a hybrid feeling of satisfaction and hunger for more. Vin Diesel performs very well in the role of Riddick, and although his character is a tough survivor, he still makes moral decisions almost on the verge of good, but that does not mean that his decisions do not turn out in his favor in the end. ... Why destroy an already perfect reputation? In short, this is a very good movie, although not perfect. The story seems unpretentious on the surface, but underneath it shines with enough originality to entertain. Some scenes have this wow factor while, as a whole, it's a bit better than average. It can perhaps be described as a cult movie and is definitely a recommendation for people who want a science fiction story mixed with a few minor psychological moments and an intriguing protagonist, namely Riddick.
