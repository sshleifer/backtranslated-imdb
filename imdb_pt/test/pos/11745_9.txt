This film is based on Han Suyin's book "A Many Splendored Thing" and addresses issues of racial relations between Asians and whites, a topic that comes from Han's personal experiences as an Eurasian growing up in China. This backdrop, and the beautiful settings of Hong Kong, give this love story a unique and daring atmosphere for your time. <br /> <br /> Other than that, the story is a stereotypical novel with memorable music that may be better remembered than the film itself. The beautiful Jennifer Jones plays the role and gives a wonderful performance to the mixed-race medical Oscar during the advent of communism in mainland China. William Holden never seemed better at playing a romantic call as a journalist covering war-torn regions around the world. The acting is top notch, and the chemistry between the two lovers provides some genuine moments of affection in the movies that will surely melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined. <br /> <br /> Cinematography really brings the fifty of Hong Kong, especially the hill overlooking the harbor, where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments. The end is a real tear-jerker. Some may consider sentimental romance novels, but for those who love classic Hollywood love stories, this is a brilliant example.
