When I saw this movie at age 6, I was in the CHILDREN section of Erols Video because it was animation. We watched it and it was a totally different game! A very violent story and graphic deaths are VERY fun and attractive, but not for kids. Avoid for family viewing, my mother almost had a heart attack and ripped the video apart!
