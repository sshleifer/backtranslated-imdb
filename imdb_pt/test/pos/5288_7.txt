Hayao Miyazaki has captured the imagination of the young and old public around the world, and his latest art work of art is "Ponyo," a children's fairy tale based on elements of the Little Mermaid's story. Of course, like other Miyazaki classics like "Spirited Away" and his latest film, "Howl's Moving Castle," "Ponyo" is full of creativity that can only truly be appreciated by adults, but it's more of a children's story than these recent efforts. It is a magical story best described as beautiful and lovable, aiming for charm rather than conflict. <br /> <br /> "Ponyo" is the story of a child with a purplish-eyed appearance of the same name, the daughter of an underwater wizard, who wants to escape from the sea and become a little girl. When she does this, she quickly befriends a boy named Sosuke. In the process, she gains a strong spell and unconsciously throws the world off balance between land and sea, and a giant storm drowns most of the city at the top of the cliff where Sosuke lives with his mother, and this threatens to end the world. Like "Howl's Moving Castle," Walt Disney chose "Ponyo" for an American release and nicknamed him an impressive selection of Western voices, even choosing homemade products from the younger brothers of the Disney Jonas Brothers. (Frankie Jonas) and Miley Cyrus (younger sister Noah) to give voice to Sosuke and Ponyo, respectively. The characters are also Liam Neeson (Fujimoto, Ponyo's father), Tina Fey (Sosuke's mother), Matt Damon (Sosuke's father), Cate Blanchett (mother of the sea goddess Ponyo) and a trio of hilarious old women played by Betty White. Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. The effort is definitely there to make this movie appeal to the American public and Disney is getting close. <br /> <br /> But the voices are of little importance in a Miyazaki movie, which is about visual creativity. A fan of transformations and fluid and fluid motion animation, creating a fairy tale happening partially underwater must have been a joy for Miyazaki to work on and perhaps even all his motivation to choose this story. Among the highlights are Fujimoto's water droplets after Ponyo that move like live waves, as well as a variety of other magnificent marine creatures and breathtaking storm scenes make "Ponyo" as impressive as any other Miyazaki movie. /> As a children's story, however, "Ponyo" focuses his efforts on being adorable. The discovery of true friendship and love between Sosuke and Ponyo is encouraging, even if Noah Cyrus cries childishly when Ponyo hugely embraces human life can be a bit annoying. But as delightful as imaginative elements and loving relationships are, there is very little antagonism or danger. Miyazaki's past films have light villains, but the conflict in "Ponyo" actually diminishes as the story progresses. Sosuke believes he lost his mother at one point and deep down is the idea that the world is getting out of tune and that humans should be ashamed of polluting the sea, but "Ponyo" is practically free of tension. The most clamorous is that its climax is calm, despite the general sympathy of all the characters. <br /> <br /> "Ponyo" will surely satisfy Miyazaki fans in every way with their imagination, and beginners will still be affected by its simple, yet visual appearance. ambitious story-telling, but this is clearly more a children's movie, better for families and others who love fantasy regardless of their form or target audience. It's not quite what you'd expect from Miyazaki considering your recent work, but it will certainly be remembered as another one of your beloved stories. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
