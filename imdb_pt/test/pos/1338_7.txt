This movie is the most traumatic and painful horror film I have ever seen in my life. Knowing that this movie is based on a true story and watching Jeffrey Dahmer (Carl Crew) brutally murder his victims is enough to bring a tear to my eyes. I admit that this was a low-budget movie with the best dialogue, however, it explained why Jeffrey Dahmer was a psychotic maniac. As he was so selfish / emotionally inward his emotions and selfishness were so deep in his brain that it resulted in him becoming a killer. Each person he lured back to his apartment, he was attracted and had feelings for, and the reasons why he murdered them were not only for the thrill of killing them, but because he could not handle the fact that they let him, it. In the scene where he killed his first victim, attacking an object in the back of the guys' heads than I noticed was not because he wanted to kill him but because he was devastated at the idea of ​​the guy leaving him. It was from there that he became accustomed to homicidal behavior and killed his hobby - both for evil and emotional reasons. <br /> <br /> The scene in which he was talking while he cried on the phone with his mother and told him how much he loved her and the love he showed his grandmother and how he did not want to move house showed that he had love in his heart. One scene I found quite frightening and strange was when a priest heard Jeffrey at a bar inviting a guy to his apartment and then phoned Jeffrey in a phone booth inside the bar so that the guy would lose his temper and change his mind. home with Jeffrey. When the guy left the bar, the priest hung up the phone and was laughing at Jeffrey. I also thought that Carl Crew had an extraordinary performance as the role of Jeffrey Dahmer. His evil, cold-blooded facial expressions before massacring his victims were so real, I was shaking in my place. His facial expressions reminded me of the way Vincent D'onofrio (Soldier Pyle / Leonard) in the movie 'Full Metal Jacket' looked just before he killed the general in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> If your an emotional person I would not recommend you watch this movie, but if you do not, go ahead and watch it.
