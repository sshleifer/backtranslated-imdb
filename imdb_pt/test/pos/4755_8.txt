Buddy Manucci (Roy Scheider, solid in a leading role) heads a secret police squad called Seven-Ups, whose tactics do not necessarily follow the exact forms of the law. They do the job in their own way without leaking anything to the press, and this gives them the freedom to expand their means of reaching the criminals that most detectives work and the police officer simply can not arrest. Buddy has a childhood friend named Vito (Tony Lo Bianco), who exchanges information with him about types of mafias and shysters working on the streets of New York. What Buddy does not know is that Vito is planning a scheme using Buddy's "checklist" names (he has this book open by noting the information provided by Vito but does not know that his friend copied those same names written inside his book ). minded gangsters in a series of money-hijacking gang kidnappings thanks to two policemen, Moon (the always villainous Richard Lynch) and Bo (Bill Hickman) working with him. When this scheme goes awry, with one of the Seven-Ups being killed, Vito becomes scared because he knows how Buddy can be when he pursues someone ... especially when one of them is murdered. The highly underrated police film has a thrilling car chase through New York City while Buddy follows the kidnapping of the cop who kidnapped him trying to kill him. The film is not overly complex after the plot is set and we realize who is the leader of the group in the machinations of mobsters. Scheider never received the credit he deserves as a good lead actor. He has emotional outreach and we see how to lose his cop and his friend harms him. The film is stimulated with good action sequences and creates an interesting plot of betrayal among friends, since greed comes before childhood friendship and how what appears to be a soft wave of crimes against Mafia families can kill the cops.
