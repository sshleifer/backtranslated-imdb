If you want to see a great horror comedy with a strange feeling, this is the one. If you are expecting a movie of blood and guts that will scare your pants, then this is not the only one for you. <br /> <br /> For the budget in which this movie was filmed, the music was particularly amazing! Even though the film was filmed on a bargain budget, music and audio were definitely better than most movies with a huge budget! <br /> <br /> The story was really well done and the director should be praised. There's an almost perfect mix of comedy and horror in this movie! The acting is top notch and leaves room to make a sequel that I'm definitely looking forward to! I have no doubt that this film will become an instant cult classic. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie tells the life story of a boy who goes into the race to become a tomb robber. It tells the story in flashback of each of the most fantastic experiences that the pair of thieves finds. Vampires for zombies and even aliens! Our stars start out as mere tomb robbers stealing jewelry, but quickly become body robbers to a mad doctor (Angus Scrim) who demands bodies for his medical practice. When the pair find a way to get a vampire to dispatch their ruthless employer, grave robbers discover that the trafficking of undead corpses is far more lucrative than simply stealing ordinary corpses. The only problem is that there's another gang called Murphy's house competing for the same undead - and that's where the two grave robber gangs face terrible consequences. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the most refreshing and thrilling horror comedies I've seen in years and reminds me of the dead evil. Do not miss this one, you'll be glad you did!
