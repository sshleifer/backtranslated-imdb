I'm a Geena Davis fan for life because of this movie. I've always loved Samuel L Jackson. And the two make a great pair on the screen. That said, I think 'TLKG' is the best action movie I've ever seen, forgetting the finals that the audience now expects and that filmmakers now try (most of the time) to incorporate into their films. <br /> 10/10
