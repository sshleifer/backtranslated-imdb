Red Skelton (in his first leading role) plays Wally Benton, who plays "The Fox" on a radio show. He writes the mysteries of murder and how 'The Fox' solves them. Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone. He kidnaps Benton, his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another girlfriend (Virginia Gray). He tells Benton to write the perfect murder ... or his girlfriends can ... <br /> <br /> Very funny and fun movie. Fast-moving (it's only 77 minutes), a good script and a perfect casting really put that aside. Skelton is very good in his first role - very funny, fast, handsome and intelligent. Veidt is excellent as the evil Jones. Rutherford and Gray are a lot of fun like Skelton's girlfriends. All three play each other perfectly - your verbal sparring is the highlight of this photo. It's also fun to see Eve Arden in a small role. <br /> <br /> Worth your time.
