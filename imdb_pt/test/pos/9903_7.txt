I was lucky to watch this movie at the Phoenix Film Festival and I must say I really enjoyed it. When I asked the principal if he had gone to the Film School, I was very impressed that he had not. Movies like these do not come from people without talent. To get started in commercials and then produce a familiar comedy of heart felt as this shows the actual reach. I will certainly keep an eye on what he does next. As a good independent film should, the film is very character driven. As opposed to your ordinary Hollywood movie, you are mostly driven by tangles. The film is centered on a Jewish family in New York, the Applebaum, who was invited to the feast of "suicide" from their parents. The movie is full of witty and quick dialogues. The fact that the small Jewish family is obsessed with being Jewish and any Jew grounds the unrealistic situation of a "suicidal" party in reality. Director Jeff Hare does a wonderful job in pulling the characters out of the actors and bringing them to life on the screen. The production design gives life to the sets with a lot of attention to detail, making the environment look like a house that has been inhabited for 40 years. The edit accompanies the dialogue in such a way that makes you sit in your seat wondering who will stab who with the next witty phrase or joke. And when appropriate, the film slows down to let audiences dive deeper into the meanings and motivations hidden within these lovable characters. If you are a fan of Woody Allen or films like "As Good as It Gets", watch this movie.
