I just watched "solitary dove's return" and it was very good! I've seen lots of negative comments about this and I do not think the viewers are being real about it! In the television / film business, it is difficult to get all the actors back for a second or third sequel. We are fortunate to have more MINISTRIES THAT RECORD IN LONE D. FAITHFUL !! This production was top notch with the original score, and the actors put their hearts on it (you can tell). If you want to watch solitaire d. with Robert Duvall and Tommy L. J., note the original. Return to L.D. does not have as much intelligence and takes on a more serious tone, but is totally captivating, though. From touching moments to villains, this is a winner! "Wonderful!!!"
