I've seen this movie for over 5 years and the subject still infuriates me, as it should. His anger and initiative were inspiring. Not that I would dominate an army and kill people, but the scene in the well and the rebellious fort will never leave my mind. This is a great movie, but be prepared for the tough subject.
