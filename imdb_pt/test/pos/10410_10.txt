www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html An excellent TV series that should be captured on DVD. This was a show I rarely missed. I found a petition to bring back on DVD. I remember a show where this obese lady wore a pair of glasses that let her food talk to her. Needless to say she could not eat her friends, so she starved to death. Another episode had an accountant visiting an underground sewage and subway security branch. The accountant wanted to close the financing for the project. It turns out that the security branch was underfunded to combat the cannibal creatures that lived in the dark. www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html
