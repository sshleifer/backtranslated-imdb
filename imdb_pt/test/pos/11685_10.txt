The rise of punk music has been poorly documented in movies and most people tend to focus on events in other cities such as London or New York. Penelope Spheeris managed to preserve a snapshot of Los Angeles around 79-81, proving that a vibrant and diverse community of art and music had sprung up, rivaling any other. To some, the bands read as who is who of the legendary American punk; Black Flag, X, Jerks Circle, Germs, Fear. The purists argue that vital bands were lost (Weirdos, Zeros, Flesheaters) and that the film was the cause of an onslaught of suburban and violent macho. However, the issues covered in the film remain relevant, the intensity of the music remains unmatched and the influence continues to be seen and heard in today's clicks / fashions.
