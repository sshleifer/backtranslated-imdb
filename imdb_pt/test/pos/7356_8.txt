This movie was spoken in Fangoria, where I heard about it, it was interesting to me mainly because it was straightforward to the video and I recognized two of the stars on the cover, James Marsden of Disturbing Behavior and Christine Taylor of The Craft. And to my surprise on Valentine's Day when I was looking for the horror hall to find it on the shelf! I immediately had to grab it. I, my brother and our girlfriends watched and, to my surprise, it was very good, the short stories were interesting and for the first time they were really scary, unlike many other horror movies made recently. Some of the plot I do not understand, but once I watch again, I bet I'll get it. And to my surprise there were other stars I recognized including one of the girls on the My So-Called Life and Jacinda TV show from The Real World, I do not know why this movie was just straight for video with a bit of hype, this movie could have offset at least how much money was spent on doing so. The only problem I have is that since it was not released in theaters, I do not think I'll ever be able to see it in widescreen. You should definitely take a chance and rent this one. <br /> <br />
