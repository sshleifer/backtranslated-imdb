I thought this was a very good TV series and I would like to see it continue. It really got interesting there at the end and I really want to see where it's going from there. Sometimes we have to kill a series without giving it a chance. I think this one needs a chance to continue, and I'll definitely be waiting for it. The ocean is one of the places that man knows so little and I think it is a mystery in itself. What is waiting for us under the waters of the world. It is even said that the man may have crawled out of the water many millennia ago. This is a new evolution? Shall we go down the food chain or fight for our position?
