Okay, I admit from the outset that Inki cartoons made by Loony Tunes are pretty offensive and I can understand why Warner Brothers got them off the market. Seen today, the Inki with large and very stereotyped lips is not politically correct. However, the cartoons were well done and it's a shame that they are not released with some kind of explanatory prologue (like what Leonard Maltin included with some recently politically incorrect Donald Duck cartoons that were recently released on DVD). In other words, playing the caricatures completely is forgetting our story. In addition, Inki, Little Black Sambo and other racist cartoons are out there - especially on the internet. <br /> <br /> This drawing of Inki has our little hunting hero. At first, he is chasing a cute caterpillar, but then accidentally happens upon a lion - a lion who is more than happy to make his dinner at Inki. However, through all this, a strange Minah appears again and again ... and eventually you will see why this bird is so important to history. <br /> <br /> Beautiful, well done and intelligent. I like Inki's drawings. Also, I'm happy to show them to extremely thin liberal friends just to watch them with apoplectic attacks or even heart attacks. Lots of fun, folks!
