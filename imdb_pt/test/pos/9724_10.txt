Series as a whole - Jim Henson's best work. John Hurt is the Narrator. Often, Oscar-caliber scripts, it is not surprising when you consider Minghella doing the writing. Acting the caliber of Oscar, always. SATURDAY - Everyone loves 'The Soldier and the Death', but something about 'Sapsorrow' lifts it a bit in my favor. In the first dance scene, the costumes, the music - perfection. Hurt and the dog typically interact with the story, but this time Minghella raises the extra level in the ring scene between Hurt and Sapsorrow. The chemistry between the characters is especially well developed, more than usual in the series, in reference to the friendship between Straggletag and the prince. I already saw? Look again. Pay more attention (for those who do not fanatically love this 22-minute cinematic perfection). Never seen that? I'm so sorry, so sorry. <br /> <br /> Child luck - not as sophisticated as Sayshorrow, but very smart in and of itself. This is a story about irony. Irony in irony, in irony ... I love it. Each character is executed to perfection, with the exception of the boatman. He was making drama; everyone was doing romantic comedy. I forgive you. This is my favorite of the mostly comedic episodes, 'Sapsorrow' and 'The Soldier and Death' being examples of more dramatic episodes. <br /> <br /> Side note: Greek Myths. What is lacking in the subtlety Minghella (different writer) partially compensates in boldness, because it portrays the four myths chosen with more sympathy and respect and history of what is habitual. Also check out Jim Henson Hour if you can get your hands on it. For storytellers, it features the man himself presenting the myths, the lion of the 'true bride' and ... no annoying opening theme! Half Storyteller, half pure, unadulterated muppet wit.
