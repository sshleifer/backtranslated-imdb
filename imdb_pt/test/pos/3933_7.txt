A lot of people are calling this movie because of the presence of Paris Hilton, but that's not a fair reason to oppose the film. The reality is that Paris has a minimal part, it passes the vast majority of the film off the screen. The film also makes fun of her on several occasions, usually involving a camera and at least once in the night vision. For those who like the presence of Paris Hilton, this may be a movie to watch at home when it's released on video because at the screening I was in, we all laugh at their misfortunes through the film and she is portrayed as a " questionable values. " <br /> <br /> The movie itself was very good (unlike the recent flood of weak horror movies), it has everything a good horror should; a scary villain, excessive violence, acts that make the mediocre person shrink ... this movie hit all bases. It is definitely worth seeing.
