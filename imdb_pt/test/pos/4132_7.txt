Considering it's basically a low budget cast, this is a surprisingly good movie about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey stars as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for virtually all of his music. Backed by her Crickets, Holly had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before her death in a plane crash, along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to stardom, marriage to his girlfriend and eventual death. I like this movie and I believe you do too. Charles Martin Smith also does a great job on this film.
