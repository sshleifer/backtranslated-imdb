For some wicked reason best known to them, IMDb members seem reluctant to credit the great Billy Wilder as co-writer in at least two (East and Ninotchka) of his early classics when any fan can detect Wilder's hand at work . Turns out this represented the first time he joined Charles Brackett (who wins a credit) and it was a great start. One commentator noted how gratifying it was to see this kind of movie in old-fashioned cinemas and I could not agree more. In Paris, one of the smaller houses of the Revival shows in one of his salles a more or less continuous retrospective of Lubitsch and I am pleased to report that this has touched a very appreciative audience across the age spectrum, although I doubt anyone was really alive when it was first released in 1938. The famous Wilder schtick fluffy encounter is particularly hot here when the millionaire, but careful with him, Cooper tries to buy half a set of pajamas at a department store on the Riviera and finds resistance to sales until Claudette Colbert appears and agrees to buy the other half. The gag is even more milked when, having exhausted the chain of command in the store itself, the manager makes a call to the owner, who is in bed and lets reveal that he is also only wearing the upper half of his pajamas. The film is full of games like this, balanced with verbal wit that makes it almost perfect. Claudette Colbert is great and receives great support from Edward Everett Horton as his impoverished father titled. David Niven in the fourth billing has some funny 'deals' like Franklin Pangborn and if Gary Cooper is not up to his role lacking the verbal dexterity and the sophisticated personality that Wilder's scripts requested well at this stage of his career, you may not have everything and what you have is almost perfect.
