I think this movie is really fun, although it lacks some essential features for this kind of movie. First of all, when Doug and Chappy begin their mission, they take off with the F-16B, and during combat scenes, they are piloting the F-16A. The second thing I do not like about this movie is the ever-repetitive F-16 rolling to your right to escape missiles ... why have not chaff and flares been shown in any movie yet? Third of all, once you see the nearly empty ammunition F-16, many missiles appear again ... the models used to simulate the destroyed aircraft are also not good. However, I think using IAI Kfir as opposing aircraft was very good, much better than the F-5 shown in Top Gun (but this movie is not as good as this masterpiece). <br /> <br /> A funny movie, I love airplanes and I've seen it more than 3 times.
