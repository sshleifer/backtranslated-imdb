A young theater actress reluctantly accepts her first major role in a play staged as Lady Macbeth, thanks to the dilemma of the production diva falling in front of a moving car. A success in winning her accolades, Betty (Christina Marsillach) finds the horror as responsible for taking her to this point terrifies her in vicious ways. <br /> <br /> First her boyfriend, Stefano (William McNamara) is cruelly stabbed with a knife while she has to watch, rope tied to a pillar in his uncle's vast mansion, keeping her eyes shut thanks to scotch needles She drew under her eyes, stinging a result if she blinked. Allowing her to escape, Betty again finds herself in this unfortunate position when a specific gold chain is found in her Lady Macbeth wardrobe that had been ripped apart by the madman after killing a number of crows that escaped from her cage in the living room of equipment, by the stylist who is first knocked down by an iron and subsequently stabbed by a pair of scissors (... to crown this nasty scene, the chain falls on his throat with the killer having to open his throat to Although not Dario uses the scissors sound to get a great effect, with the camera often receding into the dead face of the victim). Having nowhere to turn, Inspector Alan Santini (Urbano Barberini, playing him cool and dull at Dario's request) promises to catch the psychopath while Betty trusts her few friends for comfort, said theater director Marco (Ian Charleson , of GHANDI & CHARIOTS OF FIRE that would later die of AIDS A sad footnote, Dario revealed in an interview that Charleson informed at the end of the film that he was HIV positive) trying to enter the stage after a successful career in the horror film despite being rejected by critical critic Mira (Daria Nicolodi, former grip of Dario), his agent and confident. But the serial killer is highly motivated and a confrontation between them will take place, of course, in the theater, as Marco has added an interesting change in production using the crows at his disposal. <br /> <br /> I think this is Dario at his wildest and nihilistic. Although he has certainly made horrible later films (such as his Masters of Horror and SLEEPLESS inscriptions suggest), this movie actually increases the bet on pure violence against the psychopath's victims. His method of forcing Betty to watch was admittedly a joke to Dario about the kind of audience who likes to look away from the most horrible parts of horror movies. I've been rubbing my eyes every time she just has to blink (.. brilliantly, Dario shoots the sting from the point of view, achieving a tormenting effect from our perspective as if we were the only ones with the needles of duct tape holding our eyes open ). I like how Dario will show Betty's wide eyes, horrified at what she's being forced to watch, while the little blood rips the needles when she has no choice but to blink. Ronnie Taylor's photographic work is impeccable, like the crow's point of view in the movies, at the end, in search of the killer. Or when the camera "travels" through the theater rooms, following the killer who wants to see his muse from a stateroom. Or the sequence of dreams in which we are brought into Betty's memory of an event about her mother's death by a certain murderer, wearing the same mask and gloves that caused her trauma in the present. The high point, in my opinion, is the sequence of the magical shot, magically staged by everyone involved, as the camera follows a bullet that shoots into the eye of a victim, exploding from the back of his head, through a phone that Betty planned to use it for help. We even have a raven pecking the killer's eyeball (to add to this vicious scene, the raven is shown with the eyeball rolling in its beak). The only aspect I did not like, often pointed out by movie pessimists, is the "final" ending that I personally felt was a bit unnecessary, but I think Dario wanted to show that Betty was not like her mother, a woman with sadomasochistic tendencies that, in a twist, refer to why the killer torments our heroine. The rock music used during the violent scenes did not bother me because I felt that those moments of perverse graphic attacks needed a shocking thump that heavy metal can often provide.
