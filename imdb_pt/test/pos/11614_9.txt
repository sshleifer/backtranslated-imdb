Karim Hussain Art Masterpiece / Gore - This cat is definitely a talent to look for. We have several longer vignettes interlinked with some shorter ones. All this is a very powerful film that depends on its intense graphic image and symbolism and is not for all viewers. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a small OVARIAN EYEBALL. Very short segment that has a naked woman placed on a bare table. The hand of an invisible woman covers the supine woman's face with a red cloth and makes an incision in the abdomen, from which a stem of the eyeball is extracted. I have nothing much to comment on this because of its brevity. <br /> <br /> HUMAN LARVAE is one of the movie lynchings and it is a totally inflexible picture of a perverse act committed by a disturbed man. has an incestuous love for his pregnant sister. This is one of those "must be seen to be believed" type things. I'm going to say that this movie has some of the best effects I've ever seen in an indie horror movie, but the subject will make this an undeniably nasty experience for most (not me - I live for it!). > REBIRTH could have been cut out of this movie all together. This is the weakest segment of the movie and has a lot of bare people making bloody holes in a field and stuff. Too short, but this kind of thing blows the film's impetus. <br /> <br /> THE RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM is one of the most profane representations of religious images that I have ever seen and is utterly ridiculous. Think of "Piss Christ" or menstrual blood paintings of the Virgin Mary. Very hard sexually / sexually violent / bloody pictures is presented in this piece and definitely not for anyone who will be offended by a sacrilege. Subconscious Cruelty is one of the best movies I've ever seen. An extreme horror banner will be a very divisive movie between horror fans and the general movie audience. Some call it junk, some call it shiny. I do not see much middle ground. I thought this movie was very original and I would recommend it to anyone who is adventurous enough to give it a try. 9/10
