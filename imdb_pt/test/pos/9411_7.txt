Yeah, it's a little tacky. But it's suspenseful and fun, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the movie, and they do a commendable job given the plot and character limitations. It's interesting to see David Soul in a "bandit" role; I thought he was quite believable - and rather creepy - as the ever more paranoid CO Robert Conrad is a long time favorite - I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been a quality star in everything I've watched - movies or TV. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie from time to time, but our tape (a copy of VHS TV I have) is so bad that it's hard to take advantage of. This is a movie that I think they should put on DVD; maybe it was not universally wanted, but I'm sure there are a lot of people like me out there who like this kind of movie, so there would be a market for a DVD version. I'll keep waiting!
