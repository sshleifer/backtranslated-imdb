Oz is by far the best show of all time to grace the television. Better than The Sopranos, yes, ER, yes, CSI, absolutely. Intransigent, bold and totally disturbing, but deeply moving. Oz took us to any prison image that someone had already conjured up on television. Tom Fontana really did a brilliant job with writing. No topic is taboo. Rape, drugs, murder. Oz is proof of how good TV can be. It follows characters from all different backgrounds and all different races, but always returns to his all-man Tobias Beecher in the vehicular homicide jail. We see what we do not want to see, pain, death, disorder. Oz will upset you, make you shrink, make you look away, but most of all, it will make you think. Watching Oz is seeing a truly magnificent television production
