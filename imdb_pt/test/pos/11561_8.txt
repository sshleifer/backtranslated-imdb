Okay ... it's 2005 and when you finally get to look at this movie, you're probably going to exclaim that it's dated. But here's the thing, the script was bold, the exposure of the music industry at that time was also daring ... and it took some time for the music created by African Americans to be promoted on the same level as white acts. In some cases it still is - but in the 70's this film touched on some of the "background" that many never knew. Now we have "American Idol" and other things that allow us to enter the minds of "record executives" and how they think they should market something that sells and does not market talent. When I was a child, I loved the release of Earth, Wind and Fire from "This is the Way of the World," which contained some of his greatest hits: "Bright Star," "Reasons," "Yeanin ', Learnin'" and the title. Little did I know it was a soundtrack to a movie ... until I moved to Los Angeles and got the wonderful "Z" channel. <br /> <br /> The "Z" channel has shown this film as part of a retrospective Harvey Keitel. Gosh, I had no idea Harvey Keitel had so many movies - and when I saw that, I was surprised. This film is not a cinematographic masterpiece, but deserves more merit than it has. It's a cool little movie. More than a "piece of vanity" for Earth, Wind and Fire, Harvey Keitel does a great job as a ripped record executive trying to "fight the system." There are many lessons to be drawn from this, and much of the "inner" trade that has been exposed. <br /> <br /> If you can find this without cuts, it's worth a look.
