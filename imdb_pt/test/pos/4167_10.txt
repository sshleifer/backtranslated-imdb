A surprisingly big drawing in the same league as Batman: TAS and his gang, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently got to watch them again, with great acting by Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay and Maurice LaMarche. various roles. The only resentment I had was that Rob Paulsons seemed a bit too old for the title character, but that was no big deal, since the stories were great, and the fact that the whole thing had a great looping end. Some people say that was an excuse, but I found it refreshing compared to many series that simply leave things hanging. I hope one day they put this series on DVD, unfortunately it came at a time when DVDs were not yet prevalent and the drawing was probably only meant to sell a particular kind of toy that I never found appealing despite the funny cartoon.
