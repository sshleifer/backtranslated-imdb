This movie is an incredible comedy .. the script is very funny .. if you watch more than once you will have more fun. Although the comedy is sometimes silly but really makes you laugh !! Salman Khan and Aamir Khan gave their roles justice. After 1994 I did not find any Hindi movie that was as funny as that.
