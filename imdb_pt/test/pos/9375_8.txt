An intolerant soldier kills a man for being Jewish and tries to arrest him to a soldier. Not as good as the novel it was based on ("The Brick Foxhole") in which it was a gay man who was killed ... but Hollywood would not play it in 1947. That being said, it's still a very good movie. Anti-Semitism is treated very well, but it is hammered in the audience that fanaticism is bad ... well, duh! But that was in 1947. The picture is well represented by the entire cast (especially Robert Young and Robert Ryan) and the tone is very dark ... as it should be. Very atmospheric too. A big hit well deserved in your day ... well worth seeing.
