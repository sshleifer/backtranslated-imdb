Random Hearts is a very well-directed actor, well scripted and perfectly cast for the primary roles. I found it so intense that you have to stop and ask yourself in almost all the scenes that Harrison and Kristin are together as your characters deal with this awful situation in which they meet. Very talented acting both of them. Many people who believe they did not like the movie for what it was, did not understand the movie or could not even imagine a situation like theirs. <br /> <br /> (please skip this next part if you have not yet seen the movie) <br /> <br /> I loved the ending, which was a big surprise, that tied the whole movie. It was relieved to see how these two good people can get off really happy in the end. <br /> <br />
