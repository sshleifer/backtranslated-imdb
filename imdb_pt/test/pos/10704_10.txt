Unlike the previous poster, I enjoyed the treatment of celluloid. It looked good, and made the film much more enjoyable to watch. For me, this does not detract in any way from the power of documentary content. In fact, I felt that the appearance of the visual allowed me to just lose myself much more in the content. The previous poster was fair to compare the style to a Nike commercial; It definitely has that look. But, to my taste, it worked very well (and I'm far from being a fan of Nike commercials). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is how the documentary should be done. I can not wait to see the next parts of these promising filmmakers.
