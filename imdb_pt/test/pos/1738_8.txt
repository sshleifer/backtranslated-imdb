I've never seen Doctor Who before (at least not in any way focused), so I was new to the concept. I have to say that the new show works very well. It's funny (you really should also say "Comedy" in the description of the genre; many twists are only acceptable because of their comic value), it's well written and it's making a meager budget go a long way. The human dimension is very strong and engaging, which is very rare in today's TV shows. <br /> <br /> I've seen the first eight episodes, and # 6-8 have been my favorites so far. Even types of stories that are too easy to screw up (with time travel, saving dead parents and stuff like that) work surprisingly well here. Christopher Eccleston is a joy to see how the witty and carefree, if occasionally grumpy doctor - if they can find a good substitute for him, I will be quite surprised. But I'm willing to give the new guy a chance. There is little doubt, however, that the Eccleston episodes will go down in history as classics. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Doctor and Rose is particularly refreshing. The Doctor is much more a paternal figure to her than a romantic interest, and there are still innuendoes of romantic insinuation among them, which however is much more emotional and human than sexual. <br /> <br /> A good show. The biggest disadvantage is the low budget - such a program should have better special effects. And why they just do not use some cheaper effects, I do not know. In this day and age, SFX does not have to cost a package - just look at the Star Wars: Revelations movie. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
