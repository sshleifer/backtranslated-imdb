Sam Lion (Jean Paul Belmondo) finds that he needs to rest for a while while everyone around him trusts him and stages his own death. When he finds out who he loved and still loves are in need, he gets Albert Duvivier (Richard Anconina) to help them. In search of his own past, of his own desires, this fabulous film of Claude Lelouch is the search of a man of mature age. Built as all of Lelouch's films, the film begins with constant flashbacks. be intriguing, especially scenes where Paul Belmondo (who looks a lot like his father) is playing a young Sam Lion while Sam Lion is in the same room - a flashback sequence that takes a second to understand. <br /> One of the most elaborate works of Lelouch, the L'Inineraire d'un infant gate is an unmissable tale of self-realization.
