At a time when Hollywood thinks that the taller, faster, and bloodier the better, Manna From Heaven is a comic and moving look at something we all think about: what I would do if a load of money fell from the sky. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the characters took many years to realize that money had not made a single difference in their lives. They all become what they were meant to be. Unfortunately, in most cases, what they have become was unfortunate, despite their good fortune all those years ago. <br /> <br /> While Manna offers the familiar Hollywood plot of Good vs. Bad. Evil, or in the case, Generosity vs. Greed, what sets this movie apart is that Good wins by converting Evil, not by smashing it. <br /> <br /> I think the important message of this movie is that you can change the world ... even if you do one person at a time.
