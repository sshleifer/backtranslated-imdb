John Wayne is one of the few players in film history who failed in his first big break and then succeeded the second time around. Of course everyone knows that the second time was the classic Stagecoach with John Ford driving. <br /> <br /> But we're here to talk about The Big Trail. John Ford director Raoul Walsh saw this tall kid on the set of one of the Ford films and thought he had the potential. He wanted to make him the leader in a big Western budget that Fox was planning to do. The film, as planned, would be a tribute to the famous silent western The Covered Wagon. <br /> <br /> Upon seeing The Big Trail, I was struck by the similarity of Breck Coleman's character to the Ringo Kid in Stagecoach. . Both characters were friendly young cowboys, but both were also on a revenge mission. And of course, both films were made on the spot and show the expense in doing them. No studio product here with a Western set of backlot. <br /> <br /> I also do not think it was an accident that Wayne had this break at the beginning of the sound age. Raoul Walsh, I'm guessing I looked around Hollywood and probably did not think a lot of movie cowboys would have staying power in the sound. That's something else Walsh saw in Wayne. <br /> <br /> According to what I read, The Big Trail failed because after spending all that money to make the film in an early wide screen process, some Fox genius realized that his theaters were not equipped with the wide screen to show it. And when the Great Depression arrives, there will be no money to expand these screens in Fox theaters. Thus, The Big Trail received a limited release, even in what we could call a formatted version, and lost a lot of money for Fox movies. Marguerite Churchill is much like the heroin in crinoline that Duke wins, loses and wins. again from Ian Keith. Keith, Charles Stevens and F. Tyrone Power are the trio of villains Wayne has to deal with. <br /> <br /> F. Tyrone Power is the father of the famous movie legend Tyrone Power. He was a burly man with extensive experience in classical roles on screen and onstage. I would not be surprised if his son, who was 15 at the time, was not around. <br /> <br /> Also look for Ward Bond, though you may find it difficult to identify it under a very thick one. Now, it's interesting to speculate where John Wayne's career might have been if The Big Trail had been a big hit.
