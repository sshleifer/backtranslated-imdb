What do you do if you are Aishwarya Rai, coming from a blockbuster movie like 'Devdas', with some skeptical critics still relentlessly unsatisfied with their amazing performance or convinced by their strong on-screen presence and stellar acting abilities, does? Go home, sit down and pout? No. If you are Aishwarya Rai, you sign up for the next part of the strong period that comes along and continue to prove yourself worthy of all the compliments, compliments, great screenplays and equally great roles. And that's exactly what she did and in 'Chokher Bali - a game of passion', where she shines and plays like Binodini, a young widow who causes controversy ahead of her time. Directed by Rituparno Ghosh {who will later direct it in the equally spectacular "raincoat"}, Prasenjit Chatterjee {Devdas in Bengali} costars.
