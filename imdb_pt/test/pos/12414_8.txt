This is a perfect movie to watch with a loved one on a cold, snowy night. If you like a few laughs with your horror, then this is the movie for you. The ingredients of a true classic cult. It has everything you would want to see in a horror movie. A beautiful girl, A hero, The clown, A TRUCK MONSTER and, of course, a family of mutant satanic killers. This one is full of blood, courage and blood. I strongly advise you to watch this one in the wee hours of the morning, and be careful who sees you enjoying the sounds of the Monster trucks, Bad {But Funny} A liner and our hero ball of eyes. Not as good as the Evil Dead, but a close second. Just remember WARNING ..... DO NOT EAT BEFORE SEEING THIS MOVIE ...
