Yes Barney is absurd now, but when I was a kid, it made perfect sense. <br /> <br /> I did not get smarter, but I liked it. as a child I was ridiculed because nobody could say my name, so I changed. since I was 4 I went by the name Barney Tina because I could relate to her being from a different culture. I'm 17 now and Barney is a big part of my life. ... my name came from this ... I can not dis show what I grew up, no matter how stupid it seems now. <br /> <br /> I do not care if I get stuck, I have nothing more to say. they should not do the minimum of 10 lines because some people simply do not have much to say.
