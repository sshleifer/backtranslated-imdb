"The Vicious Circle" is a very unknown British mystery story. Like many Hitchcock films, it's about a man being charged with a crime he has not committed, and he does everything he can to prove it. This time it's a Dr. Latimer (John Mills), who finds a German actress murdered on his floor. As an honest man, the doctor calls Scotland Yard, which turns out to be a big mistake ... There's nothing special about this little movie. Still, watching the movie is a fun way to pass the time. I liked to follow the development of the plot. Fine actors are a plus.
