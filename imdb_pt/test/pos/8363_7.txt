Kid Power Hour featured two segments: Hero High and Shazam. Let's start with Hero High. <br /> <br /> Hero High was designed to be a new Archie cartoon with its superhero identities: Pureheart, the Powerful (Archie), Captain Hero (Jughead), Superteen (Betty) and Evilheart ( Reggie) However, Filmation did not get the rights to do this, so they adjusted a bit and created that. Here is the detailing of the characters: Captain California (Archie), Glorious Gal (Betty), Weatherman (Jughead), Dirty Trixie (Veronica), Rex Ruthless (Reggie), Principal Samson (Mr weatherbee) and Miss Grimm (Miss Grundy). The show featured live action sketches as well as cartoon adventures. The humor was the typical Filmation jokes, but at least it had a sense of fun. It was fun enough for the kids, though not quite up to the previous standards. <br /> <br /> The other segment was Shazam !, which was very true to comics, unlike the previous live action show. All major villains made appearances, as did the entire Marvel Family (including Freckles Marvel, in at least one episode). Uncle Dudley had the right voice and dark character of WC Fields, as well as his perpetuity of "Shazambago." Burr Middleton, a veteran of 1970s TV shows such as Fish, dubbed Big Red Cheese, while Alan Oppenheimer (Rudy Wells in the early episodes of 6 Million Dollar Man and Skeletor's voice in He-Man) cared for Dr. Sivana . The Wonders always had a whimsical feel for them, so little change was necessary for their adventures to meet the requirements of the Transmitting Standards and Practices (the censors). As such, the stories were very imaginative and inventive. Among the villains that appeared were: Dr. Sivana, Black Adam, Mr. Atom, Mr. Mind, Aunt Minerva, Ibac and the crocodile creatures. Mr. Tawky Tawny also made his debut on screen. <br /> <br /> Hero High must be released from BCI, but Shazam! is still in limbo, as is the live-action show. Hopefully, the proposed movie will help loosen them on DVD. It is worth watching and deserving the treatment of the DVD.
