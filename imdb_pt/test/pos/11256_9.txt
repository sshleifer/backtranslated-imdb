This movie was incredible. Never before have I seen such a film that has brought me to the harsh reality of drug use like this. There is no glamor, sugar coating or glorifying heroine. This film shows the real struggles, pain and loss that people go through in dealing with this drug. Good movie, decent acting emotionally packed and a great plot. A much more watch! <br /> <br />
