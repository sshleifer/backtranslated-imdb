A bit of a curator's egg, this one. I started to hate it with the predictable setting of 'Old Dark House', constant references to recent horrors of the US and regular trips up and down poorly lit corridors. <br /> <br /> But it continues and has are moments of originality. <br /> <br /> I started to wonder, once the murder started, how would they last only six, but then we have flashbacks from a previous visit to the building and we see A lot of bloody murders that is quite effective . <br /> <br /> Naschy is well and in the end has been a pretty nice film. He just does not jump and picks up one, with enough strength.
