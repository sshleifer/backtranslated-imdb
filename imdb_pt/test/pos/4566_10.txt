I went to the movies to see Claudine and I loved every minute of the cast and soundtrack as well. Diahann Carroll has never been better than in this role. We saw that Mrs. Carroll minimized her appearance, almost saw her naked, smoked a cigarette, drank beer, and she cursed. Whenever this movie was shown on TV and finally via cable, I would call my friends to watch it. Only the soundtrack from the beginning of the movie is amazing, thanks to Gladys Knight and the Pips. We saw a black woman struggling to raise her children, dealing with teenage pregnancy and everyday life meets a man she learns later has problems. Finally this movie came to DVD and well deserving.
