That's how I interpreted the film: first things first. There has not been a single scene in the movie where you see the thug (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands on the wall. However, the same can not be said of girls. In the end, you see Taylor disappear while he walks. It seems the message was "There was no Taylor." And the whole movie was an invention of Ben's imagination. In addition, there was no scene during the torture moments when either of the girls confront or are in the same frame as Ben. It was Taylor all the time. But in truth, Taylor was Ben. If they were two different people, then why was there no scene showing the two in a frame during the horrible times? But of course before that, you see them together and that's just Ben's imagination at work. Also, when Ben was out of jail, the text on the screen clearly states that Ben's story was not realistic and that there was no place as he had explained (read my, cars, etc ...) even after Liz Hunter leave Kristy and go back to Find Ben, she does not find him. Because??? Because Ben (Taylor) was looking for the girls. Instead, Kristy has all the time in the world to check out Taylor's (Ben) webcam, photos, etc ... <br /> <br /> Somehow, it all sums up just one fact that Kristy and Liz, both they knew that. Taylor was Ben. So my conclusion is that Ben was schizophrenic and the movie you see in it and Taylor in a single frame were just fantasies of your imagination. Otherwise, if there really was a Taylor, then they should have discovered it, given all the detailed explanation coming from Ben.
