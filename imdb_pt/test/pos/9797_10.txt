I'm a 20 year old guy from England. I do not cry in movies. But it moved me. I cried like a girl! This is absolutely the most moving film I've ever seen, even if the story was questionable. The face of Joseph Mazello when he dreamed of crying made me cry all the time. How could someone hurt such a sweet child? I'm going to cry now just thinking about it! Remarkable.
