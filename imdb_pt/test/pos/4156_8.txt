A few days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-aged lady who returned home after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened. <br /> <br /> So began a debate about the overflow of too many immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, all indiscriminately. <Br /> <br /> I'm only 15, but I thought: what idea of ​​wealth does Italy give to these poor people? How do they consider us the Land of Abundance? Last night I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer. When you have only one donkey and a few goats, these advertising postcards showing the United States as a land with rivers of milk and huge vegetables make such a big impression. <br /> <br /> NUOVOMONDO is really a must-see movie. It balances an ethereal symbolism (rivers of milk, glimpses, hard rocky mountains, the name and character Lucy / Luce) and a cruel realism (the mass of hopeful people on the ship, procedures on Ellis Island). There is a mixed cast, ranging from angelica Charlotte Gainsbourg to realist Vincenzo Amato, to the bitter and overwhelming Aurora Quattrocchi as mother. But was it really so difficult to enter the New World?
