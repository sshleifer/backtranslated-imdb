What is the matter with you? John Dahl? From "Rounders" and "Unforgettable"? VERY Quirky? Beating emma Thompson and Alan Rickman for having fun playing against the guy? And did anyone like Gingerbread Man? <br /> <br /> I rented this without knowing anything about it and found the video as cool as you can find. Never insulting, well thought out, funny, scary. I strongly disagree with the pessimists. I thought the story itself was not worthy of note, but the big cast, which probably means the director was paying attention, elevated it to super cool status. Good sound design too (much more appreciated in surround, but I'm not bragging). And yes, I am a girl, so maybe she has a slight feminine inclination (the guys in the class are very worth it). All in all, a 9 out and a WORTHY RECOMMEND.
