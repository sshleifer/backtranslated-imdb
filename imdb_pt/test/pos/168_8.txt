This pleasingly perverted and eccentric 80s corps count film may never reach the extraordinarily tortuous pinnacle of the movie "Devil Times Five," but it is still an above-average killer kid. The small but useful conspiracy revolves around a trio of clumsy tykes-two spoiled boys and a weird-eyed, bright-eyed, angelic-looking girl who were born during a solar eclipse on June 9. 1970. When the strange antisocial trio, which remains united in a closed and exclusive circle, reaches the age of ten, they suddenly uncontrollably kill themselves and declare the season open to the unhappy and unsuspecting local peasants of the suburb of Meadowvale until so peaceful and sleepy. . Writer / director Ed Hunt, the usually incompetent anonymous hacker responsible for these wonderfully miserable clunkers like the charming dopey "Starship Invasions," the jocularly sloppy parable of Jesus Christ (!) "Alien Warrior" and the incredibly silly "The Brain ". does a fairly solid and capable job here: killing scenes are plentiful and reasonably brutal (the arrow gag is particularly unpleasant), there is considerable knowledge of free nudity and soft-core sex, a good amount of tension is carefully created and maintained, some nice black humor dolls punctuate the chaos churningly distorted, and the somber surprise end succeeds in being truly bloody. <br /> <br /> In addition, the most important cast further elevates the process to the perfectly watchable and absorbing: Jose Ferror as a small-town doctor, future TV star "Jake and Fatman" star Joe Penny as a "The Prey" 's Lori Lethin as the lucky nanny heroine, Susan Strasberg as a school teacher bitchy, Michael Dudikoff of "American Ninja" as a chewing gum soup athlete, and Cyril O'Reilly (the vampire a lone misanthrope in the frighteningly melancholic "Dance of the Damned") as a libidinous teenage guy who gets bagged doing what you think of a hot naked girl behind a parked van. Billy Jacoby (who went on to act in the late 1980s as Dr. Alien and Demonwarp), Andy Freeman and especially the oddly lovely Elizabeth Hoy are genuinely scary and compelling as the dreadful troika of eerily bad and amoral rugrats. And yes, it's none other than Julie Brown, the cheeky comedian who made a surprise hit with the hilarious and groundbreaking song "The Homecoming Queen's Gotta Gun," as the lovely, empty, red-breasted bust that does a great job. , totally strange but still very yummy and naked striptease while dancing in her room for a noisy rock song! All in all, this baby sizes as a sturdy and satisfactory slasher item.
