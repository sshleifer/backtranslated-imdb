The BBC has overcome the limits they crossed with Tipping the Velvet. In the past, they have been "daring" with the work of Dennis Potter, but this mini-series (as it was shown in the UK) is superb. Andrew Davies's work is top notch - I did not read the Sarah Water novel, but I can imagine he did real justice. I comment on bawdiness - most men have been watching for it - has proven to be a talking point and main selling point when originally advertised. The fact is that it represents the lesbian side of society in the 1800s - a time when most people thought they were old men and boys - well, it was - lesbianism happened mostly behind closed, often respectable doors. <br /> <br /> You can also look at Tipping The Velvet as a 'love story' - in fact it is - as well as 'self-discovery' that many gay / bi and heterosexual people pass on and comments that this occurs and repeats all the time. <BR> If you have not seen it yet - be it on TV or on DVD - get it - you will like it - and even the production and filming of it is perfect. Just try to hide your blushes in pieces - as I said - 'obscene' is the order of the day - and watch out for a 'phallus' or two! <br /> <br /> Have fun!
