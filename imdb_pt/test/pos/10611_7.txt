I saw Marigold on a preview showing a few days ago, and I thought it was a completely captivating and enjoyable film. The film is about an American actress who is not so successful, who goes to India to play a low-budget film, and ends up seeing herself arrested when she discovers that the film's funding has disappeared along with the producers and investors. A chance encounter with a filming of an Indian film in the vicinity leads her to be hired for a small role as a dancer. As Indian films incorporate a significant amount of singing and dancing, this is a problem for Marigold, who has two left feet, not to mention a personality so rigid and thorny that she can barely hear the music, much less feel, like Prem choreographer of the film, advises her to do. <br /> <br /> But "prem" - the word, not the person - means "love", and Prem - the person, not the word - seems to incorporate this emotion in the way he deals with everything around him, whether it be her production assistant friends who introduced Marigold to filming, the narcissistic and arrogant leadership of the film, or Marigold herself, slutty and tense. Thus, under his tutelage of expert and captivating treatment, Marigold finds his feet - literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> I must say a word to those who are not familiar with the use of music and dance in Indian films. Unlike American musicals, the story progresses through these dance numbers, as plot developments unfold and character transformations occur in parallel with dance. It should also be emphasized that Indian dancing is much more than mere movement. An essential part of this is the representation of the dancer's feelings and emotions as she tells the story of the dance. This is the main purpose of dance and dancer. <br /> <br /> That Marigold reaches this stage of achievement is demonstrated in an impressive number of dance in the middle of the way, when Marigold, during the execution of the dance, she is obliged to do for the film inside the film, too expresses his love for Prem. It's an incredible performance by Ali Larter, especially when one considers that she is not accustomed to dancing in her films, or that she emits the feelings of her character through dance. She shows her skill as an actress as well as how much hard work she has put on paper. <br /> <br /> Of course no romantic movie can work without a Prince Charming of credibility. Salman Khan, who plays the role of Prem, fits the role of a T. Even when it happens that he is a not so charming Prince, he does not lose the sympathy of the public. Salman has ruled Hindi cinema (sometimes called Bollywood) for many years, and it is worth remembering that his first leading role was also as Prem. He is completely charming, sweet, lovely, sexy and vulnerable. For those who have never met you on the screen before, be prepared to be hit by mega doses of pure magnetism! He and Ali Larter make a lovely pair, and are as good at their performances as they look. <br /> <br /> Will they be able to solve their problems? It does not seem possible when we hear the last song of the film, a beautiful blend of fact and fantasy, reality and metaphor. The ending certainly took some of the audience I saw with surprise, but they were satisfied. Songs are used very intelligently. They are in Hindi, not subtitled, for the movie sequences within the movie and in English for other occasions. But its meaning is always clear from context and choreography. <br /> <br /> Marigold is a very satisfying romantic comedy - yes, there is also a bit of humor in it. Indian locales and customs give it a fairy-tale quality, consistent with a story that can be likened to a modern fairy tale. <br /> <br /> If you are or have curiosity about Indian cinema, but hesitated to give it a try This is a great introduction. It captures the color and vibrancy of Indian films, not only in the costumes and jewelery (which is quite impressive) but also in the lively dance and sound music of the world. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Ali Most importantly, you should note him for his excellent performance in portraying a selfish, demanding, "high-maintenance" woman who nevertheless has an inner attraction that inspires the love of two men. If you are a girl, you will love admiring the adorable costumes of Ali and admire his outstanding man. If you are a guy, you can not only admire Ali in his sexy outfits, but learn from Salman Khan what it takes to bring the loving heart even from someone as nervous as Marigold.
