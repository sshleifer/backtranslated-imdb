In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other, both on aliens. ET by Steven Spielberg and The Thing by John Carpenter. Of the two, ET was the one who won the hearts of people around the world, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people were so ecstatic with Spielberg's warm and strange alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing en masse. <br /> <br /> It's not hard to understand why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still beating heart. The other is a hard and uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us. I think the audience thought ET was a much cuter outlook than The Thing's muddy tentacles and saliva. <br /> <br /> It took a while, but The Thing went on to win a substantial audience for worship services. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare example of a top remake. He takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic and reinvents them in surprising and imaginative ways. In fact, Carpenter does his job so well that he can actually make a movie that is in every inch the equivalent of the showrunner of the genre, Alien. And this is even rarer! <br /> <br /> Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did. It keeps the frigid deserts of Antarctica as scenery because it is the perfect backdrop when you are trying to establish a greater sense of isolation. But though a bit skimpy in characterization, the remake fits well into the actors mentality, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear surrounding them slowly. <br /> <br /> Carpenter's frequent collaborator, Kurt Russell, returns, warmed by the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (which they are researching, no one knows). The problem begins when a Norwegian helicopter from a nearby station overtures MacReady, attempting to knock down a Siberian Husky from the air. <br /> <br /> They end up dying for their problems, and while the camp tries to solve the problem, mystery of what happened, they take the Husky and add it to their own. Except this Husky, is not a Husky at all. But an alien that changes shape. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it, they massacred the crew. Able to absorb its victims at will, it can double a living being to the smallest detail. Therefore, paranoia and suspicion run through the crew of 12 men, until no one is sure who is human and who is not. <br /> <br /> The Thing is one of John Carpenter's best films. In fact, I'm tempted to say it's the best film he's ever made. Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star. The reason I put The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it looks like his last movie that could actually be called the classic. Everyone else after that felt like Carpenter was slumming this. Films that did not flow with legal sophistication and irregular intensity so prevalent in his earlier works. But The Thing had John Carpenter at the height of his powers. It never generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the fierce assault on Precinct 13. From the second moment the alien becomes known, Carpenter raises the level of tension relentlessly. And when he delivers his punches, they come with a dying jolt. <br /> <br /> The film is a mixture of pure atmospheres and visceral horror. One approach that often seems to be at odds with each other, but in Carpenter's hands unites beautifully. Bringing Rob Bottin's fame to Howling, it casts some of the most amazing transformation effects you've ever seen in a horror movie. Amorphous forms. Half-formed human features contrasted with open jaws, spider legs, and fully flexible tentacles. In fact, the effects of the film are so surprising and inductive, that The Thing was criticized for being too realistic. <br /> <br /> This kind of thinking leaves the point completely out. It only damages the values ​​of the film. And there are many. Carpenter only enacts an effect when he needs it. It's in the quietest moments of the movie where he seems especially attuned to the story. The thing is an often disconcerting tale of shadows, whispers and implications. The characterization has never been one of John Carpenter's strong outfits, but works in his favor in The Thing. As we know almost nothing about the cast, this only makes the current situation much more confusing. We are never right, from moment to moment who is who. And because of this, The Thing stays very well and maintains its mystery in subsequent visions. <br /> <br /> A special mention should be given to the excellent soundtrack of Ennio Morricone. A thump throbbing every two seconds. It creates a sinister and scary feeling that is very difficult to shake. The whole movie is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they do a blood test to see who is human is so well endowed by Carpenter, that you can see yourself gnawing your nails without realizing it. <br /> <br /> The Thing is an unadulterated classical cigar. Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is solved. An underestimated movie, worth the re-evaluation it received. And much better than ET!
