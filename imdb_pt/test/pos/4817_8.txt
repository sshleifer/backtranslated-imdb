The world will miss John Frankenheimer. This was his first feature film and it was four years before he directed his second film, but do not let that stop you from looking. Frankenheimer's direction is guaranteed, and he gets some attractive performances from his cast. <br /> <br /> Someone else has already pointed out, but I also want to talk to James Gregory and Whit Bissell in two important supporting roles. Both would work for Frankenheimer again - Gregory most notably as the clumsy senator in "The Manchurian candidate" - and they do a good job for him here. <br /> <br /> If the whole thing seems too simple in the end it's just because Frankenheimer and the writer Robert Dozier chose to tell a simple story, and they do it well. Keep an eye on it - Classic Turner movies can only show it again.
