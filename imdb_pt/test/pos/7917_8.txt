"Alexander Nevsky" marked the return of director Sergei Eisenstein to the cinema after a period of exile, and what he produced was a bald propaganda film proclaiming the superiority of Russia over Germany. <br /> <br /> There is very little plot: Russians unite to fight the Germans; Russia wins. The film is actually an extended montage of battle scenes, mixed with some moments of German brutality (like a rather shocking scene showing German soldiers shooting Russian children into a wildfire). This was Eisenstein's first sound film, and of course he had no idea what to do with the medium. In fact, this movie really looks more like a silent movie with some added sound. There are some dialogue scenes, but they are lifeless on the screen, and the pace is all wrong, as if the actors were not together on the set at the same time they were filmed. Eisenstein primarily uses sound as an excuse to override Prokofiev's score on the process, and in fact, that is one of the film's greatest assets. <br /> <br /> Say whatever you want about Eisenstein's ability (or lack of) actors or tell his film in a more narrative format, he certainly knows how to edit images and music together for maximum effect, and "Alexander Nevsky "at all shines through their shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
