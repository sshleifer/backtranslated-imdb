Do not let the 5.9 rating (like this one on 12-8-02) fool you, this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I can not understand how it got a rating considering it to be so solid on all levels. The direction, acting, cinematography - all good. The story is interesting and original, and my only clue as to why the classification is such, lies in the fact that it is probably the kind of movie that people rate as they do not usually see. <br /> <br /> to play modern rock for an 80 year old. You may be young, educated and love him but he or she has not been and as a product of a different time and taste - do not care about it. <br /> <br /> If you like movies and can handle movies based more on real people versus those senseless action compounds, huge flashy budgets and mediocre talent, try this one the next time you see it ... < br
