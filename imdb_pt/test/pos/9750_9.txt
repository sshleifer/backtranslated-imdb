this was a well-thought-out and well-made TV movie that took a huge subject with precision and intelligence, and offers a cinematic treatment that would look great on a larger screen - the palette is a bit mute for the TV. if you're looking for a war action movie or "Bosnia lite", this is not for you - it's about an ordinary woman who faced an extraordinary challenge for humanity. If you want to learn more about the conflict and how a woman's work has influenced the world in a massive way, watch this movie when it appears. I do not see that many other TV movies have dealt with the issue of genocide and ethnic hatred at that level. history avoids the obvious demonization of "bad guys" and instead shows the denial and daily hatred that resulted in the deaths of thousands of people. I was moved on several points, and not somehow manipulative Hollywood with music driving and flashy mise-en-scene, but allowed to discover the horror and implications along with the characters. this is a film brave enough to let the content speak for itself, and keep the look underrated to support it with dignity. <br /> <br /> Actors do an incredible job to bring drama to dramatic scenes. the scenes where the victims testify before the court of war is powerful, and Wendy Crewson, Stipe Erceg and Heino Ferch are excellent. William Hurt's British accent is horrible - no one else gave him the chance to play a Briton, and when he finally got it, he blew it! - and although John Corbett's body was born to play a soldier / command, he is a bit too good, although he does a good job.
