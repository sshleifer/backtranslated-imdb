Okay, why complain about this movie? It's fiction. Deal with it. If you want to see the bio, go watch. This is an original and fictional version of what happened in Wisconsin. Obsessed people complain about this, as do all other deviations from the facts. Sad but true. I think making Kane Hodder the man the movie got the name on was a great idea. I thought it was not so good at first, I'll be honest. But that only made it even more scary. If you like Kane Hodder, Ed Gein or movies based on real events, I think this is a good movie. But if you're obsessed (like some other people) stay away from this movie and everyone else.
