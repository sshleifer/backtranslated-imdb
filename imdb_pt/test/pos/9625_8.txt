This is my favorite kung fu movie. It tastes very authentic, tempered by a mysterious soundtrack (of traditional Chinese instruments, I think), and some exaggeratedly wonderful melodramatic moments, contrasted by the heavily affected comedy. In fact, while trying to create their own "Western" genre (ie, the Cowboy movie), the Chinese invented a totally new animal, marked by the kung fu fight and its associated sound effects. <br /> <br /> The story of Five Fingers of Death is simple, a story of revenge (for killing a loved one) and the pursuit of the main character to master the "iron fist technique" that will allow him to take revenge holy against their enemies. There is even a love interest, despite the clumsy and polite type (found in most Chinese films of the period). The end result, however, is great and far more authentic than any Bruce Lee movie.
