I never sat down for six hours to watch a miniseries, but Changi changed that. I'm not going to lie, I know some Australian movies can be pathetic and boring (actually, I really like Aussie, but maybe I'm partial), but Changi is on a completely different track. Although not historically accurate, as we are continually reminded, the show combines excellent acting, an excellent script and the addition of humor to provide us with an emotional and emotional insight into life in a prisoner of war camp in World War II. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that the program should not be a documentary, so do not let any real errors disappoint you. <br /> <br /> This series exposes such creative writing by John Doyle (aka Roy Slaven) who is better known for his comedy than anything else, and an excellent director and actors move that creativity perfectly. If you want to see how much work has been dedicated to this series, visit the official website, it is very interesting and you will learn a lot about real changi accounts. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Changi yet, be sure to do nothing for a full day, as you will want to watch the series in its entirety.
