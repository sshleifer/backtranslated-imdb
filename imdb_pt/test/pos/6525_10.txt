For a film filmed in 18 days and a budget of less than 2 million, this little movie may deserve the "best of all" award. Interesting premise (in addition to the usual meteor material) with solid profiles for a cast of familiar faces. 2 thumbs up. Advice to the other reviewer: Do not be afraid to say that you liked something.
