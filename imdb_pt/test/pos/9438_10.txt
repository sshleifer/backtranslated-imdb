I would like to begin by saying that I can only hope that the producers of this film and their brother film The Intruder (directed by the great stylist who is Jopi Burnama) know in their hearts how much pleasure they have brought to me and me. my friends in the sleepy northeast city of Jarrow. <br /> <br /> From the pre-credit sequence that manages to creep up a bit, although it contains a man hitting a window on a motorcycle, the merciless destruction of a quiet laboratory, the introduction of one of the most annoying thugs and anemic in the history of cinema and the costume that Jean Paul Gautier would find strange and extravagant. Do not make mistakes; this is a truly unique experience. Initial highlight - an explosion (get used to it, much more where it came from!) Followed by a close-up of our chubby heroine and the most hilarious reading of the word "father" in living memory. And then ... the theme song ... <br /> <br /> Yes, that deserves its own paragraph. Sung by AJ, written by people who really should want to remain anonymous, makes the songs written for the Rocky movies sound like Schubert. This is the crap heroism narcissism of crap heroism from the 80s at an all-time high, with lyrics of choice like "it's just you and me, its down to the wire" and lots of talk of having to "cross the line" sense in time - our hero cares little about the limits of bona fide police work). Not to mention the Indonesian Supremes cooing the movie title in a seductive way. At this point, anyone wishing to officially disconnect has no pulse. <br /> <br /> Our hero is the semite cop Peter Goldson (written brilliantly by Intruder's star Peter O'Brien), the title's "stabilizer." Man's bull in a porcelain shop approach to crime fighting and particularly his secret work less than imperceptible really leaves much to be desired but he is undoubtedly a fun guide through the middle streets of central Jakarta with local sleaze ball connection Captain Johnny in tow, as well as Peter's own spatial partner in fashion crime Sylvia Nash, who does little. So many highlights, so little time - the arrogance "please slide" of Peter's not very convincing argument against backstage boss Greg Rainmaker (Intruder fans will know of the viscous bastard Craig Gavin as the monstrous John White - the name helluva eh? No! Oh well ...), mark the stupidity of the local location map, our hero taking a horrible advantage from the heroine Tina Probost during a moment of weakness in his name, the latter appearing in a devastated operation as a member of a particularly extravagant troop dance. And believe me you barely cover it. <br /> <br /> There was no time to get into the plot around the hunt for a drug-detection system and a kidnapped teacher with an alarming but laudable amount of national pride. Or our hero appeared at a funeral dressed up as an extra in Boogie Nights. Or the absolutely hysterical craic between Captain Johnny and Goldson - two guys never made a heavier comrade-friend atmosphere than these clowns. The trowel was possibly too subtle, I think. <br /> <br /> Oh, that fools people, and you never thought that scenes of destruction and general chaos were so incredibly annoying, but the character interaction is stupendous, the dialogue really invaluable and the incompetence in the show of some captivating way. Oh and the people in shoes - beware of the shoes!
