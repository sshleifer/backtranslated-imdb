This is a fascinating documentary about a 15-year-old black guy who is accused of murdering a tourist in Florida and the ensuing lawsuit that follows. What this film shows is how corrupt the American police system is and how easy it can be to convict an innocent and like an old idiot who thinks that a Negro looks very much like another and lives if he rot in prison because I said that he was the man who murdered my wife. The star is the defense lawyer who is brilliant not only at his job in court, but he also did what the police should have done all the time. Fascinating things. 7 out of 10.
