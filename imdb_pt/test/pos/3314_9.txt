Having grown up in the age of typing pool and dealing with office politics and men who were able to make a feast of beauties in a delicious meal of the day, this movie hits the mark. Good afternoon. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work on this film to play in front of the beautiful Suzer Parker par excellence. Everyone wanted to be and I believe they have done well and resisted over time. Best kiss on the screen between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd. <br /> <br /> It may not seem like any of this is plausible, but in fact it was and probably still gives the scare of sexual harassment. I thought the movie was well released except for Evans' terrible performance. That ball of grease, but he found his niche somewhere else. Other than that, everyone approached the plate.
