A gentle story, insinuating fury, with a redemptive message and a glorious celebration. The photograph is beautifully executed. Filmmakers look at this type of film to perfect their craft not just for what eyes can do to hone a story, but what the camera's correct vocabulary can do to heighten an emotion. Feeding the soul is, by definition, what this film addresses, but with an elegance and grace of delivery that simply does not happen much more, at least with that degree of taste, restraint and finesse. If you care about developing stories and characters, this is also a great movie to see as an example of what simple lines and right delivery can do to completely fill a character's impression. Combine all this with a soundtrack of almost minimalist character and also perfectly conceived, and you will "get" this movie.
