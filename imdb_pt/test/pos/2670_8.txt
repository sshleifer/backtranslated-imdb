This short subject has garnered accolades from all sorts of places for its appeal to religious tolerance. <br /> <br /> After a session in a recording studio, Frank Sinatra leaves and finds a group of boys hitting each other because he was Jewish. He taught them how only an American icon could about the meaning of prejudice and what we had fought against the Nazis. The meaning could not be clearer. <br /> <br /> Both songs from this short subject were recorded and sold for Columbia Records. If you are but a dream and the song written for the movie, The House I Live In. The latter is one of the best songs about an idealized version of America, we would all like to fight. <br /> <br /> Sinatra actually recorded The House I Live In again during the '60s for a joint album he did for his record label Reprise. The album is now a rarity and should not be. His collaborators were Bing Crosby and Fred Waring and their Pennsylvanians with the orchestra conducted by Nelson Riddle. <br /> <br /> Axel Stordahl was the main conductor and arranger of Sinatra during the forties. When he died this position eventually fell to Nelson Riddle. Stordahl orchestrates the short and Columbia record, Riddle for the Reprise. <br /> <br /> Sinatra fans and others should hear both back and compare. And get this worthwhile movie whenever it's shown.
