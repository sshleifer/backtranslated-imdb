Now I myself had seen some episodes of the Leauge Of Gentleman that I found hilarious. When I brought the film I was not sure if I knew enough about the series to get it, the boy was wrong. This is one of the best comedy movies I have ever seen and Leauge's clever acting makes the film. He has a very good and funny plot as well as use only a few characters at the same time help, because it does not make him very confused, which would have destroyed the movie. Even if you've never seen The Leauge Of Gentleman movie, it will make you laugh and this is a movie that can be watched more than once and is a great movie to watch with your friends. Really deserves to review a definite 10 out of 10.
