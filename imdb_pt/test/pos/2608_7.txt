This is a cute film starring Spanky, Alfalfa and Buckwheat from the comedies "Our Gang". Set in the south during the Civil War, it may seem a little strange to see Buckwheat as Spanky's slave, but this movie is as charming as the best of the shorts with the same cast. This was the only feature film of Our Gang, and I recommend it about the 1994 remake of The Little Rascals.
