I loved this movie almost as much as the original version! What teenager is NOT going through what Scamp is going through, wanting to find independence getting more and more distant from his family? The songs were cool, and the character designs were great. .Lady and Tramp seem almost exactly like they did in the original movie. They did a good job in the voices of those two, also considering the fact that the original voice actors are probably dead. However, I think they should have given more lines to Lady, Annette, Colette and Daniel. Oh well, at least they had the good sense to keep the same scenario as the original movie.
