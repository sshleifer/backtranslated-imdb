I honestly can not believe this movie is not rated better. Claude Chabrol could be described as something like a French Alfred Hitchcock, and while this film is only the second I've seen (the first is Le Boucher), I can already see that this guy is something special only in the strength of these two films. The film is a French and Canadian co-production, and takes place in Canada. The cast is comprised of British and Canadian stars and the high quality performances are good with the rest of the film; most of which is high quality too. The film is a murder mystery and begins when a girl covered in blood is taken to a police station. After being interrogated by Inspector Carella, it emerges that the young woman, Patricia, and her sister Muriel were attacked by a man who killed her sister and only allowed Patricia to flee. However, as the investigation continues, Patricia returns to the police station to give new evidence, which reveals a much more shocking identity for the killer. <br /> <br /> The performances in this movie are excellent. Donald Sutherland is subjugated as usual, but he fits very well in the role he gave here and I would not hesitate to name his performance in Blood Relatives as one of his best. The film also features supporting twists of British stars Donald Pleasance and David Hemmings, both giving good turns; Pleasance in particular, which shows just how great actor he can be and highlights the shame he went on to waste on Halloween movies. The unknown Aude Landry also gives a great performance in her role as Patricia. The movie is very mysterious for the first hour and really keeps the audience hooked. When Inspector Carella discovers Muriel's diary, the film turns into yet another drama in which the girl's latest actions are shown; and while this section of the movie is not as good as before, it's still interesting and leads to a major turnaround in the end! Overall, Blood Relatives is a great movie that really deserves to be seen best. Le Boucher is a more known effort of Chabrol, but for my money this is at least as good! Preview highly recommended.
