Giorgino is a long and excruciating journey from bad to worse in the life of protagonist, to whom the film is called. Young demobilized, poisoned by gas First lieutenant of World War II of very delicate health, who previously was doctor in an orphanage for children with some mental deprivation, goes in a search of his new location and finds much more than he pretended and enough of a different nature. Depressive atmosphere of extreme despair, where the insane are far less horrible than the wholesome ones, where madness is a kind of poetry, will keep you mesmerized from the first pictures of this film to the last. And all the beauty: the beauty of winter and mountains, the beauty of snowy landscapes and wild woods, I do not know how all the sadness and sadness of the last days of war could be so beautiful.
