I loved this movie! Films and plays fulfill their purpose when they expose social, political, and other problems that affect the majority. This film served that purpose. <br /> <br /> I identify with the plot and know people to whom it happened. By the time this movie was made, concepts presented in this film were advanced to the public, but had already happened to friends of mine through people in powerful positions. And I know what it is when people do to you what they did to Angela Bennett because they did this to me. I really liked Sandra Bullock's portrait of Angela Bennett / Ruth Marx. It portrays a beautiful, intelligent and witty young woman who has the courage to avoid giving up, striving hard to maintain her sanity and restore her life and try to protect those she loves. Losing his self-concept and succumbing to that old attempt to bolster self-esteem by engaging in sex with a stranger added a poignant touch to reality. <br /> <br /> The climax of the plot reveals the only reality. solution for this type of problem.
