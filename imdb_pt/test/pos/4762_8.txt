I love the other comments from this movie. They mirror my attitude. I'm a 70's guy, less disco and childish "Star Wars". There was nothing good about this movie except for a chase scene. That's why it was good, because it was hard, basic and economical. Roy Scheider took the film, which was based on the crew, the 7 Ups, who supported Gene Hackman in the "French Connection". The people were credible and medium-sized, who burned themselves pouring coffee, showed fear in the chase scene and almost lost it after a car accident. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it would be easier to say what he lacked. There were no sophisticated weapons, only basic revolvers and rough rifles. There was no tough philosophizing face, Tarantino wing. There was no kung fu or absurd samurai and no fancy trick either. There was no smart guy to do some complicated scheme based on hundreds of things, going the way he planned, including everyone else's reactions. Criminals were thugs, but they did not shoot people for it. In fact, there was a count of only three. something that the average movie nowadays would pass in the opening credits. It could be a G movie today! No busload of orphaned children was kidnapped nor terrorists threatening to kill half of the city. There were no high tech bans, nor the crimes themselves were too touching or ingenious, the highest tech thing I've seen was a touch ATT wall phone. There were no subplots or developments of fun characters. Besides, no sex or woman, except the wife of a mafioso who made some screams when the friend of our hero threatened her. <br /> <br /> It was a small undertaker who explored his connections with the local mafia and the police to kidnap local mobsters for some easy payments. Funeral directors. Vito, was played by Tony Lo Bianco, who did a great job, as good as Roy Schneider, Buddy, the boss of the 7-Ups cop, whom he briefed and exploited. Whatever happened to Tony Lo Bianco, he looked like a pretty and talented Pacino shoe? What he had was a great New York background for a simple crime story. Places that were bleak and dehumanizing without being a sociological study. It had a simple plot that involved this kidnapping scheme in which a Buddy cop was accidentally involved, literally dragged accidentally and accidentally shot to death. Since Buddy and his friends are a hot dog unit, both NYPD Brass and mobsters thought he was involved, as hijackers disguised themselves as plainclothes cops to lure gangsters. Obviously, mobsters thought they had lawyers and rights to protect them from normal police. Even the mafiosi were simple, old and ugly, no godfather royalty or soprano hypocrisy here. <br /> <br /> It's a good basic movie with a prominent chase scene between two 70's and d's Pontiacs. Even the cars were simple and economical, not even a GTO or Trans Am, like acting and history. In the days of batman uber-hype or "24" intensity levels apocalyptic scenarios, this movie reminds us that less is better. It should be shown to movie screen writers and directors as a warning not to dazzle, to have fun, ultimately to insult us with acrobatics, gadgets and clown psychotic behavior in abundance.
