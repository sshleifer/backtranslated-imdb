I saw this movie as a teenager when it was out in theaters, a long time ago. Seeing this again, almost 30 years later, I was surprised at how well he stayed. The jokes are still funny, the interaction between the characters works very well and the appearances come better than ever. (Steve Martin has to be the best). <br /> <br /> My kids (9, 11 and 14) loved it, and the music is good enough that they are still singing the songs many days later. <br /> <br /> I would suggest that before watching the movie, you should watch at least half a dozen episodes of the Muppet Show, to get a sense of the story behind the characters, otherwise the movie would win. Do not make so much sense.
