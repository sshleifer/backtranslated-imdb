I thought this was a very bold representation of the old concept of 'Tarzan' that made Hollywood so popular, Weismuller, et al. <br /> <br /> Yes; there are many silly things. But the idea is silly. It is almost unbelievable that a human baby can be created by chimpanzees into adulthood. I am tempted to say completely unbelievable, but this concept has never been tried. And there is certainly a lot of anthropomorphism for comfort. Although under the circumstances, I can see how hard this would be to avoid. We also now have a much greater view of the issues of acculturation, and we know that a human created from infancy, without the human behavioral orientations, will never learn them in adulthood. <br /> <br /> Even so, if you can understand Around this lot, there is much to admire that is both imaginative and daring. Lambert does the beast thing with tremendous self-confidence. I am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role that I saw him play. There are many other excellent performances as well. No less important are Sir Ralph Richardson and Ian Holm. <br /> <br /> What is particularly disturbing - and rightly so - is the simian perception of human beings. We have come to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor, stupid, defenseless brutes upon whom we so routinely dominate it. It shows very well how the false "civilization" and "morality" with which we conceal and justify our conduct is an expression of selfishness and arrogance. It may seem a bit exaggerated at times, especially in the hideous dissecting rooms of the museum, but what we see is not just a truth about the Victorians; is a truth about the way we are today. It is one that needs to be stated and can not be mentioned often enough. Holm's obsession with "zorro" as a symptom of civilization - as having facial hair was a primitive condition to be disregarded - is a prime example. Early bearded readers take note. <br /> <br /> The story is depressing. Ultimately, it is a tragedy. For though he returns to the jungle and freedom from moral tyranny, which is truly a human "civilization"; We know he's doomed. Before the third millennium to be 50 years old, wild apes will be endangered as bushmeat, and their environment developed for agriculture and mineral exploration to satisfy human insatiable excess. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a tale about ourselves. The path to extinction that other apes tread, must eventually be followed by humans. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for his ethical stance despite the exaggerated moments.
