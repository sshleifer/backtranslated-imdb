A MUST SEE documentary .----- This movie had so many things to consider while watching. It was a great documentary of a trial of a 15-year-old black boy named Brenton Butler. He accused of killing a white tourist in Florida. It shows how the police took statements from the dead woman's husband about the description of the man who killed his wife. Her husband seemed to want to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man was wearing. The police little to investigate the crime. Brenton's lawyer, Patrick McGuinness, is meticulous in getting information to help his client. He tells viewers what he thinks and the strategy he will use in police to show his incomplete investigation and beatings against his young client to make him confess. The camera goes with McGuinness where Brenton was questioned. McGuinness also takes photos of the room and how audio is monitored. He questions a police officer at the booth and asks what Brenton has heard from one of the investigators and he defies his own words. McGuinness investigates with Ann Finnell in every place the police should have gone and the things they should have done, but they did not. The film shows the Butlers as a loving Christian family who have faith in their son's innocence and faith that God will free Brenton. They visit him in prison and pray with him to encourage him. There are group prayer scenes for Brenton, the lawyers, the judge, and everyone involved in this case. I am white and surprised to see how blacks in high police positions treat other blacks. It was very disappointing to see black and white cops stick together when they think they got their man. The police have a hard job and I believe most of them are honorable, not like the ones in this movie. I think this is a great movie for anyone involved in the court system, including judges, police officers, lawyers and even potential jurors to watch this movie and learn from it.
