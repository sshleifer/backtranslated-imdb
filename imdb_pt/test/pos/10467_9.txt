I watched this movie this morning and found it to be a great demonstration of the richness of faith. Babette gave them another way of looking at life; it is not a substitute, but an improvement. She shared everything she had with those who gave her what little they had. I see the story of God here. He sent his only son to the man. The man could not give anything to match that. So, for our little sacrifice, we receive a supreme treasure and are transformed because of it. In this film, the people of the city were convinced by a little interpretation of God. Babette showed them that life and God can, in fact, be beautiful in their fullest sense. The love that the Son of God showed to man is the love we must show each other and our life will be richer for him. Even the movie is a metaphor. It seems slow at first, but the investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded in the end. It was really a party.
