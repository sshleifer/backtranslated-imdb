Betty is a replacement for the lead in Verdi's Macbeth production. When a car mysteriously hits the lead, Betty is put in the spotlight. The opening night is a resounding success and Betty decides to leave the party to celebrate privately with her boyfriend. But when the boyfriend leaves the room, Betty is caught behind by an unknown figure with black gloves and mask. The unknown assailant ties Betty to a column, chokes and puts needles under her eyes, which will cause incredible damage and pain if Betty closes them. The boyfriend returns to the bedroom and is surprised to see Betty in such a situation. He is even more shocked when the killer grabs him and thrust a knife into his lower jaw so hard that the tip of the knife can clearly be seen in his mouth. And Betty was forced to watch it all. Thus begins Betty's terrible ordeal with a murderer not only intent on bruising her, but also forcing her to watch while he mutilates his friends. <br /> <br /> Opera is classified as a Giallo, but for me, it differs in some ways from the model. Less emphasis is placed on the mysterious elements of history than on something like Tenebre of Argento or The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. The masked killer of black gloves may be ubiquitous, but the red clues and maneuvers usually associated with a good Giallo are absent. Instead, the Opera is about the strain of an unknown killer and leaving the audience uncomfortable. The focus is on the terrible scenes of death, Betty's fear and Betty's murderer's obsession. <br /> <br /> Opera presents what I think are some of Argento's most artistic death scenes. When the killer picks up Betty after her boyfriend leaves the room, you're sure Betty had it. But does the sadistic killer just want to force Betty to watch while he brutally stabs her lover in the neck? the knife emerging in her mouth. It's a well shot and projected scene. And those needles in the eyes? bright. Or take the death of the seamstress. At first, her death seems like a common and ordinary murder. But when the seamstress accidentally swallows the killer's medallion, what began as just another death scene increases when the killer uses a pair of scissors to cut the girl's throat to pick up her current. Finally, is there the most famous death scene in the Opera that I'm impressed with every time I see it? Mira is shot in the eye as she peers through the keyhole. This scene shows a lot of what I like about Argento. It has style to burn. As implausible as it may be, it's creative, memorable and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Argento certainly was not the first Italian director to focus on eye mutilation, but at Opera, a new level. Open-eyed needles, a bullet in the eye, and crows plucking an eye are part of Argento's vision (pun intended). And those scenes have the effect that I believe Argento was looking for. The first time I saw the killer putting the needles in Betty's eyes, I could not stop blinking. In fact, it had a physical effect on me. What is in the eyes that makes them abused in Italian films? <br /> <br /> To be fair (and not sound like a fanboy), there are problems with Opera that prevent me from rating it as the best of Argento. One of my problems is with the air duct system that runs through Betty's apartment building. Although I do not doubt that there are air duct systems in older apartment buildings that connect the apartments, the ducts of the Opera are HUGE. I am no expert, but I sincerely doubt that any building like this in this movie had such gigantic air ducts. It does not seem practical at all. And do not you think someone would have done something about them a long time ago to keep criminals and nosy neighbors away from the other apartments? It's convenient for the plot, but it's not very realistic. <br /> <br /> But I suppose my biggest problem with the movie comes with the ending. What's with this ending? It seems totally out of place, nailed and like a bad late reflection. I do not know what else to say but horrible.
