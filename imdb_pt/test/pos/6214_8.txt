This is a wonderful look, you must forgive the pun, with 22 women talking about their breasts - theirs, their mothers, other women, and how they affect so many aspects of their lives. Girls, older women, and everyone else (with all shapes, sizes, settings, etc.) talk about developing, reacting, celebrating, hiding, enhancing or reducing your breasts. <br /> <br /> It's charming, delicious, sad, funny and everything. Interview with documentary footage and clips of the famous "young women movies" that the girls were taken to the dining room to see, the interviews are a fascinating window for men who love women and their breasts what the other half has to say I do not know you're listening.
