I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites are Unforgiven and Tombstone. This movie, I loved it! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everyone who participated in this movie was great! I even think it hit the two movies somehow. Well, it's really not Unforgivable because this was a superb movie with which these two can not compare in the long run. I think he defeated Tombstone. Both had their strengths. For example, both had excellent well-known castings, very good plots and very good footage. But Posse defeated Tombstone in four ways in my opinion. First, the characters were more exclusive in Posse. The music was better in Posse. The idea was original in Posse, unlike Wyatt Earp. And the biggest difference, the action sequences! Oh my gosh! Possession was a western with really good action sequences. I mean very good! The action was swift. Like modern shoot'em up movies. The stock had huge budget bursts too! The fights were very good too. Mario Van Pebbles was great in this movie! I suggest buying this great movie!
