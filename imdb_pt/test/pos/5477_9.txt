This is one of the few films of this type that I reviewed and liked. While Clint Eastwood is his usual self, the overall story works well, even on the edge of Washington DC. The theme: A killer is following the president, and there is only one person who can save him. <br /> <br /> It can not be easy to make a movie that audiences like today, involving this arena. This movie is successful on several levels. Eastwood is his usual understated hero, wanting to save the president since the Kennedy era. He does well in this role, as does his foil, Reneee Russo (an FBI agent). General well done and suspense with extra stars for Malkovich. 9/10
