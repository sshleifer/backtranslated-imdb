How good is this movie? Apparently, good enough for them to plan to remake it in 2011. Jean-Pierre Melville, who gave us Le Doulos and The Good Thief, wrote and directed this film. <br /> <br /> The film is almost silent. These are men of few words, preferring to let their actions speak for them. They live from a code that governs all their movements. <br /> <br /> There are some great actors in this film - Alain Delon (The Leopard), Yves Montand (Jean de Florette, Vamos Hacer Amor) and Gian Maria. Volonte (El Indio for a handful of dollars and a few dollars more). The film does not shine on them; they are together for the ride that Melville has for them. Melville makes the film; They do it better. <br /> <br /> You see Melville's work in the Ocean movies, but they simply understand. The can not make it work as it did. A great loss in the seventies, but his work remains for our pleasure.
