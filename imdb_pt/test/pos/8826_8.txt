Every time the supposed explorers and we the public are ready to give the first glimpses into one of the new and wonderful worlds, for some ungodly reason, the filmmakers decided to be distracted by an "emergency" or some false alarm or a little artificial drama. thriller. So instead of quietly enjoying the surface of Io, or standing on the rings of Saturn or focusing on the magic of flying by a comet or an asteroid, we are distracted in concern for the good and survival of the characters.

Yes, the risks of such a mission are an important part of the subject - since it is essentially a film about a space mission, not just about the solar system. But it was exaggerated and heavily distracted from the discovery of new worlds we should be enjoying. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the film was notable in giving a very realistic feel to the human elements of a space mission, disputes, tensions, weight of responsibility, near-fatal errors, sacrifices, etc. .
