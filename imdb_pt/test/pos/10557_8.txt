My father The hero used to be my favorite movie when I was young. It's about Andre, a divorced Frenchman who wants to take his beautiful daughter (katharine heigl) on holiday, hoping to stay a little closer to her, but of course Nicole is not so easy to get along with, she just started. I'm guessing she's angry and hurt because her father was never present to her and decides to give her a hard time. One day at the beach, Nicole meets the handsome Ben, and she invents a crazy story about her and her father , the whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a fun hilarious and fun movie, I would give to My Father the Hero 8/10
