Bon Voyage is fun for the audience because it combines the necessary nonsense of a comedy with sobriety enough to keep viewers actively involved and invested in the outcome. More importantly, the film is also historically instructive; captures the tension of the so-called "false war" and, later, the escape of the French aristocracy of Paris before the German attack. However, Bon Voyage is not a "war movie". It's a comedy about the lives of a handful of people in a scenario of extraordinary times. Bon Voyage conveys the chaos, confusion and emotional bewilderment of a nation on the verge of collapse and the broad spectrum of French reactions to the new political order. This movie is a comedy that entertains the public, a novel that cleverly uses many clich√©s, and a story of a handful of people whose nation is crumbling around them.
