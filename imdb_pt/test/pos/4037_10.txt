Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I've ever seen: far better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her quest, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong and loving woman throughout the film. Kay is the poisoner of the forces of darkness: temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY one, for the love of my life, for the right of Mister. Patience is one of the keywords in this movie. I cry every time I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay. And I wish this were over soon ... Snowqueen says that despite my life, I deeply identify with the story and the characters. Thanks at least for Hans Christian Anderson and the director.
