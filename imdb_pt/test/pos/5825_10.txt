Oz is the TV show which is an intense adrenaline nonstop. It's a show that is not meant for a large audience, but a specific one as their themes are very adult oriented. Obviously, it did not reach the mainstream success, since that was an impossibility, but it had a lot of fame with its public and many famous actors or they starred or they became part of the program. <br /> <br /> Oz is a fictional series of prison-based stories located somewhere in New York State. There are many different ethnic groups that play a somewhat equal role in being represented. These groups are Muslims, Homeboys, Aryans, Motorcyclists, Italians, Latinos, Irish, Christians, Gays and others. Some have some form of affiliation with one another, such as motorcyclists and Arians, while Arians are enemies of numerous groups, such as Muslims and Homeboys. <br /> <br /> In Oswald Penitentary (its official name) there is a policy that does not allow many members of any ethnic group. It is the maximum security prison and the regular prison where sometimes the prisoners are sent to or from the program are called "general population" or "pop gene". The main character of the show is Augustus Hill, which also tells the story before and after the main segments, crossed between a documentary type and a biographical. Hill is connected to the use of wheelchairs as a consequence of his unknown past. He is part of the "others" group, which features individuals who do not fit into other prison gangs. <br /> <br /> Of the many groups, they are the smallest ones that manage to be avoided by problems. of times as the greatest are engaged in conflict with one another. A few of the most notable characters are as follows: 1) Ryan O'Reilly is in charge of his Irish counterparts and somehow always willingly engages in lethal activities for the weakest link. 2) Miguel Alvarez is the Latin-assisted who has constant struggles to deal with his popularity within his own gang and with others. 3) Simon Adebesi is the Nigerian who was the former leader of the Homeboys gang. He is also very physically large and solid. These two reasons are because he is one of the most powerful inmates within Oz. 4) Karim Said is the black and Muslim nationalist who is very defined in his opinions and desires. He fights for the rights of his people at many levels through the program, from his own Muslim group, to his broader black group and even fighting for all groups against unjust rules of authority. He appears somewhat similar to Malcolm X, the famous black rights fighter who was also a Muslim. <br /> <br /> All in all, because of its genre Oz is possibly the largest (fictional jail show or show based on ethnic relations). If this does not sound as if your own kind of series probably should not be tried, but if it matters, then definitely worth seeing. The biggest problem with the show is how addictive it is, some may feel bad seeing this kind of stuff a lot. Researchers argue whether it is harmful or not, but in the end it is only a reflection of the society of the world in which we live today. That means that it is as an informant and a gauge of the world than an aggressor.
