It's not hard to imagine what the main problem is for a screenwriter who wants to have 18 equally well-written characters with about the same amount of screen time in a movie that lasts about 90 minutes. It's almost impossible not to resort to stereotypes, and that's what writer-director Ralf Westhoff does here, too. Very few of the characters can be recognized as people you and I know in real life, many of them are only characterized with two or three attributes and remain vague. I'm aware of this, but I still think "Shoppen" is successful, that is, it does exactly what it wants. It's a film with very well written dialogues, extremely good acting and a movie that made me laugh a lot too often. I do not think this movie wants to do a deep analysis of loneliness in our modern society, or that it wants to be a moral comment on speed dating. It's a movie about something that exists and people and their motivation to use it. Funny and fun.
