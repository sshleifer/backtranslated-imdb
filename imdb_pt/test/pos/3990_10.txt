First, I loved this movie. As a fan of Billy Crystal, I must say I was expecting more comedic situations than I actually have. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His interpretation of the talent agent Sammy was brilliantly executed and uniquely his. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was outstanding in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on the spot, he has his world turned upside down. He never expected him to accidentally find the only person who could change his life. Sammy and Max's journey is unique and moving, and even humorous at times. In addition, the location in the Czech Republic, where parts of the film were filmed, was absolutely beautiful. I have to say, this dramatic comedy made me feel a variety of emotions. I thought it was great and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
