Someone definitely got into The Wind and I can not believe what I saw on screen has a lot to do with it. This is a better and more solid movie than most independents I watch all year. Cinematography shows a genuine love and mastery of the craft and the cast was great. I would love to see more of these people, especially Zeke Rippy. <br /> <br /> As far as the story and script are concerned, I'm not so sure that the negative comments that preceded this post were written with the intention of informing anyone else about the film. The long, sharply demanding pick posts that must have taken hours to compose and are the only comments left for any movie on this site by the critic are obvious slanders directed at the film's producers. I do not know the story from the inside, but it would probably be a good movie. What I know to be around this business, is, productions that try to make everyone happy usually end up being terrible and when the filmmaker has the courage, will and common sense to "kill the babies", someone always ends up with hurt feelings. This is part of biz as well, and one of the best learning tools available to those truly dedicated to doing so in the movie business. Of course, failures have nothing better to do than sit at home and write fake assessments on the internet as a form of vendetta against those who despise them (read: they were sincere and sincere with them). And that's my best guess to explain the unpleasant and unpleasant comments. To the extent that there is a grain of truth behind it all, there is a point to be made, but these exaggerations of the grain are so exaggerated that they become obviously fictitious. <br /> <br /> It's not a slasher. bloodbath, if that's what you're looking for, it's more the psychological thriller thriller, which is usually not appreciated by the lower common denominators out there. Seriously, the characters are defined by their actions and words and when you see what these people do and what they do I do not think you can come out with the conclusion that these characters have been poorly developed. Maybe misunderstood. <br /> <br /> Overall, I agree that this is an attractive and well-done film. Maybe I had not given a 9 under normal circumstances, but the harsh negative comments really attracted me to the picture (I have a secret love of bad cinema). For me, ratings below 5 should be reserved for strident, inept, misinterpreted, and stupidly written movies. None of this applies here - it's making quality movies with some real talent there. I gave him the nine to tilt the scales back in the right direction. Watch the movie and tell me I'm wrong.
