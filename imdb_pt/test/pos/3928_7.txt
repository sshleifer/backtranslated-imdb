I do not think this movie deserves the low rating that most will give. It's one of the best "teen" horror movies I've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to support it, the characters and the plot break numerous stereotypes of horror films, and this has nothing to do with some other horrible pieces that have been submitted lately. (A clear example is the mindless Saint Ange.) The first 30-40 minutes can be downright annoying, except for the beginning, although a few slight mistakes can be easily noticed. Upon arrival in the village, however, horror - a different and distorted type of horror - begins. With plot and details, the nonsense is minor; the characters are the strongest point of the film, given that so many clich√©s are broken in it. For example, the two main male characters, Nick and Wade, are by no means the idiot types we are accustomed to; although Dalton may fit this stereotype better, he is not alone in paying for this lack of awareness. Some scenes are truly, satisfyingly horrible, compensating for tense moments scattered throughout the film. And in the end, and while it's all befittingly explained, it's easy to see that things will not be so easy for the surviving characters. The only mistakes I can see that do not imply continuity (ie, Carly does not find her own finger cut into Bo's unconscious pockets) is the illumination, which is somehow annoying during the first 30 minutes. Although, plotting and effects-wise, everything is drastically and cruelly distorted with the arrival of the main characters for Ambrosia, that little village in the middle of nowhere, so I'll give it to you. It has been practically argued that about 70% of the film is illogical; "How can two people build a whole house of wax?" "Where do they get all the wax?" These would not be issues raised if people had paid more attention to the film. The Sinclair brothers did not build the House of Wax; his mother worked making wax figures, and they were exhibited in the museum. And the scenario in which the unfortunate character of Paris Hilton finds her premature death is the answer to the second question; What about all the personal objects (cell phones, cars, clothes) of the dead people? Using his third brother as a connection to the outside, it is quite debatable that the Sinclair twins should get the money needed to buy the wax, in a World War II type way. <br /> <br /> So aside, I think the film deserves a lot more than it earns, and no one should miss the chance to watch it. Then go and see the Wax House. Right now.
