Evocatively directed and slickly photographed psychological mystery thriller with outstanding leadership performance by a somber Donald Sutherland and powerful supporting roles of Donald Pleasence and David Hemming. The material decides to keep it all sad and goes from the investigation period to the victim's past. The rare and grim nature of the investigation pulled me in, but when the flashback to the victim's side showed that his last days were not so convincing, and they became rather boring and action-like. Although the script is highly detailed and somewhat complex in tying us, however, the final and surprising revelation should have been more astounding and not helped by its sloppy execution. Howard Blake's soundtrack has an emotional twist on his tracks that simply endure, and director Claude Chabrol's (for the most part) directing ability has a strong, rigid stylistic style that takes the best advantage of moody locations and flexible casting. The young faces Lisa Langlois and Aude Landry do an incredibly good job as well.
