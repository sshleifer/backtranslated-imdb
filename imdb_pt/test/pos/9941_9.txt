"Opera" is one of the greatest achievements in the horror genre. This masterful image has everything that should be in the pure horror film: good, captivating story, many symbols, wonderful visuals and lots of blood. The deaths are very shocking and bloody. An unforgettable atmosphere of fear and fear. A must-see for a true Argento fan, so if you have a chance to watch it.
