This epic brings together a superbly talented cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to life that I find difficult to explain. Diving into Die Zweite Heimat is to me similar to a spiritual experience, similar to the admiration one has when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. Language and the use of monochrome and color segments increase dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the sites, including Edgar Reitz's office. From then on, I promised to improve my German skills - after Die Zweite Heimat I feel almost German, as if I were in the head of the characters. I also try to match the piano of Henry Arnold (Hermann), but that's the only thing that always deceives me! This drama is unparalleled and I am fortunate to see it on BBC2 in the UK and on SBS in Australia. The sequel, Heimat 3, is currently being filmed in Germany.
