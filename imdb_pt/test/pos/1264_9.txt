I saw this at the Hong Kong International Film Festival more than three years ago. I entered with no expectations since Christopher Nolan was an unnamed at the time, but it seemed interesting and turned out to be one of the best things I saw at that festival. It worked well on the big screen, with the technique of cutting scenes out of sequence, increasing mood. Mr.Nolan gave a good account of his creation in the end, enough to leave anyone out as a filmmaker! I liked it more than Memento, although that was perhaps due to low expectations. And the fact that it was more of an art film.
