I stumbled into this movie as it launched channels on the teevee late at night. It continued to hold my interest about twenty years later, because of the important lesson of real life that teaches us about the dark side of human nature. And despite telling a true story that occurs in World War II, it's incredibly about the ugly things happening in Europe today. <br /> <br /> If you thought of ethnic cleansing as it is called today, it has something to do with race or ethnicity, you will think differently after seeing this story. <br /> <br /> I think I was naive to think that evil follows any prescribed set of rules. Evil is how evil does. <br /> <br /> This movie teaches a valuable lesson, and I especially recommend it for, for example. religious groups or civil rights organizations. <br /> <br /> I do not expect it to be easy to find and rent, but I would very much like to see it again because there is an incredible scene in which it gives a totally unintended but interesting glimpse of the banal complexities of the " racial proficiency ". In this scene, the protagonist, who was arrested by the Nazis at the beginning of the war, is "discovered" by a SS racial authority and led to a room. There they play a sort of guessing game, where the SS officer is able to determine where our hero (Anthony Quinn's character) came from - and where his ancestors came from. Well "come and find out" that Quinn's character is not a member of an "inferior" race, after all, but on the contrary, he is a perfect Archetypal Aryan! Which does not mean much to the character of Quinn, who is more interested in talking about the cities, rivers and mountains that the SS had just named ... However, being a perfect Aryan archetype has its advantages. Among other things, he manages to leave his job at a slave factory, where he uses striped rags, and in a slave modeling job, where he begins to wear tailored Nazi uniforms. Yes, it's a better show for a guy who always likes to wear nice clothes ... until the Allied armies arrive, and recognize his face from magazine covers. <br /> <br />
