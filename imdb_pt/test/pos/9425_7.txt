This is a great movie late at night! What I mean by that is that I really enjoyed playing my $ 3.00 VHS copy (now I have a DVD for $ 6.99!) Many nights before bed or if I have insomnia. There is just something about this movie that makes watching fun in repeated visions. It may be the fun that Basil Rathbone has in "The Secret Weapon" in various guises that fool villains and Holmes' assistant Nigel Bruce (Watson) but not the housekeeper (Mary Gordon). It could be espionage, code cracking and the theme of World War II. It may even be the light touch the director uses to deal with the threatening situations Holmes encounters while keeping the story moving. Whatever it is, "Secret Weapon" is simply a fun and enjoyable detective story that takes us back to a time when the Nazis were seeking world domination and do so with the bonus of the camaraderie between Watson and Holmes. Whether you agree with the patriotic speeches and no-holds-barred themes of "Save the World" of this movie or not (I think they're right!), I think they just add to the taste and fun of this old adventure movie that holds. for repeated views. I rate a nice 83/100 points.
