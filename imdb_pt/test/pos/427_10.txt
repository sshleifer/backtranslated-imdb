I only saw three episodes of Hack, starring David Morse, and it looks like I missed 37 episodes! Well, that's if ITV 3 shows them in chronological order. I just watched 'Misty Blue' (episode 38). I really enjoyed the 3 episodes, but I'm a fan of David Morse (especially in St. Elsewhere). For anyone reading this, Hack is great. Too bad it's aired on ITV 3. The cast is strong, though I can not get used to David's idea of ​​playing a crooked cop, yet we all know he's the wrong guy accused. I see Gary Cole as a guest star, what happened to 'Midnight Caller'? Just know if Hack is available on DVD (yet). Loving it. Cheers.
