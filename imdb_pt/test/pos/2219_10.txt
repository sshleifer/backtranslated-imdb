This film explores whether or not it creates a new genre with perfect imperfection - hilarity, truth, fun, talent, and circumstance that make for MAGIC. <br /> <br /> From the creative musical numbers to the improvised comedy that incorporates actors at their best, if I had not known better, I would have thought that there was an elaborate script here. <br /> <What You Gain: A mighty wind finds conversations with God and finds something so new, delightful and delightful that it becomes its own entity. <br /> <br /> The peters and the two give stellar performances and let him in immediately. the rest of the cast is also phenomenal. there are no small parts ... only small actors, and everyone involved here should pat on the back, be taken to dinner and be considered for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Well done!
