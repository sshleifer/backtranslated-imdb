The Four Seasons Merchant is a film about the lack of love. The movie begins with the main character; Hans Epp, returning from a spell in the foreign legion. He returns to his mother, not to be told how much she loves him, or how much she misses him; but to be informed that he is useless and, worse yet, that she preferred that the man with whom he was to return. It is the relationship of the character with the women that makes this movie so hateful; the fact that his wife is taller than him is symbolic of his relationship to the other gender; he is consistently humiliated by them, and it is through their dealings with them that his life is not as great as it could have been. This is also shown clearly by the way he treats his wife after a drink. He lost his job as a policeman through the lust of a woman and even his wife; a woman who should love him, never shows any affection for him. Even in the end, his wife is more concerned about what she and her daughter will do than with the state of her husband. <br /> <br /> The Merchant of the Four Seasons is a completely unpleasant movie. There is not a scene in the movie where someone is happy, and not just that; but the film seems deliriously happy to delve into the misery of its central characters. The film certainly is not recommended for anyone who is experiencing difficulties, for sure. Despite all the misery, the film never goes beyond the limits of reality; All the events in this film can - and very likely have - happened to make the film more shocking. The film is, of course, directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; the German cult director who committed suicide in 1982. This is just my second taste of man's work, but through only two films, it's easy to get an idea of ​​the kind of art he creates. Both films are oppressed and brave - even if they are realistic pieces of art. His characterization in this film is subtle; we only know the characters through their difficulties and not through their character. This is a very clever way of showing the public that it is the environment that defines the people in the movie, not the people themselves - and as almost everyone who sees the film knows what it's like to live in an urban society, people to relate to. The Merchant of the Four Seasons is not a movie that is easily forgettable; the film has a lot of substance and little style, and this creates a very memorable image, and that everyone who considers himself a movie fan should try. It is with this in mind that I give this film my highest recommendations; is not sweet and is not pleasant, but you will not see a more realistic portrait of depression, and this is certainly a movie that will stay with you.
