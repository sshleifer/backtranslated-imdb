Strange enough, shorts like this get a 10. Why? They are hilarious. That's hilarious. Notice the peculiar humor very much. Dated and childish for the pessimists, but they do not know what they're talking about. They learned that cartoons are not just for kids. The art in this is probably the best non-Road Runner art of the 1950s Looney Tunes. It's hard to find anything better than the art of "The Great Piggy Bank Robbery," though nothing ever does. This probably runs a 3rd or 2nd close. Shorts like this may have spawned countless scams like Tiny Toons Adventures to try to extort the old comedy over and over again, as great movies like the Scream spawned garbage like the I Know ... which was released just to squeeze all over the old horror of Scream, but like Scream, that's great alone. Chuck Jones has had his faults with shorts from time to time, but he makes up with them. Take Hopper for example. Few people like Hopper, but this has never ruined LT's reputation, but I'm sure that was his makeup on things as such. In short: This is not as good as "Duck! Rabbit! Duck!", But close. Get it on the Cartoon Network frequently.
