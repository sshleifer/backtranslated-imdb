While "The Chacal" has a better aesthetic [and a boat budget], this film preaches the real persona of "Carlos" ... Quinn is great when the Navy officer enlisted to imitate Jackal Wiley to get him out of hiding, and in the hands of Kingsley and Sutherland, he turns inside out to do so. Risking his family, his career and everything he believes, he takes on the task, albeit totally unwillingly. <br /> <br /> Saying more about the ruin ... this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 Niro ~ Stars [of 4]
