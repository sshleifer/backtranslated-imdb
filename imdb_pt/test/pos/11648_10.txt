Having read most of the reviews, I feel I have a word to say as well. <br /> <br /> What bothers me most is that most people here think that this movie is for or against the subject of death. penalty and worked with them. I remember reading an article in 1995, when the film was published (yes, I was interested a lot since I heard that I would not have forgotten the articles I read at that time), in which Tim Robbins said: that he did not want to do a film to convince the public of either one or the other. <br /> <br /> And I think you're quite right. I have to admit that I believe in the way he did this movie he tended a little to the side of the anti-death penalty, but even then people still can make their own choice. And that's very rare in American movies. <br /> <br /> I've shown this movie to many people since I left and I've seen all sorts of reactions. Death penalty advocates have become opponents or have become even stronger in their belief. And many opponents of the death penalty (including me) were stronger in their belief that the death penalty should be abolished everywhere in the world. But I even saw opponents become supporters. That and the fact that the people here seem to struggle about it shows me that there are many ways to look at them. So, whatever effect it has on you, the important thing is that it makes you think. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films that really gives you the choice, that does not run away with a simple path making you condemned or bad or innocent. This can be a difficult thing for people who prefer to have fun or learn a lesson. There is no lesson here you need to find one yourself. <br /> <br /> Everyone compliments the acting, direction and music, but since this has been said so many times I will not repeat it all over again. <BR> So, if you have not seen it yet, do it - if you dare to be challenged!
