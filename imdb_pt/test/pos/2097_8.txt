Lord of evil war puts a city through pain and suffering. Not long before, they ask for help to the giant stone Samurai, Daimaijin. Daimaijin soon arrives and really picks up the warlord with all his powers of mercy. The climax of revenge is really funny, as Daimajin crushes the guys under his feet and crushes the guys with his fist and even speeds a man's heart.
