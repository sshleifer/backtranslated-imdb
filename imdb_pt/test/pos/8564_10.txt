I gave it a 10 because it is the best film of the genre ... a good old T & A movie in the shadow and spirit of "Animal House". I saw this with a similar movie called "Swap Meet" and both were good of their kind ... a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Let's be honest ... there are more breasts in this movie than you can imagine for a pornographic movie. From beginning to end, they seem to continue appearing on the screen (scenes of sunbathing, bedroom scenes and of course the climax soccer game). In addition, a memorable kissing booth (Kiss Me, Clutz!) Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves in their roles (various Playboys, Danny Bonaduce, various family TV and movie actors, etc.). The only complaint I have to register is that Lisa London's character is called by the surname "O'Hara" and is not a good name from the 1970s like "Olivia" (or even Ora or Ona or O ... ?? !!). I saw this again in the late 80's with my now ex-wife (very well endowed) and she could not believe I was really enjoying the movie !! She was probably jealous !! Again, this movie is a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon ... just do not think too much!
