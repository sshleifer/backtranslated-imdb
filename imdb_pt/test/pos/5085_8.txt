Some people think this was a pretty bad TV series with cheesy effects. (considering it was filmed between 1977-1979), but really look at those years and think, "We did not have computers at that time." So, if you think about it, it's a good TV series. <br /> <br /> I always thought the bad ratings killed the show, but no. the network did. they canceled their theme as "The Network of Superheroes" and abandoned a short series of Spider-Man. if it had happened, it would probably have gone well in the 80s, and if it was really lucky (and I mean really lucky) in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> And no one wanted to choose this series. Anyway, Jolly old (or young) Nicholas Hammond, from The sound of music fame, is brought to the TV screen as peter parker, the secret identity of the incredible spiderman. Throughout the series, Peter handles a clone, a beautiful girl from a foreign country and a corrupt politician. <br /> <br /> While the series is out of the timeline (Peter having graduated from university, and that's when he's bitten, and Uncle Ben is already dead.) The audience is treated with the action, the suspense and the attitude that the characters have towards Peter and his alter-ego, the Spider-Man. <br /> <br /> It's also a bit disappointing that Robert. F Simon does not look anything like JJJameson, it's not so disappointing that Betty's purse is not from Betty, but an African-American girl (who reminds me of Halle Berry, who is one of the hottest women on the planet). one was not so bad. <br /> <br /> But considering the time, and how much drama they've done, it's kind of predicting what bad TV is today. Anyway, it's fun, even for today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
