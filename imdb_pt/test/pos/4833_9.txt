This movie is frighteningly difficult to describe. Although accurate enough in his account of the events leading up to the subsequent investigation into the first attempt to destroy the World Trade Center in 1993, seen now after 9/11, it is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> It would be a mistake to call this film prophetic, but it certainly makes the common wisdom of the playground "deceive me once, embarrass you, deceive me twice, embarrass me," live. <br /> <br /> Our government learned Nothing, since the 1993 attempt against the World Trade Center and subsequent readings of the 9/11 Report, shows that many of the mistakes that led to the bombing in 1993 were repeated. Some people have criticized the First and Fourth Amendments of the US Constitution as being partly responsible for the Islamic terrorists being able to carry out their evil plans but this is wrong in every way possible. <br /> <br /> Surely the people who are making this argument are not supporting the ban on freedom of speech, freedom of the press or freedom of religion? I certainly hope they are not supporting our government officials to be able to invade the home or office of anyone to search without cause or without a warrant. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the FBI, the INS and even the local police could have obtained warrants based on the information they had, but they chose not for several reasons. Moreover, no matter how unpleasant or ignorant it is, it is not illegal to speak ill of the United States or its leaders. Likewise, it is not unlawful to possess weapons or to pray toward Mecca. Consider this, until Lee Harvey Oswald fired his rifle at President John Kennedy, he was not actually breaking any law. Living in a free society has its disadvantages. <br /> <br /> Still, Path To Paradise is a must-see movie that I'm afraid of never being seen by so many people. As far as I know, it's not on DVD and 2007 is its tenth anniversary and there are no known revivals. <br /> <br /> I'm not really surprised, people do not like to document their failures. and this film certainly shows that the various agencies that should protect us did not do their job right and for the most insignificant reasons, such as jurisdictional disputes and a refusal to share information. <br /> <br /> This is a shame as Path To Paradise is well done and exciting and as many have said before, the final scene where Ramzi Yousef (played by Art Malik), the bomber who built the truck bomb that was used in the first attempt to destroy the two towers is flying after the World Trade Center, after his capture and extradition, simply says "Next time, let's take them down," is a cinematic moment that froze me for several minutes.
