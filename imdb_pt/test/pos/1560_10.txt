This is probably the best picture that many will not see. It presented a culture in a real non-literalized way. A must see for everyone who likes Indie and for those who do not. I think this movie will attract more Indie scene. The performance was top notch! Alice's character was portrayed so well. With perfect strangeness. This movie should be brought to the mainstream! I think this would be phenomenal! ALICE is the most real aspect of an element of our culture that I have seen since GO ASK ALICE. A look that is not touched by Hollywood's hand. Movies like this show young people that these things are not fascinating, but they are real and attractive. If you liked PIECES OF APRIL you will love this!
