A great performance from Clint Eastwood and particularly John Malkovich, in my opinion, the best of them all. Malkovich had this nailed down to the ground is amazing. Eastwood is Agent Mike Horrigan, an elderly and cynical Secret Service agent who is ending his career by destroying forgers and pursuing routine tasks. But a task that seems to be executed at the plant at first becomes complicated and deadly serious. Horrigan and his new partner Al are sent to investigate a threat to the president by a "crazy". As fate would have it, Horrigan stumbled not in a delirious sow, but in a professional lone wolf who has a big bone to choose from with the White House. As Horrigan delves deeper into the world of "Booth," it draws the bandit's unwanted attention and unbridled admiration for him. Horrigan was the main agent of JFK and present in Dallas, Texas, when he was assassinated and he blames himself for what happened. Now he feels it's up to him to stop the current Head of State from joining the list of dead presidents. But this killer turned the table on Horrigan and now he's the one hunted in a cat-and-mouse game of life and death. Who will win? Who's going to die? It's a race against time to save the Pres from a chameleon-like enemy that can reach anyone. My favorite Secret Service movie and as good as any.
