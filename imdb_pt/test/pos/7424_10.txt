I used to enjoy "Happy Ever After", but I was absolutely mesmerized by "Terry & June". With Aunt Lucy gone, the emphasis seemed to fall on the relationship between Terry and June, a middle-aged and middle-aged English couple, and I really enjoyed it, losing myself very happily in each episode. <br /> <br /> The '80s were the era of alternative comedy, but they were also the decade of choice - and Terry and June certainly fit the more traditional tastes. And mine - and I was a big fan of "The Young Ones" too! Each week, Terry gets into a silly situation and June is pulled into herself and usually ends up having to abandon him. As the shows sounded like today - it was a different world, but it's really fun to watch the 1980s trends - like the 1982 CB radio story (CB radio was legalized in England in November 1981), which saw Terry stuck his car on the back of a truck! I've been watching the shows again recently on DVD, and I still think they're great! Not loved by the enlightened elite - the chattering classes, but a huge success with the masses! Wonderful!
