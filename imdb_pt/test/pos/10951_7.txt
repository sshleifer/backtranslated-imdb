A vampire prince falls in love with a human girl, unaware that his brother is a famous vampire hunter. This is the underlying theme of this martial arts game that lends ideas to "Underworld" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", but manages to maintain its own style. I was confused by the UK and Hong Kong title "The Twins Effect" as there are no twins involved in the story. It turns out that the two main female characters are played by Hong Kong pop stars who act as "The Twins". Do not let this discourage you. These girls can act (at least enough for this type of movie) and add a lot of charm to the process. Jackie Chan appears in a couple of appearances, adding a pinch of her own slapstick mark on the process. In short, this is a lot of fun for those who like their vampires served with playful humor.
