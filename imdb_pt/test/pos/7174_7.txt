On June 22, 1941, the city of Przemysl, in Poland, is divided between German and Russian. When the German invades the city, the Nazis send the Jews to a ghetto. The young Catholic Fusia Podgorska (Kellie Martin), alone with her younger sister, lodges and hides many Jews in the attic of her house for two and a half years until the end of the war. "Hidden in Silence" is another good story of human sympathy in World War II. This movie looks like "Rescuers: Stories of Courage", and is also based on a true story. Unfortunately, actress Kellie Martin has a strong and powerful character, but she's too weak for such a role. In many dramatic situations, the expression on her face is not convincing. I've noticed that many IMDb users liked their performance, but I'm not sure if they like their wonderful character or their actual performance. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Hidden in Fear" ("Hidden in Fear")
