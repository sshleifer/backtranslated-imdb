I have been a dedicated visitor to IMDB for a few years. This is the movie that finally forced me to write in a review. <br /> <br /> I caught this movie by chance (the opening credits were rolling when I turned on my TV one morning). I liked the film for many reasons, all of which were well covered by other critics - the moodiness, the forgotten history of the Czech pilots, the subtle charm of the supporting characters, the fatalism of the main characters and the first. person seen during the battle scenes. <br /> <br /> But the element of "Dark Blue World" that really stood out was the lack of dramatic effects, especially during combat (and that's a good thing!). While the pilots flew in battle, no musical score accompanied them, no manipulative shot of worried spouses / girlfriends was intertwined, every small air maneuver did not elicit patriotic applause, and viewers were not invited to swallow unbelievable James Bond heroes. . Instead, the audience may feel the melancholy, fear, and isolation of these pilot fighters as they try to stay in the air during combat. As the comrades are slaughtered, we are spared crying howls and typical heroism based on revenge (but pleases the public). Instead, the other pilots sadly and silently watch their mate's fate - in fact, they still need to remain intensely focused on their own safety and goals at that very moment. We only briefly experienced the pilot's breathing and the roar of the engines as we, the audience, witnessed a spiral of friend in silence until his death. And then, immediately, "we need to" go back into combat mode and focus on survival. Too often in Hollywood we are fed with the emotions we must feel and there is no room for it. the imagination of the beholder. "Dark Blue World" maintains a shortage that captivates and envelops the viewer, allowing us to invest in the film and fill in the gaps and spaces using our own thoughts and feelings. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie, worth seeing.
