One of MGM's long-standing classics emerged in the final years of World War II, it's the movie that made young Elizabeth Taylor a star. She had made some films as a child actress before National Velvet, but when she left, her place in the movies was guaranteed. Ironically, biologically, she would be growing fast enough after National Velvet came out and her next fight as an actress was to get substantial adult roles because the casting directors only saw her as the innocent Velvet Brown, who loved her horse jumping. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how that would work because horses with obstacles need to have confirmed bloodlines and Pi's are a subject that is not dealt with in National Velvet. All we know is that he is a reckless and untrainable horse in the hands of Reginald Owen and after he has broken loose and causes considerable damage, Owen gets rid of him for a nominal price for local butcher Donald Crisp. At the same time as these things happen, Mickey Rooney enters the life of the Brown family consisting of Crisp, wife Anne Revere and daughters Angela Lansbury, Juanita Quigley and Elizabeth Taylor and their younger brother , Butch Jenkins. Rooney is a former jockey who is now on the road and heads for the Brown family, where his father was once a horse trainer for Anne Revere's family. It is he who sees the potential of Pi (short for a pirate) as a jumper and it is Elizabeth who convinces Crisp not to miss this chance. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Taylor was so sweet and innocent in the National Velvet. The Good Book says you have to have faith as a child and she has to spare. She infuses Rooney with this, to have faith in the heart and ability of Pi and leave a little more to herself. <br /> <br /> Anne Revere won a Best Supporting Actress Award for National Velvet. She is a very wise mother who has hidden depths for her that the public does not suspect. It turns out that in her youth she had a taste of fame and glory swimming in the English Channel and her prize money, spared all these years, she gives to her daughter. This scene is probably what earned him the Oscar. National Velvet also won another Academy Award for Film Editing. <br /> <br /> More than 60 years after making its debut, the National Velvet, as a family classic, lost nothing. His description of life among the world wars in Britain is still a highlight. And the National Velvet released a movie legend. You can not do much better than that for high consideration.
