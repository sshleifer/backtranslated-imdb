I have just finished this amazingly insane case, and although I can not say how good it was as I had said it was in my mind, it was still an effective and at the moment quite unpleasant piece of brain and misogyny was feeding the garbage. His story tells of a poor girl in search of her sister, who ends up being raped and drugged by yakuza crooks, and the helpful medical doctor who decides to avenge her, doing it bizarrely horrible after a rape and drugging similar. Oh yeah, and there's a bit of straightforward sex there too, unfortunately it's all soft, according to Japanese disapproval below the nudity of the belt, but the pixelation is minimal, in fact, barely noticeable in a hilarious oral sex scene. Although writer / director Kazuo "Gaira" Komizu fails to create a particularly compelling tale, this is at least a very sweet thing, plunging early into the filth pit with a rather unsettling rape (made worse by the fact that the girl looks a bit young, though I made sure she was of age). Also, most of the time this is very professional, may not be stylish, but has a certain talent and content is treated reasonably well, with particular praise for avoiding having to use a lot of pixelation. Most of the time, things are based on sex / rape for about two-thirds of the time, and it's pretty watchable if you do, it gets a little numb after a while, but girls are easy to see and times are hard. The song, by YÃ´ichi Takahashi, is occasionally effective, though hardly a fundamental part of the program she does in some places complements the action perfectly, at least enough for me to realize it. More important are the effects, by Nobuaki Koga, that make an impressive impact when they appear, aided by the whimsical nature of the climax antics. Things even come to a curiously affected end, it's certainly not a weepy or anything, but for such a messy movie for most of its execution, it's relatively poignant. All in all, this is a lot of fun fun for spirited trash fans, especially those with a taste for Japanese rapey adventures. I really could have done with a longer and more bloody revenge section, also maybe more than a point / brain but, hey, kept me watching and is very well stocked with memorably wtf moments. So if you dig this kind of degenerate junk, it's probably worth it, maybe do not expect the second coming.
