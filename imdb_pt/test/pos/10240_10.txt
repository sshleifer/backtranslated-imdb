It's interesting to see what people think of this movie, since it is, in fact, quite unique (though it has some of the hallmarks of Clive Barker's writing). Even though it seems a bit cynical to say so, the movie is intricate enough to divert those who need the standard Hollywood hooks, and in layers, so if you expect to be fed, you'll see a normal monster movie with lots of monsters and a disjointed plot. <br /> <br /> Those who need a straightforward, specific and straightforward storyline will hate this movie because the story is, as in the novel, partially between the lines, or in this case, partially out of the screen, in the comments and in the imagination. <br /> <br /> Another possible disconnection is the end, which I can say without spoiling it, which is neither entirely good nor totally bad. In fact, it's not very definite, which I know sends some people into furious tantrums about that they failed to know what happened, but for me, and for many others, I'm sure, it just adds another dimension to the story - the dimension of speculation, and, furthermore, the point that the great rupture has a tendency to cause ripples that stretch far enough. <br /> <br /> There is definitely morals here, but in a very different way. type than the standard Hollywood-in-your-face-in-the-movie-type display type. In short, morality is simple, even if it is not that simple. prejudice and the human tendency to hate the different. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, although, as many reviewers have noted, the actors' expressions (with the exception of David Cronenberg, who makes a wonderful appearance) are quite corny. I'm not sure if they are totally blamed for their rickety appearance and lack of depth, though, seeing that these are common problems in converting literature to script. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a great movie as long as you do not expect it to be a standard horror movie.
