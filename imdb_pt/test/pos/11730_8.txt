This is how Burt Reynolds describes this movie, which is the best of them all. He plays Tom Sharky, a deputy detective who is on the trail of an international mobster (Vittorio Gassman) and the man he is funding to be the next governor of Georgia (Earl Holliman). In William Diehl's novel, the story is more complex because the guy is running for president. This is a very long movie that looks like more than three hours instead of two. Filming in downtown Atlanta and the Peachtree Plaza hotel set the mood for history. Reynolds does not laugh much in this movie compared to his comedy movies. He's very serious here, especially at the beginning of the movie, because he's downgraded by a wrong-doing drug mistake. At times, the film looks more like a voyeuristic drama than a criminal film with Burt trying to get close to the mafia's wife. Only at the end of the movie does violence escalate, which leads to the climax of the bang bang. As well as the great jazz score in DIRTY HARRY by Lalo Schifrin, Sharky's Machine features an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest artists including Chet Baker, Julie London, Flora Purim and Buddy De Franco, The Manhattan Transfer, Doc Severinson, Sarah Vaughan and Joe Williams. Al Capps deals with magic score. This movie has become one of the best crime dramas of all time. Check it out. <br /> <br /> Score, 8 out of 10 Stars
