Apolitical musicians Eva (Liv Ullmann) and Jan Rosenberg (Max von Sydow) have been married for seven years and live on a small farm on a remote island to escape a civil war on the mainland. They provide lingenberry for a couple of customers to raise some money and buy some supplies. They love each other and Eva is twenty years old and wants to have a baby, but the reluctant Jan, who is a weak and sensitive man, does not want to have children. When the rebels arrive on the island, their peaceful and peaceful lives turn into hell, and they stand amidst accusations from both sides. When Colonel Jacobi (Gunnar Bj√∂rnstrand) pursues Eva, Jan changes his behavior and becomes a brutal man, and the love and affection they feel for each other changes into hatred and indifference. <br /> <br /> "Shame" is a war against war. film of the master Ingmar Bergman focused by the eyes of a couple of apolitical artists who do not hear the news, but when the war comes to their land, they have their love, friendship and affection destroyed by the senseless soldiers. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow have top-notch performances as always, and I do not remember seeing Liv Ullmann's chest in any other film. The process of brutalizing the peaceful and sensitive Jan Rosenberg by war is impressive, and the open conclusion is pessimistic and suited to dramatic history. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Shame" ("Shame")
