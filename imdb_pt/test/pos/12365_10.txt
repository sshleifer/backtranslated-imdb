Körkarlen (1921), a classic film with cult status among silent films, directed by Victor Sjöstrøm, who also plays the leading male role, is based on a story by the Swedish novelist Selma Lagerlöf. The film tells the story of brutal drinker David Holm, who beat his wife, neglects his children, seduces his brother to drink and is blinded by the love of nurse Edit (Astrid Holm). David sits at the end of the year along with his drunken friends in the town park and tells the story of the Ghost Chariot (Körkarlen): Who dies on New Year's Eve as the last before dawn, has to serve a year as driver of death and release the agonizing souls from their bodies. But David gets into a fight with his friends, suffers a hemorrhage and sinks dead on the ground. Meanwhile, the Ghost Transport is approaching. The driver is no more than David's late friend, Georges, who seduced him for alcohol and died a year earlier. Since David refuses to enter the carriage, Georges forces him. Together, they head to the stations where people live who have suffered from David. They visit the nurse whose love for David he was unable to recognize and whom he infected with tuberculosis, so she is dying now. But your unconditional love for David will save your soul. Fulfilled with their spirit, they come to the wife and children of David. David is able to prevent his wife from killing herself and her children because she does not see a way out of the misery in which David has thrown her. They also visit David's brother, who committed a murder after being seduced to drink by David. David asks Georges to return to his body, because he finally sees that his way was wrong. Since it was Georges who seduced him once to drink, David's wish is granted, he gets a second chance, and Georges has to be one more year the driver of the Ghost Chariot to pay for his own sins. This film probably belongs to the strongest and most impressive films of all time. Deplorably, it is not yet available on international DVD.
