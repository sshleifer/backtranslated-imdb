I once commented on this great Chucky but I had to do it again to say a few things about the movie when I first saw it on a large porch in a large theater. The movie was very entertaining at the theater and my first Chucky movie at a theater, and this was a special moment for me because I appreciate Chucky. The other horror villains are referenced with GREAT COOLNESS !!! And the blood was unbelievably big! The scene where the gay boy gets caught in the truck was incredibly cheerful! This was a great scene gore !!!!! And the ending was so bizarre and shocking that it made me s *% @ my pants. The idea of ​​having Chucky's Seed was very, very bizarre and shocking! When I left the theater, I loved it and could not believe it was real. The bizarre and different qualities of this installment of the child's play for some reason made me mark it as the Jason Goes To Hell of the Child's Play series. It just had that intensely shocking, bizarre and different quality that reminded me of Jason Goes To Hell. A clear buzz out of *****. Here is how I classify the series: 1,4,2,3. I loved it, but not as much as Tom Holland's classic Child's Play original. I can not wait for Seed of Chucky! May come!
