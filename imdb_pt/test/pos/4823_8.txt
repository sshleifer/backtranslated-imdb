I honestly discovered that Wicked Little Things was a really cool and fun horror movie. My friend had given it to me, and I actually saw it as nothing more than a horrible horror movie of the low category. So, after I saw this, I was wrong. very cool and very good and while I say it seemed a bit unnecessary at times, and although it may not be the best horror movie ever, it's still good. I thought the acting was very good, especially the girl who plays the mother (she seemed very believable and to me very kind). And although it is a bit clich√©'ee on top of her well. In general, I have to say if the Afterdark Horror Fest movies are not your style, so you should not have any business watching this, but if you like horror movies, or a bit of malevolent time than checking out Wicked Little Things.
