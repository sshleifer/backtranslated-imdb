Nothing better than an android with 80's technology and a ripening storyline to pull your thoughts from the depths of your mind to the center, to be taken captive by a beautifully kind cast. Growing up in the 80s gave me the invaluable opportunity to see remnants of "not very human" on many special occasions. Considering the fact that my parents were never present during the sessions, I would say that I probably would not enjoy it as much as I did as a child. So maybe this is a movie to extract from your VHS collection and deliver it to your kids, it can be found on the same tape as "The Apple Balls gang" and a "duty shift" episode, that is, if you recorded LP Mode, of course.
