Most criticism of "Attack of Show" is from people who are unfairly comparing it to an old TV show called "The Screen Savers." People are upset because the G4 decided to cancel the "Screen Savers" and replace it with the "Attack of the Show" based on pop culture. Comparing the two shows is like comparing apples to oranges! <br /> <br /> "Show Attack" is an exclusive one-hour program that covers the current Generation X / Y culture. It features film / television segments, discussion boards, video games, new DVD releases, advice on sex, new gadgets (MP3 players, cell phones, etc.), comics / graphic novels, magazines and internet fashions. <br /> <br /> It's a fun show, it's definitely worth checking out that you're in your 20s or 30s. I give it 8 out of 10.
