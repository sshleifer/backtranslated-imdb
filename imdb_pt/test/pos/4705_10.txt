I had a chance to talk to co-creator Rebecca Cammisa at the 2002 High Falls Film Festival in Rochester, NY. She said her style is to be completely open and uninhibited in filmmaking, but she was very happy to be so severely limited in the tight quarters of the group house. The narrow corridors and small rooms were cleverly filmed with a realism that would have been lost with more controlled and deliberate camera work. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen herself is a remarkable character, coming from the tragedy in her own life to being an unusual combination of caring, resilient and intelligent street. The way the movie presents us with its past is great, spending only a few carefully selected minutes scattered everywhere. <br /> <br /> In all, I can not begin to praise this film properly. It really is a treasure trove of movies and the subject is a treasure trove of humanity.
