I love this movie! I know some people may say it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is the classic style of Mel Brooks and the actors have been superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood who cares about you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this kind of movie. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did a great job as Achoo. The characters were all very well planned and everyone added their own quirks to the film. I recommend you rent this movie and have fun with a good bowl of popcorn and some close friends!
