A 2006 online poll on Japan's 100 Best Animated TV Series, conducted by TV Asahi, put the series in fourth place. It says everything you need to know. So go and watch.) I will not comment on the story, simply because I do not want to ruin anything. I just recommend that you keep watching after seeing the first episode. The animation is very good and above average for the TV. The best thing about this series is that there is finally something new. I mean, it's not innovative, but it still offers a new idea and friendly characters. You will not regret entering the world of Suzumiya Haruhi. <br /> <br /> And the best thing a movie will come soon
