It could not have come at a worse time - just as the nation was entering the Reagan years in the 80s, time without regrets, without worries. He did not get word of mouth and it opened badly. The studio abandoned that. But Hair is arguably the best musical of all time - with Forman directing and choreographing Tharpe, it's a surprisingly beautiful, well-represented and well-written triumph that few people remember. The cast is perfect, the musical numbers unforgettable, and even the end of an ending does not detract from the indomitable spirit of the film. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, you have not seen the best musical of all time. Seriously.
