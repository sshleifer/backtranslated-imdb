slow but smart. Pass by you like you live. full of thought provoking race art ideas and being cool. The only thing that impressed me was the ideas about the rock 'n' roll lifestyle. <br /> <br /> All the performances were improvised, I'll say it again. ALL PERFORMANCES WERE IMPROVISED sounds like a gimmick, but that's not what makes these characters real and how someone you would be with. this is also an incredible thing when you think about how strong the character is in this movie. from the beginning following the title, he immediately establishes Ben as an outcast by the way he moves through the crowd <br /> <br /> Ok, it breaks down like that, if you are a person living the jazz lifestyle / rocker you will like it if your smart and understand the big cinema the total crap you will love and if its two then it may be you fav <br /> <br /> but if its none of them then you probably will think it's boring and say you do not go "one line" and write a review like Ben_Cheshire
