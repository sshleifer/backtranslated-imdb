Another nice Warner movie. I really liked John Garfield in that, although I'm wondering why Cagney was not on paper. Perhaps it was very similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it's another story of Dead End Kids too, but I really liked them and this movie had lots of comedic touches and a pretty serious drama. The boys work very well with Garfield. A good sequel was the entire "swimming" scene that begins with no care, but ends up getting close to the disaster. <br /> <br /> One negative comment: Claude Rains was grossly misled. Like the detective, the good actor seemed as out of place here as a nun in a brothel.
