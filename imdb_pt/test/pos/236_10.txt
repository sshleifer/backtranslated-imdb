This was Gene Kelly's breakthrough, and that just makes it memorable. Play Rita Hayworth as your love interest and comedian Phil Silvers of all people as your partner and you have the ingredients to please everyone, which is exactly what happened. Kelly plays Danny McGuire, a Brooklyn nightclub owner (Brooklyn is always the "wrong side of the charts" in the 1940s films) whose attraction and love interest is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth). Rita is adorable and even plays a double role as Rusty and Rusty's grandmother. Rusty has a chance at the big time through the machinations of John Coudair (Otto Kruger), who dated and lost Rusty's grandmother. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Danny cutting loose Rusty at the expense of his club because she has a chance for success that he can not give her. But of course, that's not what Rusty wants, because, as usual in the films of the time, the right guy is the only thing in the girl's mind. There are no surprises, but everyone does things well. <br /> <br /> Kelly does the first of her incredible tricks, this time with herself as a reflection of a glass window. He was the master of this type of dance, and yet one has to figure out how they timed everything so accurately that he seems to be in two places at once. The melodrama gets a bit heavy, and there are some free war references that do little but offer the opportunity for a song or two, but Kelly takes that movie to the next level. That was before he became a mega-star and very soft, perhaps for his own good. An underlying edge of cruelty to his character lends him a believable and almost melancholy air. Kelly's character in 1980's "Xanadu" was also called Danny McGuire. This movie was the beginning, that movie the end, of a great race for a dance genius. Clearly, this movie meant a lot to him. Highly recommended.
