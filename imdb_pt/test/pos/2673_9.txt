When the movie started, I thought cheesy. The first ten minutes were really annoying. After the slow start and some of the novel's antics, I began to like it. The plot was unlike anything I'd ever seen. Now, was it a horror? Not really. It should not have been classified as a horror or the producers should have invested more money into the film to make it scary. As it was, the creatures were only there for a short time. I can only assume that this was for money reason. <br /> <br /> The good thing was that the movie was a lot of fun. He kept my interest (after the beginning) and made me think about creatures from another dimension. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that this was the director's first film, but there were some highlights. In the end, I got hooked. Too bad Hollywood did not put any more money behind it.
