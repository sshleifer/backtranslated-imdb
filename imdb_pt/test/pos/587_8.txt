I really liked the movie MUPPET MOVIE. It was the first of the Muppet movies and it is by far the best because it is very creative and modern. With later films, the ideas did not seem so original. But here, we can see Kermit and Miss Piggy riding a bicycle (an incredibly difficult scene), a great cast and a lot of fun. I loved every minute the Muppets were performing and I would have rated the movie much louder, except for one serious problem. In this and most of the subsequent Muppets films, some powers felt the need to include many non-Muppets - in particular, many, many star appearances. Some worked well (like Charles Durning's), but many seemed irrelevant and slowed the image to a sudden stop. Probably the worst of them was with Edgar Bergan. Yes, he was an incredible man who inspired Jim Henson and the rest of his team, but the tiny scene he was in was not needed, nor were most of the apparitions. Still, despite this big complaint, it's a great movie for the whole family - from children to the most demanding adults.
