I've watched all versions of this game that I can think of, including several on stage, and Sir Derek Jacobi is absolutely the best Hamlet I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> He has the most wonderful voice for acting on stage, and his expressive face will take you to a roller coaster of emotions throughout this play. The way he delivers his speeches takes you on a journey through madness. He (like Hamlet) can in an instant be loving, gentle and gentle and at another time be furious against the hell that is his life. You believe that he is in pain, you believe he is angry, you believe he is not a little crazy. You believe he is Hamlet. <br /> <br /> Of course some of the thanks obviously go to Shakespeare, :) but without an excellent actor to take the words from the page to the stage, it does not really matter how well written a game is. <br /> <br /> If you like Shakespeare, you absolutely must see this version. If you do not like Shakespeare, you absolutely must see this version. You will leave with a new appreciation for Shakespeare if you do. Sir Derek's subtle performance will leave you breathless.
