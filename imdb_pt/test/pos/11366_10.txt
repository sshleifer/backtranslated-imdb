I followed the whole series when I was a child in elementary school, by choice, not because it was necessary for school. I used to read the pieces in the rhythm of the series. Experience has given me a lifelong love of Shakespeare and history. It even gave me a bit of an acting bug, though only on an amateur level. Whenever I read any piece of Shakespeare's story, the images that come to mind first are this black and white production, seen on a large "furniture" television with a rabbit ear antenna, with all the "ghosts" and Although the sets were minimal, if I remember correctly, this was totally irrelevant because the performance was very good. At the time I had no idea who the actors were. Now I see that many of them have become well known over the years. I particularly liked Hotspur and Hal, which I now see being played by Sean Connery and Robert Hardy. I would love to see this available on video, especially since many of the pieces are rarely performed and less are still available on video. It would also be valuable as a document of television theatrical production from the mid-twentieth century.
