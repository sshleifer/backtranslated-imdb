Claudine is a film that is the representation of the American system in the worst. The welfare system was initially created as a springboard for those families who needed an extra hand to get up. The film showed an accurate picture of how the welfare system breaks the family unit. In other words, if the father or any male figure is in the lives of women and children, his financial support of the system would be compromised if not terminated. The struggles of the poor can be seen all over the world. I'd like to see a reprint of that movie in stores for everyone to rent or buy for the library collection.
