Interesting twist on Vampire yarn - fast, loud and moody. Despite my initial fears, Kris K carries his part reasonably well and Snipes aka Blade provides a formidable physical presence. Many bodies of blood, steel, silver, fire and explosion provide a pleasant distraction of 110 minutes. If you like the black look of The Matrix, then Blade will appeal to you, Blade still has a string of 'dodge the bullets'.
