Soap is an interesting and very bright film in some parts. You should note him for his strong characterization and for the risks that the plot of two troublesome individuals fall in love with. You should know the story through several other reviews, so let's talk about what is brilliant about this movie. <br /> <br /> First, the two protagonists are so real and intriguing personalities. The first is a woman who has opted for a four-year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with someone coming toward her. The second is a man who has always wanted to be a woman, whose pain and loneliness are shown with such sensitivity and brilliance. You hate the first one and your heart bleeds for the last. <br /> <br /> The second thing about this movie is the whole concept of loving someone for who they are regardless of sex. So, would you still love your partner if he changed sex? The movie explores this idea and is beautiful. <br /> <br /> But there is a point where the movie fails. I would like the relationship between the protagonists to develop in a better way. That what they feel is love does not appear until the end. But watch out, and post your thoughts on it here .......
