Crackerjack is a simple but very good movie where the good guys are very good and the bad guys are very bad and the central character is tried on both sides. The combination of the central character being played by Mick Malloy and the central setting of the local grassy clubs attracted an extraordinarily large crowd, ranging from a large number of teenagers to a large number of seniors - and all laughed of comedy. As you'd expect from a movie with Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy there was a bit of swearing, but it was not exaggerated and the audience I sat with certainly liked it! <br /> <br /> Mick Malloy did a good job as the lazy man who joined the group. bowling club (three times) simply to get parking spaces (one for himself and two for hire for others at a premium), but who has everything fall on it when he is forced to play or lose his membership. <br /> <br /> Judith Lucy does a good job as her local journalist / love interest and there are fabulous performances by Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson, Monica Maughan, Lois Ramsey and many others. <br /> <br /> The dark role of John Clarke as the villain is not one of the funniest, but he gives a solid performance. <br /> <br /> The not so subtle touches in the games provide a serious note for this light comedy. <br /> <br /> I'm sure those who enjoyed The Castle and The Dish will also enjoy this movie. .
