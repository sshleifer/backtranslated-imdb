For a movie that was PG, this is a fun movie. I grew up watching this movie over and over again. It's really fun, I do not know how today's audience would react, but if you grew up or loved the 80's then this is a great movie. Stephen Furst is great as Harold, who, I think, is one of the best characters in the movie. Paul Ruebens also appears for about 10 minutes. I love nostalgia.
