Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us not only of the existence of black cowboys, but also of providing a compelling story that was easy to follow. <br /> <br /> The plot, the scenery, the music and the talent were all top-notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the story of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Has he ever played a good guy? <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to broaden their thinking. This is an excellent film and I feel privileged to have seen it. I hope you feel the same.
