If Christopher Nolan had made Memento before Following, then all failures in Following would have been corrected. In Memento, Nolan built the changes in time perfectly. We were able to tell when it was the past, when it is current, etc. However, Nolan has experienced a little, and it just does not work. Although he had a small budget and could not use colors (which is one of Memento's ways to work), it was very difficult to distinguish between time. On the DVD, there is a feature that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order. I intended to write my comment after watching it, so hopefully it would make more sense, but, of course, it was not working. <br /> <br /> You can not blame Nolan for not having original ideas. . A young man, Bill (Jeremy Theobald), is bored, so he decides to follow random people on the street. He finds one, Cobb (Alex Haw), who particularly interests him. Soon, Bill becomes friends with Cobb and goes with him when he invades the houses and steals them. Then a darling young blonde (Lucy Russell) walks in, and the film gets even weirder from there. <br /> <br /> The end of Following is one of the most shocking endings I have ever seen. Of course, the Fight Club had an incredible end, but the way the After final ended was incredible. I felt as if someone had hit me on the head and given me a concussion. Nolan has a penchant for making good finals (well, maybe not, I could guess Insomnia a mile away), and can really build a great story. The following may not be the easiest to follow or look at, but it's such an original story with a shocking ending that you'll probably want to watch all your 70 minutes again. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R for language and some violence.
