Like most people who watched James Bond 007 movies. Most people NEVER knew that Thunderball was originally the FIRST 007 Movie to be released, but after Ian Fleming, wrote the story with Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham. The other two authors led Ian Fleming to the courts and WON THE CASE providing evidence that Ian Fleming took the ideas of SPECECT (Special Executive In Counter-Intelligence Terrorism Revenge Extortion). So, instead of doing Thunderball, they (fleming, broccoli, saltzman) did Dr. NO. <br /> <br /> This movie had the best of the best, From getting sean connery to coming back again, it was paid over 5,000,000 by NSNA. Irvin Kershner and Sean Connery had problems on set, that's true. But overall this movie was up there, I think (with Thunderball, license to kill, Dr No) these are my favorites from the series of titles. David Dryer was hired for Special Photographic Effects, he was working at the time on Bladerunner before NEVER SAYING NEVER. The $ 100 million yacht makes the nightclub fly, looks like a canoe. This movie starred the best villain in a title movie right behind Dr. No. Klaus Maria Brandeau kept this neurotic business together quietly, with a little humor for his authority over the bond. Barbara Carrera was excellent as fatima blush. <br /> <br /> The song was better than any score that did not contain John Barry making the soundtrack backround in most title movies. Michel Legrand is not big in the US compared to Europe, he played with Miles Davis and many other great jazz musicians over the years. It's a bit bland at times, but the 007 theme that happens around 3 or 4 times in the NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN movie is so cool, I like it more than the original. <br /> <br /> 007 is back One More Time <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton explained well, I thought, you can not relate to a superman or a superhero, he or she you have to be human and have feelings. He was by far the BEST TRUE SERIOUS ONE TO THE VERSION OF LIBERTIES. But Sean Connery proves that he can still play the part that made him and the others follow, I bet at 75 now he could still play a villain role in a MCCLORY 007 movie if any ever show up. <br /> <br />
