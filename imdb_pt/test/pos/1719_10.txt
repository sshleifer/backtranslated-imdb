I have some of Dr. Who's oldest videos and DVDs. I've played them again and again. I love each of the "doctors" for different reasons. But due to a man in the BBC hierarchy, Dr. Who has been canceled, although it is still one of the pillars of the BBC's formation. With the departure of Sylvester McCoy, the doctor was alive through the fans. The BBC kindly allowed fans to write books and cartoons. The moment of Dr. Who was stable even after 1989. So they had a chance with Paul McGann. The film was flawed but gave the BBC an idea of ​​what we wanted. In 1999, the "man" was gone and the BBC rookies thought it was time to bring the doctor back. It was a complete success. Here in America, the Sci-Fi Channel had a chance and became a complete success too, although writers were having to start over and explain Dr. Who's mythology to new viewers. It's amazing to me that they did it. In the first season, staring Christopher Eccleston with Russell T. Davis as lead writer, and Phil Collinson as producer, the Doctor came back to us and in each episode we learn more about who the Doctor is. The Doctor Who universe has always been about "Choice", "Love" and "Sacrifice". That's what they provided. It makes me want more and it saddens me that Mr. Eccleston has chosen to leave the show. My first doctor was doctor no. 3, the physician of Jon Pertwee. Eccleston does not need to worry about his position in Dr. Who's universe. He's as solid as the rest. He is the 9th Doctor. I did not know Mr. Eccleston before his performance on Dr. Who, but I do now. I wish there was some way he could know, there is a push in the Dr. Who's fan community to find his other work and take advantage of it. We already saw that he is a great actor.
