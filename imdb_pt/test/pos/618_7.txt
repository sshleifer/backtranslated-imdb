The first half of the movie scared the hell out of me and usually I'm not easy to scare, but the second half of this thriller did not work well, but still very scary! A good thriller, than using simple ways to make good terror. Lowbudget, set in Russia, cast unknown, and made in Europe. but still great fun, and yes, there are some laughs for good subjects too!
