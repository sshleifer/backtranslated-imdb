I thought Anywhere But Here was a good movie. He stars in two wonderful actresses, Susan Sarandon and Natlie Portman, who when I heard they were in a movie together I resist watching. Overall, it was a really cool movie. where I felt like they tried hard, and there was also some really exaggerated and worn out material, but there was nothing in the movie that I absolutely hated. I even liked how they used the movie's pop-up performance. Thora Birch not credited, and all the little happy / sad moments are thrilling and effective. If you want to watch this movie, go ahead because even if I do not recommend it, it's not something you should avoid, and a rating of 5.9 seems unfair in my opinion.
