I really like the opening of the movie when Colonel Ted Masters notices on his fighter radar that four enemy planes were approaching around 10 o'clock. The good news is that the film does not mention from the outset that the colonel, along with a fighter who was a lieutenant, was trying to do a "freedom of navigation" exercise along the eastern Mediterranean, but it was a little too much. pass through the restricted area of ​​air space reserved for a dishonest Middle Eastern country while accidentally passing through it. <br /> <br /> I also enjoy all the breaks in the colonel's radar readings and computer monitors as the enemy aircraft aggressively picks up the two American fighter pilots in an engagement for violating their airspace. That first duel immediately reminds me of the famous fighter pilot film "Top Gun." From the outbreak of the enemy bandits to the thirty-millimeter rounds of the enemy aircraft that hit the colonel's jet engines and forced the plane to fall, forcing it to eject, all this reminds us one thing ... dog fighting techniques can keep you alive ... but a false move can cause you to be killed. <br /> <br /> The only problem in the movie was the "snake sequence" scene. It was a little too long. Yes, the opening of the movie was great when you see the conflict ... that was the wrestling engagement. Only when a boy tells Doug Masters that his father was shot down after the Cessna planes landed in the "snake" race does he force us back to the time the conflict has begun. I think the sequence of snakes in the middle should be interrupted a little by Colonel Masters being handcuffed in the middle of the Bilyad Desert on their way to the detention center ... while the musical sequence of the "snake" continues. The movie does not do that ... if it was, the details of the conflict would have been smoother at that point. Quite the opposite. When news broke that Colonel Ted Masters' trial for treason (violation of territorial air sovereignty) was over and he was sentenced to hang by hanging in three days, Doug Masters decides to get in action. With the Air Force having futile attempts to save the man, Doug decides to pull his friends and Colonel Sinclair (played by Louis Gossett Jr.) to a plan to rescue Masters. Risking a great chance to face a court-martial and spend more than a year in a military action, he goes against Air Force policy and makes a plan to rescue the Masters without the consent of the US government. <br /> <br /> Doug and his friends infiltrate into various classified areas of the base to get many things in the area where Masters is kept for the next hanging, and the area around Bilyad (which ends up being a fake country from the Middle East to the film). One plan included firing fireworks outside the darkroom of the Air Force as a distraction to get confidential photos and maintenance material on fighter jets, fighter bases, intelligence, and all other military things around Bilyad. <br /> <br /> When all was said and done, and Sinclair studied all the intelligence, he almost rejected the plan because Doug was too arrogant. Not until they got the two F-16s and tried a dry run over a range of firing, I realized what they would do on the outside. I noticed Doug's shooting and bomb dropping are not good until he hears rock music. I remember when he dropped a Mach 82 bomb on a horizontal target and the bomb missed by 20 feet ... I realized Doug is unusual. He likes music when he fires his hunting ammunition. <br /> <br /> The last part of the conflict, the final action in "Iron Eagle", was better than the Top Gun climax of the hostile wrestling sequences. I liked the way the final conflict unfolded, especially when Doug Masters faces a Middle Eastern fighter pilot who actually led the trial against Ted Masters. Short but sweet when Doug took the enemy fighter out after a second attempt by a side-rope missile. It seems that this Colonel Bilyad was similar to "Darth Vader" in Star Wars .... in the air, it can be very evil, because if you ever saw Star Wars, Darth Vader was actually Anakin Skywalker, who was an ace pilot in space. Unusual connotation for this, but still works!
