The actors in this dark film are truly believable and well-grounded. The quality of camera work makes you feel like you are there. The script is intense and does not wander. The plot is one that makes you want to watch a second time from the new perspective obtained by the end. We show this film to a small group of clients at the Gadsden Cultural Arts Center. After the film, the patron was eager to discuss the film and one person called me the next day to say they were still "bothered". While we put an 18-year age restriction on the film, I watched the film with a group of young people, as it is a very real portrait of an unpleasant situation and sets the stage for a great conversation.
