Gary Busey is excellent in this musical biography. Great singing and great soundtrack. The Buddy Holly Story is a much better movie than La Bamba. From reading other comments, there may be some historical inaccuracies. Regardless, it's a fun listening movie, and a good introduction to Buddy Holly's music.
