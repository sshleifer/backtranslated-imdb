America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every way. It has a great host, has great guests, great production and some of the best modeling professionals, contributing to something they have not yet achieved: presenting a true America's Next Top Model. Of course this is not an easy thing to do because the US and the world would already have 10 top models competing and fighting each other in this cruel world. <br /> <br /> But it is obvious that its intention is not to present Next America's top model, but rather, the Next Model of America. The show brings together a lot of models without any experience with different personalities and major personal, professional and financial problems, giving them a chance to bring a dream to life or make their lives worth something. It is obvious that Tyra Banks uses all this to her advantage, she gives the dream, but in return it gains audience and more popularity. Anyway, she deserves it, because she's smart and, if I may say, a pioneer in this kind of show. Tyra is also a great observer and knows how to give opinions based, differing from other models and hosts of foreign versions of the NEXT TOP MODEL franchise. In Brazil, as an example, Fernanda Motta is her host and "Once Upon a Time" -Top Model. She does not even have 1/10 of Tyra's professional skills, which keeps Tyra Banks at the top. Tyra has professional and personal knowledge of what she says and she is a great mentor because she not only criticizes but points out the mistake and teaches the right path wisely. <br /> <br /> The program does not suffer major problems. , fulfills and fulfills what it promises during the cycles. The models chosen to work on the show in fact are not the best unknown models across the country because Tyra Banks bets on the difference, and she's right, because she (and also a good part of her audience) believes it's time to model the world to change some parameters. During cycles, she and her team actually make fair decisions, where the weaker go away and the more promising have new chances to prove their abilities, but they must be quick to do so, otherwise they lose it. <br /> <br /> Another very interesting thing is that Tyra also knows how to decide who should or should not win, even when it is against people's opinions. She knows that whoever wins will be famous, but has little chance of actually being a world-renowned top model. In the same way, she knows that sometimes the second place is more valuable than the first, because the first place wins the title, but the second does not receive the stigma of the title. She hardly makes mistakes when deciding the future of any model during the show. <br /> <br /> After 9 cycles, the show is getting a little tired with some old ideas, it's time for Tyra to change some things and lines because it's getting annoying and comparing with the first few cycles, we can see she's getting bored too, so she needs to do it if she wants the show to live a little longer. <br /> <br /> Either way, the show explores fashion. and world modeling, but it's also fun for those who live out of it all. It gives the opportunity to some girls and also to the market, in addition to giving great tips to those who are of the public that shares the same dream.
