Being a fan of Bills, I originally found it annoying that they did a movie about the bills and the loss of four superbowls. But once I started to watch, I felt really connected. It was really good to see the "Bills" win the superbowl, and I must say that for a TV movie, it was actually very well done. Gil Bellows as the QB, and Jon Voight as the old guard coach did a great job. 8 out of 10
