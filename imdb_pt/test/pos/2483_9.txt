This extraordinary pseudo-documentary, made in 1971, perfectly captures America's zeitgeist today ... which makes everything even more scary and relevant. "subversives" (university students, hippies, black activists, academics) are being captured by the government and given lengthy prison sentences for mental crimes and social protests. As an alternative to life imprisonment, these convicted "criminals" are offered for three days in "Punishment Park". Your goal inside the park is to reach the American flag where freedom awaits you. Not surprisingly, the Punishment Park option is a dirty lie. This brilliant film by Peter Watkins still predates "Battle Royale" and "Series 7," although its angle of attack is more blatantly political. Filmed in '71, it looks as fresh as anything made today. The performances are exemplary and the direction is more accentuated. The narrative goes back and forth between the various groups trying to survive the harsh conditions of the park and the McCarthy-type trials that condemned them. Today, this movie still holds its power. In '71, there was nothing but nothing like it. This is a masterpiece that achieves a dozen levels. There are the balls that most people today have lost.
