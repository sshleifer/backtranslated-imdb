Here is one of the Jane Austen movies that I found very pleasurable. I read the book first, then listened to it on CD and was fascinated by how a young Victorian woman could be persuaded to marry the man she loved because of a lack of fortune or education. The joy of knowing that Anne is evidently reunited with a lost love. The fact that her godmother tries to marry a cousin who has nothing to lose. Looking at the snobbery that comes from the upper classes and how the class distinctions can divide couples from following their hearts. Captain Wentworth realizes that he still loves Anne after seven years. His final understanding that Anne's love was constant all this time and that she would not let her family interfere with her true happiness and eventual marriage to someone she truly loved.
