This is one of the best films I've seen from the age of silence (sad to say, I still have to see many except for Chaplin / Keaton material). Very visually brilliant, with insanely influential style in editing and composition. Really unique (especially for your time) camera angles and extremely hectic editing. Definitely a must see for the movie nerd. <br /> <br /> The downside is that it's a bit too much in your face about your politics (I have no problem with politics in the movie, as long as they are subtle or less skippable as a backseat to the story). Also, it's not an "entertainment" movie, which is fine, but it's not something I'm going to watch a billion times. This is pure and simple art, like it or not. <br /> <br /> It's worth an A + just to influence, but based on personal pleasure, I give an A-.
