Blue ribbon banners, stars and stripes forever, decorated generals and unconditional surrender of the enemies who demanded tons and tons of radiation, this was the essence of the United States victory in World War II !! The celebration in Times Square, as well as anywhere else in the United States, suggests a national zenith !!! America is in the upper right corner !! One thing, one agonizing and meticulously perverse thing .. The adjustment period !! The real celebration ended when the bottle of champagne was finished .. Now everyone needs to go on with their lives ... just a problem though .. They have to gain new lives ... the old lives are gone forever .. Polite and pleasant smiles had a fragile fa√ßade with a longevity of ice cubes in boiling water !! All the characters in the film are displayed by primordial doubts and unable to mask a pretense that nothing was seriously wrong, for the simple reason that this was not true !!! Once sergeants and generals, and their wives, daughters and sons and virtually all other Americans touched by the Second World War, were exposed to shortcomings, nightmares and recriminations from World War II and what they actually accomplished, as well as denied, no one was the same!! For now, social and moral issues were self-interested ... Frederick March and Myrna Loy had to start over !! Dana Andrews realized that he should never have been married to Virginia Mayo in the first place !!! Theresa Wright has become painfully aware of the fact that she is constructively selfish! Las, but not least, the character, Homer, is about to get married and he thinks everyone around him is as devastated by his injury as he is, basically in the sense that they are either unable or unwilling to deal with it! <br /> <br /> The reason this movie is so fabulous is because a happy ending was struck in the hard way, once everyone recognized the new beginning of the new United States and the new world, the tragedy of the Second World War was recognized and things that were emotionally torn into pieces were taken in stride, and handled accordingly !! Frederick March and Myrna Loy need to go back to chapter one at their wedding, Homer warned his new fiancee about what it takes to marry him (that is, she'll feel like a nurse half the time) and Thresa Wright's involvement with Dana Andrews means her entry into adulthood has resulted in partial responsibility for breaking a marriage ... This is the same as learning how to drive a car to get your driver's license in the Indianapolis 500 ... The characters in the movie are the post Americans of World War II in which they are impatient for the rude awakening of coercive changes in their lives ... Happiness is no longer offered the luxury of the adjective police-aesthetic ... it is now about formidable conditions, and good victory over evil through the least ugly choice !! ... WWII did not just happen !! From now on you will master the social standards of American life !!! <br /> <br /> The added catastrophe of World War II also mirrored Americans' sense of human inadequacy. I loved this movie and the AFI too, probably for the reason that it brought issues that were both unreasonably taboo !! .. Bottom line, watch this movie !! Nightmares about combat, dilemmas about marital unhappiness and / or readjustment, dealing with your life when hit by a disability and simply acting human are portrayed constantly in the movies and on television today, however !! That's 1946 !! Very new to the Americans, so ... REMEMBER THAT !! Director William Wyler illustrated how Americans feel about the aftermath of World War II on the days when the film industry left him with a hand tied behind his back !!! Take this into account and you'll probably realize just how sensational this movie really was !!
