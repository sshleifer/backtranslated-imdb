A throwback to the "old-fashioned" westerns of the '30s and' 40s (like DODGE CITY), DALLAS has a number of things: Gary Cooper in his brightest and brightest Technicolor photography by Ernest Haller (GONE WITH THE WIND) and a score of Max Steiner (KING KONG, GWTW, DODGE CITY et al.). In addition, there is a masked ball, a mistaken identity, a feigned death and more escapism than a Republic series. As always, Cooper defines what it is to be a man under pressure. Forget 50 years of Western anguish ... this is pure fun!
