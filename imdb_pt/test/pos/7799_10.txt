The film Andaz Apna Apna in my books is the top 5 clever comedy movies ever made in Bollywood, maybe even Hollywood. <br /> <br /> When the movie was released, I was 8 years old and I heard it was a failure, but I never understood until now why it was a failure ... but let me tell you something ... the film would have more money selling domestic cassettes and DVDs and displaying on TV movie channels any hit movies in theaters. This movie has been shown countless times on film channels and I think until now the love of the public and the TV producers keep repeating the movie over and over again. I personally watched the entire movie more than 80-100 times and I still love it ..... <br /> <br /> The performance of both Aamir Khan as Amar and Salman Khan as Prem is amazing but I especially liked of Aamir Khan's performance as a smart street guy .... his dialogues in the movie are hilarious ... the story is simple and here's how it goes ..... <br /> <br /> Love and Prem are poor, lazy and come from a poor family of tailors and Amars' father is a barber. So the two get news that the daughter of a London millionaire is coming to India to look for a suitable pair ... both Lov and Prem think this is a great opportunity to become super rich ..... so , both go out to conquer Raveena Tandon .. (the millionaire daughter) ...... on their journey they both hate each other and each tries to cheat the other to marry Raveena ..... the comedy scenes in the half are so hilarious that you would need a glass of water to stop the pain in your stomach, laughing ....... and then there's Uncle Raveenas (brother of the similar millionaire) Tja who wants revenge on the father Raveenas ... .. since he is bankrupt and father Raveenas is a millionaire ...... his plans include kidnapping Raveena to blackmail father Raveenas for which he hires two butlers ..... <br /> <br /> but more later we learn that there is a twist in the movie (watch the movie to know) ....... then there is Shakti Kapoor as m crime scene Gogo who is also incredibly fu nny ...... <br /> <br /> The thing that stood out to me were the dialogues in the movie that became a kind of legend ..... Aamir khan uses his "aaila" brilliantly and Salman goes as "OOima" ........ and for Gogo there is "Jab Raat Ko Bacha Soota Nahi Hain for Ma Bolti Hain Ki Sooja Nahi for Gogo Aa Jaega" ..... each scene is so funny ...... I especially liked the one in which Aamir Khan and Salman went to get Raveena from Teja and both go in a Luna with money "chillar" in a bag. ... this scene is so funny .. <br /> <br /> I recommend anyone who understands Hindi or Urdu to watch this movie ...... this is a movie I recommend having a DVD and you will never go regret. ......
