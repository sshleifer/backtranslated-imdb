I really enjoyed watching Hell to Pay. I've been a fan of western movies ever since I remembered and it reminded me of many of the 1960's (although I was too young to have seen them in their first run). The only thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant music. It was distracting at times. One thing I noticed, and I wonder how many Gunsmoke fans noticed, was the name of Buck Taylor's character. It was a joke by the name of Gunsmoke's Doc Adams. Instead of Gaylan Adams, Buck Taylor used Adam Galen. I wonder if this was his or Chris McIntyre's choice? Anyway, I highly recommend this movie to the fans from the west. Do not expect anything "deep". Just the old entertainment.
