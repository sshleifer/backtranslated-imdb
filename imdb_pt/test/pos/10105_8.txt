I just saw "A Tale of Two Sisters" last night and I really enjoyed it. I have been a big fan of Asian horror movies recently and I think this is a strong entry from South Korea. There are not many jumps in you scares like in the usual American horror movie but the director keeps the mood out of order and bad omen very well, especially in clumsy character interactions with one another. Most of the scares are more conceptual and touch on everyone's fear of "there's something under the bed" from when I was a child, but in that case it's the closet and the sink. I also liked how the director was able to capture how dysfunctional this house is through scenes like the first dinner the characters have together. He is also good at revealing the inner life and fragility of people through simple scenes like the stepmother cleaning the makeup in the mirror or sitting in front of the TV blinking. I think this film is primarily an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt hovering over you. <br /> <br /> LARGER SPOILERS AHEAD (DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU DO NOT WANT THAT THE MOVIE TWISTS REVEALED I was following the story very well, but I started to get confused during the process of dragging the bag.However, I think the flashback at the end definitely tied it all together.The movie is very much like "The Machinist" in the way two of the character's joint guilt ends up leading to collapses and mental delusions. The Su-Yeon that we see after the girls supposedly return home is the Su-Mi illusion or the actual Su-Yeon ghost that only Su-Mi can see and interact in. The initial stepmother we see is, in my opinion, an illusion of Su-Mi.There is a real stepmother, however, and she appears for the first time in the movie when she is wearing the gray suit.I believe she is the real stepmother that the father is talking on the phone throughout the first part of the film and she does not appear He picks her up and takes her to the house. Is the stepmother before that point imagined by Su-Mi (perhaps part of her split personality?) This explains the bizarre sequence of dinner when her stepmother's brother looks at her as if she's crazy and does not remember anything she tells . I think it was Su-Mi acting with her stepmother as part of her split personality. The film shows this later in the scene of dragging the bag and scenes like the stepmother rubbing the makeup in the mirror, which is revealed later to be the Su-Mi wiping the makeup in the mirror. <br /> I think the house ghosts are not entirely imagined by Su-Mi, and are either Su-Yeon or the mother or both. In the final flashback, it is revealed that Su-Yeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died. This is the green dress they showed earlier on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother looked under the sink. Also, it's the clip that Su-Yeon used in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink. <br /> <br /> The real stepmother, in the end, is punished by the ghost of Su-Yeon, who comes in a scene a bit like the ring. After that, the flashback scene unites everything in terms of how the stepmother was primarily responsible for her death, while Su-Mi unwittingly played a supportive role. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the "mother" Su-Yeon sees when she goes to her room to cry, in the flashback, is already a ghost. Maybe by now her mother had already killed herself in the closet. This is left ambiguous. Other things that are suggested but not clearly explained in the film are that it appears that the stepmother was at some point a nurse, perhaps taking care of her mother and somehow contributed to her death as well . It is unclear when his relationship with his father began and whether his mother killed himself. It is also suggested that the mother also have mental problems, requiring a nurse. The stepmother alludes to this when she tells Su-Mi that you are starting to take care of your mother. I do not think she meant it just physically. <br /> <br /> In addition, if we accept that the initial stepmother we see is really Su-Mi, then there is the suggestion of incest as well, since the father sleeps with it. . That's why Su-Mi goes crazy and shouts, "Do not touch me" every time Dad reaches her in later scenes? Are the "dirty things you've done" she alludes to in a later conversation with her father? This film is interesting in its capacity for different interpretations. Some of the scenes, however, were a kind of derivative, like the woman in the black scene crawling around, which reminded me of Kayako's daring moves in the Ju-On / The Grudge movies. In addition, the final scene in which the stepmother finally gets her desserts is reminiscent of The Ring. Also, just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from "The Sixth Sense" or "The Others". <br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoyed it though, and it will be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake (which is already in production) is over. I have to be honest, I like both "The Ring" and "The Grudge", so I'm not one of those flashy guys who insist that remakes can not be good either. A remake that I'm really excited about is "Dark Water" coming out this summer. I have not yet seen the original Japanese version, but both movies are definitely on my list to see.
