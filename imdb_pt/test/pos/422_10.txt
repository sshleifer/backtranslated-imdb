Ok, so this series takes the path of 'here we go again!' Week after week, David Morse's character helps his journey, which is kind of nervous - but what's wrong with that? David Morse is one of the greatest character actors out there, and certainly the coolest, and having him in a series created by David Koepp - a great writer - is heaven !! <br /> <br /> Due to the lack of love for this show by many, I can not see this going for a season - but you never know? The amount of crap that made this further amazes me - hopefully something good can do this other than a first series !!!
