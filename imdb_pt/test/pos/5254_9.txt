This movie was funny from start to finish. Everyone at the movies was laughing throughout the movie !! The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, Will and Grace's girl) and Tanya the manicure (Debi Mazar). They had the best speeches, the best attitudes, etc. Jada Pinkett playing a lesbian was very funny, she really played well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the movie was the fact that the other two main characters were not so funny, although the film focus around them ........ In short, this is a great movie to go and see with your girls (yes guys, it's a girl's movie!). Appreciate!!!
