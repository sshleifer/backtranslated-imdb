This is a very fun, fluffy and glamorous musical from the 1940s. 'Cover Girl' has transformed Rita Hayworth (formerly the Latin lady Margarita Cansino) into an authentic American star. She confirmed the incredible talent of Gene Kelly as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. It symbolizes the exuberance and color of the musical genre. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth is great as Rusty Parker - it's her picture, and her presence is always on the cutting edge. Her singing is dubbed, but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and it fits in well with Kelly. I think Rita was highly underrated as an actress - she plays each scene superbly here. Gene choreographed the dance sequences (he basically received almost total creative freedom here), and his 'Alter Ego' dance number is incredible. Such art. The melodies are 'Make Way For Tomorrow', 'Put Me To The Test' and of course 'Long Ago and Far Away'. The plot is rather thin, but it has a moral. It is about the dangers of quick fame and quick money, and how any happiness with just these factors will eventually be doomed. This will cheer you up, lift you up and make you laugh. <br /> <br /> That said, 'Cover Girl' is not the greatest musical ever produced - it has a number of flaws that should be addressed. . It could be said that a little Phil Silvers goes a long way. Your character gets bored quickly. However, I was impressed with his ability to dance and how he was able to accompany Gene and Rita. Another big problem is that many songs are not that good. The cover girl number looks fantastic, but I'm not a fan of lyrics or singing. 'Poor Tom' is a great downer. I think it's one of the worst numbers I've ever heard in a musical from the 40's and 50's yet. This stinks. The grandmother sub-plot borders on being ridiculous. But that's just my opinion. Others may like these elements. <br /> <br /> Still, in addition to its flaws, it's a very, very good movie, much better than most of the product produced today. The dance and singing are sublime, the production values ​​are excellent and the mood is contagious. 8/10.
