I could not 'agree more than with the comment left by' coldshitaction 'and how this movie is a masterpiece. I've never seen a movie that had my adrenaline flowing that this movie did, and that mostly happened when Bronson comes running out of a fire escape with an M-60 and rams up like 20 guy from a gang, it's cool. Quite possibly the best action movie ever made (no exaggerations), it really could be the best action movie ever made. From the outset, one should know that you need something sweet when the police let Bronson go and tell him to clean up the favelas. Again, genius. And again Bronson is an idiot. Paul Kersey is so cool, maybe even cooler than John McClain or the Terminator, he's just an idiot. And what else is great is the fact that he is a nice guy and buys an ice cream for child and helps an old couple before killing some scum bag. genius. Highly recommended, if you hate this movie you are crazy.
