"The man with the golden arm" by Otto Preminger is a reference to heroin addiction - something that must have been quite risky to portray in 1955, fifty years ago (today's censors still have a problem with drug content in the movies!). The lead role was originally offered to Marlon Brando, then snatched by Frank Sinatra before Brando could respond. Sinatra convincingly portrays a professional and former heroin addict dealer who returns to the city and finds himself battling the demons of temptation. <br /> <br /> Preminger is one of my favorite directors (his "Anatomy of a Murder"). "starring James Stewart is a brilliant and revolutionary court drama.) Preminger practically helped change the face of cinema in the 1950s -" Anatomy of a Murder "was extremely controversial when it came out due to its plot and content (references to rape, women's panties, seduction, etc.) and "The Golden Arm Man" deals with a topic that is equally volatile. However, Preminger takes it out without becoming an explorer. from "The Panic in Needle Park" (1971) and has more than a few similarities in terms of general motifs for Billy Wilder's classic "Lost Weekend" starring Ray Milland.These three particular movies are probably the best movies on alcoholism prior to the 1980s and still remain relevant today.
