Having read the book before watching this adaptation, you would think you would have lost some of your excitement. However, the story is so clever that I could never tire of it. <br /> <br /> Sally and Elaine really put their hearts on their roles and brought in many of the characters. I fell in love with the story and the women again. <br /> <br /> Beautiful to watch thanks to the direction, settings and costumes. Despite the speed of the television plot, I do not feel that something important has been lost in transit. It left me on the edge of my seat with many wonderful moments of trembling in my stomach. I thoroughly enjoyed it. This is the kind of television I've been waiting for.
