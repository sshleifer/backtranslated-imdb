MONKEY is certainly one of the best shows ever shown on TV. I remember when I was a kid, I went to my grandmother's house every Saturday morning and turned on the TV to watch MONKEY. I loved. He had fantastic action scenes, cool special effects, a great story, a fantastic theme song that would never leave his head and hilarious dubbing. But it's kind of strange that he's in China and that the actors are Japanese and filmed in Japan, but that's not a stop to making this TV show nice. <br /> <br /> Monkey is about the adventures of three people: Pigsy (Toshiyuki Nishida), Sandy (Shir√¥ Kishibe) and of course, the unforgettable and most amiable character, Monkey (Masaaki Sakai), who travel from China to India to pick up a bunch of sacred scrolls to save the world. <Br/> <br /> MONKEY is a lot of fun and it's magic.
