For me this wonderful roller coaster of a film brings repeated pleasant visions. It is about the tangled life of three very different people. Holly Hunter is the producer obsessed by workaholic. Albert Brookes plays the unattractive yet brilliant journalist. William Hurt is the affable but stupid new kid on the block, news anchor. <br /> <br /> The classic love triangle comes with incredibly witty and self-deprecating Brookes, in love with Hunter, but she is naturally attracted to Hurt. <br /> <br /> This movie works on many levels. At the very least, it's a brilliant comedy, with the liners flying so thick and fast that each show brings a new crop of those you may have missed the last time. It's also a movie about attraction and romance not fulfilled. <br /> <br /> But perhaps more importantly, the film examines modern obsession with physical appearance and its ultimate triumph over the intellect as a valued human attribute. This is epitomized by Hurt's meteoric career success, in contrast to Brookes' relative decline. <br /> Despite being fifteen, the film has some relevant messages about modern values ​​and the continuing decline in journalistic standards. . <br /> <br /> This film is a classic in every way and it is difficult to understand why it was so neglected
