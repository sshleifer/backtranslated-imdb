This has to be one of the best post-Astaire musicals made by Columbia. Produced by Arthur Schwartz and directed by veterinarian Charles Vidor, this image actually put Gene Kelly on the map and cemented Rita Hayworth's reputation as the premier female dance partner in the cinema. She plays a double role here since she performs contemporary numbers from the 1940s with Gene and co-star Phil Silvers, but also puts her in the role of her grandmother, a nightclub artist in the late 19th century. <br /> <br /> Music should also be chosen because I believed in the latest project that the legendary Jerome Kern (most famous today for "Old Man River" and "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes") worked, and his lyricist was the same. legendary Ira Gershwin. They provided a score that is full of charm and characterization. The music for the historical sequences is especially notable because it is so perfectly styled in the language of the early 20th century that was the original period of Kern. It's like getting a record from one of your favorite 1970s bands and listening to them make a song in the original style of the time. <br /> <br /> The story is very inconsequential, which is good for me because this movie is as close an approximation as you'll probably see from the 1930's gold era of the Broadway musical comedy style on film . Even the war propaganda aspects of the 1940s provide extra charm as the talented trio sings "make way for tomorrow" and even mockingly cheats US enemies and using period slang as if referring to "gremlins." Probably the most memorable performance of the film is Kelly's dance to the "Alter-Ego Dance," which found him arguing and dancing with himself as a metaphorical image of the battle of consciousness. This prefigures much of his later work and also represents an effective and memorable scene by itself. <br /> <br /> Fans will want to look for several reasons - Kelly fans will see this as a rare chance to see him out of the limits of MGM with a different set of co-stars and music superior to his material Usual MGM. Hayworth fans will want to see Rita in glorious colors at the height of her fame and skill. And fans of classic Broadway musicals will definitely want to hear Kern's final score and marvel at the quality of Gershwin's lyrics and the compatibility of his styles. This is a definite jewel in the crown of Columbia's music program.
