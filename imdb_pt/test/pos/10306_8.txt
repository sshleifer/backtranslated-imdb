I agree with Andy, this is a good movie. The character of Kevin McKidd is believable throughout the film. We are forced to hate him and, lately, we sympathize with him. Paula Sage, who plays Roberta, also performs well. It is thought-provoking and emotive without any overproduction. Thanks to the director Alison Peebles and writer Andrea Gibb for this. A very interesting sight. The pace of the film is fair, raising just enough interest in the subject to lure it in, rather than bombard it with facts in a documentary style. Cool little soundtrack to go with the movie too, again used in moderation, so as not to distract you from the plot. Recommended.
