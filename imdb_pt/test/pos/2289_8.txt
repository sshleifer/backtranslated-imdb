Many believe that this movie is a baseball movie. These people are disappointed because it's about a baseball player, but the movie is not about baseball. <br /> <br /> Some think that this movie is a romantic comedy and they are disappointed because the relationship is not really developed. This movie is not a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> This movie is about culture. An arrogant American major Leaguer and a stern traditional Japanese baseball manager can not succeed because they can not really understand. It is after they succeed in breaking the cultural barrier that they succeed. The baseball player becomes more Japanese in his team mentality and the more American manager in allowing individual achievement, and they find themselves in the middle. <br /> <br /> Baseball and romance are subordinate to this critique of the two cultures. Many who have no understanding of the Japanese mentality miss this and think it is a baseball or romance film and see cultural shock as a mild relief from comedy. It's not - culture shock is the movie's encumbrance. Based on my own experience and understanding of Japanese culture, I think this film did very well, as it did not overly romanticize Japanese culture, nor exaggerated its interpretation. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it's a nice, relaxing movie if we understand what it really is.
