Reading some of the other comments in this film, I remembered good and not so good aspects of it. But overall, I have to say that it's one of the best movies I've seen from various genres or countries lately. More than anything else, it has avoided many of the more typical pitfalls of the latest international cinema, such as taking beautiful pictures of landscapes or being "funky" or "imitating" American films such as pulp fiction. The film is unique in many ways. On the one hand, it is a film about relationships in which sex plays no role (unusual, especially for foreign films). It is also a film about the relationship of two men to each other (also unusual - not a 'friend movie', no homosexual tension, no phallic ego / competition). Uses little dialogue, but communicates a tremendous amount. It is a simple story but full of complex details that are easily understood by any human being and universal in its relevance. I did not find the movie gloomy or depressing (it would all look like this if you watched happy Hollywood movies all the time), but a true reflection of human emotions. For example, in the scene where Mahmut realizes that his cousin is gone, you see both the sense of relief, that the cousin is gone and still regrets that you have pushed him away. Who has not felt such ambivalence - in losing a friend or lover, or in some other situation? It is rare to find these types of real human emotions exhibited in the film in a non-clich√© way. As far as culture is concerned, or the fact that it is a Turkish film, I think it hits the difficult balance between being a "Turkish" film - about realities that apply more to that place (the biggest fight to get to a Turkish city ). a European, the greatest contrast between country and city), and a universal human history that does not necessarily have to be defined in Turkey. In this day and age when people around the world are consuming culture and fetishising, this movie does not try to seduce us as' Turkish ', nor does it try to convey it as a' harsh reality ', or' this is how Turkey / Istanbul IS '. And yet the cultural elements are there. I think the comparison with "loss of translation" someone did is very good. Everyone, at least in the US, was enthusiastic about the film. I personally thought it was mediocre at best. It was well placed by someone as a vague history who was supposed to deal with the "disorientation" that happens to people living or traveling abroad. Even if the movie was funny, the characters and their motivations or crises were never clarified (even for a "lighter" movie or comedy, this is necessary). And I found myself being treated of a typically "Orientalist" Amerian story alienated abroad. Going back to 'Distant', as for the idea that this is bad, or too slow, or has no plot, I'm sorry, but people who say this do not know anything about filming and maybe nothing about being human, no offense. You do not need to be a movie buff or cultural connoisseur to enjoy this movie. This movie will be two hours of your time well spent!
