I'm not much for "cop" movies, but this is supposed to be a classic and when I found it cheap I bought it and put it on a shelf, only to finally get around to watching it yesterday, and I liked it! Now you can have New York City, but as a setting for a movie like this in the winter months, it's perfect. Roy Scheider is a member of a group of elite cops called The Seven Ups, who are five guys fighting crime in disguise. In an opening scene, they retrieve a shoebox full of money from an antique store, distracting the bad guys with a "bull in a china shop" routine. But that's just the beginning. It seems that there are two guys, posing as police officers, who are kidnapping types of mobs and holding them hostage. Richard Lynch, by the way, is one of those jugglers, and he's as scary as ever. When one of the Seven Ups, who is posing as a limousine driver at a funeral, picks up his cape, he is beaten and stuffed into the trunk of a car, leading to one of the most thrilling pursuits I have ever seen. Incredible though, as light traffic in New York is for chase scenes, but it's still amazing how Scheider follows the two hijackers through what I'm assuming is the Bronx and then on a toll and finally the car Scheider comes to an abrupt stop at one of the most sweeping endings of a chase scene I've ever witnessed. In any case, since the policeman ends up dying, Scheider and his men are under suspicion, because the police commissioner knows very little about his activities, he wonders if they are arrested for kidnapping mafiosi, so of course this kind of thinking needs to be cut in the bud & Scheider is ruthless to get to the bottom of things. Overall, a decent police action / drama, is not really my thing, but I liked that one. Look for Joe Spinell (Maniac) in a small paper. 7 out of 10.
