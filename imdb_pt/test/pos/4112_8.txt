I was 19 or 20 years old at the time and lived in Salt Lake City, Utah, and I still remember the new dome theater called 21st Century. Built-in rocking chairs and a new sound system, big screen and huge open space between the screen and the crowded theater. We feel all the excitement of a new preview of a movie. I can still hear the opening music playing the trumpet and the clang of cymbals. I loved the interaction of characters and the filmed views. I know Peter Finch and Luv and Sally had some problems with the lip sink, but hey, that was a good feeling, feel better about the things in the movie! What I regret is the way they cut the significant heart, showed the reduced version and then called the flop. I saw the cut version and I can see that you lost the view of the view you had in the preview edition. Yes, I shudder a little at Peter's effort to make love through music, but you know I did not see it that way when I left the theater. when they looked us up when we left, I regret any comments I have made that might have altered the original. I liked that and still watch as I listen to the song on my LP. Most of my family heard me sing a lot of the soundtrack and I can use the movie monologues in our "what a movie" games. I would like a director's cut on DVD to be available. It's available on VHS, but it's not exactly the same. I particularly like a serious comment about the style of the rings about their origins, struggles and triumphs. Demanding people should leave things alone. Bring it back!!!!
