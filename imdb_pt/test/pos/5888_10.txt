In a movie as successful as this, it is difficult to highlight any factor. All the departments work in perfect union to create one of the most exciting human dramas ever made in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Production is a tribute to the joint efforts of writers, producers, cast and crew. To cite just a few, Hugo Friedhofer's magnificent soundtrack is a subliminal wonder, the subtle yet striking photograph of Greg Toland, and the unbelievably effective direction of William Wyler, all combined with an ideal cast to create an American classic. <br /> <br /> The DVD version is a special treat to watch. What a pleasure to see "The Best Years of Our Lives" wonderfully preserved for generations to come.
