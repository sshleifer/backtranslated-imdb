I always liked "DOA", 1950, starring Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this movie. Dennis Quaid, (Dexter Cornell), was a teacher who loved his wife and finally discovered that she was having an affair with one of her students. Dexter becomes involved with Meg Ryan (Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a great fall for him and ended up having a single night and somehow loved him deeply. Dexter discovers that he received a drink that had bad content and would cause him a lot of health problems! If you like Dennis Quaid and loves Meg Ryan you will enjoy watching this movie, Meg gave a great performance and kept this picture worth watching!
