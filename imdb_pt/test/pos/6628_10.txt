Bergman's tale about how the hell of war can bring a wise couple of musicians to the barbarian. With many memorable scenes throughout the film, I found it particularly striking that near the end where Ullmann and Von Sydow go in a boat completely surrounded by corpses of soldiers floating in the sea. A fascinating work of art!
