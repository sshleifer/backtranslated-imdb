Ramin Bahrani assembles a scene at the beginning of Chop Shop that immediately made me identify with the origin of the character of Ale (Alejandro Polanco) and his friend. The two of them board a subway, and as soon as the doors close, they ask if they could get everyone's attention for a moment, and they're selling chocolate bars or M & M's or something, and then they sell a few bars. If you (like me) have ever been on a subway in New York City at any time, this is the kind of situation that happens so often that you almost do not realize it. Often people in a subway see children like these or minorities selling something or announcing and talking about something on a subway and do not pay attention to them. Bahrani's focus is not necessarily only on children who put things up for sale on subway rides, but on survival and the state they are in when they are in the lower class in America. Subsequently, it is in your hands thoughtful and moving, usually at the same time. <br /> <br /> Comparing it to Pixote or the Bicycle Thief is not too far from a jump (actually, in the latter, at least the father and son have each other), although Bahrani is specific in his intentions in his documentary style. We care about this Ali character, no more than eleven and working at a car repair shop cleaning a few cars and helping to disassemble others, and his sister who comes from out of town to stay with him. But it's not simply because we're forced to feed any cliches, other than, you know, a brother and sister (more or less brother) trying to care for each other. Bahrani makes the story accessible through the simple aspiration that Ali has, the kind of goal that can be achieved in your situation: save enough to buy a used food truck that Ali and Isamar can operate. <br /> <br /> Everything Ali is working on, but what Bahrani shows us in brutal detail is this job, what Ali has to do to make it happen even as his nasty things like stealing car caps at Shea Stadium or, at one point, steal a purse in a desperate moment. That makes it all the more serious when Ale sees what his sister does for money on the night side, doing sexual favors for men in an abandoned truck by the side of the road. He does not mention it and pushes him aside, but it is always something that increases the tension, something that Ale wants to protect his sister. This adds to the tragedy when Ale learns the real cost of what it will take to turn the food truck into a profit generator, a cost that further increases the anguish he has just internalized. <br /> <br /> One can immediately look at the fact that Ale is orphaned in a neighborhood like Queens, where the film was filmed naturally, as in a work of neo-neo realism (let call it realism), featuring practically all the non-professional actors in the mechanics, the workers, and the people on the streets - but Bahrani is more focused on the here and now, and that's what makes Chop Shop so immediate and sincere. There is not a trace of melodrama in the film, not even the musical accompaniment beyond the live Latin music coming from the cars and radios. Sometimes Bahrani will focus on a very subtle moment that makes him pronounced in other scenes, such as the way Ale is awake, but acts as if he were sleeping the first night after witnessing Isamar's meeting, and we watch as she lies down in bed he knows he's awake, but he can not even say a word. Or, in many other scenes, poetic touches that look perfect, like when the man shows Ale how pigeon feeding works. <br /> <br /> It's hard and rough, as you can expect, and it does not. give a lot of hope to its main characters despite the few moments of happiness scattered. It is also a superbly filmed hand film where the technique, as well as many films done in its urban tone and approach, informs and complements the subjects on the screen and what they are doing, but is also never recklessly shot or very flashy. The filmmaker has an excellent cast of "real life" (Ale was ripped from a public school in New York without any experience) and knows how not to waste a shot, while at the same time gets a brutal art with just showing what he shows. It is not City of God or Pixote; is his little masterpiece in a character or characters that we do not usually take a second look at (or a first evil) on our way in a city like New York. If you are not moved by Ale and your daily struggles, I do not know what to do for you.
