Michael Polish's hypnotic "Northfork" is a movie that will stay in the memory for a long time. This exquisitely crafted film that Michael and Mark Polish wrote are visually one of the best things that came out last year from the world of independent films. The film is splendidly photographed by M. David Mullen, with a soundtrack by Stuart Matthewman. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, maybe stop reading here. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​putting the film in Montana was a big blow to the Polish brothers. Never has the majestic views of the country and the mountains been so vividly captured as in "Northfork." We do not need any color! The beauty is in the dark tones of the film that highlights the history of desolation at this remote outpost. <br /> <br /> At the center of the story is Irwin, the sick child under the care of the mysterious Father Harlan. . This boy is seen in his bed where the gentle priest is administering the medicine to his body. But is he really there? We observe him interacting with the strange group we first meet around the graveyard. There are two newly opened tombs. Will one of them be for Irwin? <br /> <br /> At the same time, another plot line plays parallel to this first theme. We see the six men in black who came to the area to remove as many people as possible from the area. This will be the bed for the artificial lake that will be created. Your reward is a hectare and a half of lakefront property if you move a certain amount of people. <br /> <br /> The third line of the center focuses on the mystical group composed of Hercules de Flores, Tea Cup, Cod and Happy. . They are following the possibility of a link to an angel who has been injured in this area. When Irwin finds them in the graveyard, he offers to help, only if they take him at least a thousand miles from here. We watched the quartet examine the feathers that the boy placed between the pages of his bible. Could Irwin be that angel? <br /> <br /> The closing sequence shows us all parts leaving the Northfork in different directions. The men in black riding their automobiles, perhaps going home to enjoy the newly acquired properties they were given as a reward. The mystic group is seen aboard an airplane and taking off to a higher place. We also realized that the child in Father Harlan, despite the remedies and care he received from the holy figure, died. <br /> <br /> Michael Polonês got one of the best performing sets of all directors. Nick Nolte, as Father Harlan does a discreet performance in his interpretation of this gentle man. James Woods, like Walter, one of the men working for the developer, does a good job. The biggest surprise is Duel Farmer, who makes an excellent impression as Irwin. This young actor, with the right guidance, shows a great promise. <br /> <br /> The mystical group is brilliantly represented by Daryl Hannah, Robin Sachs, Ben Foster and Anthony Edwards, the man with the funny glasses. Peter Coyote, Mark Polish, Ben Foster and the rest of the cast are impeccable under the Polish leadership. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the movie depends on its simplicity. The sight of the Polish will haunt someone's memory. Montana's images, as perhaps an unreal landscape, are one of the best things American films have had for a long time.
