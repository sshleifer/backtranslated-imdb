I've seen this movie for over 20 years and I still remember how much I loved it. really touched me, and I really enjoyed the cowardly work on him. highly recommended: atmospheric and moving. <br /> <br /> I think of this movie from time to time, and I am disappointed that it has not enjoyed so much of a renaissance as many classic films. had not realized until I searched today that he won an award from the Academy for Best Original Story by ben hecht and charles macarthur. <br /> <br /> basically involves an unpleasant character who destroys the career of another and is cursed because of it. he dies, but redemption is permitted if he can persuade someone to shed a tear over him. most films show it in pursuit of that goal. well written and charming. I knew him for his plays, so I was surprised to see him in that role on late night TV in New York. a must see if you ever had the opportunity.
