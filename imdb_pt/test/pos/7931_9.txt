Watching some of the sequences (err, the entire 1/3 of the film dedicated to the ice battle) in Alexander Nevsy, a film directed by Russian legend Sergei M. Eisenstein (co-directed by Dmitri Vasilyev in his only significant credit), made me realize how much it really should be directed, at least on a scale like that. If I were a member of a group of awards at the time of the release of this film, I would probably award Eisenstein the director of the year award, posthumously. It's such a crazy blow from cinematic genius to take some of the stuff out of the film, although for someone like this director after getting out of his best work - Battleship Potemkin and October - it could have been something he scoffed at first. But in the midst of a movie that is sometimes a bit frustrating with the way the little gray ones get to the subject black and white, it's still a celluloid wonder almost 70 years later. Lord of the Rings fans, meet the grandfather of the movies, so to speak. <br /> <br /> To say that something is advertising already puts a connotation on it, and is often bad. It is something that has a complete message and a point of view. It is still a matter of heated debate (see the swarms of discussions about Moore's films for proof), about whether great art can come out of something that is idle, intended to arouse the public in a specific way. In this particular case, the Russians against the Germans. At the time, it was approaching World War II and Russia once again faced the "German invaders," and it is interesting to note that Eisenstein was hired to make this film as a summoning for the Russians never to forget a crucial part of their history . The end result comes out as something that is actually a bit common to see Battleship and October, however; if nothing else happens in these films, Eisenstein is more concerned with how the image and content can attach finely to the viewer, this style can completely engage the viewer without fail. In these terms, Alexander Nevsky is fearless. <br /> <br /> But even with the whole idea of ​​'big Russia, bad Germans', there are some small moments when things get a bit less strict, a little less strict for these ideals. For example, when we first see the Germans in Privka, they are not a faceless band that is totally barbaric and has a blind intention of conquest (not that they are not willing to take what they can). They also have their own national pride, which would be nothing less for them to go ahead with whatever their Christian teachers told them. At a minimum, the evil of the photo has a face, however kept at a low minimum for the most prevalent side to kick in. There is also a brief scene, before the ice-scape battle, where the Russian troupe has a joke being counted and laughed, and added a little more depth where else there could be little. Because most of the times in Alexander Nevsky, with his battle songs charged with pride in war, there are no complexities for the characters, most notably Nevsky himself (played in an ultra-heroic way, only questioning almost at first) by Nikolai Cherkasov. which may have to be so in Eistenstein's intention to have it as the infallible force to be considered in the tale. After all, looking for naturalism in an Eisenstein film is like trying to find non-kosher pork feet in a delicatessen. <br /> <br /> But the real reason to see the picture is not the acting, however, but by the film's appearance, how it moves and assumes such an expansive environment that Eisenstein exposes. On the epic scale, it's as ambitious as its 1920s films, with lots of extras, not just in the main battle scenes, but also in the city scenes of the hundreds of people passing by. In fact, I would say that any director working in Hollywood or elsewhere, thinking of doing some kind of immense epic, particularly war, would do well to take a look at this movie, even with just the sound off. It is even better if thought of as a silent film, with the visual traits dramatically accentuated at times. One can spend a whole month analyzing the ice battle, as it begins with the distant German soldiers and then advancing like insects, and then as Eisenstein intersects the close-up of the fighting actors and then the large shots. and with accelerated editing. And, of course, one can not ignore the power of music, with Sergei Prokofiev presenting one of the great scores of any epic work. All the time the director's editing keeps our eyes moving along with this frantic action at breakneck speed. If this was only a short film, it would certainly look good with the big ones, like the sequel to Odessa Stairs. <br /> <br /> If I thought a little less than totally magnificent, it would be because of the flaws. which come from a director who is much more suited to the silent medium than to the sound. Although I have not yet seen Ivan the Terrible, my only negative criticism would be the direction of his actors, which is really as broad as possible, with the melodrama in such a loud and surprising tone. the soldiers competing for Olga are the best example I can think of). But even this considered, Alexander Nevsky is too extraordinary to be ignored, and increases engagement in action and film production to a level that puts a reference to films still today to try to live.
