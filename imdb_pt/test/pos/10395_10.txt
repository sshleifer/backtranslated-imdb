I was shocked by this movie. Afterwards, I did not even want to see any movies for long - any other movie would be so unsatisfying in comparison. <br /> <br /> For many, it may be the worst of Antonioni - very slow, without a conventional surrounding plot, microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions - and the worst of the Wenders - verbose and confused transcendentalism. It is composed of short and distinct episodes connected by the typical flow of consciousness of the winding hero of Wenders, so that it does not produce the temporary oblivion of the escapist cinema. <br /> <br /> But to the fans, the worst is the best and the one line of disjointed story is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film. Wenders and Antonioni create a speech among their segments that seeks the heart of things. <br /> <br />
