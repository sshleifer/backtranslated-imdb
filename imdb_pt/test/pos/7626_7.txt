I was 9 when I first saw this on TV. on a Friday night. I remember the full page ad in the TV guide with Rex's photo. incredible how some things stay on your mind after 30 years. Anyway, if you're a kid who likes monster movies, this is fun enough, especially with Boone and Keats fighting with each other. Special effects are not harryhausen but worth the hour and a half if you find it somewhere on the late night TV. I have not seen this for a few years, for some reason, these classics disappear from cable. If you catch it at dawn, do not be too critical, grab a few nibbles and enjoy. may be tacky, but I thought it was a lot better than the kong remake that came out in theaters a year earlier.
