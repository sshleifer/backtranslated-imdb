Please let me know of all versions of Precious Bane or Gone to Earth in video that people may be aware of. I love Mary Webb's books wholeheartedly and would be very grateful to have any information on VHS or DVD. <br /> <br /> I read Precious Bane and Gone to Earth, which are my favorites by Mary Webb, and often collected other novels by her as well. I was fortunate to have found the poetry and essays of "Springs of Joy," but I could never see the version of Precious Bane that was in the Masterpiece Theater or the full version of Gone to Earth, although there was an American movie. Classic aeration by The Wild Heart, which was a chopped version of the original Gone to Earth movie. <br /> <br /> If anyone can help me get copies of one or both of these movies (full versions), I would be very grateful!
