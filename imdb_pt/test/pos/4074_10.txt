I do not care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. The thing with this movie is that you can not expect anything other than having fun. This is not an intellectual comedy, this is a smart popcorn movie. The top three cast members are great and work really well with each other. Shatner is a standout cast in support as himself, a former TV cop, brought by Russo's character to train police officers on how to be "TV cops." Those are by far the funniest scenes. If you want to have fun and just sit back and laugh, then watch this movie.
