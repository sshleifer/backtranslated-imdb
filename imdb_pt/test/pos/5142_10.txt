If you read Carl Hiaasen's book, the film follows fairly true to form, with some minor changes to Hollywood. In my opinion, this is a great movie for the family. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko) very well steals the show from a star cast that includes Robert Wagner and Jimmy Buffet. The children of the film do a great job led by Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley. <br /> <br /> Brie Larson is perhaps a little too small to play Beatrice. I pictured an older girl, perhaps four feet tall, in the role of Beatrice. That might have made her more convincing in her role of beating Dana. They should have developed more of their "tough-girl" character, and have bitten her into a tire, or kick a soccer ball through a person. She is very beautiful, and I understand why she was chosen, she is a box office attraction. <br /> <br /> This is as PG as a movie nowadays, with no sex and very little violence. This film is a parents dream, a film with a strong environmental message, with children who deeply appreciate the beauty of Florida and its wildlife. It shows how adults have fallen short of managing our planet and what our children may demand better. One of my favorite lines in the movie is when Mullet Fingers says, "Florida can use some mountains like Montana. Florida is so flat that there's nothing to stop developers from cleaning it from coast to coast." In addition, Florida wildlife photography spoke volumes without dialogue. As a family movie with children between 5 and 15 years old, this is a great movie! As a bonus, parents will be entertained, especially if they are "parrotheads".
