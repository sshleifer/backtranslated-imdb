This film shows a serious side to the often thought fulci works. There is not much blood and courage here, but a tale about murder and the lives affected by it. <br /> <br /> A real find, considering it was made in 1972 and will soon celebrate its 30th anniversary. <Br /> <br /> Check this one out, but be warned it's hard to find! <br /> Ron
