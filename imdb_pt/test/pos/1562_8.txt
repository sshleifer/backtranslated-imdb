Judith Ivey as the old scamming prostitute is incredible. Emily Grace the young lady. It's innocent and exciting when she finds out what's going on. Excellent steering and camera. The story is dark and disturbing. The support cast is good. It shows what happens and can happen with a race of chance. Great independent movie. Little cast. The pace is slow at first and then moves well. A good movie to show your teenage daughter who has aspirations to leave home early, to the road and adventure. This film movie has a low budget to feel but works because of the low life and areas that these people move in. I will never stop a rest stop again without thinking of this movie and checking my tires before I go.
