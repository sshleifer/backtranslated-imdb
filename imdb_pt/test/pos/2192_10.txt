Not having seen the 1936 version of this story, I can not offer any comparison there. I can, however, say that Stephen Sondheim's musical treatment of this story is absolutely brilliant. Only Sondheim could produce music and lyrics that were stellar in their own right but perfectly suited to the very bizarre subject. If anyone needs an explanation of what a dark comedy is, they should see it (and "Dr. Strangelove" too). When Mrs. Lovett stops having the "worst pies in London" for a booming business with great acclaim, we're not talking about "Soylent Green", but the ingredients are similar. Particularly brilliant is the song in which Mrs. Lovett proposes her idea to Mr. Todd. Even in the introductory number, the line "... they went to their impeccably shaved Creator ..." gives a fine indication of the premise, drama and comedy that is to come. Exceptional!
