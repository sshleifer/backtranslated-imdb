What has to change in today's attitude towards movies like Boogie Nights is the approach. The approach is awful! Comparing it with Pulp Fiction, seeing only pornography and all its aspects ... come on people, there is more to this beautiful movie. And to all skeptics, did Paul Thomas Anderson prove to be worthy again and again? Magnolia is one of the main reasons why I watch American movies and I still have faith in this "industry" that film is today. What about Blood? This is a movie that will stay in movie history whether you like it or not! Yes, you! The consumer called .. you know one thing: F # * k you! You do not deserve this, you deserve nothing. So many artists today struggle to gain recognition and it has become increasingly difficult to make serious, even mainstream, movies because people just want to see celebrities doing stupid things ... like those that sell Britney Spears. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this was very painful for me because I do not want to see this, I do not want to believe that today all that matters is to add numbers ... sales revenue and sales return. I want to see magic, the magic that Fellini, Bergman and Kurosawa brought and created through the language of cinema. Because that's what the PTA is doing ... it's creating magic !!
