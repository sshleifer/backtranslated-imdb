I finally watched this shocking movie last night, and how disturbing that is, and incredibly bloody and some unforgettable scenes, and a total assault on the senses. It looks like a film from the minds of Lynch (specifically ERASERHEAD), Buttgereit and even a bit of "Begotten." What this guy does to his pregnant sister is unbelievable, but again, did this really happen or are the left and right sides of his brain doing battle? This is the main theme of this work of art, to draw a thin line between fantasy and reality, and what would happen if the right brain of dream and fantasy goes beyond reasoning and the logical left side. And the music in this movie is unbelievable, a kind of electronic score that is absolutely perfect. Even though this movie is totally shocking and quite disgusting in some of the more extreme scenes (including hard core sex) you'll see in any movie, I've seen it as a work of art, and I loved it. And this song still surprises me, I have to try to find the soundtrack if it is available. Watching "Subconscious Cruelty" is a real event, and it's not something the viewer will easily forget. And a note to gorehounds, that's a must-have. <br /> <br /> Warning ... Be careful while buying this movie because some prints have blurred over the scenes of graphic sex and extreme gore, especially copies of the Japanese Release.
