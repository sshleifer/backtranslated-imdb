The Kid is a very good family film about a sultry picture consultant, Russ Duritz, who has a lot of money, a good job, a good house, and so on. The only problem is that he does not have a social life as great as no one seems like him, as he is not always very cool. One day though, things are about to change when an eight-year version of it magically appears. That gives Russ a second chance to get things right. Bruce Willis plays the lead role here and he gives a great performance. The Kid is a good movie for everyone.
