Square really did get this. They did not try to please everyone and focused exclusively on Final Fantasy 7 fans. And kid, you'll be happy fans when they see this movie! The story may not be so interesting or credible, but it fits perfectly into the story of the game and has several funny honest times to God !! A total surprise and a welcome too <br /> <br /> There are many funny appearances and references to the game as well. And most important of all: the fight scenes rock so hard they could cut the diamond! They really are the total awesomeness and would have made the movie worth it, even if all else sucked. I mean, they are some of the best ever created PERIOD. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. Goodbye. <br /> <br /> PS: I know my comment sounds like the delusions of a teenager. It was totally what I intended.
