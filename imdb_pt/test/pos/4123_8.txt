This cinematic biography of rock star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The highlights of the film are Busey's stage performances, where he plays guitar and sings Holly's songs. It brings this energy into the performances that Holly's own films almost pale in comparison. Busey's infectious smile illuminates the screen, he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for best actor was well-deserved. <br /> <br /> The film follows Holly's growing career in Lubbock, Texas, for stardom and New York and her untimely death in a plane crash. One thing I found interesting, if true, was Buddy's ambition - he had grand plans to go beyond recording and performance to production. As young as him, he was already establishing himself as a cunning businessman and definitely wanted to take things to a higher level. We will never know if it would have finally catapulted your initial success into a business brand like The Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The lyrics to many of Holly's songs are pretty teenage; read the lyrics of "Peggy Sue" or "Oh Boy!" and you'll see what I mean. Perhaps to a large extent this accounts for its popularity with teen audiences, but its instrumentation and stage performances certainly explain its influence in the following groups - both the Rolling Stones and The Beatles have recognized its importance. <br /> <br /> Clearly some freedoms were taken for dramatic effect. For example, I doubt that Holly punched in Nashville or that the audience at New York's Apollo Theater reacted at once to the point where they danced wildly in the hallways. If you're interested in getting close to the truth, check out the documentary "The Real Buddy Holly Story" (1985) which is produced and presented by Paul McCartney, a very relaxed and engaging musician. This contains interviews with Holly's family, friends and bandmates (Holly's musical brothers are not even mentioned in "The Buddy Holly Story"). Members of other bands like Keith Richards and Don Everly also offer reviews and stories and there are images of the old Holly presentations. McCartney's production may stand on its own, but it does a great supporting piece for "The Buddy Holly Story" and maybe it should be seen for anyone watching the fictional story.
