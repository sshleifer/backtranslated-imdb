This film is an almost forgotten gem of 1979 that, although in essence a comedy, was based on one of the largest bank robberies in the UK. In fact, one of the titles that this film is known for includes "caper", therefore, which in itself is an indication of the type of movie. A bunch of adorable redheads, who are not violent or psychotic type, who with a bite and bite perform the greatest work of their lives. To be honest, I do not really know much about the actual crime and can not comment on whether it accurately portrayed the events that unfolded or the characters involved. <br /> Richard Jordan behaves very well playing PINKY Green and is very believable as a thug who was born American and who seems very comfortable with himself. I have to add that sometimes American actors fight very well with English actors in a British film, chemistry is not always there, however, that's no problem for Jordon, who fits well in his role. <br /> <br /> It is noteworthy that Jordan himself was probably one of the most underrated actors of the 1970s and 1980s and never got the recognition he deserved. He seemed to be stuck in supporting roles and B movies, not a fair representation of his acting ability. He played a corrupt cop in THE FRIENDS OF EDDY COYLE, a sadistic murderer in THE MEAN SEASON. In THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS, he played a kind of comic character by Gordon Gehco and also in the 1980 TV program EQUALIZER, played a good boy. All this shows the versatility of his acting skills, while mixing with names like David Niven, Kurt Russell, Edward Woodward and Robert Mitcham. <br /> <br /> In this film, he effortlessly plays his role as bandit. the eye for the ladies and you immediately take to his character and cheer for him from the beginning. Can not you stop liking Green? ??? you see that he really wanted to go straight, but once blackmailing it all seemed like too much of an opportunity to pass up and in the end he loved the thought of all that money. <br /> <br /> David Niven is the boss and Shoot, the police inspector was brilliantly played by Richard Johnson, who usually portrayed a London but meticulous detective who clearly loves his job. The other supporting cast does not say much, but looking at them were all very well known actors of British characters who have often found themselves playing villains or cops (not ironic). Elkie Sommers, Oliver Tobias do what they have to do and it is good to see Gloria Graham in a special participation. <br /> <br /> For some spectators, particularly Americans, it would seem ridiculous that anyone with Greens could get a maintenance job. Of all things a bank and come and go when he wants. Moreover, the feat he made at the Crown court after the sentence was not as improbable as it might seem, in the 1960s and 1970s security was not as tight as it is now. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, there are some interesting observations. With little time bandits, the distance was too much. There have been other films where this occurs too, ie the BRINKS MAT. It's not just the discarding or concealment of the loot, but with so many people involved, someone will be careless, will scream or just break once. In addition, authorities suffer greatly from local rouges when such a large theft is carried out. In addition, they say that there is no honor among thieves, but Ivan was adamant that PINKY got his blow. You had only looked too much into your look in the dock, if looks could kill, a look of total betrayal! How could he have them all after taking care of him? You have to ask yourself a question: why can bad guys be so stupid? Did Green really think he could talk to him the second time? Inspector Watford was not fooled by his innocent face, nor by a well-constructed alibi, the whole stink stinks of inner work. Also, you have to wonder why they leave so many clues? A notepad with safe numbers written down, travel brochures for overseas travel, still leaving your telescope around as well as unusual behavior on the day of the robbery that was out of character. With some decent, but common-sense police work Insp Watford quickly took the Green measure, picked it up and soon made him sing like a canary. It just shows how, despite well thought out planning, things can unfold very quickly, there is never a clean haven for every body, some will always be caught. Although it is worth noting that much of the money has never been recovered. <br /> <br /> In the end, a fun movie, interesting photos from London and England in the late 70's, well paced, with a great ending. I recommend this particularly if you like capers. (Note: I recently bought a DVD of this, but the transfer was obviously taken from a VHS tape and is of poor quality. So do not pay too much for it!)
