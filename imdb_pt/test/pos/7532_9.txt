Writing about something so wonderful is quite difficult. In fact, it is almost impossible to describe the peculiarities of this film. This is a wonderful story about sex and gender, and it's almost unbelievable that we do not have to deal with obscene sex scenes. Feeling, this movie was made for people who like to feel and feel life in all its complexity in a simple and beautiful way. We look at this, and something begins to grow within our minds, even in our hearts: it is a pure poem. I've watched some gay movies, and I've often been really dissatisfied with unnecessary sex scenes, not because I do not like sex scenes, but usually they are so pornographic that I'm forced to think that the director or the producers or the writer think that homosexuality means perversion. Nagisa no Shindobaddo is totally different from those. Three are the main characters. We have Ito, Yoshida and Aihara, two boys and a girl in a peculiar love triangle. Ito likes his best friend Yoshida, Yoshida likes Aihara and Aihara likes Ito. Imagine what this could turn into unprepared hands? But on the contrary, Hashiguchi makes a magnificent story that goes deep into the philosophy of life, adding a question in our mind that made me think, surprised, at the end of the movie: Why? And this is because I have expanded on several issues within my brain and inside my heart. The scenes, in fact, sometimes tend to be boring, are moments of the most delightful poem we can feel, but utterly unable to write in words. And maybe because of that, we are unable to understand the issue at the end of the movie. I'm sure that this film was not made to discuss each piece of it? Some people want to understand a movie almost dissecting this. Others are so accustomed to ordinary "American gay" movies that they can not appreciate the real value of this masterpiece. Watch, close your eyes on the credits and feel, everything, feel, feel the wonderful music. For all this and much, much more, I give a nine. And I just do not give ten, because ten out of ten is perfection. But I confess I almost did it.
