Very funny stuff. Charlie was still working to his peak when he did this a little bold short on soldiers in the trenches of World War One. Bold because, after all, the war was still going on and it was a comedy about serious business. <br /> <br /> Jokes are fun without being hilarious or shaken. One successful scene follows another, when Chaplin and his comrades try to sleep in a bunker that is in the water to the knees. (That's where we have the term "trench foot".) Probably Chaplin's most ridiculous episode was disguised as a tree and frustrating any number of German soldiers as they attempted to execute an allied soldier trapped behind the lines. Edna Purviance, Chaplin's main contractor at the time, is a woman who cooperates with the Americans and is saved from execution as well. Chaplin would continue to make things funnier and more ambitious, but that is better than most. of your shorts during this initial period.
