Mute Witness is a modest but very solid thriller that has never received the attention or the good reviews it deserves. The film ?? written and directed entirely by Anthony Waller? is a thriller full of action, with aspects of black comedy and influences of terror. No absurd or endless tangle, just straight to the point of mystery. Mute Witness deals with the vicious theme of "snuff" movies and is effectively defined in Russia. *** SPOILERS *** As production costs are cheaper, a US film crew moves temporarily to Russia for filming a horror film. An old hangar is used as a filming location. The team's makeup artist accidentally gets locked up at night and while trying to find a way out, she witnesses the recordings of an authentic snuff film! She is caught and tries to escape, but as she is mute, she can not cry for help and also can not explain what she saw to the police properly. The girl's life is in real danger now, since there is a whole net hidden behind these snuff productions and they do not want the witnesses to be alive ?? *** Ending Spoilers ***. Mute Witness contains several highly exciting action sequences and is quite bloody. Some of the mysterious clues are effectively kept secret until the end. In regards to the similar topic, I would say that it is definitely better than the more famous '8 mm', directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Nicolas Cage. The acting in Mute Witness is not good, but the main actress (who is Russian) looks really cute. Sir Alec Guinness also makes a special appearance. And very cool, I can say. Certainly recommended with guaranteed fun and scares.
