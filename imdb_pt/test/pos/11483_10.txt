I saw Linda, and it's a high-rate movie! The lives of Paul and his wife, Linda, whom he adored as a young man and finally married. They meet another couple, Jeff and Stella, and the four become very good friends. But, their friendship takes a Twisted Turn after spending the holidays together at Varona Beach .... A Twist that never returns couples to their old status as friends. <br /> <br /> Linda is a must-see !!! ! Virginia Madsen's performance is acceptable; however, Richard Thomas steals the film with his incredible acting ... and the emotions he displays. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie! "Lotta Honey"
