Darling Lili is fantastic! It's by far one of my favorite movies! He certainly did not deserve the poor comments he received. Julie Andrews, playing the title role of Lili Smith (Schmidt), is the best part of the entire film. She is fascinating and spectacular! As Julie Andrews is my most favorite actress and singer by far, I was definitely not surprised by how stunning she is. This movie is simply ... great (I'm running out of adjectives!), It's magnificent, wonderful, amazing, funny, terribly romantic, sad and a total thrill and all thanks to Dame Julie Andrews! for her husband, director Blake Edwards. Oh yeah Rock Hudson was ok too :) Julie Andrews is the beautiful and beloved singer, Lili Smith. Rock Hudson plays Major Larabee, who quickly falls in love with Lili, and she with him. But their case was not coincidental. There the meeting was planned by the German government (I'm not sure if that's exactly what you would call them, but you got it), because the lively singer Lili is actually a German spy. Lili is told to seduce Major LArabee in order to obtain information about the new Top Secret Opertaion (later known as "Crepe Suzette"). Although Lili is on a solemn mission, she falls in love with Bill (Major Larabee), making her original mission challenging. But Lili pulls and completes the task, after she discovers something that is not really true about Bill. The end will not be said by me as it is wonderfully explained. If anything, you will really like this movie, I certainly did !!!!!!!! <br /> <br />
