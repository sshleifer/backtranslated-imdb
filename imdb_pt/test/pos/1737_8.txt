It was in September 2003 that I heard that the BBC would resurrect DOCTOR WHO and make it "Bigger and better," but I had heard these rumors in the press and thought that was all they were - Rumors. But it was then mentioned that Russell T Davies would produce and write the program executively and then on a Saturday afternoon in March 2004, Channel 4 news interviewed the actor in the lead role - Christopher Eccleston. Yes that Christopher Eccleston, an actor I've always been impressed since watching his movie premiere in Let him have it and if he was being interviewed on television, must have been true. As the months went by, more and more information leaked, Billie Piper was being climbed, the Daleks would return, and The Mill, the Hollywood effects company that made FX for GLADIATOR, was hired to do the special effects for the show. For several weeks before the first broadcast trailers announced the return of the new series, huge billboards in London informed the public about the return of the show, tabloids brought huge photos of the aliens and Christopher Eccleston appeared in programs as diverse as BLUE PETER, MASTERMIND (WHO HAD A SPECIAL DOCTOR, WHO'S NIGHT EDITION), THIS MORNING AND FRIDAY NIGHT WITH JOHNATHAN ROSS. In fact, this new series of DOCTORS, which must have been the hottest show in the history of British television, had better be very good. <br /> <br /> So, was it really good? Undoubtedly, it has been a great success with almost every episode doing the top ten shows on the TV charts. To give you a clue as to the success of your rating, only one episode (The Ark In Space, episode 2 of February 1975) of the previous series made it to the top 5 of the TV charts. The opening episode episode made it number three, with two more episodes hitting or equaling the previous record and that's in a time where there's a lot more competition in terms of TV stations and choice. Let us laugh and applaud the fact that the DOCTOR filled me with BABY MY TIME, the CELEBRITY COMMEMORATION and flagellated the ANT AND the DEC'S of NIGHT TAKEAWAY. Of course much of the success is due to the breathtaking look and cast of a well-known actor in the role. Most of the time, everything you see onscreen here is just like anything you'll see in a Spielberg / Hollywood movie. There is a Dalek invasion force that totals tens of thousands, exotic aliens, a 19th century Cardiff that looks like a 19th century Cardiff and nightly footage that are actually nightly footage and are not made by placing a dark filter on the screen . I promise you will hear a lot more from the directors who worked on this series, Joe Ahearne especially one day will be on the Hollywood list. There are some flaws in the new series of DOCTORS and they all must be placed at the door of Russell T. Davies. It may be controversial whether the novel and the postmodernist elements are successful or not (in my opinion they are not), but what is not in dispute is that the weaker scripts are all written by RTD. As I mentioned in my review of CASANOVA he deceives the public and he does the same thing here: when confronted by armed soldiers pointing their guns at him, the Doctor shouts "delta attack plan" that makes no sense to anyone in the audience, but allows him to escape from a tight spot, a naked captain, Jack suddenly pulls a laser he's hiding and the RTD scripts are full of such cheats and terminations of deus ex machina type. In fact, the final episode is greatly spoiled by the ridiculous concept that the "bad wolf" is that it seems to have taken RTD from a point tighter than the doctor. And from the end I'm trying to remember if any of them really went to the doctor? More often than a supporting character or the doctor's companion who saves the day. The show is called DOCTOR who does not ROSE TYLER, so we can see the title character save the day please, just like he did in the classic series? One last point about the Doctor's portrait is the way he is written as a smiling loon. Eccleston is best known for his serious and sombre roles and he is absolutely breathtaking in scenes when he is showing pain, as the tear trickles down his face at the End of the World but more often he is written as a "Tom Baker in the speed "character. It's obvious that Eccleston did not do much comedy in his career - he's not very good at it. <br /> <br /> I'm starting to look like I hate this show? Sorry I did not want to, but it's just that while some anticipations have been met or surpassed, others have not, and they are almost all in the place of Russell T Davies, who is fortunately contributing less in the form of scripts in the upcoming series of DOCTOR WHO. Let's see more traditional stories of a human post being threatened by monsters as we saw in the 60s and 70s, imagine a story like The Sea Devils with a huge budget run by Joe Ahearne! Oh, and one last request - Can we see these "NEXT TIME" trailers discarded? They reveal all the best parts of next week's episode
