Ok, so this movie is not very well known and was not very well publicized. I discovered this reasonably brutal gangster that was a good full accident movie on one of the Skys million movie channels at the end of a boring night but I'm happy. The opening sequence for this movie is fantastically comical in a very somber way. This, in fact, defines what I think is the overall tone of the film. I think many critics and movie fans who actually saw this movie were a bit unfair to just write it as a low-budget gangster movie at the Reservoir Dogs vein.OK, so there are undeniable similarities between Thursday and some other crime genre movies that have been compared, but in all fairness, I think this film takes a much darker look at comics for this type of movie, and the end result is a captivating, well done, funny movie, if not totally original.Tom Jane is good at it, and deserves the recognition he will hope to get thanks to The Punisher.His performance as the thug who got well is realistic, funny and just cold enough to make you believe that Casey really was an idiot before he retired. It's another thing that makes this movie stand out for me, the characters. In the Nicks gang you get the strangest trio of criminals ever assembled, a gentle, charismatic but very cold (Nick) leader, a happy trigger loving a woman's sexually predatory bitch (Dallas) and a psycho hill billy with brains with a propensity for torture (Billy Hill). Enter the most bizarre police detective ever seen on the screen, beautifully played by Mickey Rourke, and you have a recipe for ... well for Thursday. Sometimes it is darkly comical, sometimes brutal, sometimes unoriginal, but always captivating and worth seeing.8 / 10
