This film should be seen by as many people as possible as it focuses on human rights issues in Burma. When I first watched this movie in the mid-1990s, it totally changed my life. I knew very little about Aung San Suu Kyi or his democratic movement. It affected me, so I wanted to understand more about the situation. Any movie that has the power to make you want to learn more has done its job properly. Patricia Arquette is superb as the American lady who, due to a personal tragedy, has become reckless with the decisions of her own life and is involved in the ensuing conflict. It's a powerful film on a subject that deserves more publicity. As the film itself says, the 1988 massacre of pro-democracy activists was not televised and therefore went largely unnoticed to the world. I beg all of you to read these comments to find out more about the current situation of the Burmese people. <br /> <br /> It was time for the movie to be released on DVD. Can anything be done?
