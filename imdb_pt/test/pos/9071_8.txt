Surprisingly clever thriller about five medical students who prepared to be resurrected to share their experiences of death and what is beyond. Joel Schumacher drives with some skill - creating some very strange as well as particularly beautiful scenes. The visions of death are not what viewers can expect, nor is it what awaits us when we go - thanks to screenwriter Peter Filardi, who really did an excellent job inventing this story. Although the creativity of the story is impressive, the story also has many holes, particularly in the department of logic and credibility factors. Despite all of this, Flatliners is a good movie because of effective script, direction that again is very surreal at times, and the acting that brings four very talented actors and William Baldwin together. This core of actors acts and reacts very well to each other. Keifer Sutherland does a very impressive job as head of the group - the one who comes up with the idea of ​​dying and being born again. He can also portray a man - a young man - with a damaging and destructive secret from his past. Kevin Bacon is good as the most pragmatic and skeptical of the group. Oliver Platt is really good as the voice of human reason and fears. Platt has some really good lines and performs paranoia well. Yes, Julia Roberts is here too, and very well. the actors do better by playing with each other and making us believe they are good friends. I was quite impressed with most Flatliners, but more than anything else that story affected me the most. The scene with that dog limping around the street, only one of those powerful images evoked how many of the flashback scenes were.
