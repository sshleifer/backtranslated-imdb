When this movie was released in 1995, I found it incredibly great. Especially with Sandra Bullock. After watching her brilliant performance at Speed, I was ready to enjoy any of her movies. <br /> <br /> Back on the Net, it was a movie that keeps you on hold. All in all, I liked it, so I give a fucking whore.
