*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** I loved the set-up and always laughs throughout the movie. The performance was great, with my favorite part being Howard's attempt (Kevin Kline) to be a "manly man". The groom and parents did a great job as a support cast. Spoiler Warning: The acting of your conservative family's acceptance and attempts to be educated were comforting and believable. My only problem with the ending was the fact that Howard was actually gay. The movie is defined as "whoever you want to be," but the movie actually does the opposite. Howard's logic behind his "discovery" is the fact that he loves the Barbra Streisand movies and enjoys dancing to music. His mannerisms and tastes seem to be cheerful, and it is not until he is pointed out to him that he realizes it. Instead of freeing Howard, the pigeon bores him. Oh, he likes to dance to music, so he must be gay. His confession in marriage seemed a tilt to the desires of society. In the end, the movie becomes a gay rights film, which was not the original course. It almost becomes bland with the rest. I think the film would have been better if Howard had been direct. It would have been truer to the message.
