The beautiful song with the same name as the movie won the Oscar for best music in 1955. <br /> <br /> Love is a splendor. <br /> <br /> It's the April rose that only grows in early spring. <br /> <br /> Love is the natural way of giving a reason to live. <br /> <br /> That golden crown that makes man a king. <br /> <br /> Once on a high, windy hill <br /> <br /> In the morning mist two lovers kissed and the world stopped. <br /> <br /> Then his fingers touched my silent heart and taught how to sing. <br /> <br /> Yes, true love, a very splendorous thing. <br /> <br /> How can we forget such beautiful music? Henry King, the director, had the privilege of working with Jennifer Jones twice that year for this film and for the movie "Good Morning, Miss Dove." Jones was nominated for "Splendored Thing," but she could have been easily nominated for Miss Dove as well. <br /> <br /> William Holden is great as the war correspondent sent to inform about the communist revolution in 1949 in China. His love for Jones, an Oriental doctor, was captivating and so memorable to watch. <br /> <br /> Although the ending is not pleasant, this is still one of the greatest novels ever shown on screen.
