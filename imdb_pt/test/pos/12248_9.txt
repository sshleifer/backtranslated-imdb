I did not really like "As Good As It Gets," but I'm a big fan of the work of William Hurt and Holly Hunter, so I decided to watch this movie. And the most amazing thing for me was Albert Brooks' excellent work. Here in Spain he is little known and only as a 2nd division version of Woody Allen on the West Coast. He played a major role, but Hunter and Hurt were also good, especially Hurt, in a relatively unusual role for him. Hunter played the role that reminds me a little of his role in "Once Around" (Lasse Hallstrom, 1991). <br /> <br /> Finally, the rest of the cast is great too. Robert Prosky, one of those familiar faces in American cinema, ex-girl Lois Chiles, very well placed in that role, I think, the always perfect Joan Cusack in her early years; and especially the brief appearance of Jack Nicholson. Maybe he does not have a good scene, but it's Jack Nicholson anyway ... James L.Brooks Best Picture, great story (well resolved) and excellent cast for one of the best films of the 80s.
