Please be aware that this movie has nothing to do with Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist: Music Hall ... I know what is and is not associated with the New York location. Theodore is just the Music Hall. No Rockettes are in the movie. Just wonderful ice skaters, plus great actors and fun. I just thought you'd like to know. Truly a wonderful movie. You will never guess who the 'killer' is while watching this movie ... until the end. What a superb plot and beautiful ice skating. You never see this kind of performance. The Roxy Theater and Center Theaters, in New York City, have had ice skating on stage!
