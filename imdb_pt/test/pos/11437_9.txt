This is a nice movie. It's very realistic for the "wonderful world of music" I've been there and done it. It shows a human element in each character and the realism that no one is perfect. These amateur musicians were not that bad. The character of Cleavon Little, Marshall Tucker, was played very well. Marshall was not a saint himself. Here he was getting paid to do a job and he's giving these guys a hard time about everything in the van on the way there. You do not bite the hands that feed you. I find it hard to believe that a player with the jazz experience he has, claims he does not know any of the dixieland songs. He has a tremendous sense of predicting chord changes in songs he does not know. It is not common, but it is not unheard of. He delivers a true and hard message at the end of the film when he tells the clarinettist: "It's not a religion, devotion is not enough." At that level, he is correct, although I think the clarinetist could have dealt with the work. He was practicing his butt and vocal accompaniment music is not that hard to read. Very nice movie.
