'Traffik', despite its title, is not really about drugs. In the best tradition of the British television drama, 'Traffik' analyzes and values ​​its ostensible subject, which is not a mythical scourge, but a matrix or process with identifiable, social, economic, and historical roots, causes and effects. There is something almost scientific about the way the film draws four sets of characters from globally and spectacularly separate backgrounds - a poppy forced into the Pakistani underworld by poverty and cynical government; the former Olympian swimmer of a drug baron, on trial for trafficking; two shabby German policemen whose determination to condemn the latter comes as much from class wrath as from any faith in the law; and a junior pastor Tory whose daughter Cambridge student became addicted. "Traffik" is without didactic remorse - of the first scenes of Jack Lithgow in Pakistan, investigating the government's success in eliminating drugs before sanctioning more British aid, we are bombarded with facts about the problem. But these 'facts' come from a variety of sources - disguising government representatives; left-wing lawyers with an interest (ideological and domestic) invested in corruption; poor farmers who need to grow poppies to survive. Facts, usually reassuring markers on a map, are clearly not enough - the more facts we have, the less manageable the situation seems. It is not until Jack, the moral center of the film, the man who connects all the narrative threads, actually travels to the heart of the darkness of drugs, learns to get rid of hypocrisy (deploring drug use but refusing to put serious money to tackle the problem and create the conditions through various free-market initiatives where drug trafficking flourishes, just as the anti-heroes of the old gangster movies were actually American capitalist model, traffickers are the ideal being adopted by Thatcher and Reagan) that at least the reality of the problem can be recognized. <br /> <br /> Like I said, 'Traffik' is not really about drugs. As Jack finally acknowledges, after being fired as Tory Minister, drugs are not really the problem. It is a society dismantled by a woman who said that there was none of this (as proven by Jack's non-existent family life), systematically depriving the vast majority of people of hope and happiness, and more and more people turned to the drugs. <br /> <br /> What is more frightening in 'Traffik' are not graphical and narcotic representations of drug abuse (the technical detail of this ironically reflects the presentation of more factual, 'legitimate' or verbal information), but the dystopian vision of a Britain stripped of any joy, beauty or community, an arid terrain of abandoned dwellings and soulless modernity, a society of defeaters ready for smugglers and Thatcherist barons to trade their trade. <br /> <br /> This is not just a contemporary British story - it records the decline of an Empire based on reduced trade to illicit drug trafficking. It is certainly significant that the other sites of the program are Germany and Pakistan, crucial agents in the decline of the Empire. Here the ancient imperial amorality returns home, previously enslaved victims, their bodies abused by the power of their masters, returning to Imperial Center, London, the seeds of their decline literally carried on their bodies, incorporating the fears of all those backward . Gothic novels of the 19th century. 'Traffik' is one of the great achievements of British TV, and is in many ways superior to the recent remake of Hollywood. The political focus is obviously sharper - Jack's decline is far more effective than Wakefield's because he, as an agent of government policy, and a bad father, is part of the problem, while the only political failure of the American is the complacency. In almost all cases, the characterization is more rigorous and much more plausible (compare Helen of steel by Lindsay Duncan, already bitten by experience and failure, and her laughably shallow counterpart). Unlike the dubious racial tendency of 'Traffic' (making Mexico obscure and the Other, the ultimate terror of the WASP is sex with a black man), the portrait of Pakistan is rich and tragic, with bewildering arguments about drug protection punctuated by scenes of violent violence. All the time, the inextricable connection of public and private is expert. Visually, the film is incredibly inventive without ever being flamboyant or "cinematic" - especially in the last episode, where buildings and decor seem to move as the system closes. If "Traffik", as his remake, feels the need for fragments of the shore, then the prevailing sense of waste and loss is much more blunt, Jack's speech, bitterly desperate.
