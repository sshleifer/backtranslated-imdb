I watched this movie thinking it would be absolutely horrible and was ready for all the greed, bad effects, etc. But I was pleasantly surprised. Not that it's the best vampire movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly not the worst. I liked all the alternative reality / dream state that played in the movie. The graphics were very good for a straightforward DVD movie and I liked the overall look of the movie. I liked the main character Sai. I usually end up hating women, but there was something about her that kept me interested. Yes, she makes some bad decisions, but that was to be expected. Yes, the other characters were stereotyped, but I also expected that. I do not know if I recommend this movie, but give it a try and you may be pleasantly surprised. I'm putting this on my list of guilty pleasures.
