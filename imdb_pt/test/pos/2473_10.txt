I can not believe I missed this one. Made in 1970, with a budget that would probably allow you to make an indifferent episode of a TV soap, that's 90 minutes of support, like a knife film. You will find the outline, plot etc somewhere else on this site. Consider that the whole thing was filmed using a single 16mm handheld camera ... the whole dialogue is improvised ... none of the "actors" appeared in front of a camera before ... Sounds like a recipe for disaster. Instead, what we have are hippies v cops running through the California desert, which evolves into a "this is not fair". I'm in the person's scenario. The only problem is that the director continues to make you change your loyalty and, at the end of 90 minutes, we still are not sure who has one. Brilliant ... Very bright.
