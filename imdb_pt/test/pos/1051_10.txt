"Christmas In Connecticut" is a gem of a classic Christmas movie. Although less known than a few others - it is nevertheless a delightful way to spend a night on vacation time. I watch it every year. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is perfectly chosen as Elizabeth Lane, the only career girl. Long before being popular, Stanwyck incorporates the single girl on the rise. Your apartment in New York and your friendly restaurateur "Uncle" on the corner typify the single girl in town. She still does not know how to cook and writes a column about home to a magazine! <br /> <br /> Dennis Morgan is also perfectly cast as our wartime hero, Jefferson Jones, who wants to meet the incredible Elizabeth Lane. After being lost at sea, all he wants is to spend Christmas in a "real" house. It defines the delightful and crazy story that evolves. It's fun from start to finish. We should all have an Uncle Felix too!
