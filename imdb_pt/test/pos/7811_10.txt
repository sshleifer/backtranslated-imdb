This movie deserves to be one of the best Hindi comedies of all time. Rajkumar Santoshi is known mostly for his tough social dramas, but this is easily the easiest movie he has done. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around two small-town clowns Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan) They want to get rich quickly and thus move to the big city. They plan the same plan separately - to attract a rich heiress, Raveena (Raveena Tandon), who is the daughter of a wealthy businessman, Ramgopal Bajaj (Paresh Rawal). Thus, the one who marries Raveena lays hands on all his wealth. but when they know each other's plan, there is an intense dispute over a single government over who marries Raveena. Hilarious jokes and situations happen as the battle continues. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the identical twin brother of Ramgopal Bajaj, Shyamgopal Bajaj, wants to eliminate his brother and his niece and usurp the fortune of the family. Add to that a variety of funny characters, including Karishma (Karishma Kapoor), an error-prone butler named Robert (Vijoo Khote), a manager named Bhalla (Shehzad Khan) who imitates the villain Ajeet and a funny Gogo (Shakti) gangster. Kapoor) who looks more like a pirate and a funny comedy awaits you. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time looking for LOGIC in the film. Let the company of your brains and just ENJOY. The actors are very in sync with the script so there is no room for mistakes. Dialogues (Rajkumar Santoshi, Dilip Shukla) are witty. Music (Tushar Bhatia) and lyrics (Majrooh Sultanpuri) are memorable. The picturization and choreography (Saroj Khan) of "Yeh Raat Aur Yeh Doori", "Ae Lo Ji Sanam" and "Dil Karta Hai Tere Paas Aaoon" are appropriate and will remain etched in my mind forever. <br /> <br /> The movie starred two superstars in formation, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan (they ended up becoming superstar superstars). Aamir Khan is flawless in her first full-length comedy role. I welcome your sense of comic timing. Salman pales in comparison to Aamir, but he's still nice. Among the supporting characters, Paresh Rawal excels in his double role of Ramgopal and Shyamgopal. <br /> <br /> The film surprisingly failed at the box office. I can not understand why. I recommend it to everyone, however.
