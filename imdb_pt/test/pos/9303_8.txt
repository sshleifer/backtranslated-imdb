I find it remarkable that so little has been done with the history of the atomic bomb and its development for decades after the Manhattan Project was completed. My suspicion is that this was due to serious fears in the film and entertainment industries (in the 1950s to the 1970s) with "McCarthyism" and related national security phobias (including the Hollywood blacklist). There was a movie in the 1950s (with Robert Taylor) about Colonel Paul Tibbits, who piloted Enola Gay in the Hiroshima bombing, but nothing more. One can look at a parallel tragedy (the Indianapolis shipwreck in the United States soon after the Tinian bombs were delivered) in Robert Shaw's description of shark attacks on survivors at JAWS. But the actual trials and tribulations of Groves, Oppenheimer, and his team were not considered capable of filming. <br /> <br /> And then, in 1989, two movies appeared. I've already reviewed one (DAY ONE) that I feel is the best of the two in discussing the long technical and emotional and political issues in the Manhattan Project. The performance of Brian Dennehy as General Groves and David Strahairn as Oppenheimer was exquisite and perfectly balanced. Small vignettes about Szilard's anti-bomb crusade (Michael Tucker) help fill the story well. <br /> <br /> That's the problem here. Paul Newman is a great actor (as is the case with Dennehy), but Newman approached Groves in a different way, which, though not terrible, is smaller than Dennehy's military intelligence. Newman seems very surprised that the gun is the greatest baton to face the other boys in the yard after school. Yes, it certainly was, but the real Groves would have been more like Dennehy keeping his mind not on that great toy of the future, but on the business of creating that great toy. <br /> <br /> Dwight Schultz's performance as Oppeheimer helps maintain the film's basically interesting and good production, aided by Bonnie Bedelia as his wife. But the most interesting aspect of this film is the update of the two tragedies of Daghlian and Slotin, in particular the second, in the character of Merriman, John Cusack. Inevitably, in all technological advances, people are dead. It's just that these two tragedies (on top of the tens of thousands that were lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki) brought home the dangers of the new power unleashed, even in a controlled and peaceful experiment. The two tragedies (particularly Louis Slotin's slow and agonizing death from radiation poisoning) showed how much care was needed to use atomic power - and how the basest chances could still cause a disaster. The really different thing I saw in Cusack's performance (and in the script) and the actual incident with Slotin was that Slotin actually took some time after the accident to find out where all his fellow investigators were when they were hit by the accident radiation was able to show that it alone obtained the full effect of the accidental explosion, so that only a relatively minor treatment would be necessary for the others). Perhaps the full story of Slotin's actions was too technical for the screen, but given the enormous pain he suffered in the end, he took some time off to think of others, showing that he was indeed a first-class person.
