I watched Asterix and Obelix in Operation Cleopatra, which was my first exposure to the live-action version of the classic comics. Like the comic books, the whole movie is full of punch-based jokes, anachronistic jokes and jokes that rarely fall. <br /> Asterix and Obelix are Gauls who use a potion of strength to fight against the Roman legions in their home country. Gaul. Here they end up in Egypt helping a friend build Caesar's palace (yes, it's insignificant) in three months to prove that the Egyptians are as good as the Romans. <br /> <br /> The reason I picked it up was because Monica Belluci is Cleopatra. She's good, but the role is little more than a tip. However, even though she's rarely in the movie, I do not care, since she's so smart and the jokes are so funny that I was hysterical. I loved. I loved it so much that I can not understand why the movies were never released in the United States. <br /> <br /> The Import DVD has the movie in English, which is very good, especially when you consider it. when you watch the longer French version, puns (and therefore jokes) are not always apparent since they are auditory, so if you read the wrong names, the jokes will be lost. Most of the jokes between the full French version and the shorter English version seem to be exactly the same, although some have been modified sometimes for better and some for worse. Personally I'll stick with the dub when I watch it again, since it's easier to pick up the jokes and enjoy the humor. <br /> <br /> You really wanna see this if you love puns and low brow, but clever humor This is a great comedy
