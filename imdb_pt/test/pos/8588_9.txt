Firstly, it is interesting to note that one of the users here who commented on this film (from Belgium) had to add that Lumumba was "communist". If this user actually watched the movie, the message was that he was not a communist, but labeled as no one more than Belgium, US, UN, etc.) as a "communist" leader for other individuals, corporations and countries. economic and political gains. Even if one decides to accept that the film participates in the "revisionist history" it would be naive to suppose that Lumumba was communist, especially coming from the country that "granted" the independence of the Congo, and since Lumumba was elected DEMOCRATICALLY to his place as Prime Minister. Minister. <br /> <br /> About the movie ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most important and powerful movies that I have seen in a while. Describing the struggles of the African fighter for freedom, and the struggles of the prime minister-elect as his first leader, Mr. Peck, does a pretty commendable job of putting together all the pieces in one job. And that must have been some work. Due to the fact that most people outside the Congo and Belgium probably do not know the history of Lumumba and Congo, out of some light coverage of African Imperialism (hopefully) in one of their secondary / secondary schools (or perhaps university / college) history classes, he had his work cut out for him. <br /> <br /> And to think that "Stone's JFK" took more than 3 hours, "Lumumba" runs in 2 hours. And the most exciting 115 minutes were when we discovered that his desire not to compromise the Western powers (whom he blamed for the atrocities of his people, particularly Belgium) as he tried to deal with power struggles within his own borders, apparently Even with some of his friends, it is incredible that the man has lived as much as he does. <br /> <br /> This is a must for anyone interested in equality, justice, humanity, history, politics and true freedom. . You will not be disappointed.
