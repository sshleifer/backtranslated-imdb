OK, the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this great little gem, meaning the story began in life as material for Buster Keaton's silent classic "Chances" 7. Comedy, or acting in any genre to do so, is merely interpreting a scene and lines that someone has already written and performed before, if it is not a totally original creation. Here we have The Stooges essentially doing material that was written and executed by someone else and still for a low budget, short time of a movie, they are dealing well with things. Regardless of what the credits say in their movies, the real "stooge-philes" know that they have had a lot of influence on the lines and the direction. They took their work as seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation. Emil Sitka's own words during a documentary about the boys. Here, what seems to be his usual anarchy about something as simple as getting married, is actually organized chaos. Each line is perfectly synchronized with a related physical action. How many comedians are there today that can claim such a domain? More obviously, the Seinfeld team, but none other than I've seen in the last 35 years watching TV. Critics will always joke with the Stooges or Laurel & Hardy and others, but again ... who remembers the names of the critics or what they said? Just watch, laugh and enjoy!
