I saw this at GenCon's Indy display. I had some time to kill and decided to take a look. He played for about 1,000 people in a ballroom filled with living room. <br /> <br /> Wow, what a ride! The script was tight. Tense action. The perfect pace. The display of character excellent. One thing I really liked was that you knew it was not a big budget movie. However, it soon became obvious that breeders pushed their ensembles and effects as much as they could, despite their limitations. And it was more than enough. <br /> <br /> It's true that this movie was directed at a certain audience - gamers / table players - creators make no effort to hide it. But other filmmakers could learn a lot from them. To go to the jugular in scene after scene and not to worry if the mother who is watching will "catch", they have the biggest laughs over and over again. But there is enough universality there that Mommy will be laughing too, even if she is not at all joking. I find that I often see movies that try so hard to reduce the level to the lowest common denominator, so they appeal to most people, but the film ends up suffering for it. <br /> <br /> But not this movie. In fact, this movie was so solid that it had the audience wrapped around the finger of the opening credits. And while the viewers around me really wanted to like the movie, they were not complicated - players might be among the most critical niches out there. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I saw this in a big crowd. At least 10 times the audience was enjoying themselves so much that they erupted into applause in a joke or scene during the movie. How often does this happen in the exhibitions? It should come as no surprise that there was a standing ovation when the final credits rolled. <br /> <br /> For my part, I can not wait for this to be released. After it was over, one of the producers said they were filming for a simultaneous TV / DVD release. This date can not come soon.
