An apt description of Spock about a mighty whole in whose claws fall the crew of the Enterprise. This was a space sector our spacecraft should have avoided: first Sulu and Kirk simply disappeared from the bridge; a landing party follows them to the surface of an unknown planet and finds Trelane, a seemingly aristocratic man dressed in costumes from an Earth of many centuries past. But he demonstrates someone's abilities or something far beyond the human and does not register with McCoy's medical tricorder. The officers manage to flee back to the ship, but, like a cosmic penny, Trelane continues to appear. It brings everyone back, including some female company, to continue their games. The dilemma now assumes elements of 'The Most Dangerous Game' in space and there is an exasperating and even infuriating aspect in the total helplessness of the team in the face of such unbridled power. <br /> <br /> What really makes this a great episode is the memorable performance of the invited guest star Campbell as the dominant but not omniscient alien. His character is obviously an early version of Q, which was introduced 20 years later on the pilot of the TNG series. Trelane's confrontational scene with Spock stands out among all the strange drama unfolding. As usual, Kirk quickly begins to look for possible weaknesses in his new enemy, despite being outdone. The answers to exactly what or who is Trelane are right in front of us all the time, so when we learn the truth, it makes perfect sense in view of Campbell's perfect performance. He is constantly engaged, embellishing himself before an unknown audience, observing things with a talent that is contagious but not very sure - we can not define it first, but there is something missing here. Every few minutes, his tone becomes sinister and the crew seems to be in serious danger. In a way, you can not take your eyes off him, always waiting to see what he does next. The actor John de Lancie captured that tone similar to that of Q in the Next Generation series.
