The Three Stooges have always been some of the many actors that I loved. I love almost all the shorts they made. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses that many of them were in many of the shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the greatest actors of all time and is the most entertaining comedy team of all time! <br /> <br /> One of the most hilarious three Stooges is the Men in Black. In this short are Bud Jamison, Jeanie Roberts, Phillis Crane, Dell Henderson, Little Billy, Rhodes, Billy Gilbert and Ruth Hiatt. The acting of these actors is good, especially by Jamison and Roberts. There are lots of funny scenes here that I think most Three Stooges fans will love! In my opinion, this is one of the most different shorts from the Three Stooges. I recommend this to everyone!
