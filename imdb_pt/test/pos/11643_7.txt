This film has two new features in relation to the message conveyed by other equally good movies about death penalty and executions. This is also the stress of the drama suffered by the victims' parents-without, however, disguising the hatred and desire for revenge they feel or diminishing the horror that execution represents-and the Christian view of all the issues involved. We must also point out that in this film the sentenced man is not the nice and innocent person we see in other films dealing with executions, which does not lead us to abandon the idea that a criminal execution is no more than a legal murder of any way. Last but not least we must mention the extraordinary emotional weight placed in the last moments of the course of execution with all the catharsis shown by the condemned's last words and the detail with which the act of execution itself is seen in a parallel cut with images of the murder scenes in the forest to emphasize that we are being confronted with another murder as merciless as the latter, but carried out in a cold and supposedly "legal" way.
