I saw this movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to a group of us at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin. He prefaced with how incredible he thought he was and how funny he was and in the context of his explanation, it was HILARIOUS. I can see how that would be detrimental to some audiences, and the subject is not funny at all, but there are at least three lines in the film that made me laugh so hard that I thought about peeing. They do not come until after half the way, but when they do, oh God ... you're going to die. Oh and Jim Brown is brilliant. He's not in much of the movie, but when he's there, you know whose movie it is. Of course, the best (and funniest) movie line is his; you will know when you hear it.
