This program is certainly my favorite non-sitcom television comedy. Australia produces very few good shows - most of the TV I watch (and I live in Australia) is from the US and from England. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this show is how controversial it is. Like when they passed through numerous security barriers at the APEC summit, pretending to be Canadian diplomats. <br /> <br /> The show is composed of pre-filmed acrobatics, general satirical discussion of current world events and sometimes on stage. sketches They all come together to create a fabulous and extremely entertaining TV show. Segments such as "Ad Road-test" and "Message from Osama bin Ladin" are hilarious. For anyone interested in watching hilarious satirical TV comedy - then this is definitely the show you should watch. <br /> <br /> All the guys are great and do a great job entertaining you for half an hour. <br /> <br /> I would rate 10/10.
