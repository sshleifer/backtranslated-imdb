'Checking Out' is an extraordinary film that stands out in most film productions. His refreshing and witty humor is never an excuse to remain superficial. Rather, the film explores various facets of the human spirit and human relations. His warm approach fosters tolerance and acceptance of diversity and recognition of what unites all people. The characters are charming and fun, reflecting those idiosyncrasies that we can all laugh at ourselves. The quick dialogue and witty joke will keep you on your toes, and you may find yourself trying to curb your own laughter, as you will not want to miss a single sentence! You'll probably want to see it in the movies and then again (several more times) on video, and every time you discover something new. After each observation, you are sure to feel warm and elevated.
