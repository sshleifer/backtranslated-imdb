I got out of "Rendition" with a list of flaws a mile long, so how does my overall impression is that it was a decent movie? It's definitely a movie whose sum is better than its parts. <br /> <br /> These parts include a cast of big names, none of them giving a memorable performance (Omar Metwally, an unknown relative, is the one you'll remember); useful if indistinct direction; and a script that is very complicated and very simplistic at the same time. Metwally is an American citizen born in Egypt who is kidnapped by the US government surrender program, also known as the process by which the United States torture terror suspects to confess information, whether or not remotely true. Reese Witherspoon plays her pregnant wife, who calls in favor of an old college classmate (Peter Saarsgard), who works for a senator (Alan Arkin) and helps track down her husband. Meryl Streep plays the head of the surrender program; Jake Gyllenhaal is a young agent assigned to interrogation and whose conscience disturbs. Meanwhile, a parallel plot follows the daughter of a senior Egyptian official who is allied with the American rendition program and her boyfriend, who is in training to become a suicide bomber. Ay-yi-yi, which is a very plot to pack into a two-hour movie, and I was about to wash my hands of the whole thing, especially the Egyptian Romeo and Juliet subplot that seemed nothing more than a distraction. But then, toward the end of the movie, a twist in chronology gathers all the plots in a way that makes you want to reevaluate everything you thought you knew about the motivations of the various characters, and make Rendition a much more interesting film. It looks like it will be. Witherspoon, Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard look like high school students who practice adults twenty years older than they really are - Gyllenhaal in particular, usually an excellent actor, seems so bored that you wonder if he will gather the energy to deliver their speeches. And the screenwriter must be arrested for having an actress as good as Meryl Streep at his disposal and giving him nothing more to work than this one-dimensional dragon lady. The film, of course, seeks relevance, but instead of addressing the tangled web of arguments surrounding the question of national security, it is borne in the middle of the debate in a predictable way. There are times when you think that maybe the movie goes in an interesting direction - and if Witherspoon really began to doubt her husband's past, for example? What if Metwally really had been in contact with terrorists, as his interrogators accuse? But no, the film follows the path of least resistance. <br /> <br /> But like I said, I recommend this movie. I know I've done nothing but list a lot of his faults, but he's got his head in the right place, and it's fun, or at least as entertaining as a movie about torture and interrogation can be. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
