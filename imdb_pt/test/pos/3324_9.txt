I feel very strongly that this movie was like Waiting to Exhale with white women in the 1950s. As in Waiting to Exhale, all female characters mingled with men who were married or were not good. The only difference, apart from the obvious, was that there was not much humor in this movie. I would even say it was tragic. Only one of the male characters seemed to be kind and sincere (Hope Lange's face), but there was conflict in this relationship nonetheless. <br /> <br /> The story was about three young women sharing an apartment together who had hopes and dreams of success. Unfortunately for them, the novel did not seem easy, despite being young, intelligent and attractive. This movie could be called a tearjerker with the saddest part involving the character of Suzy Parker, whose obsession with an ex-boyfriend leads to tragedy. <br /> <br /> This is a must see.
