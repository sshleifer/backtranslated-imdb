Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller star in the story of two of the women in Dylan Thomas's life. Knightley is the childhood love of Thomas that he meets again during the Blitz. Gathering in a bar, they reconnect, however, things get tricky when Thomas brings his (Miller) wife the next time he finds her. The women get along and things continue in rhythm until the trio joins the man who will become Knightly's husband. This complicates matters even more, for jealousy begins to show its face. Beautiful to behold, extraordinarily written and beautifully rendered (everyone completely disappears in their roles), it is a sumptuous feast for the eyes and ears. It's so good to see a movie about adults being adults. On a purely visceral level I really enjoyed watching the movie because the film is so artistically pleasing. Rarely have I seen a movie that is beautifully crafted. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that I'm not sure everything has happened. Something seemed to be missing and sometimes I had to repeat the movie to see if I missed something. Not bad, but not completely satisfactory as a result. (I tried searching the line to see how much of the movie is true, but I could not find anything) I still think this is a movie worth seeing. It's a beautiful adult film with probably the best acting that the protagonists did.
