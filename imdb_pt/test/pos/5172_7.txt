Even though I had never seen or heard of Georgetown, CO, this would be a small movie. But my father was born and raised there, and these are my uncle's horses you see pulling the sled! So this movie is very special to me. Many of the interiors are filmed in buildings and houses that I recognize and are very realistic. The story is a bit corny, but Georgetown is this kind of magical place where things like that could happen. John Denver was a better actor than many people give him credit for. Mary Wickes plays the kind of "common sense lady with a lot of insolence," she played so well in many other films, most notably "White Christmas." I usually do not go out to go there in the winter so I like to watch this movie at Christmas time to "help me" until my next trip!
