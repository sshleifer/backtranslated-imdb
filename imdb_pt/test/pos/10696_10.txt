After watching this movie, I have no choice but to write a comment in the hope that there will be others like me out there who were overwhelmed by the rocket-powered ninja action and the hot white sexual excitement that is Ninja III: The Domination. /> <br /> We all know the rocks Sho Kosugi. That's a given, but what about Jordan Bennett's ultra-macho interpretation of his "Billy Secord" character? Bravo Mr. Bennett, bravo. You try early, as you try to seduce the chubby Christie (played to perfection by a fame of Miss Lucinda Dickey of Breakin) that you are not afraid to risk in your craft. I particularly liked how you do not feel the need to intervene and try to help her when 4 thugs try to rape her out of her gym. Oh, you could have helped for sure, but staying there and watching you know who the boss was. Secord will wear the pants in this relationship. I also liked how Mr. Bennett was not afraid to take off his shirt repeatedly or wear the woman-batter top despite his gorilla like shoulders and back. The back and shoulders are warm and Secord knows it. What about Lucinda Dickey? All I can say is "KABOOM" - I see a sex bomb preparing to explode. She has all the right moves as both a seducer and a martial arts expert. The chemistry behind Dickey and Bennett is what makes this movie work. You'd think she'd hate him because he's a cheesy jerk, but not my friends. Animal magnetism is too strong to resist, and they bind like crazy glue. Sho Kasugi is not as prominent as you might think, although he is still a main character, which is good for me, because all I wanted was more Bennett and Dickey. He seems to wear a lot of eye makeup, which was nice to see. The special effects? Wow. That's all I can say. I will not give the ending, but let's just say we will not disappoint. I love Ninja III: The Domination, and I can only hope there is a Ninja 4. I give it 5 out of 5 throwing stars. to disappoint
