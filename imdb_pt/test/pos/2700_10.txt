I've been watching King of Queens since the beginning, and I've felt it's overlooked at the prize shows. This show has the best mood, you can identify with the characters, we talk a lot about it at work, because I work in a company very similar to IPS, (DHL) and we love the Teamster takes !! Carrie is my hero, she's the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject. Arthur well what can you say? He just criticizes you and really takes a turn at things. Doug, he's so kind and funny, the three characters, plus all the friends, complete the show. This is the best comedy on TV !! I'd say upstairs with Seinfeld, and hey, there's nothing wrong with that .... Excellente !! as Doug would say.
