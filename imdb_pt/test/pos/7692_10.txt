I saw this movie when I was a child and have been looking for it ever since. He ranks upstairs with Cabin in The Sky, Stormy Weather and Carmen Jones as a must see in films that exhibited the incredible talent of African Americans. 60s local Los Angeles TV stations would get a movie of the week and a few stations would show the same movie for 5 days.Porgy and Bess were one of them and my whole family would be there every 5 nights in front of the TV and just moved in. for commercials. South Pacific, Oklahoma and The Sound of Music are all musical classics that you can pick up at any video store. It would be a pity to let this collection of some of the best talent that America had to offer be forgotten or locked in a safe. Please make the movie available to the public.
