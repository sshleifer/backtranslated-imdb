I'm sure people in the US do not know anything about the rest of the world, but I do not think they should talk about what they do not know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocritical as the US. The only places where consenting sex among teenagers is illegal are the US and Islamic nations. In France, for example, the age of consent is 15. In Brazil, there are 14 in Spain. Therefore, teenage actors aged 16 and 17 at the time of production are not doing anything illegal. Nudity is not considered a great thing in almost all civilized countries. And only an aberration could consider the love of a teenager as child sexual abuse.
