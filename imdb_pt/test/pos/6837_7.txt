Although this movie looks like a Thriller Noir Crime, the plot is actually a bit simplistic and with very few twists or turns of surprise - and those that appear, are not exactly shocking. <br /> <br /> However, if you get out of 'intense action thriller' mode and go into 'mindless entertainment' then this is really a very entertaining movie with several hilarious moments. Most of them can be attributed to the witty dialogue between the characters of Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson - but with that said, Sadie said it all in her hilarious opening greeting to Friedman, and left very little else for anything to develop between these two characters. I did not find this version of British actors estimated by the Southern accents so bad. (Okay, Thompson seemed to be rolling marbles in his mouth while trying to speak from the south, but Rickman was surprisingly good with very few little slips in his usual English accent.) if you want to criticize accents - let's discuss this with Coco - she only talked about the South periodically! <br /> <br />
