I had high hopes that Teletoon Retro would convey that, but instead of having programs like that, those who do not get the treatment they deserve, they exhibit things I've seen dozens of times before. <br /> <Centurions was the highlight of my pre-teen years. I know it may sound a little clichÃ©, but it's true. After Duke of G.I. Joe, Jake Rockewell is another of those cartoon characters that I really had a downfall. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Teletoon Retro does not see it in the same way as the people of my generation. Otherwise, the Teletoon Retro would be much better than it is.
