I've always liked Barbara Stanwyck, who was perhaps the most difficult leading actress of the 1930s and '40s, though few of her roles are memorable. Today she is most remembered for the TV show "The Big Valley". Stanwyck worked hard because she was durable; it seems that she would take almost any role and make the most of it to make the film a success and so the directors loved her and many common images gained credibility for her presence. <br /> <br /> And so it was because of it. "Christmas in Connecticut", a very common endeavor whose plot leaves credulity and even is not about Christmas. It has, however, Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan, as well as some supreme character actors including Sydney Greenstreet and S.K. Sakall then there are twists and funny moments that undoubtedly seemed more real in 1945 than today. To begin with, the plot relates to a magazine writer (Stanwyck) whom the magazine's readers believe to be a domestic goddess, married to a child and living on a farm in Connecticut but who is single, lives in New York and does not know nothing about cooking or doing at home. Could anyone get away with such fraud anyway? Apparently, and even the owner of the magazine (Greenstreet) is deceived, although it is thought that he would have seen the lie a long time ago, but the story continues and Stanwyck, Greenstreet, a sailor recently survived from his sunken ship (Morgan) and The friend of the Stanwyck restaurateur (SZSakall) finds herself spending Christmas in Connecticut on a farm belonging to Stanwyck's coarse boyfriend (Reginald Gardiner). You can imagine all the possibilities that exist for this, as the fraud unfolds as it should. Gardiner wants Stanwyck to marry him to perpetuate the awakening, but he wonders how she can bear it. Morgan and Stanwyck fall to each other, but he should be engaged and she should get married. Regardless, they begin what appears to be a case of pretending to be face-glued dancing and stealing a horse-drawn sleigh. Meanwhile, the incredibly naive Greenstreet character who saw Stanwyck and Morgan leave together but still failed to see one of the neighbors take back a child who was lent as part of the deception and calls the police to report a kidnap. Stanwyck and Morgan are arrested for stealing the sled and the hoax begins to clear. <br /> <br /> At this point, the movie is funny as ridiculous or absurd, not funny ha, and routinely ends up as comedies always did. The good guy stays with the girl and, presumably, they live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie every year at Christmas to enjoy these actors at their best in a story that reflects the way it was in 1945 and because of a long fascination with Barbara Stanwyck. Thank goodness it was Christmas or like 95% of Stanwyck's movies, it would have been long forgotten and we could not see it every year again.
