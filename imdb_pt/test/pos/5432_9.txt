This movie reminds me of great movies that temporarily wake me up with the realization that the emperor is in fact naked. Our electoral process is naked and gloomy. My consciousness is heightened and I want to see the world change. After a short period of time, I am packed back to my little complacency and "bubble life". In the best sense of film this work will ferment into an edible stew for me and as in "Network" I want to be condemned to say "I'm as crazy as hell, and I will not take it anymore!" But for whom? My vigorous youthful idealism was slowly reduced to a worried parent, with calm convictions, or rather, "beliefs." "Man of the Year" reveals how much I yearn for honesty and sometimes humorous takes on our current political situation. Dobbs Line "I inhaled because I thought, 'What the hell, it's on, it's on my hand, I'm going to inhale it'" it was refreshing or it would have been when Clinton was president. Why can not politicians be honest and set that tone for debate? We, the people, must realize how much veneer is being presented as real? I'm tired of this electoral process, anyone else? Let's take the veils out and set an agenda for our elected officials and get them to task (not re-elect) when they continue with evasion and non-representation of citizens. This movie may inspire us to raise our expectations of politicians who make rhetoric. Great movie!
