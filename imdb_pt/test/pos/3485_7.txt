Due to his predictable second-category title (which was distributed in Italy, at least), I did not expect much from this film. I thought it would be another cheap movie about a haunted house ("LA CASA MALEDETTA" means "The Damned House"). Well, I had to change my mind shortly after the first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and scary atmospheres reminded me a bit of The Exorcist and some of his decent Italian idiots, but that would be something completely different ... That's more like Hitchcock knows the Italian thriller! Very well written and directed, good actors, interesting plot ... OK, I tried not to spoil the display of "7 Hyden Park" for you, which I recommend to everyone. <br /> <br /> Q. Am I wrong, or when Joanna crawls or struggles to stand (she is paralyzed from the waist down) does her feet and legs move a little too much? (... And I'm not talking about the "bad dream" sequence).
