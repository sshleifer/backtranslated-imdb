When I watch a movie, I usually look for entertainment. But of course, if I know what gender is the movement, I will seek what it must do. For example, if it's a deep movie, I hope the movie irritates thoughts in my skull and makes me think about what it's saying. But who is this girl? it's not a deep movie. But it's fun, though. It's an exaggerated movie that is a joy to watch. There is only one annoying moment in the movie and there are many funny pieces. I watched it when I was younger. The cast is always entertaining as usual. I had a slight crush on Griffin Dunne, though he was not the typical male heartthrob at the time. Haviland Morris also stars. And the Austrian actress Bibi Besch is here too! Overall a delight!
