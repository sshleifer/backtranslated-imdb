This movie is a joy to watch and should do well on DVD and video. I suppose you really have to be Irish to appreciate some of the subtleties like accent, colloquialisms and the sense of dress of some of the characters, but let me assure you that when Dylan Moran pretends to be Barrel, imitation is quite familiar to most of the people. from Dublin because we have so many characters in our beautiful city that look, act and talk like that! The simple comedy employed and the genius of Michael Caines acting alone are worth the money, but in addition, the plot is great, the script is fantastic and the dialogue is fast and engaging. A lightweight and perfect entertainment movie, without the crazy humor of Jim Carrey.
