Daffy Duck has signs hanging on every inch of every available tree announcing it's rabbit season. But you guessed it - it's really a duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he is the only hunter idiot enough to fall on the gag. <br /> <br /> He's even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny approaches him and asks how the rabbit hunt goes, Elmer admits that he has not yet seen a rabbit. This is more than Daffy can bear. He leaves his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugsy. "Shoot him now!" Daffy screams. "You're quiet," says Bugs. "He does not have to shoot you now." Daffy insists he does. <br /> <br /> After Daffy returns his damned beak to the head, he is doomed to more arguments infected with "pronominal problems," which all have the same result. Later, Bugs Bunny dresses up as a sexy, flirting woman and asks Elmer for a duck dinner. Will Daffy laugh at last? "Ha, ha, very funny! Ha, ha, ha!" <br /> <br /> What's funny about this classic drawing? Bug flinches scared when Daffy screams in his face. Bugs Bunny says "yes?" dripping with self-satisfaction. Patolino stands on tiptoe demanding to be shot. Elmer Fudd complains that he "can not expect any wongers". Daffy sees Bugs in women's clothes and makes that little noise with her tongue. Carl Stalling plays "You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby" during the Bugs dragging act. Daffy demands "pure honesty" from insects. Stalling plays "Home Sweet Home" at an inappropriate time. Daffy tells Bugs that he is "unthinkable." <br /> <br /> In five words: every detail of this movie. <br /> <br /> NOTE: This short is available in "Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume One," Disc 1
