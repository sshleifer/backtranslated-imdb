Closet Land is an amazing and scary movie. He has only two actors in a single set, but never loses his attention. Scenography is imaginative and disturbing, the staging of scenes keeps your attention, while increasing your own sense of confusion and terror. The performance is excellent, with Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe having the duty to take all the scenes. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time in 1991, right after it came out on video. He did not play in the theaters where I lived; is not surprising, given its political content. It should be seen, though. It presents a brilliant staging of the techniques of torture and interrogation used by repressive societies to instill fear and obedience in their citizens. The country is never named, which makes it even more impressive. It could be anywhere; East, West, 3rd World, 1st World. It illustrates what happens when a small group of people decide what is best for everyone; when the government becomes the ruler of the citizens, rather than the servant. <br /> <br /> Madeleine Stowe is a child author who was dragged from her bed during the night and subjected to terror and torture. She finds herself in a room with Alan Rickman, a seemingly nice employee. At first it seems a horrible mistake and she is free to go; but fear causes it to linger and terror grows worse. She is increasingly subject to physical and mental torture. The interrogator uses sensory deprivation, temporal manipulation, confusion, auditory manipulation, dramatization, and distorted logic to break the author. She is humiliated and intimidated, forced to endure strenuous body positions deprived of food and water. <br /> <br /> After all, she refuses to give in; to do what the interrogator asks. She is told that it will all be over if she only signs a confession. A simple little act. She refuses. Through it all, it employs defense mechanisms that have developed since childhood. It is slowly revealed that she was the victim of childhood sexual abuse. To survive, she developed fantasy worlds and characters that would separate her from abuse. These mechanisms allow her to transcend her torture and turn the table into her interrogator. She begins to attack her own beliefs and professions, forcing her to examine her own life and motives. In the end, it is free because it maintains freedom of thought. The interrogator is the one arrested by the state. <br /> <br /> This film was made during the heyday of the Cold War, Apartheid, and at a time when the crimes of many governments around the world made daily news. It is even more opportune in a world where "enemy combatants" are detained and interrogated in secret prisons with legal rights or denied councils; where "ethnic cleansing" destroys whole societies and humanitarian aid is denied. This demonstrates that the individual may face the state or another oppressor, refusing to yield to fear and terror.
