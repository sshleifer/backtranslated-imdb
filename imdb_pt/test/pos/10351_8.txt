I was crying like an idiot for the last ten minutes of this exceptional piece of television. I have to say that the idea of ​​sitting down to see 90 minutes of what would be a very depressing material on a Sunday, was not welcome. The thought of yet another BAFTA winning possibility did not excite me ... However, the end result knocked me down to 6. This is one of the best TV shows I've ever seen. For years I was under the impression that all the originality had left the theater department of the BBC. Our Northern Friends was the last production that really surprised me and that was 10 years ago. However, faith is restored and honor is satisfied. David Tenant was awesome! As many actors as I can think of would have gone to town in a party like this, but I never saw Mr. Tenant as an actor or as a doctor, all I saw was Alan Hamilton. I have not had my heart plucked since Daniel Craigs' performance as Geordie Peacock all those years ago. Sarah Parish was also amazing and I really hope this role will bring you better roles in the future. The whole cast was great, but a special mention must be given to the director who really put us inside Alans' head. The toaster scene, in particular, made me sick.
