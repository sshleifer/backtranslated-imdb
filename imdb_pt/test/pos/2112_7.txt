I watched Grand Champion all the way at least twice now. I liked the story of the movie, the characters and the actors were not bad. It's exciting to watch a G rated movie. This is a good movie. The story is mainly about children's vision. Interactions between children and adults make the story interesting. I recommend this movie if you are looking for a family movie. If you liked Little Rascals, you'll probably enjoy it. I saw this movie on cable. Whether in the Encore or Showtime family. This is not a movie I would have gone to see in the theater. But, I only go to the movies to see the effects of the big screen, so most comedies, romantic movies or dramas I do not go to the big screen - I wait for the TV / cable edition. Bring your kids together, make popcorn and have fun!
