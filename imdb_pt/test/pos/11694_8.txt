I recently saw this at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival. The title of the film, and indeed much of the film's outline, is from Robert Graves' poem, Beauty in Trouble. Jan Hrebejk directs a script by Petr Jrchovský from a story of Hrebejk and Jrchovský. the story begins in 2002 when Prague is hit by one of those devastating 100-year floods that destroys Marcela's (Ana Ceislerová) and Jarda (Roman Luknár) and their two sons Kuba (Adam Misik) and Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova). Because of the mildew conditions they now live in, Kuba's asthma is a life threat. Marcela works and Jarda runs a chop shop in the garage that they live next door. The shadowy occupation of Jarda distances him from the law and one of his robbery victims falls in love with Marcela. Evzen Benes (Josef Abrhám) is a wealthy businessman who divides his time between Italy and the Czech Republic and offers to look after Marcela and her two children. Jana Brejchová is the mother of Marcella who lives with her husband, Uncle Richie, played by Jirí Schmitzer, probably in the best part of the film. Completing this excellent cast is Emily Vasaryova as the mentally fragile mother of Yard who gives money to the local religious charlatan. There's a lot going on here for a little movie and it's a good story with a great script and a lot of comic relief. Ales Brezina provides the score with additional music by Czech singer Raduza and Irish singer Glen Hansard. There is a lot to like about this movie and I would give it a 8.0 out of 10 and highly recommend it.
