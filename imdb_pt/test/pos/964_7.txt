I was not expecting much from this tale of a child whose term paper is stolen and turned into a movie script .. that then he travels to Hollywood to stay still .. but .. hey..it's still a fun movie. Frankie Muniz from "Malcolm in the Middle" stars fame as the boy and is quite good and Amanda Bynes as his friend is also very good. Yes, the movie works as an advertisement for the Universal Studios theme park and is really a silly movie for kids .. but I enjoyed it anyway. SERIE B-
