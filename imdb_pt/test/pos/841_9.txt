"Female Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable", the third in the series, is a magnificent piece of pulp. Closer in tone and subject to a violent Nikkatsu more rosy than other entrances of Scorpio, he is incredibly photographed, driven with enthusiasm and populated with a gallery of villains and degenerates. Shinya Ito, the director of the first part, returns to this surreal fable that begins with Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) cutting off the arm of a police officer she is handcuffed and fleeing to the Tokyo subway with her arm still dangling from her wrist. She takes refuge in a red-light district where she befriends a prostitute, who is first seen having incestuous sex with her brother (who ends up getting her pregnant). Scorpio's desire to protect this unhappy woman eventually exposes her identity and all hell breaks loose. She is beaten, sexually assaulted and locked inside a bizarre bird cage in the villian's lair. I loved everything about this hypnotic, nihilistic and emotionally touching movie. He is the superior of the first three films of the Scorpion and presents one great scene after another. I can not recommend it enough.
