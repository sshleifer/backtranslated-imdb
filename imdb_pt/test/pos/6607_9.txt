Take a subject that I did not know much about and that is exciting, why do not you know? It turns out that around 1979, director Robert Altman said that he did not believe he had made a real movie and that he hoped one of those kids would skate - if he did not break his neck - would make the first film. Well, I would not put that expectation in Stacy Peralta, but he's a skater who made a good movie. Of course, he was forced by the nature of the movie he was making to use existing images, and it's certainly a good thing that there were so many file footage. Peralta rode him well with spoken and unusual head shots from his former classmates as they are today. The whole effect is postmodern in the best sense, but it has already been done. Altman's prediction has not yet come true. What Peralta did, however, is capture enough of the energy of those intoxicating days that we can appreciate what it must have been like when modern skateboarding was invented by the Z-Boys. This is all good. I highly recommend "Dogtown".
