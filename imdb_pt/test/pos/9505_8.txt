This video was my first presentation to the residents, and I could not stop touching it in the last three days. The visuals are dynamite and more inventive and technically complex than any other I've seen on the big screen or small. <br /> <br /> The DVD loses points, however, by the useless addition of new songs. The original Residents song is unlike anything you've ever heard, and it will really fit your brain in the best possible way. The new song, however, is uniformly uninteresting and in most cases is pretty bad compared to some of the classic tracks. In addition, the incomparable Vileness Fats video looks VERY incomplete, and I could only understand the storyline of the extensive reading of the notes on the disc. Speaking of notes on the disc, this DVD features lots of cool Easter eggs that will most likely appeal to the resident's longtime fans. Tip: Look for icons on the pages of notes that should not be there. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the disc is one of the best DVD transfers available. There is virtually no observable pixelization, and only a little nervousness in strong contrast points. <br /> <br /> Kudos for a first-rate presentation. This record really deserves your attention.
