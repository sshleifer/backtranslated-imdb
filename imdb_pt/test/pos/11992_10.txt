Like Richard Pryor, Mason never got the stuff he deserved. Everything you know about him is probably wrong. Go over your accent and go see your stand-up. You'll be very surprised - he's one of the best stand-ups I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of stand-up comedy (from Lenny Bruce to Eddie Murphy, from Jerry Seinfeld to Chris Rock - Jackie Mason is definitely up there). He is known to be comic of a comic. Even Howard Stern said he is one of the 3 funniest comedians of all time. <br /> <br /> The charge that Mason is not a Dangerfield is ridiculous. Dangerfield is known to have been a big fan of Mason. Dangerfield's career was not going anywhere for long until he started following Mason's shows. That's when Mason gave Dangerfield inspiration for his "no respect" routine. While I think Dangerfield is great, watch the two get up and you'll see that Mason is the best comedian.
