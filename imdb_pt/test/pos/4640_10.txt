Still funny after all these years. Midnight Madness is good entertainment for all ages. It features Michael J Fox as a typical 15-year troublemaker. Melio and Blaylak are by far the funniest characters and Leon is perfectly cast as a game master. The romance between Adam and the girl could not have been more tacky. Fagabeefe !!!!
