I did not expect much when I rented this movie, since many independent films seem a little overrated these days (well, Hollywood movies too), but this movie was fantastic, great, it's too bad. It has not reached a huge audience because it is simply superb. I really love Alice's determination, it really makes me look at my life as a gift, and I see how privileged I am just to have an education. But all that aside, this movie really proves that a good artist can tell a good story, no matter the budget, it's a great movie and everyone should watch it, they'll love it and definitely learn something from it. I do not have to be roger ebert to know that it's one of the best movies I've seen all year, and certainly one of the truest.
