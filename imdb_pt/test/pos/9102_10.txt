I just loved every minute of this movie. Jack Black and Kyle Gass definitely brought the thunder in this epic tale of friendship, hard rock and destiny. <br /> <br /> Filled to the brim with unnecessary verbiage in every sentence, toilet humor, and the general attitude of breaking rules, this movie is a must-have for hard core hard core fans. <br /> <br /> We follow the journey of the young Jables (Jack Black) and Kage (Kyle Gass) as they try to regain their destiny, to win the open microphone night, and become the biggest band on the planet. The duo have to overcome obstacles like a room full of lasers, a man with a leg and the devil to accomplish his task. I'll let you see if they do it or not. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack itself is incredible enough, and now we see the D in person, making the experience even more magical. A must see for anyone who says a tenacious D fan. Beware of the inner jokes of the first album!
