Without a doubt, the best Burt Reynolds movie of all time! Even better than Smokey and the Bandit. This was probably the first real police thriller of the 1980s and provided the perfect blend of humor, action, mystery and style that is lacking in today's movies. <br /> <br /> This has it all: a psychotic Henry Silva in the PCP, $ 1,000 a night program girls, ninja killers and Burt Reynolds cutting their fingers one by one with a butterfly knife. The film is based on the novel by William Diehl, who also wrote PRIMAL FEAR, another of my all time favorites. It's worth watching this movie just to see Henry Silva be shot six times, slam into a window and fall thirty floors off the top of an Atlanta skyscraper. This is probably the coolest hit in Hollywood history, played by legendary stuntman Dar Robinson. <br /> <br /> Robinson also played "Moke" in Elmore Leonard's STICK, also starring Burt Reynolds. Vara presents another great stunt for Dar Robinson. Robinson falls from a Miami apartment building and unloads all six shots of a 44 degree magnum on his way down. Very cool stuff. <br /> <br /> SHARKY MACHINE is my favorite police drama. I never understood why this movie failed like it did. If Burt made more films like that, he would have built a better reputation for himself. He proves to be a talented director with Sharky as well as a talented actor. Burt is backed by Brian Kieth, Charles Durning, Bernie Casey, Richard Libertini, Rachel Ward and everyone's favorite villain, Henry Silva. PLEASE redo this classic movie! Get Affleck and Samuel L. and some other hot actors and you have a great movie just waiting to be filmed. <br /> <br /> I give a 9 out of 10
