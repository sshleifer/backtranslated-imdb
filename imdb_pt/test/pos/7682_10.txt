I was a projectionist while I was in the USA. and remember that movie very well. we had just been set up with stereo sound !! o-o-o-o !! well, it was a big deal in 1959. Instructions came with the reels. the opening rang while the projected curtain image was closed and I followed suit with the theater curtain also closed. for the interval, the curtain of the theater was closed, and after five minutes I restarted the film with the projection curtain closed, while the music was used as a curtain for the second part. Being the first stereo movie I've ever seen and being a great music production, I certainly enjoyed watching it every time I showed it to the race.
