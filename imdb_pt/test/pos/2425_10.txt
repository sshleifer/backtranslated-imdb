This movie requires a lot of patience. Because it focuses on the mood and development of the character, the plot is very simple and many of the scenes happen in the same set - in Frances Austen's apartment (the character of Sandy Dennis). But the film turns into a disturbing climax. <br /> <br /> The characters create an atmosphere filled with sexual tension and psychological tricks. It's very interesting that Robert Altman directed this, considering the style and structure of his other films. Still, the Altman brand of audio is evident here and there. I think what really makes this movie work is the brilliant performance of Sandy Dennis. It's definitely one of her darkest characters, but she plays so perfectly and convincingly that it's scary. Michael Burns does a good job as the young "dumb". Altman regular player Michael Murphy has a small part. The solemn and melancholic set fits very well with the content of the story. In short, this film is a powerful study of loneliness, sexual repression and despair. Be patient, soak up the atmosphere and pay attention to the wonderfully written script. <br /> <br /> Praise Robert Altman. This is one of his many films that deals with unconventional and fascinating subjects. This movie is disturbing, but it is sincere and will certainly cause a strong emotional response from the viewer. If you want to see an unusual movie - some might even say bizarre - this is worth it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find it in video rental stores. You may have to buy it on the internet.
