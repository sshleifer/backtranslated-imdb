Did I like Erkan & Stefan? a cool and quick story that did not get bogged down in detail. These two guys are great to see and are able to come up with new ideas all the time. The high quality image and cut gives much support to the film. <br /> <br /> Erkan and Stefan show that the German film industry is able to transfer successful Hollywood concepts with the local "satire" in our cinemas.
