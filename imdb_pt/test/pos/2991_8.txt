With all the crap out there, this is a sweet movie about young love. Yes, it is true that young love often does more from something than it deserves, but why are people not in "Romeo and Juliet"? Paul and Michelle are models of good behavior toward them. <br /> <br /> Yes, they run away and establish an ideal life, but this is a movie, not real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who was barely received. Eventually, they have sex, but no one is forced to. The film lets kids know that sex can cause babies. <br /> <br /> One thing is nudity in the movies. The camera does not focus on it, but it's there. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie has Paul with good chances of being discovered. In "Paul and Michelle," they separate for a while. If you do not like the end of a movie, think of yourself. Alternative endings are not just for DVDs.
