I was lucky enough to be an extra in this movie when I was about 13 years old during the skating scenes. My high school drama group was invited to attend. It was a fantastic experience. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey, Charles Martin Smith and Don Stroud played the music live, all day long! As a musician, I can appreciate the tireless work and dedication these guys put into their roles. They must have played these songs 20 times. It is very difficult to maintain consistency and energy under these conditions. This is visible during a cut to a close in "That'll be the day," but fortunately the unsuspecting public probably would not have chosen it. <br /> <br /> Skating all day off from school and being transported back in time was an incredible thrill. I also had my first "date" in the movie. I had to walk with a girl to the ticket office. Woo hoo! Even with an outdated haircut and hot lights melting the Vaseline into my hair, it was still worth it. Fun stuff. <br /> <br /> The film is top notch and is highly satisfying as a whole. Busey does her best role of all time and the supporting cast is superb. I'm happy to have participated in a great movie of the day. Thinking I could be in Corvette Summer or something. No. An ironic and funny ending is that years later I was at a video store in Malibu looking at the movie the week it was released on video. Gary Busey came in and stood beside me. I showed him the cover and talked about how good he was and how I was an extra and everything. Very strange, but very cool, so worth it.
