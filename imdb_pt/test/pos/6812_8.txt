This was much better than I expected, the film lavished proffesionalism compared to other B-moive of that kind of budget. The script was good if a bit of formula, but the acting was surprisingly good to everyone, including Lorenzo and you always expect good standards of Scheider and Busey. As well as the good plot and acting action is good, especially the car chases and accidents are class A. In short, this is a rise above other thrillers of movie B and does not have to rely on constant nudity or a flow of cheesy puns to offset the budget and script shortcomings, is certainly worth a rental.
