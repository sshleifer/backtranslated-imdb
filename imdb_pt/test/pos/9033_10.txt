I'm not a fan of Faulkner (which is considered sacrilege, especially since I grew up near the author's hometown); however, I think this is an excellent movie. Coupled with the quality of the movie "To Kill a Mocking Bird". If you have not seen it yet, buy anyway. Worth having in your permanent collection. Recently, TCM interpreted the film as part of the series Race on Film. I wish they would play more often. Very touching. On a side note, the staff from Oxford, Mississippi, will also enjoy seeing the pictures of the town square as it was in the 1940s. The courthouse, the town hall, etc.: They are all on the screen. I never knew the movie was filmed there until I realized the familiarity of the buildings. When I saw the arch in front of the town hall, I began to suspect. Look closely at the streamers on Chick's wall: you'll see two for Ole Miss!
