Unfortunately, this movie is relegated to the status of 'curio' it seems. Many people I asked "Did you know the Monkees made a movie?" If you are one of those large numbers, I recommend that you look at it, but with the following warning (s): If you expect a monkey style of humor, it is over there. It simply is not everywhere, like TV shows. <br /> <br /> Yes, they are trying to break their TV pattern a little, mocking it like a bunch of teenagers who are no longer in the short end of a bunch of dicks. <br /> <br /> No, you do not need to be drunk to have fun. <br /> <br /> No, you do not need to get drunk to If you like classics, you'll love the clips interspersed throughout. <br /> <br /> If you like the psychedelic era, you'll love some of the apparitions. If you are a fan of the Monkees, you may recognize some of the scams they are making in the heavy commercialization of the band. In the almost immortal words of one of my best friends after seeing 5 minutes of it: "This is a strange movie, man." In fact, it may be best if you do not try to understand it, just sit back and react to it. It's weird, it's funny, it's a bit surreal, it's experimental (still) ... it's a lot of things. Overall, it is an experience.
