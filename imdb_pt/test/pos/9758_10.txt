I can not believe it's been 25 years since I first watched this story on TV. I remembered being touched a lot by him and was fortunate enough to get the VHS tape several years ago. I have not watched it again until recently. I have been observed repeatedly since then. I must have watched 10 times in the last two weeks. <br /> <br /> The acting is superb, the story is compelling, and I'm ashamed to say that I have not enjoyed the talent of actor Bryan Brown until now. The playful facial expressions shown in the first half - when he gave Jean the stolen remedy in Malaysia is a stark contrast to his very reserved and nervous body expressions shown in the second half: his first drink together at Caines and the homestead tour. We have to wait until the wedding reception, especially the final dance scene to see their open display of affection for Jean. The same dancing eyes that first revealed his admiration in Malaysia. Who would not want to be your Mrs. Boong? As Joe changed from an arrogant figure, almost bigger than life in the jungle of Malaysia, to an ordinary self-conscious Joe in his own backyard, Jean followed the opposite road; his experience of war seems to have given him new confidence. She wasted no time and went after what she wanted. She took steps to take what she could get - just as Joe had told her once. <br /> <br /> For me, all these transformations help to show that this is more than just a love story - this is a story about growth, courage and fragility in life. The lawyer - Noel is a sweet and sad figure. He also gave a lot to Jean - he gave his last hope out of love. In the end, he did what true love requires - he put her happiness ahead of her. <br /> <br /> I happened to like the fight between Joe and Jean that was not in the book. I thought it was an appropriate and necessary addition as it helped expose the internal struggles with which both had to deal in order to make their lives possible together. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm older, maybe I understand life. love and loss a little better. This story touches me even deeper. <br /> <br /> I am, however, surprised to see B. Brown has blue eyes in the promotional photo shown on this site. He definitely did not do it in "A Town Like Alice". Well, 25 years is a long time!
