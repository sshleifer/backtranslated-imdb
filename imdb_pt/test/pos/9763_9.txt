This review contains what can be a spoiler if you have never read the book or seen the cover of the video box. So, if you want to get closer to the movie without knowing anything about it, except that I really like it, stop here ... <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are not the first, but the performance between the leads is and they give the romance between them more life than Shute does in his novel (although I generally prefer the novel). My small objections to the film as opposed to the book is that the film simplifies some of the relationships with the minor characters, and between the main characters in a scene at the end of the film, to provide some unrealistic. dramatic tension and as a general plot device. All of this is handled much better in the book, with the result that I find the end of the book a little more exciting than the end of the movie.
