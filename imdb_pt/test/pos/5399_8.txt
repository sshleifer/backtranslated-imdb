Imaginary Heroes, the remarkable work of Dan Harris, then 24, is labeled "People are never who they seem to be." Perhaps this is wisely chosen as a marketing ploy; however, I rented this film despite the slogan, not because of it. And I'm glad I did. I found the movement an insightful examination of the tragedy. I personally thought it was a movie about dealing with dreams: particularly those who are lost. In the case of a child, "loss" requires a thorough examination of what he had and did not have in his life. However, the central tragedy of the film, while posing compelling issues in itself, mainly acts as the backdrop against which different coping styles are embossed. I believe the film asks about an important question: How do we deal with our dreams, particularly where heroes become imaginary?
