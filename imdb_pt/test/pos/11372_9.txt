I believe it's been over 40 years since I've seen this series, but her memory has not faded a bit. That would be natural for the reissue of the DVD, it seems to me. Many of the artists came to have greater fame (Robert Hardy, Sean Connery, to name a couple); although it was a small role, I still remember Judy Dench, then 20, like Katherine of France (Henry V). She was very kind then as now. <br /> <br /> There is a hint on this site that the series was filmed in color - is it so? Who would have known - virtually no color TV in those days. You're worth it, no VCRs; if so, some may have recorded. As a way to teach the history of the English language, this series has made it live in a way that few classroom teachers can manage. <br /> <br /> What a beautiful re-edition that would be!
