It's a shame that the Gershwin family and Goldwyn Estate have taken this great movie out of view, depriving the public of seeing some of the most wonderful actors and performances ever assembled in a single film. It is also true that the singing voices of Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge have been dubbed for this film, and this is used as one of the reasons why the Gershwin do not want this movie to be released again. Because despite the flaws in the film and the creative differences between the Gershwin and the Goldwyns, this film has some of the most remarkable performances ever made on screen. Sammy Davis, Jr. and Pearl Bailey deserve special praise. <br /> <br /> This film was the big swan of independent producer Samuel Golwyn. It was also, ironically, Gershwin's greatest shame. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is a loss to the wonderful black actors who appeared in it. For we can no longer see them at their best.
