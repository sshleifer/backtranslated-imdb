This is a decent movie. Although it has little time for me, it contains a lot of action, courage, good sense, and emotions in that time period. Matt Dillon and the other main character do a great job in this movie. The emotions and intensity were compelling and tense throughout the film. It's not a typical expensive Hollywood CGI movie, but it was a very rewarding film for the price. My night was great because of this movie. This film is a traditional action movie with great acting, history and direction. I would recommend this movie. The character development of the characters was good and makes you believe you were actually seeing a real event going on. Because this movie I believe was made with cheaper budget, the acting and the quality were much bigger.
