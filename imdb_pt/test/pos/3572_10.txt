Bluff I really think this movie is very good. <br /> <br /> It's a basic type of Colombian film. It's hilarious and the actors use local expressions that are too deep to listen to. <br /> <br /> It shows a different face of Bogota and I think this is very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we need to show it to the world This is director Felipe Martinez's first film and I really except that this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director. <br /> <br /> We need to continue to support the Colombian film industry, because this film and other good films are the beginning of something great.
