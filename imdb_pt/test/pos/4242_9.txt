Chucky (the killer doll of "Child's Play" and 2 bad sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) receives his remains and (using "Voodoo for Dummies") revives him. So, through very complicated circumstances to enter, she is dead and has her soul put on another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a beautiful couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make real people again from Chucky and Tiffany ... <br /> <br /> Well that sounds better. After the last two sequences of "Child's Play" (both horrible), I was expecting the worst, but it really was a lot of fun. The film does not take itself seriously for a second (seriously - how could it?) And the lines and situations are really very funny. There are also some very bloody murders thrown in to satisfy us horror fans and the movie never stops moving. The film also has some things not normally found in a horror movie - a gay friend (Gordon Michael Woolvett) who is smart and does not play for laughs and a sequence in which Stabile is in shirt just to show his muscular body. John Ritter has a great turnout as well as a sheriff. <br /> <br /> The performance is good - Stabile is young, very beautiful and friendly; Heigl does not have much to do but pulls her and Brad Dourif (Chucky's voice) and Tilly are hilarious like the killer dolls. My favorite part is when the dolls have sex (do not ask) and she asks for a rubber and he replies: "But I'm DONE rubber!" The special effects are good (no bad CGI here) and this is one of the few horror movies that mixes humor and violence in a fun way. Worth seeing. I give 9.
