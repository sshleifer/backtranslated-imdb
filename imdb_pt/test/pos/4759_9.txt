I was born in '68 without much parenting guidance, much like what I watched on TV (as a child in the 1970s). I always loved this movie (and French Connection) and always tried to get it whenever I was (checking the Sunday TV Guide ahead of time). I bought it on DVD a few years ago and watched it twice since then and I must say, I still love it !!!! Roy S. was a great actor from the 70s (Jaws is one of my all time favorites, Marathon Man, etc.) and although the 7-ups is not a movie worthy of the Oscar, it puts you exactly in a time in a place (NY, early 70's, as did French Connection) and gives him some difficult characters and a glimpse of life as a cop at the time. And yes, car chase is one of the best ever.
