The thing with Ali G is that he takes the stick off himself and his character. <br /> <br /> Humor is a kind of totally politically incorrect, irreverent, and self-suffocating type. <br /> <br /> Personally, I love this movie, and so has everyone I met who saw it. You can watch it multiple times and pick up new gags up each time. Humor is both auditory and visual, and timing is flawless. The humor is probably very English, and specifically London, so it is possible that viewers who are not in English do not get a little bit of humor. Think of yourself as a teenager and you'll love it - especially if the likes of Kevin & Perry Go Large please you!
