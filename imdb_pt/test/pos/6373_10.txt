I'm glad I'm not the only one to find this series very good. This is the best series for young ladies! I have such a strange taste in comedies and I find it so hard to please my intelligence, and I'm so happy that your mood is exactly what I need. Love the gang of actors! If anyone knows a series or just a movie similar to this, I say pretty please write back because I miss the series. <br /> <br /> And I kindly ask the writers and producers that CONTINUE, even though the actors are now all grown up, I guess! <br /> <br /> Have a good morning / day / night / night! (because I do not know the exact time that you will be reading this post)
