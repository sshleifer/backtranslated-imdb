In a sport that values ​​the eccentricity and treasures of its characters, one of the greatest of them of the 1930s was the pitcher Dizzy Dean. He was such a colorful personality that he was probably elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame based on this, unlike his throwing stats. After all, part of Dean's story is the premature end of his career. <br /> <br /> In St. Louis Pride, Dan Dailey successfully captures the character of Dizzy Dean, at least the Dean I remember. I'm not old enough to remember him, but I remember him broadcasting the Baseball Game of the Week during the 1960s. Well, that's part of Dean's story too, being a pioneer radio station and then television. Now that the announcers are in the Hall of Fame, there's no doubt that Dizzy belongs to him. <br /> <br /> Jerome Herman Dean was one of a tribe of sons of sharecroppers who had very little schooling but an incredible talent for playing a baseball. at an incredible speed. In fact, he had a younger brother, Paul Dean, who was a very good pitcher. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna plays Paul in this film and is one of his earliest film roles. Paul Dean, in real life, was a quiet type of retiring, whose career was also interrupted by injuries. Because of this, Crenna does not have much to work on. During the rector's heyday, sports journalists tried to put Daffy's nickname on Paul, but that never happened. <br /> <br /> Joanne Dru, taking a break, the western girls in gingham dresses and corsets are top notch as the wise, patient, and understanding Patricia Nash who met and married Dizzy while he was playing for Houston in the Texas League. <br /> <br /> In the 1937 All Star Game Dizzy started for the National League. Facing Cleveland's Earl Averill, Dean was struck in the foot by a line thrust toward him. Refusing to listen to medical advice, Dean spoke again too soon. He broke his big toe and put a lot of force on his arm. He was never the same pitcher and his refusal to accept this is part of the story. <br /> <br /> If he had a career of ten to fifteen years, who knows the statistics that he could have divulged. Dean was the next to last pitcher to win 30 games in 1934 and after Denny McLain (who was a kind of character) did it in 1968, that has not been done since. <br /> <br /> Dean entered the broadcast and while he was not the first former player to enter the broadcast booth, his colorful game descriptions made him an instant success. He started broadcasting to the other St. Louis team, the Browns, and the Browns were a very unhappy team with little to cheer. Dean became a major attraction there. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of the rector's story is the problem he had because of his lack of education and his colorful way of expressing himself in the air. This is part of the story that I will not get into but the film is treated with tact and humility and your eyes can moisten if you take care of the sentimental. <br /> <br /> A good baseball movie, a true tribute to an American success story.
