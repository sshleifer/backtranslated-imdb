I had my reservations about watching The Return to Lonesome Dove after seeing and enjoying the original very much. Without Tommy Lee Jones replaying her role as Woodrow Call or Anjelica Huston as Clara, I figured this would not seem authentic enough. Seeing "back", I can honestly say that he is a worthy successor. The actors actually do the show with Jon Voight, Rick Schroder and Oliver Reed, all preformed at their best. I admit the story may not be as engrossing as the first, but the "comeback" definitely has its share of excitement and captures the romance of the old west in a way that few other movies have. Anyone who still has reservations can be sure that The Return to the Lonely Dove can capture the 'feel' of the original and will not disappoint. Do yourself a favor and take a look, Ol 'Gus would be proud!
