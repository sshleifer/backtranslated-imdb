"Challenge to be Free" was one of the first movies I saw as a child. It was also one of the first VHS tapes I ever owned. I had not seen the movie for years, so yesterday I decided to put the tape on and watch it. Wow. The story is as powerful now as it was the first time I saw it. I think now that I'm older, I can better appreciate the values ​​implanted in the film. (Self-confidence, the value of freedom and love of nature) It's a "B" movie, for sure, but it's one you'll remember for years, especially if you see it as a child.
