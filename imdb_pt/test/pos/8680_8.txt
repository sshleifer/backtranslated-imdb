I read most of the reviews here were all seen just the flaws of the movie. I agree, the director is not Kuprik, the actors are not Oscar winners, but there is something that everyone can relate to. I do not want to ruin, but to tell more than the plot - the end of school and the trip to a big party, or if you like to see beyond the metaphor, is to choose the way through life. Remember those days of youth? the days when you or our friend acted like the characters? Or do you think you should have acted as one of them and now you regret not having done it? if you can go back to that time and if you can ask any of these questions, maybe the movie would not be so bad.
