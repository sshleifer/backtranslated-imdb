"That's pretty much the whole soundtrack to this movie. I just saw this baby at the Munich Film Festival and rocked the house. Director Doug Pray is never seen in this documentary, nor do I think he is heard, but he did a close examination of the lives and history of the mixer. He has targeted his film in about eight chapters, and then his motley group of enthusiastic interviews will be tempered according to what they are talking about. I've never been big on "scratching" but the film does a wonderful job of keeping elementary to those who know little, and infusing in-jokes to those who are experts themselves in this area. Mix Master Mike of the Beastie Boys is in this movie, but it was not until after the movie that I could name several heavy hitters in the industry (DJ Shadow, Q-Bert, etc). The extreme turn-on fascination for these talented and quirky DJs is evident in their explanations of what their music means to them. The film also throws some gratifying light on these guys (and a woman) to be classified as musicians. Pray, do not let your movie idle, and if there is a slow scene, it will be re-energized by almost never ceasing music. If nothing else, this movie will increase your vocabulary of slang. I have to go back to "dig", so I'll finish this comment. See, it will be of interest. Good man stuff. Good thing.
