When I watched this movie as a teenager, I tried the soundtrack. Some bands from the soundtrack that I did not know yet. However, during the film, I already realized its quality. U2, Blondie, Police. Quincy Jones, Commodores. Smashing soundtrack. <br /> <br /> In Brazil, this movie has not been on TV for a long time. Today he went on cable TV and I remembered to go to the site to make the comment. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie surprised me a lot, but it's what happens in real life. Not always, what I thought to be the ideal, is what happens. <br /> <br /> Life brings us many surprises.
