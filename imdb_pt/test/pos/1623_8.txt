So the first things first .. <br /> <br /> Angels and Demons is a much better and much different film than the Da-Vinci code. <br /> <br /> After the recent series of comic books, re-images and questionable resurrections of aged franchises. it is refreshing to watch a very solid and entertaining film that is devoid of unstable film techniques, lens reflexes, excessive GCI and on the major action sequences. <br /> <br /> In this regard, Angels and Demons almost seem old-fashioned. It offers a good and thoughtful debate on the old question of the science of religion, offers a glimpse of the parallels between the great houses of God in Rome (beautifully filmed by the way) and the temple of modern science which is the great center of the Cern. hadks collider facility. <br /> <br /> Hanks is Hanks pretending to be the smart guy and he fits in the role much better second time than his wooden performance in Da Vinci. good support is offered by a solid cast, with a special highlight being the stoic Cardinal Armin Mueller-Stahl. but the main grace of the movie is the rhythm. Throughout the runtime, I was totally engrossed in the story, and the movie never gave me time to sit back and sort out its flaws in logic. <br /> <br /> My only serious criticism is that part of the science described is at best the authenticity of the real world. But this is not the fault of the filmmakers, but a remark of the old saying that you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which, the story is cracker, mixing adventure and a race against time with a good dash of intelligence and a good twist or two along the way. <br /> <br /> Overall I recommend this to fans of any of the national treasure movies (which this clearly mimics but with a much more serious vibe) and fans of adventure stories in general.
