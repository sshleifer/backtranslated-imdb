I can not even begin to imagine why everyone hates this movie so much. This made me literally cry from laughing several times ("I trust you slept well?" "Actually, we had a rather difficult night" "ah, the dangers of adultery"). <br /> <br /> Admittedly, the ending is a bit annoying, but it still has its moments (the obvious fake ball of the booger ballet as it flew into the ocean, "beach house paradiso"). <br /> <br /> personally, I think it's the funniest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
