This movie was great, I do not understand disrespect. I first scene that in like 87-88 and it was really scary, If you're a horror fan of the 80's, you should have no problem with this movie, it has everything that makes the 80's terror great. I met some of the actors and they were cool. What is not great about a scary old house, demons, crazy party and young looking good with horny. The dialogue and special fx have made this film a classic. This film also took care of one of these classic rumors about the horror that the black guy does not always have to die in the end. Although this movie was great, there is one thing that has not yet been discovered to me what really happened to the old couple in the movie. The end was on purpose or not that little story that always intrigued me.
