This is my favorite Renoir of the fifties. It is the story of how Henri Danglard built and launched the Moulin Rouge nightclub; we see the workers exploding on the spot to begin the construction and training of the dancers. Finally, the vertigo of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dance. The financial problems and ego displays of the artists are described. <br /> <br /> Gabin is in great shape as the easy Danglard - see him deal humorously with Nini's violent boyfriend. Gianni Esposito is moving like the melancholy prince who is courting Nini. Maria Felix, with the body of that Amazon, is imposing as the selfish Lola, the first lover of Danglard. Finally Françoise Arnoul as Nini, the laundress who ends up dancing to Danglard, and becoming his girl, is simply stunning; its beauty and daring charm will conquer it. <br /> <br /> A bonus: we received Edith Piaf, Patachou, André Claveau and other stars in star appearances a century ago who ruled the Moulin Rouge.
