Mickey Mouse is now 75 years old. It was created by Walt Disney, a famous creator, producer, director etc: I love Disney movies because it's so much fun watching the cartoon movies. Completely Walt Disney I think is the king of creations, Everyone has to love these creations and the Walt Disney films. Thanks Walt for all the classic characters you've made.
