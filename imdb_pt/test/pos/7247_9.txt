Made in the same year as the first Lumiere films, this is a much more dramatic short film than the brothers tried until the 'Niagara' the following year. The surviving copy is very rude, but this only increases the visual violence of Turneresque, while huge waves of water run against an impassive pier, and appear ready to engulf the camera, the viewer. <br /> <br /> If you watch a number of these first short films in chronological order, and try to get into the mentality of the times, there is an additional shock in that, unlike the single frame set-ups of the Lumieres, this film features a edition, which for me any fee, was as sharp as the razor blade in 'Un Chien Andoulu'. Unlike the monodysplasia of Lumieres films, Paul opens up the possibility of multiple perspectives, freeing the viewer from the power of nature, deluding their reach in a way that the Lumieres never succeeded. The second shot has a stream similar to that of Niagara, but it's less scary because, through editing, we avoid the danger. In a film like 'L'Arroseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', nature remains indifferent and powerful, unattainable by the camera. The basic grammar of the film puts an end to its supremacy.
