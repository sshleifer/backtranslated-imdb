Across the bridge: the sound of Istanbul received one of the most breathtaking applause of the audience when it ended and very deservedly. I did not expect much from a musical documentary, but the film proved to be much more than that. It was also a visual documentary of Istanbul with grotesque contrasts of old and new, western and eastern, poor and rich, modern and traditional. Black and white photographs of old Istanbul by world-renowned Armenian photographer Ara Guler were exceptional. But of course the main theme was music and, by God, what variety! It was in a similar way to Bueno Vistas Social Club; the love and respect of the interviewer - Alexander Hacke here replacing Ray Cooder - by the musicians exuded from the screen and involved us all. The music was very interesting. The jazz session by a group of gypsy gypsies in a small western Turkish town was astonishing. I will not be surprised if travel agents start receiving group booking requests for Kesan after the movie is released. But I loved Muzeyyen Senar, who looked incredibly elegant in a burlesque manner and at the same time tilting his "Raki" boldly stated: "My voice and I have 86 years!" Well done Faith Akin. I bet there are many more Turkish musicians who are feeling excluded: go to Volume II, please.
