I recently saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between the personage of Jacqueline Bisset and the personage of Michael Brandon. The rented version did not have this scene. I imagined that? <br /> <br /> Or, is this part of the "cleaning" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions that some people find are not "appropriate"? <br /> <br /> I love this movie - it's exactly like the friendship between a friend and me and we've been friends for 25 years and I've seen it together. Her husband also thought we were. Thank you, Joan
