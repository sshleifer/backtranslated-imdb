When I saw this on TV I was nervous ... what if they screwed up? Millions of families like mine, living with a man with brain problems, in my case, my father, would be disappointed. I watched with my mother and we both ended up crying, was as accurate and captured as the family feels as good as the person who suffered the brain injury. The actors were all wonderful and I had no complaints, my mothers told me she could not stop thinking about it. I hope this program has made many people aware of what it is like to live with brain damage and how it is for families. More programs like this should be done, I was surprised at how good it was and really rocked me emotionally.
