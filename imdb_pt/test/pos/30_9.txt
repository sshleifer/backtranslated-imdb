'The Dresser' is one of those movies that are so perfect that you really struggle to find something that does not like them. Written by Ronald Harwood (himself a former commode of the legendary Donald Wolfit), he shines with energy and true love for life behind the reflectors. <br /> <br /> As' Sir ', the dominant actor and main focus of the play, Albert Finney is a joy to watch out for complaining of the lack of a storm during the' wind blow, little wind '...' of 'King Lear' or talking to his loyal stage manager, Madge (Eileen Atkins, good as ever) about the old days. Like Norman, his camp wardrobe, Tom Courtenay makes a fabulous presentation, babbling at the sound of the so-called Lear, picking up a bottle to go to the pub or depreciating the fool, Mr. Davenport-Scott (often mentioned, but never saw! ). In an engaging supporting cast, there is Edward Fox as Oxenby (a typical arrogant second leader), Zena Walker as his Ladyship, Lockwood West as the Fool substitute, and many others. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of energy, bringing with it some of the weights of its stage origins, true, but being so well acted, you do not realize. Very well done indeed.
