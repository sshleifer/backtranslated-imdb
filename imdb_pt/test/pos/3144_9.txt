I saw this movie the same night I saw 6 other shorts. This was a leap ahead of others in terms of acting quality, direction, filming and originality of the story. It comes along with a professionalism that is often lacking in short films. <br /> <br /> This is a great short film for the following reasons: 1. Amazing performances. The two actresses are convincing and confident instantly. His chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, although the film is 10 minutes long. The acting and direction are very powerful. <br /> <br /> 2. Beautifully filmed. Lighting, framing and filming are usually impressive. The 35mm film differentiates this film from other short films. And what a difference it makes. Filming is worthy of this movie. <br /> <br /> 3. Strong history. Often, short films try to do very little or too much over time. Or they are trying to tell a predictable story. This is a good balance of telling an interesting story without prolonging it too much or leaving you unsatisfied. You wonder what will happen next, while at the same time feeling that you have seen something happen. <br /> <br /> Interesting result too. Praise without overpowering. <br /> <br /> If you can find this at a festival, make an effort to see it.
