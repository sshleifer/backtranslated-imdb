Why did Ramon (Carlos Fuentes) take his five college classmates to a scary abandoned school building that used to serve the children of wealthy black sheep? That answer may be in a journal in his possession supposedly written by his dying father. What they come into contact with is actually a revived episode involving another group of six, with five of them presumably finding graphic destinations at the hands of a sadistic security guard (Paul Naschy) that occurred 20 years ago. But as they seek a way to escape from this place, terror awaits them as this horrifying moment repeats itself as the group runs through their lives, often in a state of panic when the killer begins to hunt them down and destroy them in various bloody . ways. Will Ramon and his friends survive this night of terror or will they turn into ghosts forever repeating the same night as those who preceded them? <br /> <br /> The elegant Spanish slasher has that professional glow and powerful and shocking violence to match. Some spirited exchanges between the characters ... in their dialogues, are references from pop culture to American horror films that may irritate some viewers. A demented Naschy is really fierce with the kittens as he happily attacks them. A bloodthirsty maniac who performs his violent acts with pleasure. I found the noisy musical tips a little annoying and filmmakers often use flashbacks from previous events in the movie as reminders to the audience. I do not think these tricks are necessarily needed, but I felt that the director wanted to communicate in-depth with the viewer, hence the use of clues and flashbacks. A small detour to the plot of this movie keeps moving and the camera follows the rhythm of the characters and how they react to the chaotic situation presented to them. Your enjoyment in this film may, in the end, come to your acceptance of the supernatural paranormal aspects of the plot. Moments in time revived and an assassin continuing his work apparently from the tomb. The turnaround seems a bit shocking and abrupt, but this may (or may not) work considering how the story unfolds as to why Ram√≥n's father is shown among those ghosts who staged these terrible events two decades earlier. I'm going to say that this movie probably would not hold up if examined in detail, but like a horror movie, it's a breath of fresh air.
