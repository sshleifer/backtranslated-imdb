How can people give this movie a low rating? Unbelievable. The performances of Wilkinson and Watson are so full of merit that I can only imagine that these detractors were weaned in blockbusters and pornography. (If that sounds grumpy, it's because I just wiped my original 400 word words now). I was so impressed with Tom Wilkinson. Everyone salutes the guy. This is a performance of considerable subtlety and enormous skill. His development as an actor in The Full Monty for this performance masterpiece is incredible; One of the best things that happened in the movies in the last ten years. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson is a little less authoritative due to the glint in her eyes that says' see me? This cheeky woman here? You can not guess what I'm going to do next because I do not know either! It seems to be something she can not help but show us in every role, but yet she is an actor of incredible ability and presence. She is very sexy here, as she needs to be, and fair play for her so: this is a screen quality that normally, for me, she has not in previous films. <br /> <br /> How Can You Expect Rupert Everett to be required to make a high-class movie for up to 30 years that could give PhD-level tutorials on How Not to Give a Shit to Go to Hell on Account of total selfishness. He's so skinny here over the course of the movie, however, I'm worried about him. Linda Bassett's housewife is also excellent: a small role, but with a great plot to deliver, it makes you reflect on how much talent we have in Britain in terms of character acting. I want to see more of her. <br /> <br /> The narrative bow is fine; is an interesting enough plot, given that no one in film production seems to be trying to convince Joe Public that there is nothing new under the sun even though he shifts to the '40s melodrama in the last reel. But do not worry - that's a great 80-minute figure for anyone with half-brain money. Congratulations to Julian Fellowes for his first directing work: how we need more such substance-like films. It shows a lot of skill in terms of adapting the original novel, telling a story very effectively and subtly. And congratulations also for conjuring up an immense display of the art of the actor in Mr. Tom Wilkinson. What an old man. <br /> <br /> T.
