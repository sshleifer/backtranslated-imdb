That's probably on my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was very different! He mocked Robin Hood, and it was HILARIOUS! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well it acted it was! In addition to Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I particularly love music; "We're men in pantyhose!" If you have a good sense of humor, you will love this movie!
