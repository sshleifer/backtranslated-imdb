Lucio Fulci's most respected film, "Do not Torture a Duckling," is highly renowned for its bold subject, gruesome images and strong plots. The terror falls on a small Italian village, when young people begin to appear assassinated, engulfing the confused and determined authorities, in addition to a mystery dedicated to the mystery. Was it the scary hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the prostitutes? The rich girl? Someone? Contrary to the frequent representation of most fans about the violent content of the movie - I consider it to be much more driven by plot lines; presenting only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and planks). In no way does it detract from the positive attributes that this film offers. Fulci proves himself fully capable of distributing a hell of a dark and disturbing giallo with child kills, black magic and, of course, a good complete set of knockoffs ... Although I am particularly more in love with "Lizard in a Woman" than Fulci. Skin "and" New York Ripper "," Do not torture a duckling "dominates the giallo genre as a mysterious and thought-provoking murder mystery!
