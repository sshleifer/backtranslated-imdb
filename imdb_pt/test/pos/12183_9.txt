*** It may contain spoilers *** OK, it was not exactly as good as expected, actually it was very different from what I thought it would be, but it still turned out to be a really good movie. <br /> <br /> I usually do not care much about this kind of music, but in this movie it worked perfectly (I mean duh he's a rock star) but after all I loved Stuart Townsend in that, and Aaliyah, even though she had a small part of the movie was amazing. <br /> <br /> And even though Tom Cruise has played Lestat in the Interview with a Vampire, I have to admit that I am glad he has refused the role even though I hate it when they use different people to play the same characters in sequels and things like that. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was great and I enjoyed watching it, even though there were parts that could have been better. Great vampire movie.
