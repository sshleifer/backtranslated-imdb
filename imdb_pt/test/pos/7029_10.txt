<br /> <br /> When this movie was released, I dismissed it as a light pop nonsense. That was a mistake. <br /> <br /> After repeated visions and seeing a documentary of the making of DIRTY DANCING, discovering the depth of this film certainly increases its appeal. <br /> <br /> DIRTY DANCING is a movie about change. The evolving nature of relationships within the family, changes in the world view during the adulthood, etc. The story takes place during August of 1963, the final weeks of the last summer of innocence for the American people. The many personal changes experienced by the characters reflect the many changes in American society that would be marked by the assassinations of Kennedy and Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Film lovers loved this movie and repeated their trips to theaters. is the most successful dance film in the world. As a man I find the romantic pairing of ultimate stud Patrick Swayze with very simple Jennifer Gray very difficult to accept. This would be fatal to most romantic dramas, and may also have created the intense aversion expressed by most male critics. <br /> <br /> The film's soundtrack found status # 1 before the movie's release. Even today it is almost impossible to attend a wedding reception without hearing a song from DIRTY DANCING. <br /> <br /> Near the center of the film, Baby's mother wakes up and asks Baby's father, "Is something wrong?" <br /> <br /> Baby's father, the anti-change family member, tries to keep everything that's going on in secret. He tells his wife to go back to sleep. However, resist as one can, the change is unbeatable. DIRTY DANCE is the story of a person waking up only in the final moments of our country's last sleep in innocence.
