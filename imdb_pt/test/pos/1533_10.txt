I am deeply grateful to have seen this movie. The acting is astounding, the film itself is powerful and clear, and the issues involved are treated with subtlety and depth. <br /> <br /> This is an important movie. It could be profoundly transformative. <br /> <br /> I would pay good money to never see it again. Because it is so good and so complex, it is extremely difficult to watch. I admit that my liking for movies tends strongly to light entertainment; the visual medium can be so powerful that I try to avoid it for anything really important. Those of you with greater courage than I can find easier to deal with. <br /> <br /> But I encourage people to see it at least once. Preferably with others, so you can talk and have someone around to remind you that there is more in the world than the movie.
