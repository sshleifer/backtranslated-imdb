This movie was awesome !!!! I did not know the story behind it, so I needed to let it unfold before me on DVD. He had many twists, but still kept the story fresh and exciting. Elaine Cassidy's acting was in a brilliant word, as was Sally Hawkins. The plot is rich in plausible occurrences as well as new ideas of the present. <br /> <br /> There is really something about Mrs. Cassidy's eyes that leaves "a mark". This film is a refreshing look at how we see the "Victorian times" and how we view this society. A very interesting watch.
