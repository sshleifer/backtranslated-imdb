I do not know why critics say it's bizarre and macabre. I really do not know. Dark -yes, bizarre - no. It is sad and full of emotions, especially with the history of Pinguin. They say it has S & M elements, but I do not really find anything like that except for Catwoman's whip. <br /> <br /> This movie is deeper than its genre and villains are not just some crazy crazies dressed up as in a masquerade. They have strong motives with strong feelings involved. It's not just a sexy girl who likes steel jewelry - she's on her personal crusade and Pinguin ... well, at the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him (Danny's strong performance) DeVito). Again, I think Michael Keaton is the best Batman and he carries his costume well. <br /> <br /> You can see it's a Tim Burton movie because it has an unusual style and is a very talented guy. But also the music is fantastic and fits into the emotions.
