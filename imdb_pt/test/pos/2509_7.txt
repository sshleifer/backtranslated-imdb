Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a bookstore in the sleepy seaside town of Loblolly by the Sea. Divorced, Helen has a small daughter who goes camping during the summer, giving the mother a little more freedom. Working at Helen's store, is manager, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), a fairy gossip who has eyes for the handsome firefighter, George (Tom Selleck) and two young college students, Jennifer (Julianne Nicholson) and Johnny (Tom Everett Scott ). One day, Helen stumbles on a romantic and tender love letter and suspects Johnny has written to her. Throwing cautiously into the wind, Helen and Johnny start a small "thing." But later the letter falls into the hands of others, including Janet, who thinks George sent her to her, and Johnny's, who imagines Helen writing it to him. And so on, the letter goes. But, in fact, George possibly has eyes for Helen and Jennifer fell in love with Johnny. The curator of the city museum can also have a secret love. Will such tangled affairs always straighten out? This is a cute movie with beautiful scenery and capable stars. Each of the leading actors delivers an enjoyable performance, including the addition of Blythe Danner and Gloria Stuart to those previously mentioned. So also, the coastal landscape is more lovely, the costumes are well chosen and the picture is really very good. There are a few surprises, including a subtle gay plot development, which may not please all onlookers. But for those who love romantic comedies, this should be included in any list of good choices for the genre.
