"Radio Flyer" is one of my most beloved American films. The really great job of two boys, Joe Mazzello and Elija Wood, (despite T.Hanks' poor performance at the beginning and end). ...) with wonderful script from DMEvans and powerful and emotional direction from R.Donner's more Absolutely Incredibly Peerless Music Score from H.Zimmer allowed the "Radio Flyer" to gain one of the top places in my family's movie ratings. It's so unfortunate that this very good movie has been criticized by some movie critics. <br /> <br /> I can not help waiting to see on DVD.
