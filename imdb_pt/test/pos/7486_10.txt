This movie is great. Not because it does something special or new, but because it is consistently great in all its parts. No part stands out as being "groundbreaking" or "stellar," but all parts are way above mediocre, and that makes for me an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> I own several copies of this movie. , and can get it on DVD or Blu-Ray collectors, one day (arresting now, due to the high prices of blu-ray, and of course, the face I do not have a Blu-ray player ... but this <br /> <br /> It begins out of ordinary, but quickly turns into a drama filled with tension, some action, strongly portrayed characters, and a plot well outside that keeps you interested until the very end. <br /> <br /> Wait, no, it does not get ordinary. <br /> <br /> It starts as if it were a Qun. <br /> Tar. <br /> Wish it could be. <br /> With an incredible scene where an attempt to buy coffee and a donut goes ... very, very wrong. <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie, nothing was as it seemed, and some people are dead, and some people are very rich.I will not tell you who ... watch and enjoy! Overall Rating: 10/10, A **, Excellent!
