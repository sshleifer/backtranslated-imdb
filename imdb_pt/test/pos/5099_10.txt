Peter O'Toole is Arthur Chipping the Latin Teacher, with strict observance of detail and meticulousness, helping young minds understand the meaning and definition of Latin words and phrases. He is seen to be cold and unjust and is not in touch with the times. But meeting stage actress Katherine Briskit (Petula Clark), not only in a late dinner after a London presentation in London, but in an amphitheater in Greece, her closed world begins to open. Goodbye Mr. Chips is a remake of MGM's 1939 MGM movie. During this period, the musicals were released and the Hollywood studio system was in total disarray. When they debuted in Los Angeles and London in New York, the musical numbers were left intact, but when it came to the major street theaters around the world, it went without songs thus making the film shorter and more open. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the MGM / UA Home Video under Ted Turner in the late 1980s, early 1990s, when VHS and Laser Disc were the major home video formats, musical numbers were reinstituted and the gaps were closed. Laserdisc was the only format chosen to see Goodbye Mr. Chips in Widescreen Letterbox Format. <br /> <br /> For some time, the Original Soundtrack was only available in the original version of Vinyl and Cassette Tape. still today can be found on Ebay. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the wonderful people of Film Score Monthly.com in 2006, the soundtrack was digitally remastered and remixed into a set of 3 CDs with the score completely rebuilt. the general score of the release album, and the narrated sequences originate music and interviews. You also get 1 unused song that is a true lost gem, Petula Clark's "Tomorrow with Me" that would have been cast in place of "You and I" before hand. <br /> <br /> This film is both a classic musical and a true tribute to educators everywhere. I would certainly buy this movie if Warner Bros. MGM and Sony put their money wherever their mouth is and restore that movie from all movie sources and put it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the bells and whistles put back Put with all the extras you can find and stuff in one launch.
