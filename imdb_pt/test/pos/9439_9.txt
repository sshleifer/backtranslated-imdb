What is the most violent movie of all time? Rambo III? Command? Robocop? Add these three very violent together, and you still will not be equal to the carnage in The Stabilizer, the craziest, craziest and craziest action movie I've ever seen. For a hundred minutes, things explode and people die in dozens of strange ways. It will make you laugh and cheer, and when it's all over you will be more than a little exhausted. This movie is a hidden gem, a cult classic that unfortunately has no cult. <br /> <br /> The Stabilizer is the nickname of our hero Peter Goldson (Peter O'Brian), a big, greasy man with a curly mullet. He arrives in Indonesia on the villain trail and means Greg Rainmaker. We know that he is evil because he is mentioned only by his full name ("I hate SCUM as Greg RAINmaker!") And uses a killing method that is so horrible that I can not even say it here. Wait, yes I can. He steps on people in spiked shoes. Greg Rainmaker: Cleat Killer. <br /> <br /> When Greg Rainmaker is not pouring alcohol into women for his sexual pleasure, he is kidnapping important teachers and leading a huge underworld empire. It's up to Goldson (a Jewish action hero? Gevalt!) And his heterogeneous team of helpers to stabilize the situation by killing everyone and blowing up a lot. Perhaps "stabilizing" has a different meaning in Indonesia. <br /> <br /> And violence, oh violence. This is a movie without will, it is not possible, to let five minutes of screen pass without some kind of explosion, stabbing, car accident or abortion interrupting the dialogue. Violence is extreme; It's not graphic and bloody, it's really very strange. For example, the Stabilizer and the company invade one of Rainmaker's warehouses (driving through a solid concrete wall on a motorcycle, of course). When perched on the porch, with heavy fire coming from below, the Stabilizer does the only thing it can do. He directs the balcony to the guy's head, the front tire jumping like a basketball. Amazing. <br /> <br /> Of the excessively gratuitous love scenes (both the main female characters jumping in the bag with the hero of their choice, not two minutes after speaking alone for the first time) to the poorly dubbed dialogue ("Victor, you talented bastard! ") The Stabilizer has it all. This is a movie for the ages, up there with Citizen Kane and Gymkata. Not widely available at launch. If you find it anywhere for any price, buy it and savor insanity. <br /> <br />
