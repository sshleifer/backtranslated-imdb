This production of Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark is by far the best I have seen. Although it may not have the production value of some of the more recent adaptations, it has the most important element: Sir Derek Jacobi as Hamlet. Jacobi's portrait of the troubled Prince is multifaceted and fascinating. . His displays of emotion range from hatred to sadness, love to revenge, and everywhere else on the map, but without seeming forced or exaggerated. In fact, some of the most powerful sequences occur when he underestimates them, with stillness, soft talk, and pensive expression. As for interpreting Hamlet as crazy or are ... well, you should decide for yourself; I've changed my mind more than once. At one point, it seems that he considered himself to be sane and simply toying with madness, but he suspects that he is indeed really mad ... a revelation to himself, captured beautifully. Having performed the role of Hamlet onstage more often than any other actor in history, Jacobi's affinity for the role is no surprise. As for the production itself, it is presented as a kind of "filmed-copy" of the stage play, with little special effects or capricious camera work, minimal ensembles and no musical accompaniment to speak of . This production relies on the acting prowess of the cast, and the words of Shakespeare, to evoke the emotion and interest of its audience. And this works. The other players are also excellent, particularly Patrick Stewart's "Claudius" and Claire Bloom's "Gertrude." Together, the cast presents a perfect ensemble. <br /> <br /> The last element (but far from being the least) that makes this production stand out is the piece itself. Here is presented in its entirety, a rarity in the film. But, curiously enough, I never realized the time. I was too busy getting caught up in the story. I suspect you do too.
