This is a very sad and moving film! It deals with the subject of child abuse. It's very sad, but mostly a true story, because it happens every day. Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello play the two children or Lorraine Bracco, a single mother who just tries to make a home for them. While living with parents, a man who likes to be called "The King" comes into their lives. He hits the younger boy, Bobby, but the two brothers promise not to tell their mother. But finally she finds out, after Bobby gets hurt badly. The final kind of ruined it for me, because it's totally unbelievable. But except for this, I love the movie.
