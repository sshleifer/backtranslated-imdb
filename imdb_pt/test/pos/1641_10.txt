This was really a tense and somber episode. Excellently executed, wonderful acting and atmospheric direction, 'Ice' is one of my favorite episodes. Together with Wettested and Home Grotesque (these are pretty good in dark environments in my case) Looks pretty realistic to me, their paranoia, their suspicion and their growing rage was perfectly executed by the great actors. However, 'Ice' had a problem that I overcame after some watches: it was too short! I WANTED MORE! <br /> <br /> Overall, 'ice' had what 98% of all episodes of X Files have: Excellent acting, Intense story-writing, hard drive. All works. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
