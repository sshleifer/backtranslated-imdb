The basic plot of this movie has already been detailed in several other reviews, so I will not bother. I would first like to praise the producer, the cast, the directors, and the crew for creating a wonderfully engaging movie with a meager $ 1 million budget, a small fraction of the normal Hollywood fare that does not seem cheap. These people have the ability to do something new and fun without spending a fortune doing it. This is essentially art for art. I know, I know, some of you will decide that this is not art, but something smaller and okay. I, at least, am happy that people like these will continue to invest time and effort to our benefit without waiting huge multimillion rewards. <br /> <br /> Now to criticism. I feel that the scenario presented is credible to a point. It's wonderful when everything works and the hero / heroine saves the day and all is well when it ends well. What strikes me is the blatant manipulation of events so that blind luck is more responsible than courage and strength. <br /> <br /> When Lee was attacked but not seriously injured, somehow she appeared on a mud bank next to the dead guide. Then, miraculously, his loaded revolver is still in the holster and actually works (after a few cleanups and gossip). Finally, when Lee is attacked on the mud bank and jumps into the water, once again the croc can not kill it. She ends up with her hand in his mouth and pulls the trigger repeatedly, to end the crocodile's brain (literally). <br /> <br /> I came to the conclusion that having Lee walk hand in hand. talking to croc was just a way to end the movie with the human in triumph. Based on what I saw, the crocodile attack continues and continues until the prey stops fighting. Croc will spin around and dismember and drown the prey. This happened to the first 3 victims, but not to Lee. She had teeth marks, but they were not deep. <br /> <br /> I think the end would have been better if the croc had won, frankly, thus proving its dominance of the mangrove, its territory for millions of years. But then, how many of us would be upset or disappointed that the beautiful girl did not come out alive?
