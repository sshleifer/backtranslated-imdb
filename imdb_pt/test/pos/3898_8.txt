"A Slight Murder Case" is an excellent TV movie, which is worth the price of a rental. William H. Macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his lover and then tries to hide the crime. While this may seem gloomy, the film is actually quite light and funny with many memorable lines ("Act is harder than I thought - have you ever seen BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology" and my personal favorite. "For the next week answer these two questions about film noir, What do these people do during the day and why is it always raining?) The film has a large supporting cast, including Macy's wife Felcity Huffman, James Cromwell and Adam Arkin. Must see for Macy fans!
