I had never heard of this movie when it was given to me to translate so I did not know what to expect. I checked the IMDb and I was curious. It did not take long to realize that this was a gem. Performances are excellent, great story, and it is well run and well written. It's hard to compare it to other films, but "Stay with me" comes to mind, although it has so many differences of "The cure" as similarities. The tale of an extraordinary friendship between the boys, plus the dramatic and comic elements are the most obvious similarities between this film and "Stand by me." Other than that, "The Cure" is a good movie by itself, and it's worth a wider recognition. It is dramatic, but also adventurous, sad but also good-humored. I can not think of a single thing that bothers me about it. Having said that, I do not want to give the impression that it is a "perfect movie", whatever that means, but rather that I enjoyed it immensely, I was very moved by it and would not change anything about it. I will not go into a detailed description of the story / plot, partly because it would be too general or too revealing, and partly because you can find this information elsewhere on the site. In closing, I can only say: wonderful film, see if you have the chance.
