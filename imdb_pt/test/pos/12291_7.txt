Leos Carax made three great films: Boys Meet Girls, Mauvais Sang, Les Amants du Pont Neuf. In fact, these movies were not so good, but have the violence of youth, the beauty of the juvenile wilderness. Carax, in these three films, was well aware of what movie was, but tried to make his own view of art, without thinking of everything he saw, but using it and fusing it in his day. Pola X is a very different film because Carax made Les Amants du Pont Neuf, a 20 million dollar monstrosity, a movie that destroyed everything in its path. After such a movie you can not make another from the same point of view. So, Leos Carax has to change, and he did. The film is not as beautiful as the first, it is more reasonable, there is no more studio, no more dreams about Paris, Carax has entered the last reality. It is not cleaner, they are not poetic characters. Carax became a romantic in the German sense.
