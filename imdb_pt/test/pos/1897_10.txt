The best movie ever made. Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero. Whether dealing with everyday life, whether with pimping, I can always seek inspiration and guidance from him. When it comes to blaxploitation, Rudy is the man. No one is evil. Watch Dolemite as he and his army of kung fu killers just for women knock out Mr. Big and Willie Green. Incredible plot, huh? There are so many unique lines that multiple views are needed to enhance your vocabulary. If you say a few lines of Dolemite, you will be instantly legal. If you're in the mood for a riot of laughter, rent this movie. Also check out The Human Tornado, Disco Godfather, and Petey Wheatstraw, the devil's son-in-law. Now, can you dig it? <br /> <br /> "You do not have business, insecure, rat-eater, motha !! '"
