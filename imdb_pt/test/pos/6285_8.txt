When I first saw that this movie was going to be aired on TV, I was just new to pauly shore like that joke of a comedian who wore really strange clothes in the past. I still decided to watch and was impressed. shore brings a new breath of air to the screen. In this film, he plays with a college advisor who probably also needs his own advisor. Carla gugino, in an understated role, plays Becca, a Midwest "country girl" with a simple family and a travis movie clich√© boyfriend. when she goes to Ucla, she finds a crawl and he quickly turns her into a blonde, bubbly Californian girl. she decides to bring crawling home for the Thanksgiving break. When Travis decides to propose, becca needs a distraction. crawl then decides to make everyone believe he and Becca are already involved. this leads to crawling up the romance between Becca's parents, befriending her brother, and even causing the dancers at the local bar to break loose. I will not reveal the end, but I liked it. however, do not rent if you want a pungent performance; rent it if you want to laugh and enjoy a bit of humor from the 90's.
