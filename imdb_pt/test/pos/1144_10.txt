I saw this movie at school and I loved it. Based on a true story, this is an absolutely splendid masterpiece of a movie. Seriously, I could not find anything wrong with that. One definite advantage is how it was filmed. Situated in Morocco in 1904, the wind and the lion is filled with thrilling images such as the Grand Raisuli on horseback, especially. The cinematography was impeccable, the editing was sharp, the costumes were beautiful and the scenery was breathtaking. And I have to mention the music of Jerry Goldsmith, it was phenomenal. I've used this phrase quite recently, but Goldsmith is not my favorite movie composer for nothing. His score here is so exciting and exciting, it shows the true musical genius of man, and this gem of a score should be up there with top scores from Goldsmith with Legend, Rambo: First Blood, Patton and The Secret of NIMH. <br /> <br /> The action is exciting and the script is smart and sophisticated. The steering is treated with sensitivity as well. The performances were also surprising, with Sean Connery, always the image of charisma and softness, magnificent as the Great Raisuli, he almost dominates the whole image on his own. He is accompanied by an upbeat Candice Bergen, a crafty John Huston and a captivating Brian Keith in one of his most unobtrusive performances. The story is quite accurate, perhaps fragile in some areas, but with the performance, music and visuals so good that I came to love. 10/10 Bethany Cox
