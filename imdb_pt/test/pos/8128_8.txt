An inspired choice of director for this latest Brit-Flick, Rose Troche, who came on the scene with the free tale of NY Dykes, _Go Fish_ brings a view gently attached to this tale of a Londoner choosing the slightly inappropriate environment of a liaison society male to declare their desire for a mate of male truths. The highlight for me is a scene in which society tries to return to being primitive hunter-gatherers, but ends up asking for a take-away. The film as a whole is beautifully portrayed and Troche, who would never be accepted by some of the lesbians she portrayed in her previous film, takes advantage of the larger budget by indulging in some wonderfully time-consuming photos that contrast with Go Fish's granular hyperkinesia. A really fun movie
