I really enjoyed this movie - not so much for the story (which was fine but was a bit slow at some points), but even more so for the incredibly beautiful scenery of Greece and the Greek islands! Susan Sarandon is totally engrossing as the carefree loving interest of John Cassavetes - a man "on the edge." But the scenery! Oh oh oh!
