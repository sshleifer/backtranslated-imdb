As a robocop fan, I've always loved this movie. I saw it when it was released, and finally bought it on DVD from Brazil, it was never released in the US on DVD. I like the movie, but like everything in this world, everyone has their opinion, loves or hates. no matter what a movie does, someone will always say "why did not they do it another way?" in other words, you can not please everyone. if you love robocop, you'll love this movie. to me, it's so unique that it's not tacky, or silly like a lot of low-budget movies. this movie has always kept me interested. I can see some scenes that Robocop borrowed from here, but tell me what movies do not do that? many movies use other ideas from other movies and sometimes change them. funny movie!
