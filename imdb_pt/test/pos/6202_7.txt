I liked this series but felt that the whole thing was disappointed by the recording / mixing sound. <br /> <br /> For whatever reason, they have had to employ a huge amount of what is called ADR where the actors replace the original location sound with a new recording in a sound booth. <br /> <br /> The reasons for this are usually due to problems on the spot, or because someone has gone wrong somewhere in the sound production chain. <br /> <br /> It would not be so bad if ADR was well done, but sometimes it's just a distraction. It's not just the ADR that's the problem - sound mixing does not match the quality of performance and images. <br /> <br /> I would be curious to know what went wrong.
