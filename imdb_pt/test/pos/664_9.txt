STMD! is one of the funniest and funniest low budget movies I've seen in a while. Director Jeff Smith (who also served as co-writer, director of photography and editor) definitely shows his love of underrated horror movies from the '80s with this movie! Anyone who loves the fights, absurd situations, eccentric and stereotyped characters from the 80s horror movies will love this homage to the past. <br /> <br /> STMD! definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some. It has all the "excessive violence" and "free nudity" that is reminiscent of those who entertain the horror movies of the 80's that we all love. I had a blast watching STMD! From the 80s costumes that the stereotypical characters use to splash the blood to the silly tone I could not get enough!
