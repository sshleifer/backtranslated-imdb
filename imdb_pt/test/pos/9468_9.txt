I saw this movie in a special exhibit. At first I thought the movie would be like a typical Amanda Bynes movie, but I was wrong. The film is based on Shakespeare's book "The Twelth Night". This movie tells the story of a girl who lives to play football. Well, when the girls 'team is cut off, she has to work hard to get into the boys' team at a different school to get revenge on the team of selfish guys at her old school. Along the way, she gets caught in a long tangled web of love, lies and deception. This movie is this year Evil Girls. I think this shows some great new actor skills and there are defiantly some great stars to be featured in this movie.
