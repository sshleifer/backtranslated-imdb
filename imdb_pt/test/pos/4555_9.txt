During my trip to a youth leadership forum, I was surfing the channel until I found "Tommy Boy" on TBS. Since I've never seen this movie before, I wanted to check it out. My roommate, who already saw this, told me, "This movie is a classic." After seeing the whole movie, I came to the conclusion that he was right. "Tommy Boy" is constantly funny from start to finish, thanks to the comic duo of Chris Farley and David Spade. Farley is a riot as the title character, a spasmodic jerk who just walks through life as if it were not important. His laziest ways soon stop when his father (Brian Dennehy), a rich "Break Pads King", dies of heart attack on the day of the wedding. This leads Tommy, with the help of his sarcastic childhood friend Richard (David Spade), to take the road to sell enough to save the company. <br /> <br /> The main motive of "Tommy Boy" run funny performances from the main cast. Farley is the funniest person in this movie, the funniest second person being Spade and the third, Rob Lowe as the bad guy in the movie. Another funny guy is Dan Aykroyd as Ray Zalinsky, a well-known autonomous extraordinare. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the movie works is the plethora of jokes. Chris Farley has hilarious moments, and David Spade has malicious comments and catch phrases. The jokes in the film (some involving a deer and a bathroom by airplane) are funny, thanks to director Peter Segal (Naked Gun 33 1/3), writers Bonnie & Terry Turner <br /> ("3rd Rock From the Sun, That 70s Show "), and the cast. "Tommy Boy" is a very funny movie, although for some unknown reason most movie critics (including Roger Ebert) find it horrible and bland. (I wonder when his sense of humor died.) I recommend "Tommy Boy" to those who are great comedy fans. Thank you so much roommate.
