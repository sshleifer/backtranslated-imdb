Fuckland is an interesting movie. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it had lasted longer. Looks like he's dead. Many critics have tried their best to turn it off. I do not know why. It is the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematographic world since the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland, I saw the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne and Mifune. They were all great, Festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland is not with the others. I was just fascinated with the movies. It is played as if it were a real documentary, with a real person so obsessed with his camera that he refused to put it on paper. In some parts of the film, it is clear that this is a work of complete fiction, but this illusion was delayed by an incredible period of time. I wish the filmmakers had something more interesting to put on the screen. It's basically about this guy, Fabian, who is an Argentinean visiting the Faulkland Islands. The Argentines were only allowed in the last two months on the islands, and Fabian plans to impregnate the women with Argentine children. He gazes at one of them, and most of the film is spent in his seduction. The two actors are very natural. Camilla Heany only suggests that she is an actress. Fabian Stratas looks completely real. The politics of the film is a bit confusing to me, as I have only an idea of ​​the situation around the island and its recent history. I was 3 years old, I think, when the Faulklands were invaded. The final part of the movie does not work at all. I do not understand what the filmmakers were going there for. Still, Fuckland is an interesting Dogma experiment. It breaks some rules of Dogma, notably the rule of non-extra-diagetic music. There is a lot of it. 7/10
