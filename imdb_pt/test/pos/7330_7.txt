I like this movie. I may be partial because I love dolphins. However, my 3 and 4 year olds. The old man will sit and watch the whole movie ... It's not Oscar stuff, but definitely fun. The dolphin cinematography is well done with a beautiful backdrop of oceanic landscapes and sunsets. My favorite scene is when Flipper "plays" the pop of water hitting Sandy's head. It's a funny moment that makes me laugh all the time. On the other hand, the villainous games of the boatman bully (forget his name) are a little hard to accept. And the shark scene is far from reality. Question: Do dolphins really make so much noise? Or are there any serious dubbing going on here? Bottom line: my kids enjoy and continue to recycle through our VCR.
