My girls 4 and 6 love this show. We stumbled on a PBS station and they always ask when it's turned on now. This reminds them of their grandmother who takes care of them every day in the summer. It's funny too and sometimes they just can not stop talking about one scene or another. I would definitely recommend this show to all kids. It is very clean and shows you to slow down and it is not about watching TV all day. When Nana reads a story is slow and she talks about every page with Mona. It reminds me to slow down when I read the next book for my girls at bedtime and talk about the book instead of flipping through it to make them sleep.
