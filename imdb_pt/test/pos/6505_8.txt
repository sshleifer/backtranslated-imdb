Scratch is a documentary about DJs and their art of scratching. From that description of a movie line, you would have no idea how fun and educational this little movie is. It is a joyful and vibrant celebration of a cool subculture that is little known. It's full of hip hop underground music and you can see some of the best DJs (eg DJ Q-Bert, DJ Shadow and Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys) showing off their stuff. Going into the movie I was not sure that "scratching" could actually be called an art form, or that the turntable could be seen as an instrument in itself. Scratch completely changed my mind on those points. What these guys do with their record players is really amazing - it's definitely some kind of art - and the turntable, if you know how to use it, can be turned into an instrument that you can "play", drum or a guitar. And you still have a lesson on the basics of DJ Q-Bert's scratch (for example, how to use the fader for different sound effects). All these DJs in their own way were inspired to pick up the art of scratching after watching Herbie Hancock play their song "Rock It" (do you remember that song, did you?) Live on the Grammy. What caught their attention was not Hancock himself, but his DJ and his scratches. Scratch is not just a scratch, but it does a few scratches, thanks to the creative way this documentary is filmed and edited. There are times when the clips are quickly "rewounded" and "routed" several times, which mirrors (in the middle of the movie) what happens when a DJ quickly moves the disc on his turntable back and forth while using his fader (wicka-wicka "sound." Whether you're a hip hop fan or not, you can count on Scratch to provide a very enjoyable evening at the movies. I mean this as a compliment.
