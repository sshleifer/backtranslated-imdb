This is a bewildering Absurdist Short. A miller, dressed in white, walks toward us from a windmill in a desolate landscape. Although the image is reduced, there is an obvious logic here. However, he is stopped by sweeping, all black because of his work. They begin to pound each other for no particular reason - did the arrogant mumble insult the soot-sweep? Is this class war? Be that as it may, he attacks his opponent with bags of grain that fly throughout the fight, making redundant everything he had done before the fight, making the windmill redundant, so that everything becomes as useless as the struggle. The grinder of the miller whitens the darkness of the sweep-then the Westerners would not be so subtle, heroes and villains being color-coded. Is there a racial hue here? <br /> <br /> If this was not marvelous enough, the fighters are expelled from the screen by a crowd of people who came from nowhere, a Kafkaesque end appropriate for a strange story (or are they just social consciousness rising? against a fight that denies order and purpose?), and very unusual in the early days of silent movies. This mix of comedy, surrealism and absurdity is an obvious precursor to BUster Keaton, while the windmill reminds us of one of the great thrillers, "Foreign Correspondent" by Hitchcock.
