How did they get the movie photo of the car to collide with the back of the semi? And then Roy sits down - great! It looks like the DVD is scheduled for May of 2006 - about the time !! Watch this on a large screen or reliving movies in a movie theater if possible in order to fully appreciate the overall aspect ratio. My other favorites in this category are: Original Italian Job with Michael Caine; Bullit with Steve McQueen; Living and dying in Los Angeles with the CSI guy when he was young; French Connection with Gene Hackman; Ronin with Robert Deniro; Vanishing Point with Barry Newman; Enemy of the State with Hackman again - What are your favorites?
