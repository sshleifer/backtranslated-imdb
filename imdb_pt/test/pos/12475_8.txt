Relentless mercenary Bruno Rivera betrays his pregnant partner / girlfriend Meiko (well played by Eiko Nagashima) to have exclusivity in a fortune in stolen diamonds. But Meiko manages to seriously injure Bruno before he runs away. Bruno ends up in the chic chalet of the good doctor Don Simon (a great performance of Lautaro Murua). It also attracts the attention of the two hot girls of Simon: the fiery Monica (the luxurious Silvia Aguiler) and the sweet Alicia (well rehearsed by the lovely Azucena Hernandez). However, Bruno soon realizes that something is very wrong about the isolated place and plans to escape as soon as he can. Meanwhile, the bitter Meiko tries to find Bruno so she can take revenge on him. Naschy, who wrote and directed, as well as stars, invents one of his strangest, most distorted and perverse vehicles of terror, with this oddity little seen. The infrequent plot and mysterious atmosphere become more strange and unnerving as the story unfolds, eventually leading to a genuinely surprising surprise ending. This film still benefits from occasional moments of blood gore (watch out for the memorable sequel, with a poor bastard being devoured alive by carnivorous carnivorous pigs!), Alejandro Ulloa's slippery cinematography and a decent dash of nudity and soft sex. A good support of Roxana Dupre, Raquel, Pepe Ruiz, Don Serafin, Julia Saly, Teresa. A pleasantly dark and worthwhile shock.
