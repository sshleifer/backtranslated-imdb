This is one of the best lesbian movies I have ever seen! This series brought joy and sadness of true love. Being set in the 1800s was an amazing look at lesbian life and desires of lesbian women. The cast went beyond expectation! Rachael Stirling is an incredible actress, I have never seen her other works, but her portrait of Nan made me connect with her feeling her anguish, pains and love. The only thing I feel more important is to connect with the characters in anything I watch. If anyone has questions about watching this movie ... Think twice! This is a must see series. Well done again to the BBC! We need more lesbian films that portray love and real grief, like this one. Living in Canada I had this imported DVD and I'm so excited to have it bought.
