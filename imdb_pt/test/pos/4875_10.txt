I watched SEA OF DUST at the Rhode Island Horror Film Festival in Providence. It was the highlight movie of the Festival and won Best Movie from among a few hundred entries. The director and some of the stars answered questions after the show. One star, Suzy Lorraine, was even hotter than the movie, and she was a great actress in the film. <br /> <br /> This film is independent, but has many cinematic touches a feeling of quality. It even has an original soundtrack of classic style. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Savini and he's the big villain here, in black cloak, he's more of a force of evil than a real person, I guess. He is sucking the souls of people and using them as soldiers in a distorted attempt to establish his version of the Kingdom of God on earth. In his opinion, Christ was all about suffering and Savini intended to make everyone suffer. <br /> <br /> The main argument that matters is about a young doctor, Stefan, who is sent to investigate the strange events that Savini is causing in an isolated city. He proposes to an aristocratic girl on the way, but his SOB father tells him to get lost. Then he meets a strangely possessed but seductive girl from the interior. I think she falls in love with him, but she also tries to kill him, as well as several hot women in the movie. <br /> <br /> I found the scenes filmed in the woods as the most frightening and most attractive, with strange people along the road (the little evil twins scared me a lot). <br /> <br /> The film has a lot to do, a lot to list. There's a lot of blood, torture and blood. Luscious licking the blood from the faces of the faces. The head of a terrified girl explodes. This was unexpected. Gorges begin the crevice. Some brutal stabs. <br /> <br /> Then they play to laugh at times, provoking some fun in the whole evil genre of the black forest. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Hammer and Ingrid Pitt movies, it is fascinating to see her in this movie. She disconnects one of the cables, plunging a cross into his skull. Great. The guy who played "Multiple Miggs" in Silence of the Lambs is great in an ax fight. <br /> <br /> The film is surreal and with the ending, I'm not sure if the events happened or if they were in Stefan's head because of his rejection by his so-called bride. He returns in revenge and this scene is brutal. The director also spoke on the subject of religion being misused to support wars and murders. I can see that, of course, Savini's vision of religion was frightening. <br /> <br /> This was a strangely exceptional movie, with some stars like Savini and Pitt, very good supporting cast, including hot, great scenes of blood, action, and all the time you're wondering what the heck is happening and what will happen next. <br /> <br /> That deserves ten stars, because it's an excellent independent film effort, I do not think it was a low budget, but it had to be a lot less than a big studio budget, and yet they did it do something really attractive, unique and thought-provoking.
