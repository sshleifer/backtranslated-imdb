Widely known as "Do not Look in the Basement" - this is the pure horror of the '70s, the kindness of B movie that could actually pass as the genre version of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." Although the movie seems to get nowhere during the first hour + of the running time, I liked that particular group of eccentric lunatics and their various personalities and shortcomings - like the former army sergeant, a girl obsessed with taking care of a doll of plastic, a kind man-a child and a crazy nymph. After his chief physician is murdered by a patient, a small sanatorium hires a new nurse at his unmanned facility, who is immersed in the resident's different "ticks" and explosions. Things gradually become stranger, however, when patients begin to act in a much more abnormal way than usual ... You never know, or care, where the movie is going, because it still amuses you to complete it ! Several of the "twists" seemed a bit too stressed and I might have used a little more blood, but I really dug this much underestimated blend of humor and horror. Check out...
