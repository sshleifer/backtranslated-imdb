I saw this movie for the first time in the early 80's by cable. It was unique as a statement about the sixties, culture, war, music, race and a lot of things that I'm sure I missed. However, about a year ago I came back to my life as I began to enjoy it with my son. He is a bit young (9) for many of the themes, but he understands that dancing hippies are fun to watch, and he understands that the ending is ironic. While I can not think of other movies in this genre, he has an independent genius that I love. It also does a unique justice to Central Park. Most of the musicals are lost in me, one way or the other. "Tommy" was on top and with heavy hand in the direction, "Oliver" seemed to control crowds on the silver screen, "The Wall" was very abstract and self-indulgent dribble, but hearing "meat failure" hair looks right for our times today, as it did in the 80s, as it must have been in the 60s ... truly timeless.
