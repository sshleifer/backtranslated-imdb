Greetings again from the darkness. Based on the mega-bestseller author Khaled Hosseini, the film provides us with a peak in the ugliness of post-Russia invaded Afghanistan and the terror of the Taliban. Director Marc Foster adds a gem to his resume, which already includes "Monster's Ball," "Looking for Neverland" and "Stranger Than Fiction." <br /> <br /> The story of young friends Amir and Hassan and the unknown bond they share in the next generation. This is a story of honor, courage and loyalty and is an unusual tale about maturing. Some great scenes of the boys when they are kids, and then some truly amazing scenes as Amir returns as an adult to find Hassan's arrested son. <br /> <br /> This is a story told, compelling, with a message. The acting is solid everywhere, without an actor stealing the screen. While not a pleasant story to watch, it is certainly meaningful and heartfelt. In addition, a quick shot of Midnight Oil playing in the billiard room is a welcome gift.
