Young John Garfield made a great performance in 1939, "They Made Me a Criminal." Celebrating a win in the ring in a packed locker room, boxer Johnnie Bradfield talks about his love for his mother, drinking rejection and a clean lifestyle for fans, including police officers, who devour her. Later in the evening, he is plowing and fighting with his butt girl, while his manager, in confusion, shares the night. And the whiskey. <br /> <br /> One problem develops when another couple arrives. The guy is a newspaper reporter and he says he will expose Bradfield's false life on the front page. The manager kills the reporter and he and the floozy run. The murder found out, cops are later looking for the now sleepy boxer whose car is run by the manager with his new ex-girlfriend Johnny now instant. A police chase ends with a fire car accident. Manager and girl are dead and unrecognizable. <br /> <br /> Johnny discovers that he should be a killer. But he is also considered dead. Seeking counsel from an attorney, he trusts the counselor the key to a bank deposit with his exclusive savings of $ 10,000. The lawyer then gives Johnny $ 250 and tells him that the balance is his fee by giving him professional advice: Get out of town quickly and go far. (I would never charge a customer over $ 5,000 for that concise, wise, and right direction.) <br /> Johnny, now a freight jumping bum wagon, ends up yielding conveniently to a ranch in Arizona where he was suckled back to health by the beautiful Goldie West, Ann Sheridan, a beautiful actress whose career was in ascendancy. Taking Jack Dorney as his nickname, the boxer loses some of its edges when falling in love with Goldie. He becomes a mentor and friend to - The Dead End Kids. Screen characters familiar to prewar viewers. <br /> <br /> The chance to make money comes when a show boxer appears defying any sucker to last several rounds in the ring with him. It's a natural temptation for Bradfield / Dorney, but there's a fly in the soup. Who should have appeared, but the detective in New York, Monty Phelan, the laughter of the department? He's been on the morgue's duty for centuries because of a small mistake early in his career that sent an innocent to Old Sparky (we all made mistakes, did not we?) Phelan recognized Bradfield from a newspaper photo and is there to watch fight and make the squeeze. Claude Rains is the cop who has endured insults and barbs from his fellow officers for years. <br /> <br /> What follows is predictable, but it is well acted. I hope this was a major feature when it was released - it's too good to be rated a second "B" in a sunroom. Busby Berkeley, better known as an excellent choreographer, directed "They Made Me." The Criminal "and Max Steiner, one of the greatest Hollywood composers of all time, wrote a good but not extraordinary song for the film. Now available on Alpha Video's DVD, the movie Me put back $ 4.99 and gave me a great pleasure. I'll see again. <br /> <br /> 8/10
