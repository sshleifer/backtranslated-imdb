The plot of The Milkwoman is a simple unrequited love that, despite the passage of decades, remains strong. Now 50, Minako Obha (Yuko Tanaka) lives alone and works two jobs? one as a checkout employee in one supermarket, the other as a reader, making their daily rounds in the Nagasaki hills. One of his stops is at the home of Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a government official who takes care of his wife with terminal problems, Yoko (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita used to see themselves as schoolchildren, but after the death of Minako's mother and Kaita's father, who seems to be having an affair together, their own relationship was destroyed. Lying on her sick bed, Yoko knows, however, that her husband's feelings for the wet nurse have not completely disappeared and, because of Kaita after she died, she tries to create a means of bringing them back. <br /> <Although the story may be simple, the emotions it deals with and the means by which it expresses them are really where the heart and beauty of the film are. The film takes its time to show the simple daily routines of each of the characters, their actions being recorded by a lady who is writing her story for a book while taking care of her own husband who is showing signs of dementia. In the process, it describes the social circumstances of people of different life forms, how they interact with each other daily, how relationships form, and how past and present can collide. The director deals with this wonderfully with a strong structure and visual style. It is only later in the film that the story begins to follow a more conventional and inevitably melodramatic way, as if it were being built to fit the narrative structure of the book being written. Everything is validated by the emotional depths that the film plays, most effectively represented in the exceptional performance of Yuko Tanaka.
