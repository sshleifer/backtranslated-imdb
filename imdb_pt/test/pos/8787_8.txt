You can not help marveling at Hitchcock's early work. "Saboteur", for example, is so fluent and fast that it's hard to believe he made this movie more than 60 years ago. There are some advertising elements, but they are entwined in the mystery so well that the thing works beautifully years later. You also get some foretaste of things that Hitchcock would do next - how to use a national milestone as a backdrop. This time it's the Statue of Liberty. In "North by Northwest", of course, is Mt. Rushmore You will also recognize things that will appear later in "Rear Window" and "Vertigo" in "Saboteur", but we will not reveal the show. Robert Cummings is excellent, as is Otto Kruger, so charming. Look for the Hitchcock mini-western in this. It happens quickly, so do not blink.
