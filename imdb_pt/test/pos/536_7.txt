Since I'm a fan of Natalie Portman, I had to watch the movie. I enjoyed every minute of it. He manifests himself in a very sincere way. Throughout the movie, it seemed Natalie was her mother and Susan was her mother. Susan's character continued to make bad decisions and was still burned because of it. <br /> <br /> I heard there must be a love scene involving Natalie and some guy (he's in Outside Providence), but Natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed. And I think that's great. I think a love scene would have ruined the tone of the movie. <br /> <br /> Natalie must have a knack for choosing good movies because I have not seen her in a bad movie yet. So any movie that has Natalie Portman will undoubtedly be seen by me. <br /> <br /> A good movie. 7/10
