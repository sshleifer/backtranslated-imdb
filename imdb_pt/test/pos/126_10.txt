CONTAINS "SPOILER" INFORMATION. Watch the director's other film, "Earth", at some point. It's a better movie, but this is not bad, just different. <br /> <br /> A rare feminist view of an Indian filmmaker. Tradition, rituals, duty, secrets and the portrayal of strict sex roles make this an engaging and culturally dynamic viewing experience. All married characters do not have the "fire" of the marriage bed with their respective spouses. A husband is celibate and commits a form of spiritual "adultery", giving all his love, honor, time and respect to his religious swami (guru). His wife is lonely and longs for intimacy and tenderness she ends up meeting with her lesbian sister-in-law who arrives to live at home with her unfaithful husband. This unfaithful husband is openly in love with his Chinese lover, but was forced to marry a lesbian (without his knowledge). They only have sex once when their lesbian closet wife loses her virginity. <br /> <br /> A servant lives in the house and he reveals the secret that the two women are lovers. Another significant character is the elderly matriarch who is unable to speak or take care of herself because of a stroke. However, she uses a bell to communicate her needs as well as her discontent with family members. She lets them know through her bell or slamming her fist that she knows exactly what is happening in the house and how much she disapproves. <br /> <br /> In the end, the truth about everyone leaves and the two women lovers end up running away together. But not before there's an emotional scene between the swami-addicted husband and his heterosexual ex-wife. Her sari catches fire and at first we think she's going to die. However, we see the two women united in the last scene of the film. <br /> <br /> The writer / director of this film defies the traditions of his culture, but it shows us individual human beings who are imprisoned by their culture. and gender. We really care about the characters and do not see them as stereotypes. Each one surprises us with his humanity, vulgarity, tenderness, anger and spirit.
