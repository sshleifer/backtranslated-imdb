I think Samuel Goldwyn was trying to do two things in this movie. First, the film is a tribute to Jascha Heifetz, considered the best virtuous violinist of the last century. Second, having brought the children of Dead End with their movie of the same title and watching them sign with Warner Brothers, he was trying to create a second gang of attractive kids. <br /> <br /> Although the film was good, there was certainly no demand for the children in this film to return to another film. <br /> <br /> The leader of the gang is Gene Reynolds, who once played violin, but now leads a street gang of dishonorable kids. His stepfather, Arthur Hohl, breaks the violin his late father gave the young Reynolds and threatens to send him to reform the school because of the poor protests of his mother, Marjorie Main. <br /> <br /> Young Reynolds accidentally stumbles on a music school. directed by the conductor himself, Walter Brennan and his daughter Andrea Leeds. They accept it but have their financial problems with many lenders led by Porter Hall. <br /> <br /> This film is mostly seen today because it is a chance for classical music lovers to see and hear Jascha. Heifetz, which as you gather, is the solution one way or another for everyone's problems. Joel McCrea is also in this movie, but has a fairly colorless role as Andrea Leeds's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> In addition to Heifetz, one thing the film does is play, albeit cautiously, on the topic of child abuse and wife beating. Arthur Hohl is an evil man and Marjorie Main is clearly a very mistreated wife. <br /> <br /> The children of the cast get along, Reynolds, Tommy Kelly, Terry Kilburn and a young girl named after Jacqueline Nash. who grew up and performed as Gale Sherwood, a nightclub partner for Nelson Eddy. She had a beautiful soprano even as a child. <br /> <br /> But it is Heifetz that you see the show.
