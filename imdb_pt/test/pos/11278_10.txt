This kind of anguish can only be within a young man who seeks very seriously his religion and his place in this world. As the text says at the beginning of the film, these images are dead: they are already past and correct since the moment the product was ready. But this is only for the manufacturer of these "products": Perhaps for someone who is in the same state of mind (I think many people, at least those who are seriously interested in religion, go through the same terrible doubts in their personal development) . And this, of course, is the reason why art is made in the first place: Identification and consolation among human beings. <br /> <br /> This film uses very well the "classic" techniques of experimental cinema. And that is where these techniques are, in my opinion, the best possible way: as an instrument for storytelling and creating atmosphere for them, not just as pure abstractions or as an end in themselves. These "tricks" have been done many times. Some other films I imagine have influenced / inspired this director, are "Eraserhead" and "Nosferatu". It's interesting how these techniques make this movie totally timeless: there's nothing contemporary in this movie. Or anything of any other specific time either. This could have been done a thousand years ago. <br /> <br /> It is interesting in this story how these people treat this born holy child: they use it selfishly for their own purposes, and they do not even try to listen to it. They beat him up, plucked out his bowels and castrated him. They drag their body (alive) by force from one place to another. And they do the same kind of violence for their mother. The story also reminds me of Borges's short story "Brodie's Report." Also the criticism of the practices of Christian institutions reminds me of the great "El Topo". Clock nasty at times, but beautiful. Very simple, thoughtful and concentrated. Very strong film, almost too strong. All human energy focused on that. Also this movie shows that when you have the passion and ideas, you can make a movie with a zero budget. <br /> <br /> But I have to admit, it was a bit difficult to watch for a "contemporary" viewer like me, because of the experimentality. It was so slow and demanding. But after all, worth suffering. I have to give ten points just for the effort that someone makes that kind of movie.
