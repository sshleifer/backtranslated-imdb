Well, I have to say, this movie was probably the funniest movie I've seen all year. And I do not mean that in a good way. This is probably the most pathetic movie I've seen in a while, and yet it's what makes it so hilarious. you can say that these people are really trying to act, unfortunately for them, they are not doing such a good job, even making the statements presented in a serious tone seem really funny. Aaron Carter is essentially a character very much like him in real life, and yet he manages to make the character look tacky and unrealistic. This movie is one of those movies where everything that should sound serious is really funny and all the things that should be funny are so stupid and cheesy that you have to laugh because you know how hard they are trying. This movie is so bad, it's really good. I would definitely recommend it if you are in the mood for a good laugh.
