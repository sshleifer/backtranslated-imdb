I absolutely love this movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the store. I saw Kathy Bates was there, so I figured it had to have some value, you know? I watched for the first time just shaking my head. . . There is? So it was the last scene, and I found myself aching with so much smiling. I clicked on "play movie" and watched the whole thing again. It's arguably the weirdest movie I've ever seen. But the more I watch, the more I love it. It's absurd and crazy and sweet and sweet. Kathy Bates is flawless, but the rest of the cast is fabulous as well. What strange characters everyone is! The dwarf is very funny for words. And Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow are hysterical. It's just a fun and fabulous movie. I have the urge to see again. Who is watching for the first time, please keep it to the end. Worth it!
