Much of my childhood was spent lying in front of the radio, listening to Hancock's Round the Horne or Half Hour or watching Carry On movies. Probably the most famous line from the comedy "Infamy! Infamy! They all have the infamy!" It still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> This is a rare sight of the man behind the comic figure and the entire production is a brilliant mixture of tragedy and comedy until the final citation from the coroner's court read in four different voices of Michael Sheen. It was brilliant on paper. Most of the other members of the Carry On team were like that and their Kenneth Horne was very good, but Michael Sheen took the show and there should be some sort of prize for him. <br /> <br /> It made me feel "wow." To quote Kenneth Williams, to the cynic who says "life is a joke", the only answer may be "Yes, well, let's make it good."
