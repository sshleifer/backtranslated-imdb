I can not understand why IMDb users would rate this movie as 5.2 / 10? It's really great, very funny. I strongly recommend this movie to all of you, adults, teenagers and especially children! <br /> <br /> The story is about a 14 year old who always tells lies, at home and at school. One day he had his homework to write a story of 1000 words. But he did not, so the teacher told him to write and give it to her in 3 hours, or he would have to go to Summer School. Yes, he wrote in 2:45. "Big fat liar," I think it was a story of himself. On the way to school, he hit the limo of a famous Hollywood producer and gave him a ride. But the boy forgot the story in the limo. He told his parents and the teacher, but of course, they did not believe him. And the producer of the film, he took the boy's story as his new movie, "Big fat liar." When the boy saw the movie trailer, he told his parents he had written, but they did not believe it. So he and his friend had to go to LA to prove one thing: the truth is never overrated. Enjoy this great movie, you will not be disappointed. Do not rely on the 5.2 / 10 rate, it should be 9/10! Believe me! <br /> <br /> P / S: sorry, my English is not good enough to make a better comment!
