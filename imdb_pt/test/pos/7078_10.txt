Meryl Streep may be the greatest actor working today. His chameleon portraits never cease to amaze; she seems to really be the characters she brings to the screen. In "One True Thing," she gives life to a deceptively direct, deeply complex woman, doing her best to play the hand that life has given her. Surviving with cancer is no easy task, and not just surviving, but continuing to live life is even harder - and that is exactly what Kate Gulden (Streep) intends to do. Ren√©e Zellweger ("Jerry Maguire") not only remains in this exalted company, but shines as the daughter of Streep, who learns to see in a new way the life of his parents, as well as yours. Streep is a powerhouse and deservedly received an Oscar nomination for his work here; his "I'll just say this once" dialogue with Zellweger will leave you devastated. Zellweger, however, is the true revelation - her face conveys every emotion, every conflict as she begins to learn the many truths about the strengths and weaknesses of her parents. Director Carl Franklin ("Devil in a Blue Dress") deals with the material of the story extremely difficult, with certainty and delicacy.
