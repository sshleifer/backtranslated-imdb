If you listen to Ween (The Pod, God / Satan), then you know what's happening with "Split". I found that watching the movie under the influence of LSD helped to handle audio / video plotters a great editing job. The plot was only important from the second to the second. The acid helped to interact with the sounds, subliminal and general rhythm of this masterpiece. Do not bother writing about something beyond the reach of your understanding ... There simply is not enough of these great independent attempts at expression on your raw and amateur level. I dare someone to make a movie that can also mess up my head and change the way I see the visual arts and the reality of the world. Not to mention the many realities that have not yet been explored by this human mind. I love Chris Shaw's vision. I also appreciate the terrorist film "The Begotten," by E. Elias Merhige.
