Jack Palance, (John Witting), was generally a bad guy in most of his films and in this movie, he showed his great acting talents above and beyond my expectations. John Witting unexpectedly returns to his son's farm after years and years of separation. Christopher Walken, (Jacob), has difficulty accepting the appearance of his father after he spent the night in the family barn. Jacob's younger son and daughter greet their new grandfather and accept him as he is, a very old man, at the end of his ropes. Glenn Close, (Sarah Witting), immerses himself in the character of John Witting and begins to reveal the truth about what happened to him during his years of family absence. This is a very warm and loving film about real events that happen in most families for generations to come.
