For those who expect documentaries to be objective creatures, let me give you a little lesson on American cinema. <br /> <br /> Documentaries depend heavily on the cast. You select the characters you think will increase the drama and entertainment value of your movie. <br /> <br /> After filming a ton of images, you unite them to make a movie with ups and downs, turning points, climax, etc. If you have problems with existing pictures, you can shoot a little more that makes sense, find some pictures, or be smart with your narration. <br /> <br /> The claim that filmmakers used images of places that are not part of the film (favelas near beautiful beaches) does not diminish the value of the film as a dramatic play and the particular image is that which resonates enough to justify its not very true inclusion. Either way, you use the pictures you can. So they did not have footage of police violence for that particular neighborhood. Does that mean not including it and just talking about it or maybe putting some cartoon animation so the audience is not "cheated"? No. <br /> <br /> As for the hopeful end, why not? Yes, the Americans did it. Yes, Americans are optimistic bastards. But why end on a low note? Just because it is set in a foreign country and foreign films end on a low note? Let the aliens portray the bleak outlook on life. <br /> <br /> Let's think there may be a happy ending in the future. There can only be one.
