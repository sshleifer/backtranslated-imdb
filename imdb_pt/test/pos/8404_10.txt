gone with the wind and scarlett are two different movies that were never meant to be compared obviously the original actors in gwtw are all past and deserved their own separate prize and praise i loved gwtw and never really expected a sequel to be made or never live up to half the compliment of gwtw but to my shock scarlett was so well written directed and acted as scarlett gwtw in its own right deserves so much prize I can now honestly say that I do not know what I like best I think the script Scarlett was the perfect number 1 as a sequel. Angry! producer scriptwriter and all the actors Bravo! AS sequences rarely fulfill their name because it is the same as its predecessor. For those who do not like you miss the point and a great end to a phenomenal start
