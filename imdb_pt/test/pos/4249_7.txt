Of course, the movie is full of black militant stereotypes and much of the jargon of the day. In that sense, the movie really dated. But, as a satirical look at America's number one parasitic industry, advertising, it is still on target. But counter-message, or the effect of big money on those who would make the industry more socially responsible, without promoting war toys, alcohol, etc., is also important. Thus, the film also deals with the attractions of capitalism. Note, for example, how Putney's costume suddenly changes to resemble the revolutionary Third World Fidel, shortly before he leaves the company. For a moment, it appears that Swope's mini-revolution has been successful among its employees, and it is moving on, perhaps to spread the movement. But then, the former militants succumb to the fascination of big bucks and he leaves shaking his head, perhaps to hijack a plane to Cuba. Downey's final word, however, is ironic, since the Arab (I believe) sets fire to the money tower, leaving the metaphorical structure of propaganda, capitalism a smoking ruin. To me, it seems that change can only succeed as a cleansing act of destruction and not as a reform process - a message consistent with the radical spirit of the time. <br /> <br /> Whatever the subtext, there are some genuinely funny moments, especially with the commercials that play as well now as they did then. Those who compare the anarchic style to that of Marx Bros. make a good argument. The throw lines fly thick and fast along with outrageous arrangements. Forty years later, it's still a tough movie to achieve consistent control. Despite the crudes, however, the film remains a work of daring originality with some genuinely revealing moments.
