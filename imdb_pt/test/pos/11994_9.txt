Everyone has the right to an opinion. The only critic who counts is yourself. I think this is a great movie. Much better than the original. <br /> <br /> In "Caddyshack," Rodney Dangerfield is funny, but unpleasant. He was invited to do the continuation, but things got in the way. Jackie Mason shows the saying that "less is more". He's funny, but a man with real family problems, a more rounded person. It's not a drama, but a movie that makes you feel. In fact, at some points, you feel sorry for Jackie Mason, especially when your daughter goes out with him. <br /> <br /> It has a good soundtrack and, overall, a good excuse. A good end to the series. <br /> <br /> In the TV show "Alf", Alf says he cried in "Terms of Endearment". The wife, Kate Tanner, played by Anne Schedeen, also says that he cried in "Caddyshack 2".
