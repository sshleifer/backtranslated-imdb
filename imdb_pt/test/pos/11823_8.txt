This is one of the most moving movies I've ever seen. No movie affected me the way it did. This is a great movie and you have to see it for yourself. I'm usually impregnable with these history movies, but this did it for me. I was crying in the end. You will yearn for the friendship that is portrayed in this movie. If I can give this movie a billion stars I could.
