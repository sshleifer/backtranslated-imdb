No matter how you feel about Michael Jackson himself, you can not deny that this video is the most original video of all time. There is no other video that is remotely close to "Thriller". The first time I saw it was when I was 6 and it scared me a lot. Now I watch with a smile because now I can enjoy the wonder that is. I love this video and it will be around as long as there are video clips. I think everyone should sit and watch when they are turned on and look back and see how good it was, especially for being 1983.
