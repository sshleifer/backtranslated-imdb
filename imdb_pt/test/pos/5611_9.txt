One of the many speculations about Y2K was that the world would end in the late midnight of December 31, 1999. In "The Book of Life," writer / director Hal Hartley looks at the possible ramifications of a new millennium Armageddon, beginning with the return of Jesus to Earth on New Year's Eve, ?? 99. The story examines the task of the Son of God, who must open the remaining three of the seven seals contained in the Book of Life (now contained in a Mac laptop computer), in which there are also the names of the hundred and forty-four thousand good souls which will be spared on the last day. Jesus (Martin Donovan), along with Magdalena (P.J. Harvey), arrives in New York to make the necessary preparations to fulfill his father's will, but he begins to think twice; Should he judge the living and the dead? Do they deserve what should happen to them? It is a chalice he would rather not embrace at this particular time, which encourages Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan), who fears that the fruit of all his hard work is about to be carried away by midnight, as he can only continue to work while there are people around who cling to their lamentable hopes and dreams. An artfully rendered high-concept film, Hartley presents the story in a clever and thought-provoking way, taking great care in dealing with the sensitive subject matter, so as to make it harmless even to the most ardent fundamentalists. The dialogue between Jesus and Satan is intriguing and stimulating, as is the effect of his presence upon those whom he encounters during his bodily stay in the city. It is a captivating meditation on the spiritual side of man's fragile existence and a contemplation of what was prophesied in the Revelations of John in the Apocalypse, the last book of the New Testament. And there is logic in Hartley's approach to the Second Coming; it maintains the aesthetics of the contemporary environment, employing altered film speeds that visually give the film an ethereal quality. Christ discreetly wears a suit and tie, effectively mingling with the population, while Satan's outfit is a bit more casual, his appearance a bit misaligned; He has a bruise above his left eye. Donovan is well cast as Jesus, giving a benevolent appearance and a sense of urgency contained to his character which is very effective. It is, of course, a unique portrait of The Savior and possibly the best since Max von Sydow in "The Greatest Story of All Time". It successfully conveys a sense of inner peace and tranquility, of serenity, which is the essence at the core of the character. And Ryan is completely involved in his role as the Prince of Darkness; he has a distinct way of speaking and a resonant quality in his voice that makes it absolutely mesmerizing to watch. His eyes are penetrating, a feature he uses effectively with sneaky eyes and captivating looks. He's the guy who could sell you anything in exchange for your soul before you knew what hit you. It's a memorable performance that contrasts so well with Donovan's portrait of Jesus. The supporting cast includes Martin Pfeffercorn, Miho Nikaido, Dave Simonds, Dave Mendel, James Urbaniak, Katreen Hardt, ). In his own inimitable style with "The Book of Life," Hartley has devised a perspective of the last days that is interesting, fun, and truly unique. It has a way of capturing life as it is just off center, a method that works especially well with a film like this. Comparatively short for a feature film (duration of 63 minutes), it is however one of Hartley's best and worth the price of admission. It is a movie that will stay with you and maybe make you think of some things that you may have kept in a corner of your mind for later. And that is part of the attraction of this film; this makes you realize that "later" is probably now. I rate this 9/10.
