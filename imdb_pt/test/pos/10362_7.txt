I liked this movie. Many people refer to her as "Sabrina, the teenage feminist." They do it with a lot of movies that Melissa Joan Hart is in. Still, she really surprised me in this movie because she was terrific on the part of Mary, who fights for justice when her roommate is raped. You could say that Hart was extremely determined in this movie and it showed. I also liked Lisa Dean Ryan as Mary's roommate. She was very effective in making me feel sorry for her character after she was raped. Josh Hopkins was good as the arrogant and selfish rapist. Lochlyn Munro played her character convincingly. The acting in this movie is better than in most TV movies, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> The film was very predictable. Also, I expected more from the end, it was very abrupt. Delivery could have been better. But the performances and the overall plot compensate for these problems.
