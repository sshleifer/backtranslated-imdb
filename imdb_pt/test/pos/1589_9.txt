This is a sweeping, if somewhat spare, adaptation of Thomas Mann's novel of the same title. Dirk Bogarde does his best on-screen performance - he believed it himself. The dialogue is minimal, so his face must record the nuances of his anguished character - a composer (a novelist - the only major altercation) who travels to Venice in 1910. Visconti has fun in depicting beauty, passage and smell of decay. Staged as an opera director, Visconti combines Mahler's music and images in his best film since "The Leopard" (another impressive film, which influenced Coppola's Sicily in the "Godfather").
