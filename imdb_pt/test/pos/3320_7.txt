"The Women," by Claire Booth Luce, shows relationships with men from the point of view of a woman in a play (and the 1939 film that also has Joan Crawford doing a whore: a character who could have been Amanda Farrow 20 years earlier ), which does not have male characters. Here we see the male characters and what group they are. They use women as toys and throw them away, letting the women suffer. Ironically, women in "Women," perhaps because they are all we see, are shown in a less than favorable light, alternately silly and intriguing, with the only "good" (Norma Shearer), growing "claws" by the end. In "Best of Everything" we see men for criminals, while women are largely innocent and vulnerable. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about women skipping things. Diane Baker jumps out of a car (perhaps in the most absurd scene in movie history, which is not in the book). Suzy Parker falls from a fire escape. The women of the film are jumping to the workplace, seeking success and love at the same time. Women would jump into the future and leave that kind of novel behind in the next decade. But they would return to this in the 1980s and 1990s, through the novels of people like Sidney Sheldon and Judith Krantz, (though their useless works are not as good as that). <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is what it seems. I love the brilliant cinemascope movies of the 50s and 60s. They look so much better than the home-made pixel-challenged movies we've been doing ever since, especially in the letterbox version we see on TV, and on DVD, with the image so clear that you could get into it. The look of the bunch of young beauties is also memorable. This movie probably has more beautiful women than any other. There's a supermodel (Suzy Parker), a beauty queen, (Myrna Hansen, who was not the Miss America of 1954, as Rona Jaffe on the DVD says, but Miss USA 1953, by IMDb), and a Playboy. playmate, (June Blair, January 1957). My vote goes to Suzy, one of the amazing beauties of all time. Her performance here is not as horrible as people pretend: they are just reacting, like people then, to the vision of a supermodel (the first, really), trying to act. No one seemed to care what she did. Her role, that of a seemingly mundane woman who ends up being the most vulnerable, is the most complex of the group and she does well. <br /> <br /> The most touching thing about the movie right now is the age. of the female leads at the time. Hope Lange was 27 when they filmed it in the spring of 1959. Diane Baker was 20. Suzy Parker was 26 years old. Hope, who appeared to be the heiress of Grace Kelly, was never really big and turned out to be Mrs. Muir on television and, by IMDb, ended up living in a house with "coffee table boxes" because she spent her money on causes she believed in before she died at age 72 in 2003. This movie must have seemed like a distant memory that was irrelevant to her by then. Baker, always a welcome face on 60's TV (especially Richard Kimble), and still acting as an actor and actor trainer, turned 67. Parker found "the best of everything" with Bradford Dillman for 40 years before dying at age 70. the same year Lange did. But here they are, young, beautiful and ambitious for success and love, as well as their characters.
