Like some people I know, I got stuck in 'Stingers'; not until 2000. Three years later, there is no way to lose an episode. The show really is so good and has, for a better word, maintained its integrity, unlike 'Blue Heelers', for example. Crime is the thing; Personal lives are there, but just expelled when affecting an investigation! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he really fits well, which did not surprise me. Gary could evaluate any British or American actor in a similar series. The cast changes occasionally, but each change brings something new and fresh. With arguably Australia's best team behind the scenes, 'Stingers' will continue to be a series of cutting-edge drama.
