During the War for Southern Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes its forces to defend the local women and children against an invasion of the Yankees. <br /> <br /> In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular OUR GANG boys to branch out. in occasional feature films. With Shirley Temple's great success in two 1935 Civil War films (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLE REBEL), it was natural for Roach to look in the same direction for his GANG. Although generously produced and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box office hit. The little GANGsters would turn to short subjects. <br /> <br /> Although he received the highest grossing and leading role, George Mcbany is the rival of the entire first half of the movie with little Billie Buckwheat Thomas. Here were two of the best young actors ever to appear in American films. With all the experience of old and experienced professionals, these two gamin could steal scenes and hearts with equal bravado. A constant joy, without a fake note between them, they provide the essential reason to watch the movie today. <br /> <br /> Phillips Holmes makes a quiet and chivalrous presentation as Spanky's adult protector. Almost forgotten now, Holmes was a great actor who died very early during World War II. Genius Ralph Morgan is especially good as a nice Union general - his scenes with Spanky are a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Other OUR GANGERS appear in the middle of the movie, most notably Carl ?? Alfalfa 'Switzer; he starts to fight ... Just before the battle, Mother. Even the beautiful Rosina Lawrence (GANG's schoolteacher) appears to play Holmes's beloved. <br /> <br /> Irving Pichel is particularly slippery when a cowardly cardiac became Yankee's vindictive captain. Sloppy Willie The best and daring Louise Beavers play Miss Lawrence's slaves. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that there is racism in the film, not uncommon for Hollywood of that era - but almost completely absent in the original series of OUR Jeans shorts. <br /> <br /> Fans of 19th century music will like to pay attention to the soundtrack, which is a long succession of old songs.
