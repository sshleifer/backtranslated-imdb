"Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters" is a visually stunning production that deals with complex issues with evocative ease. It is based on the life of controversial Japanese writer Yukio Mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. It is not really a biographical film - at least not one in the traditional sense - but an exploration of Mishima's iconoclastic work. The film manages to present abstract concepts in a non-engaging and fully engaging way. Paul Schrader makes you sympathize with Mishima without having to deconstruct him or his work. It does not solve the puzzle well, but it makes you understand. An added bonus: When we see Mishima's fury over the lack of tradition in a morally empty modern society, Schrader gives us an excellent demonstration of the dichotomy between thought and filmmaking. John Bailey's cinematography is spectacularly good. The greatness of the work of the composer Philip Glass is perfectly adequate to the project. "Mishima" is the best movie I've seen this year so far.
