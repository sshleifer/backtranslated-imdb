I really love this movie, I first saw it when I was working in a video store. When I went to buy they told me it was out of print and I could not order it so I just today thought I would look. and then I found that they put in Spain on DVD under the name "Something But What Friends" and you can buy there is in English and Spanish on DVD .... hope this helps ..... I know how difficult it is find movies that we love and that were not released in the American market. good luck..oh For more info here is a place to look .... HTTP://www.zonadvd.com I think it goes to 10 dollars usd on eBay as well.
