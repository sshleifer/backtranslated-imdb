I saw that at the Newport Beach Film Festival the other day. The film is really exceptional. The crowd I went with we all loved. Funny, pungent and great acting. I'm tired of the tried and true Hollywood novels, who can relate? David Krumholtz (Max) is truly amazing as the true and safe lover of ultra-wacky Grace (Natasha Lyonne, who is also excellent). When Max falls in love with Grace, we believe that. Because? Because love at first sight is crazy and we are dealing with two lost, and perhaps not so crazy, souls. Also noteworthy are Giullmo Diaz as Hector and Rosanna Arquette as a sexless / sexy neurotic, both "roommates" of Max and Grace before embarking on their trip to Sheboygen, WI and meet. Do not miss this one, it's something special! P.S. The soundtrack, led by Kevin Hearn (of the Bare Naked Ladies fame) is really super cool too.
