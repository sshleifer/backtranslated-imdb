Making it short and to the point. This movie was great! I loved! I actually got this in a Hollywood video for $ 3 on VHS and watched it about 5 times in the last two weeks. I'm a big fan of Bogart and I just got attached to this movie. I found the song funny and now I have a ringtone on my cell phone. Robert Sacchi is great and takes a good Bogart. His nose is a little big, his voice is a mix of Bogart-Columbus, and he does some things that are strange, but on the other hand, he was fantastic and this movie was wonderful. No one can be a perfect Bogart, but he was great. Remember, Sam Marlow is a fan of Bogart and will not do everything he did. He mentions many other films and does some things that were never part of Bogart's character. But, it's so funny and hilarious and has a great cast, including some pretty women. Watch and enjoy!
