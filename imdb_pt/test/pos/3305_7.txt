This is the drama of a captivating woman that men can enjoy. The plot follows a young woman (Hope Lange) who goes to work for a publisher after college. We can forgive her jumping from desk to editor (hey, it's Hollywood) and some other flaws. Here is one of the few movies in which the great producer Robert Evans (here, beautifully representing a rat with women) appears. He also features a mature Joan Crawford and fantastic supporting cast. Check out.
