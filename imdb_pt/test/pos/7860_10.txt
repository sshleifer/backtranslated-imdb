Director Don Siegel really impressed me with this movie. It is clearly filmed, graphic without being visually explicit, well represented by all involved, and covers some of the most common issues of every day, in an almost expected normality, hitherto not seen in any other film by this critic. I did not know what to expect to sit in to watch it: a civil war movie or some kind of seventies brat with Eastwood coming down to a girls' school in the south. But it really is none of these things, but rather, examination, exploration and descent into the souls of men and women - a grim comment about what lies at the heart of the civilized. as one reviewer noted previously, none - none - of the characters are nice at the end of the movie and yet each one is interesting, complex and enigmatic. Eastwood plays Cpl. McBurney, a Union soldier found by young Pamelyn Ferdin (you'll recognize that voice as soon as you hear), a girl in a school of manners led by Geraldine Page amid the chaos that was the Civil War - particularly in the south. Soon, Page, teacher Elizabeth Hartman, the lovely young seductive Carol and even Ferdin (Amy) have emotional / sexual ties to Eastwood - each with their own needs and secrets and problems. Eastwood is not a good man. he plays the girls of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage. In the unfolding, we get some really interesting things revealed from latent lesbianism to incest. The Beguiled, for me, is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on all creative fronts. This may be (except Invasion of the Body Snatchers) the best Siegel movie. It certainly is one of Eastwood's best REAL performances. page is always very good and Hartman, Fe5rdin, et al excellent. the gothic mansion for school is effectively claustrophobic. Some of the messy sex scenes. And what happens with Eastwood is an advantage over much of the competition for scary, weird and demented movies.
