This movie starts with all the grumpy promise of a great contemporary western noir - after the ill-thought-out opening flashback sequence anyway. The setting is beautifully desolate, the characters painfully isolated. Although part of the acting is less than believable, the plot ultimately provides enough tension and twists to make this movie worth it.
