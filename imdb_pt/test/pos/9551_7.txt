Man, I really enjoyed that, even if only by Fred Willard's comment on the dog show. There are some dead spots and some jokes that do not work, but overall the movie works just fine. When I was younger, my parents raised dogs and the people I knew at those shows were not much less bizarre than the freaks of this show, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie because of its art. and for his comment about how we tend to take frivolous things too seriously ... I liked acting for his accuracy (most of the accents were perfect) and his subtlety (I loved the way each person strolled with his dogs) ... <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if you have any appreciation for the strangeness of human existence.
