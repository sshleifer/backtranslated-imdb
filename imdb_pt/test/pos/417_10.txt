He is not your conventional taxi driver. <br /> <br /> These people have problems. With his wife, with his son, a priest, all his fares, his ex-partner and above all himself. And the best thing is that they just throw us away. So we have to keep watching to find out more about his past. <br /> <br /> The idea may not be original, but David Morse does it. I think this is a great show, and I hope people get into action before the season is over. <br /> <br /> WATCH THIS SHOW !!!!!!!!!
