Watch this movie just to see Shahrukh Khan say "I love you, K-k-Kiran ..." It is both moving and scary when he says this, from beginning to end. This movie made him famous, and I totally recommend it: D It's a lot of fun, the music is bad and you're going to laugh along with Shahrukh here ... You're really going to be scared of the hero and the heroine and incredible as it may seem, least one of the characters. You will feel sad and happy and relieved and afraid at the same time. Go see this classic Bollywood movie with your good friends and some lovely food and have a day off. And after watching the movie, have the music and the scenery in your mind ... forever.
