Twenty years after watching this, I still find myself citing things from this movie like "Look Between the Two Giant Melons," or I'll start singing the "Pabst Blue Ribbon Theme." On the other hand, 20 years later, now I can understand the "meat machine", since there are still many stereotypes like that out there that they used for this movie. These are signs of a good movie for me. I could say that this movie is the test of time, which I can not say for many movies of the 80s. I keep saying that this movie is still on the list of the favorite movie of many people as a child in the 80s. likes games and dreams of becoming a "Game Master", or is in the movies of the 80's to revive his childhood, you need to watch it. Besides, sometimes it's sarcastic and funny. But one thing is certain about this movie, if someone invites you to a "Big Night", they do not mean a X or acid trip party, they mean, get ready for a midnight madness! You will see. Everyone will be dying to play! hehehehheh.
