Watching this hilarious, retro but very entertaining career girl tale, I was struck by the first appearance of Joan Crawford. All I could think of initially was, "Oh my God, it's the same face as Michael Jackson in his notorious reserve photo!" <br /> <br /> About 34 minutes after the movie, Diane Baker and Hope Lange leave a cab in Greenwich Village. As you walk down the street, you can see part of a plaque behind them for the Stonewall Bar - scene of the "riots" that are considered the trigger for the modern gay rights movement. Speaking of Baker and cabs, I had to laugh when she got into one and said to the cabbie, "56th and Sutton Place, please - and beware of the bumps." Can you imagine the reaction to this from a driver in today's Manhattan? She says, of course, because she is pregnant and does not want to hurt the fetus. But that does not stop her from jumping from a car when she discovers that Bob Evans wants her to have an abortion! Well, they had to find a way to lose the baby (1959 and all). <br /> Sue Carson is as charming as Mary Agnes. Why was this your only movie? There is no biographical information about her in IMDb.
