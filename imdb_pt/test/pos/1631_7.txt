I go to the movies to have fun. I was very entertained with the first film of this series: The DaVinci Code. It had lots of twists everywhere to keep me very interested. Angels and Demons is no different. If you liked DaVinci Code then you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie too. Angels and Demons is done in exactly the same style as the previous movie, but at a faster pace, which I liked. Ron Howard kept me glued to my seat for the entire two hours without boring me at all. <br /> <br /> What I really liked about this movie was that although it's obviously fictional, they leave enough real story to do. seems very believable. If there is one thing I did not like about this movie, it is that the plot itself is very unbelievable (I do not want to give any spoilers). But hey, it's a movie. I was entertained throughout the event and was very pleased with what I saw.
