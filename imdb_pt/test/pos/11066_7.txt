"Saratoga Trunk" is a 1945 film starring Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper. It is based on a 1941 book by the great Edna Ferber. Subconsciously, she may have gone with the wind in her brain; parts of the story reminded me of GWTW. In the 1890s, Clio Dulaine is an illegitimate child who returns from New Orleans, France with a mulatto servant (Flora Robson) and a dwarven servant, Cupidon (Jerry Austin). She has been given a title as a countess and claims to be a widow. Her mother killed her father by accident and her family avoided her. Clio takes over the old homestead with the idea of ​​shaming his half-sister and his father's wife, which she does with great attention to herself. Her plan is to marry someone very wealthy who can give her the security and respectability she wants. Then she sees Clint Maroon (Cooper), a Texas player, and falls in love with him. The two have a volatile relationship - and he has no money, so she can not marry him - so he goes to Saratoga Springs. Eventually, the Dulaine family has enough, and his lawyer gives him $ 10,000 to get out of the city. She makes. She goes to Saratoga Springs and goes after the owner of the railroad, Bart von Steed. But Clint is always around. <br /> <br /> Bergman is gorgeous in dark hair and wearing vintage attire, and Cooper is gorgeous with that incredible 300-watt smile on his face. How she could resist him is beyond me. And the love scenes - whoa, what a chemistry! The supporting cast is excellent, Robson and Cupidon creating interesting characters, and Florence Bates giving an outstanding performance as a socially prominent woman who puts Clio under her wing, knowing that she is a great farce. <br /> <br /> The movie runs a movie. little time, and part of the acting may seem old-fashioned nowadays, but it's an absorbing story full of atmosphere and vivid performances. The ending will not come as a surprise. It's a fun journey, though.
