If you're among the IMDB audience that put High Fidelity in the top 200 of all time, this movie is probably NOT for you. This movie is as infallible as Steve Frears is consciously hip. Renee Zellweger is an excellent screenwriter for urban magazines, who returns to her suburban Bucks County nest to care for her mother Streep (who offers another performance in the hall of fame). William Hurt is ideally raised and the husband irresponsible, unfaithful and selfish. If this movie does not make you cry and laugh then you are too hip to have fun.
