A small town kid who works in a big city becomes a big star and then spirals out of control. It shows the rise to fame and then falls out of fame and back to a small increase. Great cast of actors and a great director = a great great movie called Boogie Nights. <br /> <br /> P.T Anderson. An incredible director who made Boogie Nights incredible. From the moment the movie starts until the time it ends, you can feel how beautiful this movie is. Some scenes are breathtaking, literally. A great story, a great movie. Mark Whalberg was fantastic, Philip Seymour Hoffman was wonderful as he is in everything. Thomas Jane was also magnificent and, although he had only a small part, he played perfectly. There's a scene in this movie that I can not beat, "The Drug Deal Gone Bad Scene" was incredible, combined music performance and cinematography to make it incredible. I had not seen the Boogie Nights and thank God I did it, it's so well done and now I'm a big fan of the PTA (Paul Thomas Anderson). <br /> <br /> Do what you have to do and watch this movie.
