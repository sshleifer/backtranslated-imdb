I started watching The Outer Limits in '95 when I was 10, and it surprised me every week in every episode, every episode had a twist and every week I could not wait for the next one. How the writers managed to do each episode so well and make it different from each other over 7 seasons is beyond me. This show can teach us about life, robotics, alien and human encounters, and a more paranormal view, and how it affects people. What really makes this a good show are the characters in each episode, they really show excitement and are really good actors. What you'll also notice every week is an actor / actress you'll meet from a past show, which is pretty cool in its own way. <br /> <br /> If you want to relax, sit down with a good Sci-Fi show, then the Outer Limits is for you
