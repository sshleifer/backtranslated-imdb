Oz was a fantastic show, as long as frequent male nudity does not discourage him. There was a lot of male frontal nudity in this show, more than any other show you'd see on a porn channel. Other than that, it was the best show on TV, and one previous commenter said "better than Prime Suspect". Prime Suspect is Tom and Jerry vs. The Simpsons. No reply. If you have DirecTv, they're re-running from the start on Channel 101, they're in Episode 3 now. Highly recommended. Creator Tom Fontana also did Homicide, which was an AMAZING show. But why all male nudity? We all know that these things happen in prison, but do they really need to show this often? That was the only thing that got me out of the show. If I want to see naked men, subjects being raped, I myself kill someone and witness firsthand. Otherwise, I like my free black penis TV shows every five minutes.
