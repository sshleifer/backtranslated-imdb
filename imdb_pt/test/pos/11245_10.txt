The show itself basically reflects the typical nature of the average youth; partying and picking up girls is the common weekend goal in clubs. People disapprove of the program because of their "perverted" idea of ​​picking up girls using techniques and strategic characterizations, but truth be told, virtually every youngster is doing it at the club. Overall, the show really appeals to the younger population as we like to see the outcome of a "player" performance at the club, since the program offers a comical approach made possible by the panel of judges. <br /> <br /> 10/10; a cool, fun and exciting series that allows the audience to actually interact. Good job, boys.
