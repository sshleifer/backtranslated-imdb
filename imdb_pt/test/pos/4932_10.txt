When I was a kid, I loved "Tiny Toons". I particularly loved "Tiny Toons: How I Spent My Summer Vacation". I thought it was fun to laugh on the floor. A few years later, my friend had the video. And I realized that I would watch for the good old days. I was still on the floor laughing. My opinion, the Plucky and Hampton skit is the best. They decide to go to "Happy World Land". And they end up having a crazy adventure to get there. All the sketches are funny. I'm still looking for the video. So if anyone has any tips. Please write me. <br /> <br /> This is one of the funniest cartoons I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
