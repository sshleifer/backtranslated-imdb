This is one of Julie's biggest tributes to the song, alongside her album "Trapped in the Body of a White Girl". To quote the great Medusa "Dare to undress, just wear your underwear, you will have a ride home every time" - Wow !!! Now that's good advice. You're invited to the party in my pants Yeah, come on, boy, let's dance, at the party in my pants Julie Brown is hilarious !!! It's almost sad that this video is only 51 minutes long, but every minute is incredible !!!
