This long-awaited remembrance on DVD of Rush's visit to South America in 2002 is possibly the best rock video ever released on record. The image and sound production values ​​are incredible, especially when they constantly struggle against the elements to get that production out. All the tracks you'd expect from the RUSH catalog are here from Tom Sawyer to The Pass, reproduced gloriously for the frankly orgiastic Brazilian crowd. They actually sing for YYZ - which is an instrumental, and gives an indication of their fervor! disc is the concert and the second disc contains 3 scenes from various angles - Villa Strangiato, YYZ and the incredible drum solo, as well as a 30-minute documentary about the band's visit to Brazil. In short, this is a triumph and all classic rock fans must own a copy.
