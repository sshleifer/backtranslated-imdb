I had the privilege of watching the UK premiere of Inglorious Basterds tonight! Having seen the trailers I had high hopes but had doubts due to a number of self-indulgent films (let's be honest, self-indulgence is your middle name tarantinos) <br /> <br /> I was surprised to find that He took the cat out of his bag with it. The film is rich in interesting dialogues, Timed Comedy Perfect with a dash of brutal murder. <br /> <br /> The greatest glory of this film, however, is with Christoph Waltz, to whom no fault or error can be found. He manages to create real tension in the audience, remaining rather "theatrical" (could not think of a better word). He definitely deserved his prize in Cannes and is going to an Oscar without a doubt !!!! Hoping to see you on something again soon!
