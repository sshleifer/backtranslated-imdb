I love this movie. You can make the characters friendly (well, most of them) about the problems they have with their relationship. <br /> <br /> Gloria Swanson, like Leila, is in a dusty wedding with a husband who barely notices her presence. (although he notices his absence). The movie shows very well why she is tired of married life, and why she is susceptible to a sweet con man without making her selfish or picky. The reaction photos of Leila at the dinner table on her birthday while her workaholic husband (late for dinner again) eats salty chives with gusto and pushes bridal and groom dolls out of the way of his plate, are perfect. <BR> The show is stolen - and stolen effortlessly - by Elliott Dexter as Jim, Leila's negligent husband. After losing Leila to another man, Jim literally cleans his act, scrapes his mustache, struggles to lose middle age distribution and dresses well. There are several photos of Jim at home, lonely and thinking of Leila, including a powerful scene when he finds one of his old dresses in the closet. The film gives the audience the advantage of seeing Jim's transformation with Leila. It is not only the exterior that is more attractive; we come to know a lot more about the kind of person that Jim really is, and we see how completely different he is from Leila's second husband, Schuyler (Lew Cody). Dexter shines like the before-and-after Jim, who is determined, after discovering the true character of Schuyler, to win Leila back if he can. The most moving moment of the film comes when Jim and Leila discover they are under the mistletoe, and Jim talks about what he lost. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth watching.
