Having obtained a copy of the Bostocks Cup I must confess that it is not as funny as I originally thought! IS BETTER!!!!! Charlie Williams ... eat your heart. Match Match ???? Never! Slope inclined by 45%? Ronnie and Reggie Kay? George Best? The bus driver who thinks that Pontefract is in South Wales (it's all Ponty that and Ponty) Bertie Masson's (Tim Healey) luck hat !! (not that it's in tricks) Sugar Plum Fairy ????? Confused???? Watch again. The innovative use of real footage with the Bostock players was brilliant and the producer should be proud to give us a MASTERPIECE. Come on ITV do the spectators and a favor yourself - show it again !!! Please>
