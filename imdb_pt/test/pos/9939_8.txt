I finally got a copy of Dario Argento's Opera, and I tell you ... it was on time !! It was Argento's last film I had not seen yet and I'm a fan of most of his work. I think most of his work is extremely important to the horror genre, but some of his films tend to disappoint (like the Phenomena). But the idea of ​​the Opera storyline always attracted me and it turns out I was right !! I enjoyed all the filming at Opera and was fascinated by this movie in the first minute until last. Of all the Argento movies, Opera went straight to the top spot and I hope it can encourage as many people as possible to see this as well. <br /> <br /> The script and idea of ​​the Opera storyline are quite simple. Especially compared to Argento's previous movie, Phenomena, who had many ideas, and ended up being a mess. The plot of the opera is scary and creepy, but at the same time is an excellent satirical commentary - almost a parody - for opponents of explicit violence. *** SPOILERS *** A young opera singer (the beautiful Cristina Marsillach) is being chased by a horribly sadistic killer. Throughout the massacre he commits, he forces Betty to observe her actions with her eyes wide open. There are needles attached to the eyelids and when she closes them, they are shattering. *** END SPOILERS ***. For this simple but effective idea, Argento adds many horrible elements like Crows, MacBeth's classic piece (and curse) and all the atmospheric location of the opera and music building. Especially the presence of scary crows and extra value. Ancient masters like Edgar Allen Poe already knew that these black birds have a lot of mystery around them, and Dario Argento also knows that. <br /> <br /> Violence and blood are very well presented in Opera and this is what makes this a true portrait of Argento. Its better in my opinion with Profondo Rosso as a close second. I certainly hope to recommend this movie to many people among you. Especially for horror business fans (Italian), this is an absolute must! Favorite Rewind Scenes: Argento shows her visual talent the best of the scene where Betty's friend is getting shot in the eye while trying to see who's in front of the door.
