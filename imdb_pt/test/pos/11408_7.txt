A hundred miles away from the scene of a murder in a small American town, Jill Johnson (Belle) sets up for a babysitting night. With the children asleep and a beautiful home to relax, she locks the door and triggers the alarm. But when a series of strange phone calls from a stranger says she "checks the kids," Jill panics. Fear of terror when she has the calls tracked. And what the police found turns the perfect nanny job into the worst nightmare of a 16-year-old. There are no other major actors in this film. Camilla Belle is the main star with a handsome face. The day she arrives to take care of it, she really has no idea what the hell really expects for her. <br /> <br /> If I were in a house like Jill was. I'd explore everything around. The refrigerator would be the first person I'd look at, but I'm a man and I'm not a nanny. But what I found funny was the size of the house. I was thinking, would the movie be the same if the house was not so big? Anyone could get lost in that huge house, but this movie needed a house of enormous size. <br /> <br /> Camilla Belle has a beautiful face, a perfect smile, but it's like for a movie like this, the leading actress needs someone with experience. I did not find Camilla that good. I do not know, maybe she thought this might be her innovative role. I like her, she's a cute girl, but someone to have a part in this movie has to be someone other than to accept that. <br /> <br /> This movie was not scary. I also found this movie more like a "girl movie". I think the only reason this was released during SuperBowl Weekend was that the guys stay home and watch the game and the girls go out to see it. It also seems like a kind of movie where girls will like more than boys. But I liked this movie, but how it is. Girls like to smile and scare or scream. This was just a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone might like this movie. There are many PG-13 horror movies that are never successful. This was on their own level. So I kind of liked this movie. I give it a 7/10.
