Everyone wants Duvall and Jones back, come on! Viewers are saying things like, Zahn and Urban are not so deep ... Puhlease! Were you so deep when you were young? That's the point: they have a lot to learn. Zahn and Urban derive the superficial innocence for which they were instructed, and with an excellent commitment to preserve the nuances of Duvall and Jones' entry into the characters. Zahn is blatantly perfect as the beginning of Gus, and Urban is subtly perfect as the initial Woodrow. What a bold move it must have been for them to take that position in the entertainment industry. They must have known that they would all be coming down on them because they were not really the original loved ones, but they clearly put the best effort forward. I gave a 7 because the issue was hectic in some places, and the timelines were incomplete, but the acting was a joy to watch. Val Kilmer was absolutely excellent. One more thing: I hope that the public would accept the mysticism implicit in the apparitions of a jaguar and a blue and gold macaw, if there were more effort in appearance and were so accepted by the characters.
