Well played drama based on a novel by Arthur Miller. Something as simple as a pair of glasses turns into life. Lawrence Newman (William H. Macy) is a man who chose to be satisfied with his worldly life; the same job for twenty years and still living with his mother. He is told by his boss to correct his vision with a pair of glasses. Newman's life changes drastically and plunges into hell. The glasses he chose make him look Jewish. He loses his job and becomes the subject of heavy scrutiny for his neighborhood in Brooklyn. In search of a job, he meets the attractive and sincere Gertrude (Laura Dern), herself living with conflicts because of her Jewish appearance. Soon, the new life of the couple becomes a nightmare, full of attacks of humiliation and intolerance. A very fit cast that features: Joseph Ziegler, Peter Oldring, Kay Hawtrey and the musical fame, Meat Loaf.
