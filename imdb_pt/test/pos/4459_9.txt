Being an experienced fan of Italian thrillers and directors Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Sergio Martino and Aldo Lado, I thought of Lucio Fulci as an overrated hack. I had seen The Beyond, which I find totally overrated, and found The New York Ripper simply shocking and I particularly did not like The House By The Cemetery. These three films have let me conclude that Fulci is the least interesting of these Italian filmmakers. But my stubbornness prevailed and I had to check out more of his films. City of the Living Dead was a film that I found very interesting, but not torturing a duckling is almost a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Situated in a small Italian inland town in a repressive religious community where the boys are being murdered. Authorities do not know who is behind these crimes, especially after their main suspect has been cleared. A young eager reporter along with a half-bitch girl (who seduces boys) investigate and eventually get to the bottom of the issue. <br /> <br /> Brilliant atmosphere combined with a good story and a good cast (not always the case) with the Italian thrillers of the 70's) do not torture a duckling a good crackling thriller. The plot is well constructed, not easily discovered and the final conclusion is very satisfactory. Fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of repression and guilt in a very ruthless and ignorant community and creates some very strong visuals, particularly in a scene where a woman is beaten to death by some city dwellers. Fulci's social commentary on religion and innocence is quite bold and all aspects are well treated. When thinking about his zombie movies and his ultra violent giallo New York Ripper, it's amazing how he balances his critique with explicit violence and makes an even stronger point. So far I have not seen any Fulci films done as professionally as this. <br /> <br /> Although not a traditional giallo film, Duckling has many of the trademarks of the genre. Fulci displays complete control over the format, only once going to sea with a bloody little convincing moment, but overall he seems to be even better at creating mysteries than gore epics. The extreme scenes here are much more powerful and really punch. <br /> <br /> So far, Torture a Duckling is by far the best Fulci film in my opinion. Reviewed edgy social commentary combined with explicit scenes of violence and a crackling good mystery to boot.
