* POSSIBLE SPOILERS * I thought Pitch Black was quite nice, with some cool effects - I liked the bigger beasts, although they were not a Alien series Aliens patch. It had a pretty good vibe, which I felt Vin Diesel helped contribute. <br /> <br /> One thing that baffled me was how it rained. If the planet has three suns and is almost in broad daylight, where did the moisture come to form clouds and thus rain? <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that Fry died in the end - this reminded me of the new Hollywood movies of the 1970s, with the main heroine not coming to an end.
