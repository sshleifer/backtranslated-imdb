I've been a big fan of Errol Morris since I saw Thin Blue Line and I heard it saved a life. To this day, this movie is your best work. <br /> <br /> The plot is a mixture of Stephen Hawking's book, of the same title, intertwined with the life of man. The story is told through interviews with family, friends and Hawkins himself. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled; It seems totally annoying, but the whole package is dynamic and thought-provoking. The blend of life and theories is perfect and completely entertaining. I was particularly moved by how they humanize this genius and the omniscient man. Although physically impotent, the greatness of Hawking and its sheen brilliance are encapsulated in a real human being who is allowed to laugh and at the same time. <br /> <br /> Find this movie. Watch and enjoy. And if the studio that owns this photo reads this, a 15 year anniversary edition would be perfect NOW ...
