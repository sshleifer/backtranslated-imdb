One day a red street cat is fed up with being kicked by people and attacked by dogs and muses that life would be better if he were a skunk. He then paints himself in black with a white stripe on his back and adds some Limburger cheese to make it stink. In the first life it could not be better for him, the dog runs away and the butcher leaves his shop leaving the cat to leave with a pile of meat. Just as he is thinking that everything is perfect, he is noticed by a real skunk, not just any possum, but the overly loving Pepé Le Pew. Pepe confuses the poor cat with a possum and chases him thinking that his protests are just shyness. Our poor cat thinks he escaped when he throws skunk skin from a tall building so Pepé thinks he's dead, at first seems to work, but when he runs away, Pepé sees him and instantly forgets the dead opossum. In the end, the cat realizes that it was better to be kicked and attacked than to be coveted by a spoiled brat ... there is a good end to the possum too when his wife finds out what he has done. <br /> <br /> This was a rather funny introduction to Pepe Le Pew, who at that time was just overly loving, but now looks like a sexually aggressive pursuer, although he has been punished for his behavior in the end.
