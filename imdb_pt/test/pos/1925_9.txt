This is a story about a journey made by a man who has had a dream and courage. Donald Crowhurst was an English businessman and amateur sailor who competed in the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, a yacht race around the world. <br /> <br /> I was very intrigued by the story after listening to a radio interview with producer John Smithson, who is also the producer of Touching the Void, one of the first documentaries to make commercial success in 2003. I had gone to the movies with much hope and little prior knowledge about the subject. historic event, and I'm relieved to not be disappointed. For 92 minutes I was led through an astonishing story and left with much to think about. With no re-enactment, this movie made great use of the limited audio and video files they found and turned them into a compelling story that allowed the public to understand Crowhurst on a personal level. The story turned out to be people who had direct connections to the events, including his wife and son, and the eventual winner, also the only one who got out of the nine competitors, Robin Knox-Johnston gave his own accounts of what happened almost 40 years ago. Crowhurst logs that he kept during the 243 days at sea are so scary that it made it much easier for me to understand what total isolation can do for a man. Although Crowhurst's body was never found, the other competitor, Nigel Tetley, whose yacht sank just weeks before claiming the fastest passage award, committed suicide three years later, following unsuccessful attempts to complete the circumnavigation. Director Louise Osmond was also in the Q & A after the show along with producer John Smithson. I had no idea she's a female director and it turned out to be a great surprise. The film is receiving a limited release in the UK (a few days in certain cinemas). Grab the movie while you can, unless you have a state-of-the-art sound system that can recreate the sound of the Southern Ocean. So, I'm sure they'll see you on DVDs too.
