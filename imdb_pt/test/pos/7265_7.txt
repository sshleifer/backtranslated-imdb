This film is undoubtedly the best I have ever seen, and it really shows what British talent can do. Its effects are extremely good, considering that the film is set in the mid-eighteenth century, and all the filth and disgust of England at the time, is captured very well. The characters are developed and developed from MaCleane's prostitution antics to his development as a highway robber and exhibitionist The Gentleman Highwayman in contrast to Robert Carlyle whose cynicism and honor show that you can love a thief and a criminal because I quote: 'He's got more honor on his little finger than any of you fat bastards! <br /> <br /> Not referring to you, of course! But, arguably, it's the most thrilling and emotionally charged scene ever seen in a movie, but you just need to see it to find out, just say it involves rope around the neck. <br /> <br />
