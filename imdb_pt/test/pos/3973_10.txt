I went to this thought another rough movie with gross humor. Telling from my first sentence I do not like this mood and this movie had its moments, but I loved it. Justin Long never did a comedy like that where he's sarcastic and smart and I loved it. Lewis Black ... enough said. The end I really loved, because I had to take it seriously, I mean, how would you end it? Yes, it's another weaker story, but not in its typical format, and the movie was not its ups and downs, it was people coming together for a common goal: going to college where they were accepted. The cast was incredible and yes I laughed out loud when I did not think it would be and the laughter lasted longer than I thought. The parents and sister played their roles well, but their characters are put in when needed. The movie was not focused around them, but at the same time they appeared when you wait and do not expect them to. They touched on the story very well, and I loved the familiar faces Anthony Heald (Boston Public), Jeremy Howard (me) (Galaxy Quest with Justin Long), Ross Patterson (the new guy) and Sam Horrigan (Brink). Blake Lively added something right to the film that made it even more enjoyable as well as the Friends of B. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who hated these crude comedies of the last 4 years and really wants something with humor and a storyline in fact!
