I put the DVD waiting for the perversion of the Society's creators' and Re-Animator's camp, and I was rather surprised to get caught up in a truly suspenseful tale. Acting was top notch (good to see Vosloo in a starring role after a long string of villains), the plot involving, and the few surprising twists. I imagined that I would move quickly largely to get to the abduction scenes but instead would watch it, just being disappointed in the end. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm being too tolerant, but like I said before, I was not expecting much more than alien sex. Of course, if you are looking for some hot alien sex, you will be disappointed. For the most part, it was a quick nonsense on the examination table, with a glimpse of an impregnating alien.
