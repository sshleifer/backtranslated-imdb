Forget Easy Rider - Head is The movie about the 60s. <br /> <br /> Almost laughs: while the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute TV commercial about dandruff! Look: the 50-foot Victor Mature tries to figure out what the hell he's doing in this movie! Listen: Frank Zappa (with his pet cow on his leash) tells Davey Jones "Your music is terribly white"! Experience: The Monkees' only live performance as a real rock band plays the first real punk rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father! Be confused: Be very confused, as confused as Terri Garr is when Mickey Dolenz makes sexual innuendos about her in her movie debut! Witness: Futile protests against the Vietnam War come out of nowhere and disappear so quickly! Watch: Mike Nesmith spat at Christmas as he wore a Victorian velvet velvet jacket on a gothic horror movie sound stage covered with cobwebs! Let yourself be carried away: to the karmic happiness inspired by a comic book version of Indian mysticism, delivered by a character of white character in black, while Peter Tork pretends he knows how to play guitar! Discover: Academy Award-winning director Bob Nicholson's first feature film, written by Oscar-winning actor Jack Nicholson! Pretend this is not happening: when the Monkees commit group suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge! Take drugs - take lots of drugs: take as many drugs as the cast and crew evidently did while making this movie! <br /> <br /> With Head, the Monkees turned out to be the angriest artists in Hollywood history, bar none. It's disconcerting to find out they blamed the failure of this movie on bad deals. To be sure, the promotion was practically non-existent; but they did not recognize how angry, how depressing and depressing, how self-destructive this movie really is! I mean, this movie is a trip - with bad acid - to the suicide ward of a psychiatric hospital. The only movie that I know is depressing is Terry Gilliam's Brazil; and like Brazil, this movie reveals why life in the late 20th century was almost unbearable - if you were lucky. It is not simply that Western culture was suffering from serious overloads of information, but the information itself was just bad, bad, bad and bleak. In fact, it was the very effect of overload that kept people connected because it allowed people to be distracted by one crisis or another - if the news of Vietnam became too much to bear, they could turn the channel and watch a documentary unemployment rate. The "positive" response to reality revealed in Head was Woodstock - three days of peace and love and nudity and mud and insects and bad food and dirty drink and poop and pee and bad acid and Peter Townsend almost killing Abbie Hoffman. Everything happened behind a steel fence under the lovingly watchful eyes of a true army of New York state police - meaning that the "freedom" of Woodstock Nation was as illusory as the music that John Sebastion thought he was singing. speak. "500,000 stupid idiots out of the rain," was a critic's judgment about Woodstock (I think it was Andy Warhol). <br /> <br /> The only good thing that happened there was Jimi Hendrix's Star Spangled Banner. Two years earlier, the Jimi Hendrix Experience made their first America tour with the warm-up opening for the Monkees. <br /> <br /> See, it's all connected in some way. <br /> <br /> You owe it to yourself - no, you owe it to your unborn children - to see the real 60's, only to be found on film in this bizarre tribute, miraculous and utterly absurd to one of the most interesting capitalist coups of the late twentieth century.
