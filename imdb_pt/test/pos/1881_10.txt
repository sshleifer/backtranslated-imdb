Usually I do not review online, but it's Saturday and I'm stuck in my room on a rainy day with nothing to do besides watching science fiction films and Xena: Warrior Princess (I can not catch the damn 'Joxer the Mighty Song out of my head, has been there for the last ten years or so, just randomly appears when someone (me) does something stupid). If you have any complaints about this movie, and actually publish them on the internet, do you have any idea how much you look like an idiot? If you expect more from Bruce Campbell than what he puts (in the most literal sense) than why in God's holy name do you watch your movies? No one watches a Bruce Campbell movie when they want to see something genius and intelligible, we watch them, then we feel better about ourselves (like those people who watch Jerry Springer and eat Chunky Monkey), and to be easily entertained by nonsense psychopaths . . I personally love Bruce Campbell movies. I'm not a complete idiot, in fact, I see myself as an intellectual and a scholar (haha, shut up, Ally). His films reflect insane, random, quirky and ridiculous ideals that anyone with a brain, screaming or not, might like. That, and he was kind of sexy on Xena: Warrior Princess, even with facial hair. I rate this movie as a great 10, just because I can. If you can not catch simplistic plot schemes (if any), flurries of science fiction splendor (leather, spandex) and familiar visions of insanity, if not exhausted, then screaming out loud, do not watch the movie. (or anything that mentions the name Bruce Campbell). Oh yeah, Ted Raimi was amazing in that movie! Way to go Ted! You did the best with what you had. ; |
