This is a hard-to-find movie in the US, but if you can find it - and you're interested in the life and music of Percy Aldridge Grainger, you'll enjoy it. It's historically accurate. Richard Roxborough's Grainger looks surprisingly like Grainger in this period in time. Karen Holten, by Emily Woof, is much prettier than the real Karen, but it was an inaccuracy I was happy to find out! I think what really impressed me was how Roxborough captured Grainger's outrageous personality. Barbara Hershey's Rose was also a treasure. If she looks considerably younger than Rose did at that time, it's more than compensated for how well she captured Rose's obsession with Percy. It's an easy movie to recommend. (I should note that when she saw "Passion" my wife had no particular affinity with (or knowledge of) Grainger and her music, but she was totally captivated by the film.
