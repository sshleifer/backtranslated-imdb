This low budget crocodile film actually delivers the goods. The fact that it was inspired by true events would mean little if you ended up with a fake crocodile, a C.G.I. bad or an obvious studio. Fortunately, none of the above is involved with this fantastic and very realistic film. The crocodile is real, there is no C.G.I. and on-site shooting occurs in a real Australian marsh. The actors were obviously inspired to create as much realism as possible in their performances, and they succeeded. You can put yourself in your situation, which is proof of how realistically "Black Water" translates as entertainment. Highly recommended. - MERK
