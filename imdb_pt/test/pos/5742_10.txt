The grandmother is the best movie ever Ganny is the best movie I have ever seen. the plot was like nothing ever seen or done before these people were truly blessed with a talent without a joke I love this movie. I need to buy, but I can not find it anywhere. It's a dream for me to go meet the actors and try to make a grandma. I rented GRANNY on the Broadway video and kept it for a week longer than I should have and asked if I could buy it. not a big disappointment and an even bigger one in the week after I came back I wanted to go and rent it again but came to find out the Broadway video was out of business. if anyone has the movie or knows where I can buy it, please write to iloverot@aol.com
