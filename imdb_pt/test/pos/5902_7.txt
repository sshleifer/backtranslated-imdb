This is not the best Canadian movie of all time, IMO. I'm not going to leave the track and name 3 or 4 better. Just a few nights before I have seen "The Bicycle Thief", the highly rated Italian classic, and there are some parallels. Both filmmakers filmed their film in a specific time and place, with minimal resources in terms of sets and cast. And the result in both cases is fascinating and a joy to watch the realistic setting and the characters alone. The prolonged shots on the faces and the landscape almost make it worth watching on their own. That being said, this is not exactly the same as the Italian classic. The film is filmed in a frigid and arid city of asbestos mining in Quebec. This frigidity is contrasted with the warmth of the people and the eye of filmmaker Claude Jutra. Basically, what you get is a series of vignettes that are probably nostalgic memories of Jutra - not ha, ha funny - but pungent, and probably sometimes difficult at the time, but now warmed up with the homeland of nostalgia. The film snakes; there is little tension. Somewhere about half to two-thirds of the story begins. Everyone you've met up to this point is involved, and you've come to know these characters very well; so have a little patience right from the start. The story is good; will leave you thinking, and involves sex, love and death, all the basics. If you like Bergman, Godard, Truffaut, all that sort of thing, you will not be disappointed with that.
