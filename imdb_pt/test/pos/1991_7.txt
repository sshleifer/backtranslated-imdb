"We are both stumbling together in this formless world whose rules and objectives are largely unknown, seemingly indecipherable, or even possibly non-existent, always on the verge of being killed by forces we do not understand." So says Ted Pikul in the film. That for some people sums up life and 'eXistenZ' is probably a movie about existence. What is real and what is unreal and how do you tell the difference. Or not. The last line of the film is superbly ambiguous. <br /> <br /> The film looks like a disheveled dog story (actually it has a real hairy dog), but it takes you on an interesting ride, full of taunts. The Cronenberg touches that will make you look at amphibians, pods, fish, pimples and bones in a new light. Some pieces are very disgusting. It takes place in a rural setting where the gas station is called a "gas station" and a Chinese restaurant is called "CHINESE RESTAURANT." The film has a captivating texture that is at a distance from your usual science fiction film. many things in the movie and returns by watching more than once. <br /> <br /> The main actors are Jude Law, who is good and Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is great. Some roles do not suit this very talented actor, but when she has a good role like this, she is second to none. Her unconventional beauty and her fascinating voice fit into Allegra's part. (It looks great in a little black skirt too.) There are other family actors, but they do not have much to do. Sounds good, sounds good, and a score by Howard Shore complements the movie very well. Cronenberg is possibly the Alfred Hitchcock of the sci-fi / horror genre. No matter what movie he does, it's always worth watching.
