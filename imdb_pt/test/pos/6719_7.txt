Although hardly comparable to other science fiction movie giants like 2001: THE SPACE ODYSSEY or LIGHT FINDINGS OF THE THIRD TYPE, the LIFEFORCE functions as a totally bizarre and bizarre fusion of elements of science fiction and terror. Somehow, despite the dialogue that addresses ridicule and the acting that does the same, it manages to work because of some highly different elements. <br /> <br /> Freely based on Colin Wilson's 1976 novel, "The Space Vampires," this film by director Tobe Hooper (POLTERGEIST) focuses on a joint US-US mission Britain aboard the British space shuttle Churchill to study Halley's Comet. Led by an American commander (Steve Railsback), they discover an alien spacecraft in the comet's coma. And as they investigate the interior of the spacecraft, they find alien occupants that look like giant bats. Later, Churchill arrives in Earth orbit, but no response is given from radio calls issued from the base of the mission, the Space Research Center in London. Columbia is cast to meet with Churchill, but they find the whole ship destroyed by fire - all except the alien beings wrapped in glass that, far from being untouched by fire, seem absolutely perfect. The aliens are bought back to Earth ... and that's where the incredible happens. <br /> <br /> These space vampires escape from the Space Research Center and instead of draining their blood victims through bites, they suck their victims. 'Lifeforce totally out of them. One of them is Space Girl, a completely naked vampire played by Mathilda May. Railsback, the only real survivor of Churchill, is bought by SRC chief Frank Finlay and a British special agent (Peter Firth) to track down May, who is in telepathic contact with him. Soon, however, the vampires turned London into a scene of pure holocaust; people are being desiccated or turning into zombies, and NATO's threat to sterilize the city with thermonuclear radiation is great. Railsback finally reaches May, and sacrifices herself by impaling her with a large metal saber. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly unconnected, unquestionably unequal, but still worth watching, LIFEFORCE, despite the frequent inconsistency of his script and his performance, benefits from some excellent special effects of John Dykstra (STAR WARS), some of the best ever seen. The other element of work, and a surprise, is the incredible orchestral soundtrack of Henry Mancini, almost Wagnerian in the same way as John Williams's soundtrack to STAR WARS - and Mancini, like Williams before him, uses the London Symphony Orchestra Largely forgotten these days, and a critical and box-office disaster in 1985, the LIFEFORCE, if for no other reason, still has to be seen by anyone who has a taste for the bizarre. There has never been a movie like this before, and there certainly will not be anything like it again.
