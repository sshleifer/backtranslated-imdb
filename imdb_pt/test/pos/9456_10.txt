When I saw the first preview, I almost fainted with excitement. I've been a fan of Twelfth Night for a long time - it took me to Shakespeare, so having a modern adaptation is a dream come true. My expectation was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The plot basically follows the original plot and it means: complicated! I do not even want to try to relate it, the summer plot is probably going to cover the basics. Imagine having a girl pretending to be a guy in a boarding school and thinking about all the possible situations they would create. I will not even pause to question the plausibility of such a plot; reality is not the point of the movie. <br /> <br /> What is, however, is absolutely hilarious. Almost all scenes preach the comic setup. Congratulations to the writers, director and actors in this regard. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is the star of this movie and she loads it wonderfully. She is super cute, not a bitch and can make a comedy without fail. I admire her as much for not being as slutty in her movies or in public life as many actresses do today. I'm glad there's at least one decent young actress in Hollywood. Ok, I'm out of my soap box ... Channing Tatum, yes he's hot and built like a gorilla, but he really makes me laugh! My favorite scenes throughout the movie are when he is trying to talk to Olivia first talking about cheese and then about his training regime. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast also did not fail to perform, with wonderful additions to the characters in the forms of the mother debunker and Monique, the girlfriend of classic evil. <br /> <br /> Overall, lots of fun, loooots of laughter and a highly attractive cast. Maybe not on par with the original, but it outperforms modern versions of other pieces, including the much praised 10 things I hate about you.
