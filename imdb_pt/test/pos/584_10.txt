The Muppet movie is an instant classic. I remember the opening scene with the panoramic view of the swamp and Kermit beginning (in my opinion) the most loved song in the history of songs. At that moment my mother always sang along with Kermit. <br /> <br /> Watching this title as a young man makes me smile. I can still sing next to the desire of my heart. Like many Muppets movies, there are adult jokes that are (in my opinion) still funny today. My favorite line of all time is actually this movie, it's the last phrase said by my green-eyed hero Kermit "Life is like a movie, write your own ending." That's what I intend to do! Thank you Jim Henson.
