Undoubtedly, GRAND CHAMPION has the most impressive cast of "AAA" stars and musicians who have come together for a fun family "G" adventure. This is a must buy for every video collection! Director BARRY TUBB cleverly combines the drama of the rodeo / 4H competition for the "GRAND CHAMPION" cow with a moving and funny story of perseverance against difficult challenges. Joey Lauren Adams presents her typically solid performance as the well-meaning mother, but the star of the show is 12-year-old Emma Emma Roberts, whose presence on camera is brilliant as that of her famous aunt, JULIA. You can expect a lot from this young Roberts-protégé 'as he is already showing off in his new Nickelodeon series,' UNFABULOUS '.
