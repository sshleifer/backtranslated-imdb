Gamers: DR is not a fantasy movie, it's more like an amateur video. Horrible magic effect, really false fireball, terribly made dungeon, castle, village ...... sword, ax, shield, mantle, plate ..... okok ... everything. You'll need about 10 minutes to adjust your visual expectation, so you'll have 105 minutes of fun. <br /> <br /> I am from Hong Kong and it is very difficult to find RPers, none of my friends play RPG and I always like to be one of the characters in the D & D world. Watching Gamers: DR just show me how would be to be a player. You see rules books, dices, game play, etc etc etc; You hear terms like "fighter", "magician", "life point", "level", "character", "flaming hand", "chaotic evil". <br /> <br /> What the RPG likes about me is that they let you do anything you want, not linked by RPG software. Gamers: DR provides the same element, you will not know what will happen next and will probably make you laugh until you die. The movie is real life for both gamers and the D & D world. You will hear the gamer roll the dice when the character in the game comes into action, which makes you feel really participatory in the game. <br /> <br /> I do not want to ruin anything, but anyway, Gamers: DR is a must have for RPG lovers. For people never play RPG, I'm sure you still have a lot of fun with it.
