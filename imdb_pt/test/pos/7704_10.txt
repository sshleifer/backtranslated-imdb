I watch this movie with horror in my heart because my mother was also a crackhead like Michelle. I've been wondering where Michelle is now. There were times when I had to find my mother in places I was afraid to be but more afraid to leave her there! see Michelle act like this made me wonder where she'd been sleeping all this time? I watched in hope it has never been so bad for my mother! and what I want to know is ... where did Matt and Tracy "rip their ass off?"! The worst scene for me was watching Tracy shoot an old Navy dressing room !!!! You never try clothes before you and it seems that all of them, except Michelle, have aids !!!! Where are they knowing 2008? can we get an update ??????????
