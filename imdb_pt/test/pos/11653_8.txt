This is the most human and human of the movies I've seen in a long time. The ironies are plentiful, Susan Sarandon as a nun, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon in a movie that does not preach but also does not condemn. It is the cinema that is the best, and yet the story is fictionalized from various real events. <br /> <br /> Which one is the most amazing, Sarandon or Penn? It's easy to say who's nicer, but it's hard to tell who's the most compelling. they are simply magnificent. <br /> <br /> You may think that all murderers should be killed or you can argue that life without parole is not life and that death is more merciful. whatever your personal feeling, this movie gives you the chance to pause and reconsider. <br /> <br /> In the end, we simply want to sit quietly and reflect. This is what the great drama does, gives catharsis, creates a moment in time, a shared memory that touches our humanity.
