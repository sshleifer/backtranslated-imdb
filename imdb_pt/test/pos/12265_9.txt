I'm sitting around movie listings and really do not see anything I want to see. My appetite keeps saying, "Something like BROADCAST NEWS". That's what I want. Something intelligent and funny, with adult ideas and great acting and writing, and a style of direction that does not draw attention to itself. This may be the best performance of Hurt (it's THE BIG CHILL, in my opinion): however eccentric, Hurt is intelligent and interprets a person without intelligence without being sure - wink wink - the audience knows - wink wink - - Hey, I'm not stupid ... well, okay out there. Hunter is perfect for notes and Albert Brooks is a revelation. (And he can read and sing at the same time!) Great, great work. <br /> <br />
