"Jaded" takes on the complex issue of abuse: perpetrators and victims. In smaller hands, it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct video. This director, however, was able to conduct a multilayered textured study with a decidedly different point of view. Given the fact that the director / writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A. are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-male film. It is not. Being a sexual predator is gender neutral. The nudity of this movie is not erotic. Rape is brutal and not sexual. We are looking at the victims and not the excitement. <br /> <br /> The talented cast sounds true. For a film that is so little known, I was surprised by the quality of the presentations. They are good. Carla Gugino and Rya Kihlstedt are amazing. <br /> <br /> Somehow, this movie got lost. Maybe you're too smart for your own good. It's a "should see." Highly recommended. Sexual suspense of a thinking person.
