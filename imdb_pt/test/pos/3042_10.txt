I saw this movie on TV in the UK about 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. My interest has recently been revived by visiting Hilton Head - the next island instead of "Yamacraw" (Daufuskie actually), and reading the excellent "The Water is Wide" by Pat Conroy. With the benefit of knowledge, I reassessed Conrack and consider it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some precision - a rarity of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Three things still impress me: 1) The issues of educating the poor and marginalized and being inclusive remain the same. 2. Education is more than reading and writing. 3 .. These kids were my classmates, I was 6 in 1969 when Pat Conroy spent the year in Daufuskie. <br /> <br /> Why has not this been released on DVD yet?
