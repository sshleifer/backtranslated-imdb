One of the most interesting things is that this 1988 film is highly praised as a sequel "just in name". There's nothing wrong with that, except this: the return of Chevy Chase as Ty Webb. This connects the viewer to this character (from the original Caddyshack in 1980) and makes fans think or want the Caddyshack II to look like the first. <br /> <br /> There are rumors that Rodney Dangerfield should return. He carried a large part of the first film, so his return would have put Caddyshack 2 on top. Jackie Mason is the new Rodney for this movie and does a decent job, even if his deliveries are very different. Dan Aykroyd was great but not in the movie enough. He should be involved in the amount of screen time Bill Murray got in the first one. Robert Stack (Airplane!) Was good in the new role of Ted Knight / Villian. (We miss you, Ted!) Danny Noonan should have come back. Many others could have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later. Bushwood should not have gone through the total overhaul he did. Instead, the characters involved, instead of the club itself, should have been the main focus, as they were in the first. When you watch this movie, keep in mind that it's not a great sequel and you may think it's another good or bad eighties comedy. Fans of the first must see it, but do not be shocked when the comparisons between the original and Part II are so far apart.
