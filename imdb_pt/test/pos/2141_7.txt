I've been a fan of Heaven's Gate since its first release. I've seen it at least half a dozen times and thought of it as a masterpiece. So it was with enthusiasm and a sense of anticipation that I took myself to see the cut of the restored director. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I was disappointed to see him again, and since then I have reviewed my estimated film. The Gate of Paradise touches the grandeur in parts, but in general it lacks the thematic and narrative consistency and the passionate urgency characteristic of a truly grandiose film. <br /> <br /> First, two technical problems: The sound quality is diffuse throughout the film. , approaching inaudibility at times. Part of this, perhaps, is intentional - a way of imitating the chaos and confusion of history as it unfolds. But at key points, it is not possible to record what the characters are saying. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is equally diffuse. The images do not show sharpness and particular detail. The result is a certain graininess and lack of pictorial clarity that can blur the foreground and the background. Structurally, the narrative is out of tune, as if Cimino could not decide the effect he is after. He wanted an epic, of course. But a pastoral or dramatic epic? The film is uncomfortable and unconvincing between styles and maybe even genres. Sometimes I remembered Days of Heaven, Terrence Malick, or even Elvira Madigan, in their languid, elegant scene painting. On other occasions, it threatens to turn into a robust western, more like 'The Wild Bunch'. In fact, the last film offers an instructive benchmark for a 'Heaven's Gate' rating, as it shares the same concern of the period and employs a similar tone of ambivalent nostalgia for a darker but more heroic America. <br /> <br /> This structural and thematic uncertainty is not helped by the poor quality script that often sounds forced and shocking to the ear. The result is an inauthentic sense of the discourse of the period. <br /> <br /> The almost greatness of the Gate of Heaven resides in its fixed parts. The sequence of skates, in particular, is unbelievably beautiful, one of the most evocative scenes ever made in the movies. <br /> <br /> Another piece that works great in terms of theme, mood and unifying scenery occurs when Kristofferson and Huppert will ride on new equipment for the lake and she will wash herself while he sleeps in the shade. The languid rhythm, evocative music, and monumental scenery combine in this scene to convincingly portray the love story that may be at the heart of the film - and what could have been its saving grace if pursued more convincingly. <br /> <br /> Some critics complained about the length of the film. That in itself does not bother me. A good movie can not be long enough. The restored minutes are key to restoring the missing motivation and characterization of the cut version, and they are full of pictorial interest. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the main glory of the Gate of Paradise lies in the painfully evocative soundtrack. The repeated theme of the waltz and its different scores (complete band, guitar, solo violin, etc.) give an astonishing quality to the action of the foreground and establish a thematic consistency that is lacking in the narrative itself. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, most notably the absence of a convincing narrative, there is a sense of greatness about the film. The cinema is left with a sorry feeling of lost grandeur and a desire that Cimino could revisit the film - with the wisdom of time and hindsight, to repair what is so bad.
