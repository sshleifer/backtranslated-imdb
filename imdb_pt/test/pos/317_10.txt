As I look through the hundreds of comments that faithful readers of IMDB have published in this film, I find it very interesting how few comments, "middle of the road", exist. Everyone loves or hates. Having seen Apocalypse Now about 30 times, and having recently dissected on DVD (how do we live without these magical digital machines ?????), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place. in my heart for this movie. "Why would you want such a confusing movie?" Ask many of my associates. The answer is this: Forget the war, forget the brutality ... This is a classic story of society protecting itself from those who refuse to follow the status quo. Brando represents the individual who has his own way of doing the work. They (Big Brother) have sent him to do the work, he does it very well, without adhering to the accepted "standards" of death and destruction (am I the only one who is worried about the fact that we have "standards" for death? and destruction ????), then they send the "Conformity Police" to eliminate the individual. Hmmmmmm .... Draw some parallel between this and the things you see every day? With the deepest respect for Mr. Coppola, who I believe to be one of the best directors of all time, I think he transcended his original intent of the film and probably did not even notice until the film was released. The subtle subtext that permeates the whole film has a lot to do with being planned and portrayed; instead, it seems to have "grown" in itself, like a wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden. Once again I have to reiterate: I think FF Coppola has done an incredible job in this entire production, such as the cast and crew, but the sum of the film exceeds ten times the individual effort. So if you have not seen the movie, rent it, watch it, watch it again, and maybe a few more times, and look for all the generic parallels with everyday life. Only then make a judgment about the quality of the film. Those of you who have seen, will again see the mentality described above. I think you may have a new appreciation for the movie. Or maybe not! No matter if you love or hate, be sure and give Coppola credit for his masterful storytelling style!
