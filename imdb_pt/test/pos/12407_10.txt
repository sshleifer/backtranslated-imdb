I love this movie. Tense with great characters. The boy from "Sandlot" is great, just like Corey Feldman. When children attack the seat, it's pure adrenaline. Inside the bench, it becomes a bit like a "Lord of the Flies" situation where they turn against each other. Justin Walker of "Clueless" is wonderful. I saw this on "Showtime" while browsing the channel. It was a pleasant surprise. James Remar is also very good here as the sheriff of the small town. Taylor Nichols, who I love from "Barcelona", does a good job also as a federal agent. I recommend this movie to any fan of bank robbery movies with a lot of good characters. I was shocked to discover that Roger Corman was a producer on this, since the film is not a B movie.
