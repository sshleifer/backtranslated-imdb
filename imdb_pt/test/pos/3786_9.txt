This is one of Chaplin's first national films, from the period between his glorious Short Mutual and the more mature features of United Artists. More opulent than the Mutual films, Chaplin's quest to perfect his comic expression continues. Most people forget that the movie is actually a dream that Charlie has while waiting to be sent forward. There is a lot of antics through Limburger cheese being used to fuel the enemy, and Chaplin's incursion into enemy tree-clad territory. <br /> <br /> At this stage of the career, the great man had been so immersed in the filmic expression that his films give the impression of being alone. Undoubtedly, this was not the case, but still, it gives a convincingly realistic view of life up front, as I recall, albeit from an ironically humorous perspective. As far as I'm concerned, familiarity with the whole of Chaplin's work should be a prerequisite for all moviegoers - do not delay!
