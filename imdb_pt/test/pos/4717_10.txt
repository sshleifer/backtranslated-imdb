This is a great movie in many different ways ... perhaps most importantly it presents the Western public with the remarkable and tragic story of Aung San Suu Kyi and his struggle for freedom and democracy. Wonderful performance, dazzling cinematography, breathtaking action and suspense: "Beyond Rangoon" has it all. I've seen this movie several times over the past ten years and each time it means more to me. Not everyone will like it (hence the relatively low IMDb rating), but that's because it's not a conventional Hollywood stupidity; instead it challenges the viewer on several levels. I never watched without sobbing in the end and promising to live a more meaningful life.
