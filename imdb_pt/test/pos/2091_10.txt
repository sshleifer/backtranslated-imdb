When a bomber, a patrician, a pornographer, and a crazy biker, along with several other forms of social scum, have had enough of their freak-infested cell, they identify a rat and look for the hole. Escaping from the sewer the group of 9 souls, enjoy the new freedom found and go to civilization. What follows is not surprising. Complete chaos and terror follow their trail. It seems like everyone has some unfinished business to take care of. <br /> <br /> Freely based on The Great Escape, 9 SOULS is by far among the top 5 movies I've seen this year. Running right around 2 hours 9 SOULS will deliver such a powerful story that it will literally leave you breathless. The handsome, but subtle, use of the wavy sides of the field adds the realism that is expected of this story. The vision of director Toshiaki Toyoda (Blue Spring, Porno Star), is completely incomprehensible, as it implements a sense of pity for the characters. As fast as each character captures their dream, it is as fast as it gets ripped from them. Now the full responsibility for the success of this film should not lie solely on the shoulders of the director, but the accessories should also go to the actors. This movie was full of excellent performance from top to bottom. Ryuhei Matsuda (the son of Miyuki Matsuda of Audition) does a stellar performance, and seems to bring some of his mother to the screen. <br /> <br /> I should also support the Artsmagic DVD. This is the sixth movie of them that I have seen now, and they seem to get better and better each DVD. The sound quality is perfect and the picture; clean and fresh. It is very annoying trying to watch a movie that is too dark in the transfer, so the discs of these cats are good. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie will soon receive the status of masterpiece by viewers around the world. Keep an eye on 2005 for 9 SOULS; It's really amazing movie to watch.
