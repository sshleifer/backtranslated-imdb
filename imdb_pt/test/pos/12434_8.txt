"Gaming? Nicotine? Fisticuffs? We are moving in a downward spiral of iniquity!" So says the chief of St. Swithen in inspecting the common mistress at Nutbourne. The faculty and students of St. Swithen were ordered to share facilities at Nutbourne to avoid German bombs during World War II. Then there is the library of the masters. "It's not the book we got Jessica James reading in the closet, Decameron Nights!" "Well, really," he said. what else this place may or may not be, is no place to take girls carefully raised! "<br /> <br /> Yes, a terrible mistake was made by the Ministry of Education. Nutbourne is a school for boys. St. Swithen is a girls' school. And what makes this one of the best post-WWII British comedies, Nutbourne's boss is Wetherby Pond ... played by Alastair Yes while the head of St. Swithen is Muriel Whitchurch ... played by Margaret Rutherford. <br /> <br /> "St. Swithen's?" says Lagoa. "You do not mean that yours is a school for boys and girls?" he asks one of the older girls. "Just girls," she says cheerfully. "That means, sir," asks one of Nutbourne's teachers, "that we should expect 100 girls?" "It means that not only has the ministry made a mistake in sending a school here, but that it is guilty of a terrible sexual aberration!" <br /> <br /> Ms. Margaret Rutherford's Whitchurch, as positive and motionless as a warship, intends to do its best by embracing Nutbourne, if possible. Alastair Sim Pond is exasperated until her bald head and is determined to save her school. Meanwhile, there are 100 girls and 170 boys to be fed and sleeping places (along with all the teachers). The cooks and foremen, all placed, leave. Miss Whitchurch and her girls, however, are up to the task of cooking. "Come now, Angela," she says to a girl trying to stir something into a large pot, "did not you make porridge before?" "Yes, but no one ever had to eat it." "This is a defeatist attitude, my dear. Stir well and do not be shilly shally." <br /> <br /> Things are going badly when Pond discovers that four governors of a school he hopes to lead are coming at any moment to see for themselves how well led by Nutbourne is. And Miss. Whitchurch discovers that four rich and influential parents have just arrived to see how their daughters are doing in the new boy, they said - the facilities. The only solution? Ms. Whitchurch and Pond, their teachers and students, come up with a series of lessons to make the allusion that Nutbourne has no girls and that St. Swithen has no boys. After the parents inspect a dormitory and leave for a class, the girls in the bed bow down and the boys who were hidden jump on the beds as soon as the governors come in. The boys are watched in rugby and, as soon as the governors turn their backs, the goalposts are removed, the lacrosse nets are placed, and only then do the parents walk to observe the girls. One of the parents sees her daughter in a science class and, moments later, sees her in a choir practice, and moments later ... "There's Angela again," she says to Ms. Whitchurch. "Because that's the way it is," she responds, pushing the parents to avoid the governors who are approaching around the corner. "The child is omnipresent." <br /> <br /> When we left Nutbourne, everything was discovered. The students are moving. Teachers are stunned (except for two who are kissing). The Ministry of Education has just sent several student buses. Parents are speechless, but governors are not. "We are waiting for an explanation," one of them says sternly. Pond holds her head and shudders. "Can not you see I'm trying to think of one?" <br /> <br /> The film goes from one complicated and ridiculous situation after another, backed by a very funny script and two extremely comedic performances by Rutherford and Sim. Rutherford's exasperation and ruthless determination are so well matched that It's a shame that this is the only movie they did together. Joyce Grenfell, like Gossage, tall, awkward, sports teacher from St. Swithen gives them some competition. If you keep your eyes open, you'll also find some fun references from director Frank Launder, including a Nutbourne gong that looks like a dwarven version of J. Arthur Rank, a faint echo of The Third Man's zither theme, and a stolen shot of David Lean's Oliver Twist, except this time the little boy comes up holding his bowl of porridge and says, "Please sir, I do not want any more." Frank Launder and his partner, Sidney Gilliat, were responsible for some of the best films produced in England during the 1930s, 40s and 50s. They wrote, produced and directed, sometimes making one, sometimes the other. In one way or another, they were responsible for top-notch films such as Green for Danger (with a masterful performance by Sim), I See a Dark Stranger, The Lady Vanishes, Night Train for Munich, Wee Geordie, The Belles of St Trinian, The Rake's Progress and many others. With the happiest days of his life, Launder wrote and directed while both produced. He's one of the best of them.
