The following are minor spoilers Steve Allen opined that the topic mood over serious events may be considered acceptable by many based on the formula: Tragedy + Time = Comedy. 1939 before the German assault on Poland was not a fun period and subsequent events, including the Blitzkrieg (following the Sitzkrieg) that led Germany to the Channel, resulted in the heroic evacuation in Dunkirk and gave the world the sickly spectacle of a France supposedly prostrated its honor to the Nazi conqueror. <br /> <br /> The stuff of romance, comedy, and a great deal of serious drama? Yes. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau, with a well-matched and excellent cast, creates in Bon Voyage a pastiche of events and scenes of history and imagination that is extremely entertaining. <br /> <br /> Viviane Denvers Isabelle Adjani is the most famous actress in France, while the clouds of war gather over Europe (what a cliched cliche, sorry). A self-proclaimed veteran with many cases to her credit, her inner motivation seems to be "whatever is good for Viviane is good for ... Viviane." After the premiere of her latest film, after which a minister in the incompetent Reynaud administration , Jean-Etienne Beaufort (Gerard Depardieu in an unusual role for him), signals his interest in her, she goes home only to wearily find a former lover who does not understand the word "no." She resolutely resolves this question, but Frederic (Gregory Derangere), to help deal with the mess in his apartment, Frederic is a hoped-for novelist. <br /> <br /> A comic accident which once again emphasizes that, almost as a message of public service, the importance of working windscreen wipers puts Frederic in jail under more serious charges. Fortunately, the Germans' escape from his the static positions forces a transfer of prisoners to the south of France, but our boy escapes by going there in private rather than as a barrier of the state. <br /> <br /> Panic and fear in France like the defeated Germans are well portrayed and a new twist enters the story. Who should find Frederic, but the truly beautiful young research assistant, Camille (Virginie Ledoyen), who accompanies the obligatory Jewish refugee scientist, Professor Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehle). Kopolski has some bottles of "heavy water" that he needs to get to England. Of course the Germans do not cling to this vital ingredient for you (one part is pure fiction - there was never heavy water in France in 1940 - just Perrier). And Camille is as attractive as she is devoted. <br /> <br /> What next? Peter Coyote as an alleged French journalist, Alex Winckler. Be warned as to your name. He is really an official of the Abwehr (German military intelligence: a spy). And he used to sleep with Viviane as well (and wants a reprise of his case). Apparently, Kopolski's type is the only major male character he does not want to be with the actress. <br /> <br /> What follows is a series of adventures and setbacks that are seamlessly integrated to produce a very fast style. paced and enjoyable movie. In part, a tribute and a kind of spoof in "Casablanca", this is an incredibly funny movie (except for the heavy Nazi pieces). <br /> <br /> Isabelle Adjani deserves praise for the best portrait I have seen in years of a adorably cute narcissist with few or no redemptive features. And Depardieu, disloyal to Reynauld and ready to leave the ship and join the traitor, Petain, is convincing as a man whose enthusiasm for Viviane exceeds his sense of duty diluted to the Republic. As a human being in power at a critical moment in French history, Beaufort is worldly vile. <br /> <br /> Not shown in many theaters, Bon Voyage should be available for purchase or rent soon. Look! <br /> <br /> 9/10
