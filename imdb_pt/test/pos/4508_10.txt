I read the book and saw the movie today. The plot is so powerful that almost any screenplay or script would have done him justice. So nothing much there. However, this is still a beautiful movie because it makes you think and feel, just like the book. Watching this is not like watching a documentary in a bankrupt state and feeling sympathy with people suffering under an oppressive regime, but it's like watching any story of another ordinary man, across generations, across continents. Amir's cowardice, his guilt, his dilemmas, and finally his choice of a form of redemption could have been a story of any of us. There is not a single infallible character to admire and idolize, but they are all gray, as are all of us. <br /> <br /> Another important observation is that the film does a great job of telling the lives. Afghans over the twenties of turbulent political scenarios. A vibrant and carefree childhood represents Kabul before the Russian invasion and the desolate remnants of the city echo what the Taliban did to her. <br /> <br /> Children-actors deserve "approval" to the end. . They can embarrass any mature actor. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet seen the movie or read the book, just enter the theater bearing in mind it will witness a multi-layered story woven. in a multi-colored fabric of human emotions and feelings. This film is not intended to provoke anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban feelings, but rather to experience the trials of human existence. <br /> I read some of the external reviews linked to the site and I must confess that I do not see the point in writing reviews that summarize the plot as a distant spectator and point out technical details about incredible cinematography or something similar. At least for this film, one should try to connect it rather than judge it objectively.
