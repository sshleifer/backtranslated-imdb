Daddy (78) and I (46) had fun watching the movie today. For a guy mostly known for serious roles, De Niro is a comic actor heckuva. Of course, it helps to have your past movie footage to play against. Consider that one of these roles, 15 MINUTES, was a policeman having to deal with mass media interference, and you have an interesting set of comparisons / contrasts. <br /> <br /> Murphy plays another of his Axel Foley character type. Shatner plays a burlesque of self, a parallel world self that was best known by TJ HOOKER and not by STAR TREK. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note how the film comments on the contrasts between the reality of police work and its fictional counterparts on TV and in the cinema. Shatner lectures on the proper means of sliding through the hood of a car; De Niro points out that the holsters scratch the finish of the hood. Ironically, as the film progresses, De Niro's character begins to incorporate the illusions of reality TV-TV in the case of the real world in which he is working. <br /> <br /> The film draws inspiration from a range of sources. make the comment is derived. Well, so what? Satire must derive its mood to exist. And in addition, the film has peculiar moments of originality. For example, I am reasonably certain that the villain's death method has never been done before. <br /> <br /> A complaint about the reality of the weapons involved - should not these weapons have had some kind of retreat? To penetrate the steel, these bullets had to have sufficient inertia to penetrate. And the highest level of inertia of the bullet is at the moment of firing. So ... firing a hail of those tank killer bullets should have propelled the sniper back to its ends. Oh, what the hell ... it's a satire. Perhaps the lack of recoil of the guns is in itself a satire in the B-F-Guns used of so casual way in the thrillers. <br /> <br />
