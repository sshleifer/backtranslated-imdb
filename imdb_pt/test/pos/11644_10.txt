I've seen this movie for many years and it has never left my list of the best movies ever made of all time. When I first saw it, I was just beginning what became a passion for justice. He gave an interesting perspective on the death penalty and also gave me some things to think about. <br /> <br /> When you have a cast like this, you're right to assume it's going to be nothing less than that. fabulous. This is by far the best role I've ever seen Sean Penn play (along with Sam). He sets the paper, does not glamorize his actions while doing so. He manages to maintain a level of debauchery throughout the film that I think was very important. By the end, he does not try to be seen as anything more than he is. He is a sick man who regrets his past, but still gives excuses for it. He ends up being able to rescue his sense of self-esteem as much as a convicted (and guilty) murderer can, with the help of Susan Sarandon's character, sister Helen Prejean. Your character taught me about goodwill toward others without making me forget how a person's actions can be horrible and without making excuses for them. <br /> <br /> The support cast was also top-notch. I was surprised to see a small appearance of Jack Black in this movie given the funny man he became today! I loved this movie for personal reasons and just because it was a cinematographic work of art. And, in my opinion, that's one of the rare exceptions when the film surpassed the book.
