Most of Brigitte Bardot's films I've seen have failed to take advantage of their captivating presence on screen. Unfortunately, she received few really good roles in films of undeniable quality, which was a real oversight. She deserved them and was able to demonstrate her cinematic power when they emerged. Like Genevieve in "Love on a Pillow," we had a clear exception to the trend of light and soft vehicles, as it was an interesting artistic film by any reasonable measure, and a 28 year old BB was with her. more attractive. "Une Parisienne" is another, featuring an extremely catchy Brigitte in an interesting and well-crafted comedy that explores how an ambitious man can be persuaded to remain faithful to an incredibly beautiful young wife. There are several good performances here. Her husband playboy, Michel, is one of them, "The Prince", played by Charles Boyer, is another, with entertainment efforts of a good supporting cast. As for Brigitte Bardot, the way she looks in this film is the way I remember her as a child in the fifties. She was 23 years old in 1957 and far ahead of her time, prettier than any other actress of the period, including Marilyn Monroe. Her curvaceous and flirtatious sexuality, widely shown in various dresses, simply jumped from the canvas. She was more cool and cute than the women of America are today, almost fifty years later. Obsessed with their careers and still clinging desperately to feminist politics, they go out like a bunch of clueless lesbians. In contrast, the sexual kitten was sexually liberated, intelligent and clearly independent long before it was fashionable, but while fully grasping the power of its exceptional femininity, it used it for a higher purpose than mere self-interest- believed in love. A still photo simply could not do it justice. You had to watch her slim but voluptuous shape (with her 20-inch waist) lightly cross a room. You had to see that wild blonde mane, look in your big, brown, seductive eyes, and listen as your full, full lips spoke French. In a close-up at the end of the film, she flickers and flirts with the camera, her beautiful orbs flicker. What baby! For Brigitte Bardot fans, "Une Parisienne" is not to be missed.
