I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost every day. There are good and bad in ALL races, why make everyone bad? This holds true for all races today. John Harper was an educated man, he graduated from high school, he still had a university year before returning to reserve. How do I know that? John Harper lived with my family in the three years he attended high school and kept in touch with us the year after graduation. He was a gentle and kind soul, he could be fun and could be serious when times were right. I was not too old when he left our house but I still remember every time he helped me with my homework when my own brother could not be bothered. He even taught 3rd grade the year before he arrived in Winnipeg. None of this is mentioned in the film, and the suicide of the police cross is an admission of guilt as far as I am concerned. What happened to John is unforgivable, not only in the native community, but also in the white community. Not everyone in Winnipeg thinks like the police, I knew the person in there and how he was like PERSON, not like an Indian!
