I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it was one of the most captivating movies I've ever seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was to meet new and new faces and great actors behind them in great unexpected locations and brilliantly filmed. The three heroes share a chemistry on the screen that runs through the entire film, making it so exciting. They are set in amazing landscapes seen by such an original eye (the PDO's work is great) that makes you feel like you are discovering it for the first time. The desert climate floods everywhere, and even the scenes filmed on the streets of Los Angeles or San Francisco appear to be a natural extension of it. The story takes you gently through all these beautiful scenery to take you to a bittersweet end, being the perfect climax to that perfect journey. Building the film itself is a master craft. The skillful use of innovative features (such as photos that link Danny's memories in the film) compares to such rare and enjoyable hand-made works. Blind Spot manages to capture the essence of the desert by taking it to a universal common ground where any of us can feel both discoverer and native.
