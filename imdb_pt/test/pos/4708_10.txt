My ex-wife and I came in and were intrigued by the trailer for this movie. We waited for him to leave, but when he did, he did not spend much time in theaters. Several years later I bought it on VHS and I'm transferring to DVD so I can preserve it. <br /> <br /> I found it very exciting. It's about real events in a real country. BURMA had such a bad reputation for the political oppression it created that it changed its name. <br /> <br /> I think women with little makeup are very sexy. Patricia Arquette is in this movie. Frances McDormand and Spalding Gray are in it only briefly. <br /> <br /> After returning home to find her son and her husband brutally murdered, Laura (Arquette) is afraid of blood. A bad trait for a doctor. Her sister (McDormand) tells her to go on holiday to Burma. While there, she witnesses a peaceful demonstration and has her passport stolen. In a bold move (or stupid), she asks a tour guide to show her something of the tourist route. Her guide is wounded by soldiers and she spends the rest of the film trying to get him to safety. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch, it reminds me that we in the United States forget that for a peasant. living under the military regime, SOCIALISM, where at least eating is practically guaranteed, looks very good.
