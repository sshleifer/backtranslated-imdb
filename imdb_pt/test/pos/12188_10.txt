"Queen of the Damned" is one of the best vampire movies I've ever seen! The movie had suspense, action and gore. The combination of the Queen's fierce demanding attitude and our star's rock humor, well represented by Stuart Townsend, makes a wonderfully made movie that only this combination can create. I am always the one to give advice to my friends and family where the movies are worthy of rent and when they ask me if the "Queen of the Damned" is worthy, I tell them that it is worth buying. This movie is for sure a must-have in every home for horror movie lovers!
