Let's start by saying that I'm a punk fan for most of my life. I always had a certain lack of respect for the Los Angeles scene in the early 1980s, that the documents of the Western Civilization Decline, with the exception of X and Black Flag, were over New York and English punk. After I saw this movie that changed completely. The people shown may look like a bunch of stupid, idiot kids who think they can do something beyond Cree Street through their lifestyles, but it's a great demonstration of hedonism combined with a loud, fun rock n roll. One of the best scenes, and indeed very insightful, is the interview with Claude Bessy of the Catholic Discipline, or "Kick-Boy," as it was known to readers of Slash magazine. Originally from France, he talks about punk as a dirty old Frenchman and gives clues to viewers about many aspects of the punk, or DIY, attitude of music, politics and life in general. Darby Crash of the Germs is a complete idiot most of the time, but Germs' Manimal performance is pretty decent, complete with a young Pat Smear. Black Flag's performance with Chavo Pederast on vocals (it was filmed a few years before Henry Rollins joined the band) is decent, and X and FEAR give the best performances in the film. Stay tuned for interviews with young punks. You'll hear some of the funniest things you've ever heard in a documentary. Highly recommended.
