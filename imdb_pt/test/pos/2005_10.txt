Eve is an eye opener, because of the great landscapes and the music without technology in the back, we listen. This film shows a good aspect of the human body being God's creation and to consider it, viewers can gain a greater respect in the legendary story of Adam and Eve (be it true or just a fairy tale, depending on what we believe) of watching this movie. Actress / Model Eva's imitation by Inger Ebeltoft is so good that there is not a good word to describe her performance, and I can not imagine having another actress being Eva. This film to me is very useful for the type of relief therapy stress. We never felt so relaxed before seeing this movie. This movie is a masterpiece, God supposedly wanted this movie to be made in the first place! <br /> <br /> Razbin!
