This, ladies and gentlemen, is truly a modern B movie. The dialogue is blistered and delivered with wooden stiffness, the premise is predictable (there are some decent twists) and the characters remain 2D for the most part. And there's still a certain ... charm. The WWE Kane wrestler brings to life the sick and twisted monster of a man with many ducks (though he's a character resembling his character he's been playing for about ten years) and then I find it amusing when people say " not great reach for him, "but Glen Jacobs is apparently the cool guy, so it actually is. Anyway, he is scaled perfectly like the brute and the deaths are properly above the top (Jason would be proud), but I have heard at least four pauses of applause by four different scenes of deaths. Honestly, step into this movie thinking you're going to have fun and have fun, oh, it's ENOUGH to gorefest. The R rating is richly deserved and I actually got a little nauseous during some of the more graphic times. Anyway, a very, very funny movie, but pretty bad.
