I can not help but notice the negative comments this movie got. To be honest, I saw the preview of this movie, and the premise seemed to intrigued me. Yes, I rented after reading the comments of others. They are correct in that some of the performances leave much to be desired. They are also correct that one of the best performances of this film was that of Dr. Graves. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant the kid in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, maybe because I'm in a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly worth it.
