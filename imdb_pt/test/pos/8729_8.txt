I'm surprised by the relatively low rating this movie has. It's a grumpy comedy and a novel run by someone other than Billy Wilder, but does a good job and even won an Oscar. <br /> <br /> It's Ingrid Bergman's first US film since the 1950s and even though she's no longer the young bomb that was in her early films, she plays a rather generous hard role. This film proves that she had multiple talents beyond her beauty. <br /> <br /> Goldie Hawn, who won an Academy Award in this film, her first feature film as a supporting actress, is very good as the most modern and sophisticated dentist lover. , love them and let them Walter Mathaw. Goldie is charming to all senses in this role that with a great cast has put her like a slam dunk for this early career award. <br /> <br /> This movie is not real deep, but it is a jewel that stood the test of time very well. Not sure why it's average is as low as I give a solid 8.
