If Archie Bunker was armed, he may well have been "Joe." However, "All in the Family" would have had a short run, because the censors would never have allowed him to follow the lines of this film. Joe is a working class guy who is racist and intolerant and has a big mouth, especially when he is drunk. One night, he meets a man at a bar, Bill, who is having a drink to calm his nerves after accidentally killing his daughter's addicted boyfriend and he lets Joe out. What happens is that Bill's daughter was living with the addict, and she was taken to the hospital after an overdose, and he goes to the apartment to get her things, but does not expect him to go find her boyfriend, who comes in the cool of a big drug deal. In the ensuing fight, the boyfriend is killed accidentally and Bill does not want anyone to really know, of course. But he let slip to Joe, and when the papers and the news comes, Joe sees them, puts 2 and 2 together, and suddenly this man is a hero in his eyes. He talks to him later and Bill is worried that Joe will blackmail him, but not for money, he wants to date him. Which is, in a way, almost worse. Now Bill's daughter escapes from the clinic where she is, and returns home, and accidentally hears what happened and then is running away, and most of the film consists of Joe & Bill infiltrating the underworld to try to find her. This accumulates in a very shocking ending, which for me was totally unexpected and ends only on the right note, or wrong note, depending on your point of view. A kind of decent but obscure view of life in the early 1970s, especially from the point of view of a working-class fanatic, which is not for everyone, but it's not a bad movie and it's a decent watch. 8 out of 10.
