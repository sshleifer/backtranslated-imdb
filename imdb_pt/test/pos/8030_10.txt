I'm a big fan of the spy genre and this is one of the best of these movies. The Task is based on a true story, which has been a bit embellished for the big screen, and really takes you on a fun ride. The film has a great cast, starring Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. <br /> <br /> Naval officer Quinn is recruited reluctantly by Sutherland after a chance encounter with Kingsley, who believes Quinn is the famous terrorist Carlos. Jackal. Because Quinn looks a lot like Carlos, Sutherland does not stop recruiting him because Sutherland is obsessed with the capture or death of the terrorist. <br /> <br /> The training sequences are amazing. Quinn is actually tested by Kingsley and Sutherland, having to withstand attacks from remotely controlled snowmobiles, from eating the same food every day, from being drugged with a hallucinogen. He still has to learn to make love to a woman the way Carlos would. <br /> <br /> The film has great action scenes with Quinn, eluding allies because they believe he is Carlos and in his final mission when he is killing the jackal. Throughout the movie, Quinn must contend with the new personality he has conquered against his own. Will he remain as implacable and free as Charles or will he once again come to the life of a good husband and father? <br /> <br /> If you like the spy genre, this is a must see. The action is used only to propel the story of this thriller forward; There are no free explosions or fight scenes. Rating 5 out of 5 Stars.
