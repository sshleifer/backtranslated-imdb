If it had been done two years later, it would have been banned! The number one should see the recommendation of the day!. The best Rouben Mamoulian movie I've seen so far (but I have not seen J + H yet). <br /> <br /> No wonder why this film received less than 200 votes. A great greyzone who could not care less about what is suitable would not be seen again until the 1960s. As morally ambiguous and somber as the grace of the 70s, but with a certain charm as well. Of course this has had to decline over the last 30 years and unfortunately it does not appear to have been rediscovered. <br /> <br /> Seriously. That's all. Great actors: Gary Cooper, Sylvia Sidney and this time not so kind Guy Kibbee. And a powerful director. So far I have not been the biggest fan of RM, but I really enjoyed his films and with that he goes into a new league. One of the best movies of the thirties I've ever seen! This is something I never thought existed! 9,5 / 10
