I just called my brother Paulie on the phone and he said he was watching Hoods and it was funny. So, like I said, never go against the family! The demand for more lines is good, since I like to express my own opinions quite often. If something is misspelled, it is more likely that my vision and not my brain. This gives me one more chance to take my photos in The Departed. When you know exactly what will happen in the last scene without any prior knowledge, this usually means that it was not so full of suspense. All you need is a good director, the same guy I believe made my favorite mafia movie, "Goodfellows", but in a completely different way. And then shoot Jack and you'll get an Oscar. I have to see hoods to make sure it was no better than the Gibbs "The Departed"
