After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The movie is like no other I have ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more than disturbing images of men and women and how they approach sex (his two previous films were the brilliant In the Company of Men, and the almost brilliant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, witnessing the brutal death of her idiot husband (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), gets lost in a fantasy world. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play the murderers who killed her husband and are now on trial. The trick to the film is that Freeman and Zellweger are actually parallel characters. While Zellweger falls for the image of the beautiful and educated Dr. Dave Ravell in a novel, Freeman idealizes Betty. Nurse Betty is a brilliant film, full of life, humor, love and graphic violence. My note: 10/10.
