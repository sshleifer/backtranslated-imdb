This is a film so revered and studied, a classic among Hitchcock's many, that it's no use wanting to watch it again. However, you think: can it hold even when the huge (and clever, and incredible) plot trick is not a surprise? <br /> <br /> And to begin with there is the beginning, a deeply beautiful and slippery story of all history, the essence of it. Two taxis, two men in their shoes, each walking on the train, sitting opposite each other, and, oops, a mistake, a little shove, and the conversation begins, and we see the men themselves. They are interchangeable. <br /> <br /> The tone here is characteristic of Hitchcock, as it is in many horror and suspense films - cheerful and light. We know that by entering the movie, however, that this will not be the case, so we're already worried. What, after all, is about to go wrong? <br /> <br /> Much. In fact, in Hitchcock's fashion, he is a purely innocent man (almost always a man) who faces injustice, who is trapped by circumstances that threaten what is most valuable to him. The innocent in this case, tennis player Guy Haynes, is played with an innocence that is believable - his collegiate education in the first scene, for example, when he realizes that the other man is a little cuckoo, is exactly what you or I do. The not-so-innocent man is the spoiled, selfish, and frighteningly intelligent child, Bruno Anthony, played with absolute brilliance by Robert Walker. (This unusual performance is equivalent to that of another crazy Hitchcock, played by Anthony Perkins in Psycho.) So, from the first scene, on the train (and the train, really beautiful!), We have both clues and we have the mind- blowing and totally simple and ultimately devastating plot since the first novel by Patricia Highsmith who also wrote the books behind the two Mr. Ripley films. And it does not hurt that the script was written by Raymond Chandler himself, who knows something about economics and intelligent dialogue. It's a crime. <br /> <br /> Of course there is more than just the first scene. What to notice? Well, that cleverness of a senator's daughter (I thought she was great) is Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, who is still with us (as of 2009; she also had a role in Psychosis). And there's a signature landmark for a key scene in the movie - the tennis courts in the Hamptons, known to us as the site of the US Open. The fantastic last scene complete with the carousel is the only place where Hitchcock moves in a sort of slow and steady setup, building the suspense, making it surreal. Fear grows fat with children laughing and the old man crawling underneath everything. And when he falls into an accident - all this is rejected in a scenario, one of the most naturalistic uses of a director known for not caring about the realism of his projections. <br /> <br /> The perfect Hollywood photography is stunning without becoming so stylized (as in some noir movies) it is an object in itself. Look again at the first scene, or the filming (and editing) of Haynes coming into the house for what the public thinks is murder. This is a sophisticated construction. When we are not completely surprised that Bruno is in bed, this only proves that the director puts us on tiptoe. Something unexpected is always expected. <br /> <br /> Are there any flaws? Who knows? It depends on what kind of falsehood you can accept (or embrace) as beautiful style. The scene in which Bruno is suffocating the old woman at a party is both brilliant (the woman, played by Norma Varden, is such a believable caricature that takes her breath away) and spoiled by him looking at the senator's daughter and being triggered trance by his glasses, and his resemblance to his previous victim. This is an idea of ​​mid-twentieth-century psychology that intrudes on many of Hitchcock's efforts. (The end of Psycho for beginners.) <br /> <br /> The Wikipedia article on the film cleverly emphasizes the consistent duplication of things in the film, from the main characters to the murder victim and the senator's daughter. This echoes in many ways - two men accompany him to the tennis court, two men accompany the victim to the amusement park, and so on. There may be a lot of it, but it provides an aesthetic consistency above and below our consciousness. Do not forget, there are two murders - it's the lack of the second murder, the inability to create a duplication in that case, which causes Bruno to be unraveled. Walker, the actor had emotional problems and was institutionalized the year before that this film was filmed and shortly after, he died of a reaction to a drug used to calm one of his explosions. Although he has appeared in other films, Strangers on a Train is easily his tour-de-force. Farley Granger has had a long career that has never seen him achieve true stardom, although his style may have a peculiar nervous sweetness that really works, especially in They Live by Night. <br /> <br /> And if you watch this movie for the first or third time, look for the hilarious and hilarious scene in the tennis game where the heads of the audience move back and forth in unison - Bruno. He is looking out without moving his head directly at us. As the movie trailer says, after this movie, you will not be talking to "strangers on a train".
