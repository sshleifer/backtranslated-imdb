Many more eloquent reviews have described the spectacular acting, style, and style of this film. It seems that the only negative critics focus on a perceived imbalance in the way the film deals with the central moral issue (euthanasia). <br /> <br /> This film is, bar the final scenes, meticulous in emphasizing Ramon's belief that he is not Making some important point, but merely that, for him, a life devoid of dignity is a life that not worth living. We viewers see an enormous amount of dignity in their lives - we see family and friends and culture and, but by their physical limitations, a life fully lived. Central to the tragedy of this film is that there is really only one person who thinks that Ramon's life is not worth living - and that's him. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and say that the only counterargument comes from the visit of a clumsy priest is nonsense. The priest's visit is pure farce, a direct assault on the simplicity of the response of the Spanish Catholic Church to the question of euthanasia. However, the sister's farewell words to the priest momentarily expose the powerful "pro-life" feelings that silently support the entire film. We are constantly encouraged to see the hope and beauty of a life lived with love. As the film progresses, we can be gradually encouraged to understand Ramon's reasoning, but we never reconcile with his decision. <br /> <br /> I do not remember a movie that thrilled me and provoked me as much as that.
