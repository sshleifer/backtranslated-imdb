IT'S OK. Barney is the best children's show of all time? Of course not. But in some of the comments left by other IMDb members, you would think it was a multimillion-dollar production with high-class actors and a ridiculous budget for special effects. Well, guess what? It's Barney for God's sake. It shows children good behavior, good properties and that it's okay to be who you are. For those of you who find it annoying, it's because you're not five and the show was not meant for you. For the member of IMDb who wrote the review on the front page, I think you may have gone too far. Did you really describe a character from Sesame Street as "down to earth"? Grow up, this is a great show for preschoolers and really helps kids learn in a fun and creative way.
