If "Love Me Tonight" is "the musical for people who do not like musicals," it must be said that "The Gay Desperado" is definitely not a musical for people who do not like opera. In fact - although apparently based on a comic operetta - it is not really a musical but a bandit story with unrelated arias interpolated to show the voice of a character; and what a voice that is. <br /> <br /> Nino Martini, like the young Chivo singer who joins the troop of bandits to get a place on the radio (no, the plot does not make much more sense later or ...), has a glorious tenor of gold whose style does not date a day since the time in which it was recorded. The trillions and headlines of some of his musical contemporaries belong to a past fad, but it is very easy to imagine Chivo singing "Nessun Dorma" for the World Cup crowd and leading the charts in the process. Unfortunately, while he has an engaging smile and a decent dramatic reach, he is completely unable to act and sing at the same time. The result is that the fast-paced movie shakes to a chilling stop every time Chivo puts his hand on his chest and begins to declaim, and the viewer's tolerance for the result probably depends on his appreciation of opera performance. In addition to this disadvantage, the film is a pleasing and amusing satire in Hollywood conventions and the stereotype of Mexican bandits in particular, which achieves the vital goal of all these parodies in making their characters get enough of themselves . maintain the interest of the viewer when the joke would have become obsolete. The bandits boss and his partner have the traditional double-action relationship, there's an enigmatic pawn with a carved teak face and a witty heroine (a young Ida Lupino) who does the generic "You say you hate me, but you really love me "routine with a refreshing twist. Overall, the film is fun and very funny, and I feel like I got the value of my money - but it can not be denied that the musical interlude, while admirable in its own way, introduces serious problems of stimulation.
