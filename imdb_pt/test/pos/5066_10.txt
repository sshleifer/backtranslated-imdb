This was an excellent film with good acting and keeps its attention until the end. Maybe people are tired or uncomfortable with the subject and that's why it's being so destructive. It could also be too deep for many viewers who give films like the American Pie series. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal is a CIA analyst, not an agent, who should observe an interrogation an Egyptian man by Moroccans, not Egyptians. He should not be a hardened agent and therefore seems naive of the interrogation techniques used. This is more likely than if he appeared as an "old hat." <br /> <br /> History jumps a little and can be confusing, but it also makes you stay focused on what is happening. until the end, when it all comes together when the puzzle fits. The supporting actors did a good job helping to bring the film. I found the film powerful and thought-provoking.
