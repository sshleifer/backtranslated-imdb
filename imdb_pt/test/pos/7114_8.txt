This is another universal scare festival full of fun. Many people want to compare it to House Of Frankenstein. Although they have similar cast and the same director he can stand on their own (it seems that Erle C Kenton directed most of Universal's recap Larry Talbot (who somehow survived the House of Frankenstein) also appears at the door of good doctors seeking a cure for their affliction. of an unsuccessful suicide attempt, Talbot and the doctor find the monster Frankenstein.To complicate things before he bites the dust, Dracula infects the good doctor with his blood.He becomes a bloodthirsty maniac at certain times.Where this leads is something you will have to see for yourself. <br /> <Carradine really does a very good performance as Dracula. <br /> <br /> He is not chewing the scene as he will in later roles It is difficult to suppress laughter when he appears in a top hat. The cover / cover is traditional, but the hat has to go. Where does the hat go when it turns into a bat? <br /> <br /> Onslow Stevens gives an excellent interpretation of the doctor. He is torn between his basic goodness and the growing lust of blood with which he is now prone. This is a very underrated performance. Chance brings even more life to the Wolf Man in his fourth appearance in this role. <br /> <br /> The monster does not have much to do this time. I just laid it down to the end (some Ghost Of Frankenstein images are used). At least in House of Frankenstein, he was up and about for a while. <br /> <br /> Yes, it clings to the basic standard of Universal, complete with anger. The village mob is uncontrolled with torches. But it's not a bad way to spend an hour and ten minutes.
