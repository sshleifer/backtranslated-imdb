Ok, I'm not sure if this counts as a spoiler, so I marked the box anyway to save the hassle. <br /> <br /> I've noticed that the opinions on this movie seem to be a fair division. Personally, I loved it, though I must say I think some of the cameos were there for the sake of having a tip. (Peter Kay?) Personally, I'm just grateful that it was not Edward's show, Tubbs and Papa Lazarou, and that they chose the 3 best characters in the series to head the film, especially Sir Goeff Tipps, possibly the funniest of them all . The bunch. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is less a summary of one rather obtuse blog thing, but what the hell, the movie was amazing, and I think that's all that counts.
