I just watched this thriller, which I thought was one of Hitch's minor efforts. How wrong can you be! Maybe because I'm older, or maybe because the movie gets better with each viewing, but now I find it incredible. All the suspense is squeezed in the smallest detail, and this final scene on the carousel is simply breathtaking! Perfect in every way, highly recommended.
