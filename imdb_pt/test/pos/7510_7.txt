The Hospital is a movie that was made ahead of time. This film, produced by screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky, who gave us the Oscar-winning movie "Network," deals with overworked employees, gross incompetence, and bureaucratic corruption in a large conglomerate hospital in Manhattan. George C. Scott, in a superb performance as chief physician, is led to alcoholism and a death wish as he tries to recover from a divorce by throwing his son out of the house and, worst of all, a medical center where corruption and incompetence take precedence over the care and healing of the sick and wounded. <br /> <br /> Scott makes the movie his own, and viewers will be shocked at what they observe at this medical establishment. You can feel the "pain" (pun intended) of what this hospital did to him. The vivid images of the incompetence of this hospital are so vivid and dramatically powerful that you can see yourself laughing and being deeply disturbed from scene to scene. <br /> <br /> If only the film had stayed with this premise in a documentary style, as it begins, this image would be brilliant. Unfortunately, there is a sub-plot of Scott falling to the daughter of a senile patient. The patient has murdered people in the hospital. This is where the credibility of the image is tense. The scenes of romantic dialogue add nothing to the image, and the mental patient, pretending to be a doctor, was totally unbelievable. A simple security call and a check of records should have prevented the senile patient from carrying out the murders. It takes almost the entire film, before security people are brought to the movie to get the patient out of the hospital. I could not see A PERSON doing so much damage, even as corrupt as this hospital. <br /> <br /> In addition, the character of George C Scott is "overloaded" (another pun intended) because the script has many things happening at once. For example, in a period of 20 minutes, you can have up to 20 different doctors accused and deny what you should have done or not done. With the nurses and the help, it's the same story. Someone's medical record was read wrong, someone got the wrong drug and died, the doctor operated the wrong patient, another doctor did the same thing, blaming a third nurse who was not on call because the second nurse who should be admitting the patient I was on your coffee break. There is also a lot of subtle and somber humor, with the same messages of incompetence and corruption being fed to the viewer. <br /> <br /> This repetition of medical ineptitude is unforgettable. However, the murder subplot is more of a distraction than an aid to this movie. When the focus of this film is on team incompetence and Scott's reactions, you're stuck on the screen. But the conversations between Scott and the crazy patient's daughter force the film into a kind of mystery "Who Done It?" which seriously undermines the quality of the film. When the crazy patient is revealing how he did the murders, I wondered why: the producers needed the sub-plot "to find the killer" of the crazy patient? I think the only point of Scott's character having a relationship with the senile patient's daughter was giving him someone to talk to. The hospital should have maintained its blunt accusation of the medical profession by removing scenes of love interest and crazy patients. You should have focused on incompetent B.S inside your walls more often. In a time when this movie could have been phenomenal, the sub-story stories make the movie very good instead of the great masterpiece it could have been.
