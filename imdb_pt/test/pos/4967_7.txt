I met Jennifer for the first time when she was out of town when she appeared on TV in the middle of the night; I fell asleep before I finished, but stayed with me until I had to track him. His appeal is that although there is not much to do, it creates an intriguing atmosphere, and because Ida Lupino and Howard Duff (then real-life man-and-woman) exhibit seductive and discreet chemistry. Lupine plays a woman hired to house a vast estate in California whose former caretaker - Jennifer - disappeared. (Shadows of Jack Nicholson in the Enlightened one, although in this case it is not Lupino who goes, or went crazy). Duff is the guy in town who manages the finances of the estate and takes a shine to Lupino, who decides to play hard to get it. She becomes more and more involved, not to say obsessed, with what happened to her predecessor in the old dark house full of descending stairs and locked cellars. Atmospherics and romantic byplay are by far the best part of the film, as viewers are likely to find the resolution a bit disappointing - there is simply not much (except a little frisson at the tail end that anticipates Brian De Camille's filmmakers ). But it is well done and, once again, stays with you. Extra added attraction: this is the movie that introduced the song "Angel Eyes" which would become part of Ol 'Blue Eyes' standard repertoire.
