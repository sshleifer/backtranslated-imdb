"More", perhaps, is mostly remembered for the excellent soundtrack composed by Pink Floyd - in 1969 they were not superstars yet. In fact, they made an album with the music of the movie, no fan can lose! <br /> <br /> But this is also the first film by German-French director Barbet Schroeder: it's a cult movie. When it was released, censorship everywhere cut off various scenes of sex and drugs. It is also one of the first films to explicitly address the issue of drug slavery. <br /> <br /> A German boy travels to Paris and meets an American girl: they fall in love. Together, they seek sun and exoticism. But it is a love of very high price: she starts it in drugs. <br /> <br /> In the 60's, anti-drug campaigns were not like today, there was not much information. On the contrary, in many ways taking drugs was a kind of spiritual experience ... Hence, it is quite surprising to see a film from that period describing a nightmarish heroin experience. <br /> <br /> The film is simple, not vulgar and filmed in a "cinema-verité" style. The actors Mimsy Farmer and Klaus Grünberg are very convincing. "More" is a document from the late 1960s - and a document ending the illusions of hippies as well.
