The Oscar-winning "Kramer vs. Kramer" follows a chic businessman Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) and his divorce with his bored wife (Meryl Streep). One day, Ted's wife leaves him and his son in search of a better life, forcing Ted to approach his son (Justin Henry). The two attach themselves and become very close (but only after some friction), and just as everything is going perfect Ted's wife returns to the city and wants the exclusive custody of her son. Ted then goes on a mission to not let his son be taken from him and fights with his wife in court. Dustin Hoffman performs tremendously with Meryl Streep, and young Justin Henry is impressive. It's a sad emotional roller coaster of a movie, but it's a very well done and inspiring film. The film won the Oscar for Best Picture at the 1979 Oscar, along with Best Actor for Hoffman and Best Supporting Actress for Streep. If you do not mind a tearjerker, 'Kramer Vs. Kramer 'is a great movie to watch. Note: B +
