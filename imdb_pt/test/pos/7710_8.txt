The detective story is not typical of the Matrix Universe. It's a private-eyed film-noir story with a strong narrator and a very rich feel. Rich in terms of his visual appeal. The snowy scenes, the granularity, everything stuns. <br /> <br /> But what about history? It's interesting, even if it seems a bit out of place. The agents hire a private detective to track down Trinity. He discovers that they have tried the approach before, but with dangerous consequences for the hired detectives. Still, he tries to locate her and eventually gets through references to Alice in Wonderland and hackers and chat rooms. Then things start to get interesting ... <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a perfectly satisfying short animated film. <br /> <br /> 8/10
