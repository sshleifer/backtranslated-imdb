I suspect there are several cuts of this document doing the rounds. The copy I saw focused on Joe's erotic movies and referred to his horror production as he passed. There are countless porn censorship films featured in their X-rated glory and the legendary filming of EMMANUELLE IN AMERICA's "snuff" (breasts being cut) receive a generous screen time. <br /> <br /> The interviews with the very friendly Joe is informative and sincere. He is a gentle, modest and articulate and discusses his interest in shocking audiences because he wanted to mix eroticism with horror, and how he may have been responsible for one of his artists becoming gay. <br /> <br /> His friendship and work relationship with Indonesian beauty Laura Gemser is played, as is his indifferent attitude in shooting with hardcore. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato personifies an incredible period in the Continental cinema that has passed. It's great to see a documentary dedicated to him and his excellent work. <br /> <br /> RIP, Joe.
