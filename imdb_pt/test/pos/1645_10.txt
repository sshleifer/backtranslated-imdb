A team ranged between Scully and Mulder, two other scientists, a pilot and the guy who plays Bana at Seinfeld, climbs to an Arctic research post where all members die by killing each other or killing each other. They discover that there is a worm - a virus - that is parasitic to the point of madness and death. The problem is that, after a certain dog attacks, anyone can be infected, but who? This is not only my favorite episode of season one, but also one of my favorites of the show. The Arctic environment includes the characters and, of course, like Carpenter's Coing, it's so much fun to see these uniform characters suddenly start appearing in dramatic scenes. And the visual effects of the worm and its effects under the skin are cheesy, I did not care about them. The drama between the characters ends up working more than usual because of the tension and because all the actors (including Bana's guy) understand what's going on in the story. And, as usual, I loved the ambiguity of the ending. Highly recommended.
