Shortly after moving to her new country house in the English country, Hercule Poirot receives an invitation to dinner from Sir Henry and Lady Angkatell, the owners of a large mansion nearby. But the next day, one of the guests is found near the pool, and his clumsy wife is holding a revolver a few paces away ... <br /> <br /> This Agatha Christie mystery is a little thin, although the The murderer's plan is still very clever. It is the excellent filming and cinematography that elevates history to a higher level. This episode mostly retains the serious tone of "Five Little Pigs" and "Sad Cypress," but contains more dark humor than them. The cast includes possibly the two most famous actors who have worked on the series, Edward Fox (as the butler) and Sarah Miles (as Lady Angkatell), although the outstanding performance is given by the stunning Megan Dodds as the front. Henrietta: her face-to-face confrontations with the brightness of Suchet and are the highlights of the film. Oh, and since an English police inspector got involved in the case, I think they could have brought Philip Jackson back to this one. (***)
