A 15-year-old who spent his life flying in jets feels the same way? However, I can only just its impact on me. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart takes a wonderful turn as - Jimmy Stewart.

These circles that look like cobblestones or a cornfield, should make you wonder, is he in the right place? They continue and pass by, passing through his vision until he gets low enough and sees that on the night of Paris, what he was seeing was the light of the city reflecting the upturned faces of the thousands of people waiting for him to land.
