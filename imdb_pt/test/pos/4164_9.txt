Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who performed at the beginning of the 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method ("sketches" of poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and his fantastic beauty) and his struggle to accept a harsh reality before his idealistic imagination. <br /> The film integrated portions of Miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully. His relationship with his students was powerful, especially in a scene where he offers everything he has for a student who has just been caught stealing classroom materials. Miyazawa's disinterested compassion for his village farmers, his sister, and other unfortunate people can serve as a lesson to us all. In addition, Miyazawa's devotion to science was also well portrayed. At a time when Western ideas were still met with skepticism, especially in provincial towns like the one in which Miyazawa grew up, he understands his usefulness in helping his fellow villagers and is inspired by his elegance. The way the film presented moments of artistic passion and deception in the writer was really intense and well interpreted. <br /> <br /> I felt that the CGI integrated into the film, while revolutionizing an innovator, colliding with the more organic animation. It could be argued that this was intentional to represent conflict within the main character, but I found it quite unsightly. I would also like the film to discuss Miyazawa's Buddhist influence, but it worked well without it. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was very well done. I give a 9/10, with a point being deducted for the CGI. Otherwise, the animation, the plot and the dialogue were all wonderful and sincere. I have not seen any other Kawamori Shoji movie, but after watching this movie, I'll be sure to give them a chance.
