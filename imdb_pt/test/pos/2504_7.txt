In addition to the fact that this film was filmed mainly in Rockport MA, which is a beautiful city where my mother once rented a small store and I spent many a nice summer as a child, it is a fun and cute movie. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I did not want to see this movie, although I have a romantic comedy air (I do not know why). The trailers I saw were not attractive, the cast did not seem so interesting and I had no idea what the plot would be. In the end, I thought it was an interesting meditation on relationships and family. I had so much fun and I must admit that I thought this movie was one of the most neglected stones of last year. I am disappointed that few people seemed to have liked the "humanity" with which the film introduced the viewer. <br /> <br /> I read a lot of bad reviews about this movie and I must admit to a certain level. of shock with the cynicism that is prevalent in them. As a graduate student, I consider myself quite cynical, but this was a beautiful film that deserves much more than it did.
