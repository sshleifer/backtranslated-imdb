I've never been in the past interested in this play, although I have loved Shakespeare and have seen most of his plays now and enthusiastically studied some at school. Something about this story and all the confusion about it seemed to put me off. I never bothered to try to see Hamlet until very recently deciding that I should at least try to watch him and borrowed the Olivier version from the library. Well, I fought it. Olivier looked very old, not only in his appearance, but in his acting part. The piece had been severely cut to fit in a more conventional film and I think it must have lost a lot, because I found it difficult to concentrate on it, so I was bored and bored with it. I still think Olivier's Henry V is the best version I've ever seen of that exciting piece - though I have not re-released the Beeb version yet and I do not remember what it was like when it was first shown. <br /> <br /> I've heard of Branagh's full length version of Hamagh. Although I liked Much Ado, I think the Beeb version is a lot better and I was not totally impressed with Henry V. But I was a bit out of Branagh after seeing his disappointing effort in the musical Love's Labor's Lost, which is a game. I like it and I was very well done by Beeb. <br /> <br /> Finally getting the Beeb Shakespeare complete on DVD recently, I soon traded in one of my favorite pieces of Shakespeare, Richard II, and was simply fascinated by Jacobi in the play, so I was immediately persuaded to watch his Hamlet in then. What a revelation this piece is now for me! Yes, it's splendid, but I feel like you need an actor you can emphasize to play Hamlet and that to me is Jacobi. Amazing. It is intriguing to note that although he is older than I understand the character Hamlet, he does not appear in Olivier. Now I noticed that he's also in Branagh's version and it had a lot to do with Branagh's training, so I'll have to watch it to see what Jocobi does with Claudius! I'm interested to find out that Jacobi trained Branagh as a yes, you can certainly see the influence. <br /> <br /> And now I'm going to watch it all again ....
