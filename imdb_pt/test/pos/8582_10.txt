A fabulous movie that I've watched several times since I bought the video only four days ago. Yes, I am a Colin Firth Fan and Colin was his natural and talented natural self. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Colin (Matthew Field) and Fissy (Sammy, Nimi's 7-year-old son) was so special and so natural to see. They were fun together and also played the strings of my heart. The scenes that I loved the most were Sammy and Matt sitting on the wall talking and Matt, then falling back from the wall in a hilarious way (I will not reveal the contents of his discussion so as not to ruin the plot). Also very hilarious was Sammy questioning Matt about sex, Colin and Fissy were perfect in this scene and doing what could be a weird matter between adult and child so natural. The words and face of Colins at the end of the scene were so nice and they said it all! simply brilliant. The credit, of course, must also be attributed to Fissy Roberts for his charming portrait of Sammy. He played a childlike character so adorable and daring. The two actors were perfect together. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Colin (Matt) and Nia (Nimi) was perfectly balanced and I could not agree more that the chemistry between them was wonderful to watch, showing love, tension and, of course, passion. It was exciting to see how his delicate novel unfolded gradually, also showing how his cultural and social divisions affected his relationship, and it was nice to see how Colin and Nia interpreted Matt and Nimi sensibly discovering, accepting, and overcoming these differences. This kept me stuck on the TV and guessing until the end of the movie. Colins' portrait of Matt's vulnerable and juvenile side was also perfectly portrayed, so much so that I found it hard to see when Matt was so mean and childlike to Sammy because he (Matt) thought Sammy was getting in the path of his romance / relationship with Sams Mother Nimi. He could not help but feel very disappointed, angry and frustrated with Matt for treating Sammy this way and this in turn threatening to ruin Matts's special relationship with Sammy and Nimi. Colins' special talent of "getting into the head of a character" and displaying the different sides of a character to the audience was very much in evidence here and pure magic to watch. I should also mention that Colin also has such a good relationship with young actors (see also 'My life so far', a wonderful and must-see movie). <br /> <br /> I also loved the relationship between Matthew and his wife Jenny, both were excellent at showing the public the dark side and tensions within their marriage and that not all seemingly "Happy Weddings" are exactly what may appear from the outside. <br /> <br /> I can not forget to mention the reverend who I found very funny, in a serious way! Nimi's mother and family were also hilarious, as well as showing the importance of Nimi's culture and situation. <br /> <br /> The downside, I can not find a disadvantage, but be objective about the film and to give credibility to my review, the only negative comment I would make is that the writers did not explain in enough detail why by which Matt collapsed in the car, there was only a vague hint, of Nimi, that something was wrong with his heart. However, this did not detract from my enjoyment of the film, far from it. I just needed to rewind the tape a little to a second outlet. <br /> <br /> I felt that this movie had everything, fun, uplifting and I loved the rich colors and sunny landscapes. The film warmed a cold winter day and made me smile :-)) All the essentials were there, laughter, love, tension, sadness, anger, drama, and a good factor heat feeling, with, yes, many of those delicious moments of Colin Firth, including a very drenched Colin in a 'Wet Shirt' scene, not to be missed by any fan, what more a girl might want ;-)) <br /> <br /> I would strongly recommend this movie, especially for any fan of Colin Firth ;-)
