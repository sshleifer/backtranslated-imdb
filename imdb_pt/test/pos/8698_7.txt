A few years ago, while I was renting some movies, I came across Substy 4, I ended up watching and really kind of enjoying it, we need a good vampire movie that does not stop. But when I went back to the video store, they said they had no other subspecies video, unfortunately, so did any other video store I did. I gave up, until someone on youtube posted all the subspecies movies and I watched them all last night and got hooked. I am now a fan of the full moon subspecies series. I think because that was the kind of horror movie I was looking for, I've been looking for a good fright for a long time and subspecies filled that spot. Radu is one of the coolest vampires on the screen and almost gives Nosferatu a run for his fangs! <br /> <br /> Radu is an evil vampire who is behind his blood stone, his birth rite, the stone contains some blood that is absolutely incredible and gives you strength. Three American girls studying Romanian history and culture find a man, Stephan, who volunteers to help. They stay in the castle of Radu, where we discover that Stephan is Radu's brother; Radu seduces and transforms two of the girls, but Stephan falls in love with one of the girls, Michelle, and will do anything to protect her. <br /> <br /> Subspecies is a fun series, despite the extravagant effects, makes it somewhat lovelier. Besides, Radu was a perfect villain, for Stephan was the perfect angel as a romantic vampire. The story is creepy and I think this was a fun vampire movie. This was also the first in the series, the best part is that the sequences are so fun. I would recommend this for a horror movie night, watch it in the dark, Radu is sure to send chills down his spine, or even his neck ... OK, cheesy joke, I could not resist. <br /> <br /> 7/10
