Zachary Scott does what he does best, that is, plays a worm in "Danger Signal," a 1945 B movie also starring Faye Emerson, Mona Freeman and Rosemary DeCamp. Scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets his money. On the lam of his latest murder, he rents a room in the Fenchurch family home, Hilda (Emerson) and his mother (Mary Servoss). Scott plays Emerson and she is dazzled. Mid-romance, her younger sister Anne (Freeman) comes home from a medical treatment. When she mentions that she was Uncle Wade's favorite and he left $ 25,000 (dollars in 1945), Scott loses interest in poor Hilda and makes a play for Anne. Anne looks like Rebecca from Sunnybrook Farm until she starts sneaking around with Scott - during the night, she ages 10 years and becomes completely unpleasant with her sister. Finally getting the message that her tenant is no good, Hilda calls a psychiatrist (Rosemary DeCamp) to psychic and advise her. <br /> <br /> Psychological dramas were all the rage during and after World War II, and Scott does an excellent job as a good sociopath. This was his forte - as a weak sheriff on "Flamingo Road," he did not show any real presence. As for two times, we saw him do it in "Mildred Pierce," where he proved to be particularly good at it. Emerson is a stenographer of books, with loose hair and big glasses, but after hours, she is adorable and gives a great performance. DeCamp has always been an underrated actress - here she has a soft German accent and is delicious. <br /> <br /> This is a very fun movie, although it is a very routine story. Actually actualization raises this.
