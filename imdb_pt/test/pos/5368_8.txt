A young couple - father Ben (solid Charles Bateman), wife Nicky (the adorable Ahna Capri) and daughter KT (the cute Geri Reischl of fame "I Dismember Mama") - find themselves trapped in a small town in the California desert populated by hysterical lunatics. Worse still, there is a pernicious satanic cult that is kidnapping small children for their own diabolical purposes. Director Bernard McEveety, working from an unusual and inspired script by William Welch and L.Q. Jones (director of the "Devil Times Five", Sean MacGregor invented the bizarre story), relates the curiously eccentric plot with a slow yet steady pace, and cleverly creates a chilling, nervous, and mysterious ooga-booga atmosphere. Strother Martin offers a wonderfully perverse and robust performance as Doc Duncan, who is the cheerfully sinister leader of the evil sect. The cast of excellent high-quality actors qualifies as a substantial asset: Jones as Sheriff Hillsboro rude and sensible, Alvy Moore as Toby's friendly spot and Charles Robinson as an insightful and devoted Father Jack. The brilliant and polished widescreen cinematography of John Arthur Morrill, Jamie Mendoza-Nava's scary score and the wild and exciting black mass ritual of climax are also available. The idea of ​​having toys reaching the killer life is simply ingenious (the opening scene with a toy tank coming true and crushing a family in your car is really shocking). Good ending strangely ambiguous too. A gratifyingly idiosyncratic and understated winner.
