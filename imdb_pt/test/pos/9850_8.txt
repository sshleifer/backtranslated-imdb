If you have not heard of this movie, it follows two Sudanese refugees from a refugee camp in Africa to America, where they convince themselves that they will find success and riches. Life is harder than expected in the United States, and this movie captures beautifully the frustration felt when things are not working out. Lives are captured so well many moments seem scripted because they are so perfect. Whether at work, at school or at break, the two boys, Peter and Santino, are very honest with the filmmakers and make very thought-provoking comments about life in the states. It's one of the only documentaries I remember that when it was over, I wanted it to go on for two more hours. It may be difficult to find this movie because it did not get a good distribution, but check your local "art house" or independent theater and give it a gift (side note, if you're reading this when you're already in the video, it's definitely worth it. worth rent). Rating: 28/40
