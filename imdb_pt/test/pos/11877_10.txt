I am a big fan of Larkin's works, I believe he was among the greatest poets of the 20th century. The film itself does great justice to the bard of Hull. Wonderfully portrayed by all the players in their roles. Bonneville does a service for the sexually repressed Larkin, he avoids an impression and deviates from becoming a caricature. The use of his poetry was the highlight of the piece itself. Instead of demonstrating the enormous intensity with which Larkin felt, the use of his own words offers a better view of the plot and adds a much darker but more fascinating atmosphere. Most enjoyable.
