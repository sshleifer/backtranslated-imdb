OTHER great performance from Kiefer Sutherland. I love his films because he always plays his role very well. For a low budget film, this was done very well, and kept me on the edge all the time. I love this kind of movie, and I was glad I realized that. I will buy the dvd or tape for sure. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
