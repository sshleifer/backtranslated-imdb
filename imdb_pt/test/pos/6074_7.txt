The English Patient is one of those films that deserve all the rave reviews. I say most, because this film, although very serious, intense, deep and really thoughtful, still suffers some disadvantages. Firstly, why, why are modern films so long? This lasts over two hours and from time to time it becomes very difficult to focus and follow the extremely serious plot. I say, if the movie was a shorter hour, that would serve only good. However, we have what we have. The winner of several Oscars, The English Patient, is still very good. It is a deep and insightful treatise of human soul, love and betrayal, war and cowardice, violence and bravery. Ralph Fiennes is an outstanding sensational actor. Her hero, neurotic and silent, is an enigmatic person, ready for anything just to save her lover's life. He's great, though half the time being a deformed cripple. He is the strongest link here. Juliette Binoche is as always very convincing and sweet. She adds a lot with her excellent game and love story plot with the Sikh official. Willem Defoe, Colin Firth, Christine Scott Thomas are all here, all huge and all very strong. And then there is Egypt's desert, so there is a deep, cloudless sky, green forests of Italy. Nature is here, even when people die, bombs explode, land mines explode. The war is here too. It's obvious, terrible and bloody. Then there are corpses, horrible bloody bodies, naked bodies, adultery and everything. I do not know what to say. Much of the work of a splendid actor, so much of realism, so much brutality that war brings. This is not a movie to relax. That makes you think.
