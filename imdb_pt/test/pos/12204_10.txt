This is the first science fiction series in which I have been seriously involved since Star Trek (and I have not seen Trek for years). It takes the theme of the invasion in slightly different directions, but it did so in a very interesting way. He also lends the novel format, where he continues the arc throughout the year of the series. The CGI definitely does not outrun the plot or the characters, except for Nim, the novice creature who is a pet with a definite attitude. (Anything that shows what he really thought about the neighbor's dog is A-1 in my book.) It was a stroke of genius. <br /> <br /> I'm at the end of the end asking questions (smart, I hope) and crossing your fingers and toes that NBC or someone else (Sci Fi maybe) will continue to run the series and respond to those questions. <br /> <br /> A great show of class.
