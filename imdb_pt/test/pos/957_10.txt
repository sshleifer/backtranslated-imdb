I have to admit that I loved this movie. Of course I'm sure you know that "Malcolm is in the middle" star Frankie Muniz, and the ever so sweet Amanda Bynes "The Amanda Show" starred in the children's comedy as two friends that I'm sure we can all re-bond to. The film is about a boy Jason Shepard (Frankie) and his friend Kaylee (Amanda) going on an adventure in Hollywood. SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> As it begins, Jason is a typical 14-year-old boy who lies to solve the problems of everyday life. One day, Jason is hit by Mr. Wolf (the great bad director). Jason's English newspaper is stolen by Wolf and begins the adventure along with Kaylee to gain the trust of his father back. They fly to Hollywood in search of Wolf to retrieve it. Frankie and Amanda do all sorts of acrobatics to bring Wolf back, and all he has to do is call Jason's dad and tell him he stole his idea. But the end is not a real surprise, being the good proveles and victories. <br /> <br /> The story is cute and fifth grade humorous, but what you expect is classified as PG. I truly believe this is one of the best family comedy years. Not only are kids acting great, with exceptional cast, well written, but it's also good fun. It made me laugh and fall in love with his innocent message. I highly recommend it and would like to disagree with someone who gave a zero out of ten. The unemployed critic is not unemployed for nothing. I give (well I voted in ten in ten) a perfect one.
