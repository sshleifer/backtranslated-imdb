I watched this movie at the Santo Domingo International Film Festival. While watching the movie, I had the feeling of having seen a movie with a similar story before ... a movie with Ray Liotta, but I do not remember much. Of course this is much more dramatic, especially in the end. <br /> <br /> This is the story: Emilio's life becomes a lie that he can no longer support. After 20 years of lying all his life to his wife, son and all the people he knows, the truth is chasing him and there is nowhere to go. <br /> <br /> Watching Emilio invent lies is coming out and funny, but after a while you get tired of the same thing ... the case with a young girl should have something more, but no. Despite this, the film is still funny, coming out and enveloping. Either that makes you want to help Emilio with his lies or help everyone get him. I liked analogies, photography and good performances. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10.
