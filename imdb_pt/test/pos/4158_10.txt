I only had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (previously known in the US as 'The Golden Door'), and I was very impressed by the dreamy and occasionally surreal tale of a family who immigrated from Sicially to the US in the early days. of the 20th century. He also functioned as a proverbial middle finger attached to the Homeland Security eyeball (preferably up to the third node) in his depiction of mistreatment of strangers who only want a better life than they were getting original motherland. The cast (mainly) Italian, with some exceptions works well. This is a discreet and quiet film that is lovely to watch (the occasional but tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasure) while the script is well written. This is a movie for those who are sick and tired of the foolish Hollywood escapism that serves little more than to sell popcorn (not that I have any problem with popcorn, remember! I really love the stuff). You would be wise to look for Nuovomondo / The Golden Door (ie whatever it is that is being titled in your area).
