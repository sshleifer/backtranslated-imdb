I rented "The China Syndrome" recently, mainly because I read that it was this movie that inspired ABC to do "The Day After." "Syndrome", however, is more of a thriller than a drama. The film is quite political, but I strongly agree with its message - nuclear energy, although extremely efficient, is very dangerous for common use. The risks are simply too high. The people in charge of the actual nuclear plants are expected to be far more responsible and ethical than those represented in the film. However, given that the near-disaster of real life on Three Mile Island happened a few months after this movie was released puts this in question. (In fact, this case was probably more of incompetence than corruption.) "Syndrome" is not only critical of nuclear energy, but also of modern media, similar in vein to the "Net" only much more serious. Being a print journalist myself, I am quite familiar with the way people perceive the media; but it was kind of scary to see that even in the 1970s TV news was already running out. When Jane Fonda's character tries to convince her boss to let her make real news instead of a fluff, she is advised not to try to change, as "research" finds out that people prefer a pretty girl to make bouquets, not news. What really makes the movie memorable, however, is the incredible thriller generated in its last third. During this period, the spectator is constantly fearing for the lives of the protagonists, whether the danger is coming from hired bandits or the potential collapse of the nuclear power plant. And that last scene - I will not give up, of course - but this will let you guess. <br /> <br /> On a final note, I had a distinct feeling of seeing the movie that seemed times more like a TV movie than a true theatrical movie. This could be, however, more due to the fact that the rental tape that I was watching was quite old, and not formatted to fit on the TV screens as the videos and DVDs are today.
