"The Falcon and the Snowman" is the story of two young people, a CIA employee and a drug dealer who have become disenchanted with US foreign policy and sell state secrets to the Soviet Union. The events of the film are based on a true story. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn are compelling in the main parts and develop interesting characterizations. The supporting cast also performs well, notably with a performance by David Suchet of Hercule Poirot as an experienced Soviet agent. <br /> <br /> The film is usually effective in exposing its premise and developing it, giving a feeling of two boys picking up something they did not understand properly. However, it seems long and heavy at some points in the middle. The ending, however, is tense, impressive and effective. There are some infectious rock songs included in the soundtrack but also unfortunately a smooth and repeated synthesizer track that does not fit with a spy story. There are other spy movies that are worth looking for more than "The Hawk and the Snowman," but it's a decent movie, though.
