This movie rocked !!!! I saw in a screener a coupla weeks ago. Half an odd story where James Franco plays that idiot who marries Sienna Miller just to leave the country and they go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon. I do not want to give it because the movie has not yet been released, but it's totally cool and you would never expect it to happen. I kinda thought I'd hate it because it's a novel, but it's kind of fuzzy and things I like a lot. The acting is really good and Sienna Miller is totally smoking and plays this very sweet girl. I think she should do more roles like that. James makes a fool of himself, but you end up liking him and the end of the movie is very good. David Carradine plays a cowboy and he's good. I gave this movie a 10 because I left the movie really enjoying it and wanting to see what I did not expect again and my girlfriend really liked it and cried. good date movie
