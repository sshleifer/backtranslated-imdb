This film is a story of a Catholic nun as counselor for a convicted murderer on death row. The film describes what she does as a nun, who has no productive role. She could have had doubts in her real role. But eventually she plays the part that only a nun can play, which has nothing but faith in Christ. In the United States, there are so many movies describing convicted criminals or jails. These scenes, especially the execution, are very different from Japan.
