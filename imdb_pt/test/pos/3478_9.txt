When I was 10 (currently 14), I promised never to see a movie that I knew would not have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago I had done very well except Shakespeare for English class ... etc ... I was still just seeing things that ended happily. But then I saw Ramola Garai in Havanah Nights, which was cute, not good but fun enough to watch. After seeing this a few times over the two or more years since I first saw it, I started liking it, especially the song. So I did a research on her and found the IMDb ... I saw "Inside I'm Dancing" and I assumed she had done another dance movie, and more it seemed. It was later on a picture search (from Rory, looking for the Gilmore Girls poster for closet) I took a picture of that movie ... I searched for a trailer, found the trailer and when I saw the hospital and heard Rory say " You have the future "I remembered my vote and realized that this would not be a good movie for me. But it stayed in the back of my mind until we were in the store and there it was for $ 5 used, so I went ahead and bought it. After seeing him I just wanted to get out of my head because it was so sad. I still would not get close until I had cerebral palsy as a vocabulary word. So I just had to see it again and this time all I did was laugh, even in the saddest parts I did not feel more depressed because I realized that throughout this movie was happy and uplifting ... I love it and now is one of my favorites, I'm sure this is the worst review you've ever read. But see the movie is worth it.
