I bet I watch this movie 4 or 5 times a year, and I'm going to do it more often, now that Hollyweird tycoons thought it was good to put it on DVD, because it's a classic with a capital "C"! This movie is timeless! How can people pay $ 10.00 nowadays to see the junk that comes out of Hollyweird with movies like the Egyptian; THE TEN COMMANDMENTS; BEN HUR; CAPTAIN NEWMAN MD on tape; DVD; and cable movie channels; I could go on forever, but this movie is great, and for an unknown relative, Edmund Purdom carries the film as Atlas carried the world. The story is wonderful, the acting is top notch, and the graphics at the end are so powerful that you sit in your seat for a few minutes, trying to let the words sink! Really a knockout of a movie. I would give this 15 stars if they let me! They do not make them like that anymore, but they should !!!!!
