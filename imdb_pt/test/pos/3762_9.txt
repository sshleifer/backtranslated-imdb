In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I heard it was "The Greeks do not run out of Freeks". Is this right? I really liked that sound. I also liked "Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide" in the final scenes. Truely a doper movie, but with lots of laughs and puns, gags of vision and clowning. Madame Woo-Woo's place was reminiscent of some places I visited. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other things which is really amazing. She looks very different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity did not hurt her at all. Mark Blankfield reminds one of Gene Wilder in some ways. Bess Armstrong was beautiful and kept her beauty for a long time.
