Before watching this movie from start to finish, I just got the last half hour. Normally I do not watch a movie if I have not seen it from the beginning, but a friend used it and when I started watching it, I could not stop. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised this movie did not have a great theatrical release. This is a pretty funny movie (often dark humor), and the monster and the monster truck are quite menacing. The monster makes Leatherface look cute, and the monster truck is like a cross between a German World War I artillery vehicle and a gigantic coffin. <br /> <br /> A shy twenty-five-year-old boy is long journey to prevent the woman he loves to get married. Her former best friend follows and cheats on him constantly. They are threatened on the road by a vintage black hearse and the monster truck mentioned above. They also get a hitchhiker, played by the very sexy Aimee Brooks. <br /> <br /> I also watched the animated trailer with the director's commentary, and the electronic press kit and I found these two interesting. I would bet that commenting on the film with the director and the two male actors is a lot of fun too, but I have so many other movies to watch that I've never seen before ....
