Arrogant medical students play chicken with a process that simulates death, in an attempt to get a (hopefully temporary) view of life after death. Some twists and turns are somewhat inaccurate, and the acting occasionally is exaggerated. But the underlying message - about forgiveness from God and others for our real or perceived sins - is positive and unique in the movies, and the cast is very good. The last sequence between Julia Roberts and her father is so effective that, years after seeing it, I still feel shivers thinking about it. Highly recommended.
