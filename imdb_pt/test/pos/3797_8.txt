At this time, when almost everything comes to DVD (I'm hoping to see the My Mother the Car collection at any time), this movie was unfairly neglected. There are countless stupid comedies from the 60s, as well as many other eras that have received at least a superficial treatment on DVD. This one has not yet been released on VHS despite the talent involved in the creation (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (noted for co-writing Tootsie), and Dustin Hoffman in his debut). It's obviously a product of the sixties, but it's almost everything else back then. All films reflect the tastes and customs of the times in which they are made. This was released the same year as The President's Analyst, another absurd masterpiece. This movie was finally released on DVD and developed a follower cult. This movie has many unforgettable moments, bizarre and crazy. Of course, it's painted in broad strokes and has go-go silly music everywhere, but that's part of its charm. Create your own absurd universe. If anyone who is in charge of producing DVDs for Columbia Pictures' releases (I believe Columbia has posted) does research for new releases, that deserves my vote.
