First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the rugby aspect of this movie interesting, it could be any sport and I think I would have liked it that much. The fact that rugby did not make it better or worse for me. <br /> <br /> What made this movie great is the story itself, based on real events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club. Coach Gelwix is ​​the kind of coach most parents would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even though they have won 17 national championships and lost only 9 games in more than 30 years!) . The more I learned about the coach and the team, the more I like this movie and its message. <br /> <br /> I've seen other sports films that looked great at first, but then I researched the details only to find that most of these films were 10% de facto and 90% fiction, with 10% facts being greatly exaggerated. Not so with Forever Strong. It may sound too good to be true, but that's what's so incredible about it. If it were fiction, it would just be a nice story and nothing more. Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie because of some negative reviews from professional critics. I have read some of your comments and most of them have given the movie horrible comments. These are usually the same critics who get enthusiastic about movies that most people hate. In fact, I would be concerned if some of these critics had given good reviews of the film because I almost always disagree with their opinions. <br /> <br /> Go see this movie and post your comment (positive or negative)! Currently, most of the audience analysis is enthusiastically positive (here and at Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I'm interested to see if this trend continues. Thank you!
