If you are looking for an original horror movie, this may be the best for you. It's weird and sometimes it sticks to stupidity, but it's a good-looking movie with a nice, original sound that never fails, except perhaps during the climax too long. "Nightbreed" is a must see for horror fans, or for movie makeup fans of monsters. <br /> <br /> Boone (Craig Sheffer) has had dreams of a town called Midian full of mutant creatures. In therapy, his psychiatrist Dr. Decker (director of horror David Cronenberg) came to the conclusion that Boone is a killer, and gives him hallucinogenic pills, and tells him to surrender. After almost being killed, Boone ends up at the hospital. , where he meets a mental patient who also knows Midian, and tells Boone where to go. Midian, located in a graveyard, is inhabited by vile mutant creatures that do not let Boone enter. After escaping with just one nasty bite, Boone is shot dead by the police, who was taken to his location by Dr. Decker. But Boone is not dead. The bite causes him to live and he goes to Midian. Meanwhile, Boone's girlfriend, Lori (Anne Bobby) tries to find Boone and get to the bottom of it. When Dr. Decker also discovers about this place, chaos sets in. <br /> <br /> The plot seems long and complicated, but it really is not difficult to understand. The plot, among other things, makes this movie really interesting. The makeup effects are staggering. The creatures look unique and astounding, and make this a very attractive film. To add more appeal to the senses, we have a musical score by Danny Elfman, which is exuberant and lively, and fits the film like a glove. The photos in the movie are also beautifully set up. Cinematography is lovely, and the film creates an atmosphere that is never broken. Even the acting is good, with the biggest surprise being the director David Cronenberg giving a big and threatening performance as the man, who for one reason or another wants to see Boone dead. It's strange that a horror movie is so well done. <br /> <br /> The problems with the film ... well, there are some, but the positives outweigh the negatives. The script features occasional jokes to try to add a little humor, but almost everyone falls flat. Mutant creatures look great and for the most part are well represented, but sometimes it looks like they're just posing for the camera. The worst part of the movie would have to be the climax. It takes so much time and it's just a constant chaos. It's the part of the movie that moves from individual characters and cool photos, to explosions of every direction and violence to characters we do not know or care about. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is amazing to look at. It's a well-done horror movie, but even with that said, it has the occasional failure in the character's speech, and a confusing climax. However, this is a must to check out. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** out of ****. 101 min. R for strong violence and language.
