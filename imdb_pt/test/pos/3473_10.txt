I did not know anything about this movie until I watched it ... my brother actually suggested I take a look. Usually, her suggestions are not very cool, but I was stuck for something to watch, so I watched. <br /> <br /> Well, to shorten a long story, I give it 10/10. /> <br /> The film focuses on two people, who meet while staying at the same place. Initially, he is very dependent on the institution around him, the other is a rebel. One does what he likes, the other as he said. Since the first moments of the film, we quickly see the friendship between the two buildings and see how they blend with each other. It's a remarkable job, that can tell a good story without distortions, people jumping from bathtubs or superheroes coming to save the day. <br /> <br /> There is a good deal of courage and reality. there, not everything can work - not all abysses can be overcome - and this film shows the lot deliciously. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, and are not impressed ..... I suggest you do not see anything new.
