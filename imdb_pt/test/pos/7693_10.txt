This was / is an incredible movie, with incredible cast, song, song, story, etc. It is a tragedy that some arrogant families (the Gerswhins or Premingers) can keep it available for generation after generation. I wanted to see it again all my life. I just found this site and read it because it is not available. Shame on these families for their pettiness. My wife is from Germany and she has never seen the movie. I do not even have my stepchildren or my grandchildren. It is very sad that a film of such depth and quality is not available for them to see. Where do these families come from, making such a presumptuous, selfish, selfish, condescending decision to forbid generations to enjoy this movie, those stars, these performances, that music! Drop the video and let the world judge and enjoy!
