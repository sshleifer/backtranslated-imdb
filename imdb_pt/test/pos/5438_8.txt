This movie was really different from what I imagined, but it exceeded my expectations. This film has exactly the right mix of comedy, drama, political criticism and satire (not necessarily in that order). Without being condescending or wisenheimer, it reveals the open and subtle problems of our high-tech capitalist democratic society. This makes you laugh instantly and stay in thought later. For those of you who liked to "shake the dog" and wished to have human and human politicians, this movie should definitely be the choice! <br /> <br /> "Politicians are very much like diapers: they should be changed often and the same reasons."
