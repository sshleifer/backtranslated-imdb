You do not review James Bond movies, rate them, rate them according to how they meet expectations. There are certain things that are expected, even the demand for a Bond film and each individual effort or delivery or not. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond movie a Bond movie. And while NEVER SAYING NEVER is not technically part of Bond's official filmography, the mere presence of Sean Connery returning as 007 makes him something more than merely an honorary member of the series. Anyway, here's how it ranks on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: The clever title does not have an apparent link to the actual plot, but it is a reference in joke to Sean Connery's oath to never touch OO7 again after having been lured once before for DIAMONDS TO BE FOREVER. Whatever the case, it's a catchy title. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Pre-Credit Teaser: Maybe trying to avoid any obvious parallels with Bond's official EON series, there is no Teaser; the opening scenes are shown only behind the credits. And even this is disappointing: another one "oh-no, Bond was killed" false. 4 points. Opening Credits: In addition to a full screen of minuscule 007, they did not bother trying to increase credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 point. <br /> <br /> Thematic Song: As written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall, "Never Say Never Again" would be a perfectly nice part of a long elevator ride. As a Bond theme, it's just okay. 6 points. <br /> <br /> "Bond, James Bond": Appropriately, since this film sees Connery being drawn back into service as Bond after a decade of hiatus, the story begins with 007 facing the question of whether Bond / Connery is still up to work. Fortunately, Connery more than stands ready for Bondage again. Although he is a bit more grizzled, sporting a bit more perimeter and wearing a slightly more obvious wig, he seems to have no trouble getting back into action. All in all, it's one of Connery's best and most laid back characters. 9 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Babes: Even in the best of Bond movies, female characters do not get a lot of size; they exist in large part as necessary accessories for the use of Bond. Kim Basinger, an Oscar winner, gets a lot of room to create her character Domino Petachi and the film benefits from it. She does a good job - and she is not bad to look at either. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Villain: The reports of his death being obviously exaggerated, Blofeld is back - at least for now - showing that he has more lives than his esteemed kitten. A villain who eventually became a stereotype of Jesus, Max von Sydow, does not have much to do on paper, but it's a silky presence, though. But he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximiliano Largo. After a series of banal Bond villains, it's so refreshing for Brandauer to deliver a performance that is both subtle but colorful. Funny without being exaggerated, ruthless without appearing caricatured; his Largo is on the same level as Auric Goldfinger as one of Bond's best villains. 10 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Baddies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? As played with all the dashing style of a particularly extravagant drag queen, Barbara Carrera shines through the film, displaying a mixture of moody and more than a little pure psychotic insanity. Bond has come across a variety of femmes fatales, most of which have been so easily dismissed that they existed more as fun jokes than as characters. But few have dared to display such a flare for dramatic determination or so fierce. Even his premature death is spectacular, even by Bondian standards. 10 points. Sinister Synopsis: As a remake of the THUNDERBALL type, the film seems a bit already done: nuclear missiles are stolen and large real estate properties countries of the world do not pay a ransom of several kazilh√µes of dollars. But at least producer Kevin McClory was lucky enough to be forced to redo one of the weaker Bond adventures. By comparison, this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the absence of many Bondian brands, the film is successful. 9 points. <br /> <br /> Production Values: The movie begins with an uncomfortable style, like a TV movie trying to be more than it can. But as the story progresses, the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose, making it a superior adventure. 8 points <br /> <br /> Bonus Points: There are several strange changes that differentiate this Bond movie from the official series. Miss Moneypenny is hardly recognized; as interpreted by Edward Fox, "M" is a grumpy old grump, with no respect for "Double Os," an omen of how Judi Dench would later play the role; and "Q" suddenly has a cockney accent and is all Bond's friend. And there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film, such as replacing Bond's Astin-Martin with a vintage Packard and a number of tango dance that is cleverly inserted into the story. And a big rescue near the end is on horseback, a tribute to THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, which was itself a tribute to the Bond films. 5 points. <br /> <br /> Summary: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a mixed bag. In the really important areas, it is more than safe thanks to the hero Connery, the villain Brandauer, the murderer Carrera and the damsel in danger Basinger. But the devil is in the details; as seemingly unimportant as the opening credits, theme song and such seem, the film is missing because of its absence. It all comes out as a fake Bond movie; a very good substitute, but a substitute, however. <br /> <br /> Bond-o-meter rating: 78 points out of 100.
