I first saw All the Rivers Run on TV when I was a kid and I loved it. It was great to see a mini-series that was filmed and filmed in a place so close to home. Living quite close to Echuca, I loved going to the historic port to see the steamboats. The first one I ever rode was Pevensy (Philadelphia in the movie). I love how it takes time to let the events happen. Nothing seems rushed like most movies are today. The acting was fantastic. All Rivers Run has been perfectly launched and I love the Philadelphia team. Mac is always fun to watch with his branded raw onion sandwich after a great night out. It easily deserves a 10 out of 10 and is one of my all-time favorite mini-series along with Dynasty Dynasty.
