This is a very well done film showing the lives of international students during their "Erasmus Year" in Barcelona, ​​which by the way is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and is an ideal location. <br /> <br /> The idea itself, with all the different languages, is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are a few clichés about the countries, but most of them are true! The characters could not represent their different countries better. Having experienced "Erasmus" in me during my semester of exchange in Italy, I can say that the film is incredibly authentic. I had many experiences that were similar to the characters (except that I did not fuck so often). The movie is also pretty funny, but not like all those stupid American college movies. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film also addresses some important issues, such as moving from student to professional life. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (I may not be very objective)
