Instead of going there and making a realistic film about drug addiction in Windy City, controversial director Otto Preminger decided to go the other way and make his film look as artificial as possible, fleeing the fashion created by men like Kazan , Huston and Zinnemann, who were making their photos all over the world. Nelson Algren, in whose novel the film is based, was recorded as despicable. What, one imagines, was the premise, and why did he make the film that way? <br /> <br /> The sets in the film are so small that they suggest a cartoon of Mr. Magoo. Louie, the drug dealer, is dressed to resemble the kind of gangster the Mad magazine artists used to draw. Arnold Stang, wonderful comedian he was, seems out of place in a serious image like this, and his appearance, topped with an exaggerated baseball cap and big, provokes laughter. Robert Strauss, another actor best known for his humorous roles, is also out of place, as his big, grumpy face and the delivery of Runyone lines seem more appropriate for a Jerry Lewis movie. Against all this, the stars Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak and Eleanor Parker need to do extra hours not to let the viewer laugh. Sinatra is agitated and maniacal all over, suggesting a man uncomfortable with himself, therefore wholly fit for the role of a drug addict. Miss Novak, looking like a plant and sublimely unimpressive, is friendly and looks like a product of the artistically shady favelas she loves in the movie. Parker is pure Hollywood and very hardworking as the crippled and crafty Zosch. She's never convincing, but neither is the film. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone interested in a realistic depiction of the lives of drug addicts in America. The Caligari sets, by itself, make it unbelievable. Preminger may have aimed for a dream effect, as cardboard backgrounds give the film the surreal feel of a nightmare operetta, perhaps going back to the early days of Preminger in Vienna.
