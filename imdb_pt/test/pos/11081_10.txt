... David Bovie sings in this movie. BUT THIS IS!!! It's all about America, so do not be ashamed to watch. Think, if you can, to avoid further damage ... You know, you're the same normal guy next door, so be careful! One of the best critics of "ordinary" mind and friendship. Do not you still care? Go for the music - it's worth a try, just close your eyes and Pat Metheny and David Bowie will play you so deep you'll start screaming! And while watching, if you dare open your eyes, please do not make popcorn and things like that, you will lose a lot. You may think it's not worth it, but think twice - and do not look at your neighbor's lawn - you never know what to find there ... Is it worth it? Try it! Just do not die or make a fuck about it ...
