Hoot was great. The owls are adorable and the film highlights an interesting environmental issue that I did not know existed. Florida is full of fun characters and the movie does a great job of bringing it to the screen. My children particularly love all different animals, from snakes, to owls to alligators. It's really a simple story, but also one that they need to hear at this age. When children are young, it is when they really develop their sense of values, but one of them must be to take care of our environment and all the creatures that live in it. I think it was great that the film had a talk with them about the ride home about the animals and how to help them. It was really sweet and long-lasting to hear my little girl talk about how she wanted to save the birds. Anyway, overall it was really a great time and I highly recommend the movie to anyone looking for something fun and meaningful.
