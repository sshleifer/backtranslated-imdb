I saw this movie for the first time in the late 60's, and I try to watch it every time it comes on TV, which, unfortunately, is not often. Now that I have TCM and FMC, I expect it to be at least once a year. Like Louis Gossett Jr. in An Officer and A Gentleman, Jack Webb delivers incredibly great performance as a Parris Island Drill Sergeant with the classic recruit, and the plot in this, though dated, is thrilling and beautifully portrayed. . And having real jug heads in the cast certainly helped in the realism of the film as well. It's a great movie with high-level acting and an excellent story. See if you get the chance - it's worth it!
