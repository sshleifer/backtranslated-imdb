This is one of my favorite movies ever! along with Casablanca and the cannibal holocaust, this is a near perfect cinema. rex allen tells this wonderful tale of a cougar who just needs a little love. contains action, adventure, suspense, comedy and chaos on the riverbed! SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAD TO KILL TO DO !!! you will not find a better cat photo anywhere, with "outer space cat" coming in like a second not so close. Charlie's performance is magnificent. includes even cruelty against animals and intense wood extraction! You have to love disney, for all moral failures!
