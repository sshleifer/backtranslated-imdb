Take out all the parts of the movie that were "present" day and stick with the flashbacks. Then you would have a great story. The story of Faith and Wolf and their relationship was the best part. Diaz and Eccleston were wonderful. Brewster was heavy to sit down. Surprised to see Blythe Danner as mother. She was great. Also look for Patrick Bergen as his father, always like him (Sleeping with the Enemy). This is very hippie, save the world, kind of movie. Do not mind too much, but I'd recommend watching it just for Diaz's performance. It has excellent range and should be used more. Eccleston is, as always, attractive. He is wonderful!
