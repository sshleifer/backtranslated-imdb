I can not add much to what has already been said, except that I'll have to because of the minimum policy of 10 lines. <br /> <br /> I actually have this in a VHS-to-DVD copy, but the quality is pretty poor and I desperately need it to be officially released. <br /> <br /> I can imagine what extras I'd like to see (Tim Healy's character cursing one of them) Football Bloopers-type programs would be great!). You can imagine now, can not you? But of course, it seems that most people will have to keep dreaming about releasing a DVD. <br /> <br /> Certainly for God there must be someone in the ITV DVD release department who also knows something about British culture, is knowledgeable on the web and has enough on them to look at the IMDb from time to time ? Oh well.
