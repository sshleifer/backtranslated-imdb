I saw this last week during Bruce Campbell's book tour. I thought it was amazing. Almost everything I would expect from a science fiction film by Bruce Campbell. Your campy is very funny. Ted Raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy. The plot is crazy, an American businessman goes to Bulgaria and is killed. Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who rescues Bruce Campbell back to life implanting half the brain of a former KGB taxi driver. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the movie trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between him and the KGB agent. The film has all the great slaps on Bruce Campbell and humor. The film is a bit predictable, I knew that once the wife was dead, she would be sharing a brain with her killer. However, I did not go to see this movie because I thought it would have an Oscar-winning screenplay, I went to see it because it was a science fiction film by Bruce Campbell and I was not disappointed at all. I recommend you go see him on your books tour or wait and watch the science fiction channel next month. Although before the film he said the Sci-Fi channel cut some of the movies to make it TV friendly. If you are a Bruce fan, I highly recommend it.
