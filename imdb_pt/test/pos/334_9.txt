This is an amazing movie that starts slow. This leads you to think of it as a typical family drama of the family. So in the second half, there's a twist in history that turns that into a deep history of global reach. <br /> <br /> If you're not used to movies from India, with seemingly grafted routines for music and dance for no reason, stick with this movie. Especially starting with the second half, you'll find this movie an incredible experience. <br /> <br /> *********** Spoiler Minor Here ************ * I have only one complaint with the movie. The dialogue at the end (between Amudha and MDS) seemed very weak and missed the opportunity to bring the war as a force that transforms people's lives. It was implicit all the time, but there should be something about the importance of the struggle for MDS.
