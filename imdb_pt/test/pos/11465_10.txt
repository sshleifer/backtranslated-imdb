This is a great horror movie for people who do not want all that gore and sensationalism. This movie has equal amounts of horror, suspense, humor and even a bit of light nudity, but nothing great. Linnea Quigley is not exaggerated as in "Return of the Living Dead," where she danced naked in a crypt, but she is still essentially the same character slut. Cathy Podewell is a virgin and chaste character before going to "Dallas", and we are also introduced to Amelia [soon Mimi] Kinkade, the sensual and sinister pretender living in the house. While she and Linnea are possessed and take care of the house, they reanimate the bodies of their dead friends to scare the survivors. I've heard a lot of people compare this movie to "The Evil Dead", but if anything, this movie is a rival to that one in the same way that Freddie rivaled Jason. This series of films is far superior to this one!
