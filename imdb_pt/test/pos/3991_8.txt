Warning - this movie has some incredibly graphic images and should never be seen by children. <br /> <br /> The artist about whom this story is concerned was in fact a good Korean painter who rose from the lowest depths to become his greatest painter. Unfortunately, in many ways, this guy was also a jerk in many ways. Part of that was artistic temperament, and what might have seemed annoying was only his demanding nature when it came to art. But at other times he was simply a drunken jerk-especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist. At the end of the film, it being irritating, abrasive and unnecessarily cruel seemed to have subsided. Although all this does not make him a particularly good man, it is important to capture in the film, so we understand a lot about the nature of the artist. <br /> <br /> I really found the film fascinating and loved how the movie artists real artists were shown throughout the film (as in LUST FOR LIFE). I really wish I could show this to my students (I teach at an arts school), but I can not, because there is so much adult material. Yes, there is nudity, but even more problematic for any audience (especially the younger ones) is when he, um ... hmmm, ... I do not think IMDb will let me describe what happened, but it was very graphic and involves body fluids. Not just an unpleasant and disgusting scene that did NOT need to be seen, but a reason to keep the junior from watching this wonderful movie. It's a shame.
