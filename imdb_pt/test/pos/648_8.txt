I found this movie on Netflix and had to add it to my queue. I was not disappointed when I got it, it's as funny now as when I saw it at a local drive-in movie theater at the time. <br /> <br /> She builds a fine climax with you having glimpses of the various characters as they begin their journey through America on the Honky Tonk Freeway, America on wheels. This was a strange comedic role for William DeVane, as I remember him as Kennedy in the 1974 TV movie "The October Missiles" and felt that no one could have taken this dramatic character as well as he did. <br /> This reminds me a bit of Dick Van Dyke in "Cold Turkey," where Van Dyke played the local minister. DeVane's role as mayor, minister, and activist was typical of small towns, making his character seem fun and real. Howard Hessman and Teri Garr as the spoiled family in the RV was the target of the season as well. Anyone who traveled the country with small children, (we already got there?) will appreciate these scenes. The scenes of a small town struggling to survive reminded me a lot of the little town I grew up in, but they dealt with the charm and humor that you often only saw in small towns. Cities disappeared because of the highway system and gives a realistic view of what they had to do to survive. (All animals used in zoos?) <br /> <br /> In short, it's a light comedy with no particular message but with a good-humored look in America during the early 1980's. Worth watching if you just need a little cheer.
