It seems a given, but if a viewer forgets the context, he risks losing an opportunity for pleasure. <br /> <br /> It is easy to carp, from the high heights of the 21st century, to market styles and prices. Years of the Great Depression; but the intelligent viewer will remember that magic word, "context," and will understand better and thus appreciate "Accidents Will Happen." <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Ronald Reagan again became a handsome and presentable face, and again gave a positive performance. A reviewer said earlier that Gloria Blondell played nasty wife, but that was wrong: she plays the clerk who has a crush on the Reagan character Eric Gregg but keeps his hands away while he is married. Gloria was cute. Not as beautiful as her sister, Joan, she was still attractive and a good actress. Maybe she looked a bit like Joan was a loss to have a more successful career, and it is certainly our loss. <br /> <br /> Sheila Bromley was Mrs. Gregg, and played well. <br /> <br /> Other actors included Dick Purcell, and the great Earl Dwire played something beyond a voracious villain. <br /> <br /> Again, most players never achieved the "family name" status that many of them deserved, but they gave good performances here in a story that is still current.
