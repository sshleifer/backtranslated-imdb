Renowned Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský, known mainly in North America for his leading role as Jacob in the production of Jacob the Liar (Jakob, der Lügner 1974) gives us one last brilliant performance as a playboy of 80 years who refuses to admit that he is about to die. <br /> <br /> Jirí Hubac's script is exquisite. Funny, moving and well developed. He explores well both the subject of advanced old age and the motivations of characters who are precariously strong and fragile, happy and unstable. <br /> <br /> Frantisek (Vlastimil Brodský) and his best friend Eda (Stanislav Zindulka) are on high for all kinds of antics and are making sure to make the best of their dying days. Meanwhile, Frantisek's wife is preparing for their death, saving for funeral money and punishing Frantisek for her endless childishness and irresponsible attitude. Their son is about to take their apartment and put them in a nursing home, but Frantisek does not want to hear any of this. He wants to enjoy life and make people around laugh. He wants to help and love and give ... but at what cost? <br /> <br /> Surely to captivate adults of all ages, this beautiful film by talented director Vladimír Michálek is touching and entertaining. It makes you think about how we live our lives and why we live our lives. It brings the simple story of a stubborn old charming forward and allows us to reflect and feel what life is. <br /> <br /> After an active career that lasts over 40 years, it is a bit gloomy I know that Vlastimil Brodsk died in April 2002, no longer under the control of terminal cancer. However, it is edifying to think that he had the chance to be part of such a touching script and to be the catalyst for this ode to joyous old age that has not even begun to make the waves he is about to create in the American repertoire. Following the international success of Jan Hrebejk's "Divided We Fall" (2000), it is becoming clear that Czech cinema really has something to offer the world. This movie, at least, is a must see.
