... The world may never know. (The Oscar-nominated "Best Short Animation" that year, "Anna and Bella," is very good, but it's not "Big Snit." Both are available on Expanded Entertainment's "World's Greatest Animation" compilation if you I would like to compare. <br /> <br /> "Snit" and its director, Richard Condie, have attracted so much attention that there is not much to add. <br /> <br /> I would like to note, though, that the film contains one of my "shots "favorites in an animated short, one in which the man opens the door to let the cat out.I do not want to reveal the actual events described here, but the first time I saw the scene I was whipsawed from one mood to another, For this photo, and for the way Condie constructs himself for this set of moments, "The Big Snit" deserves the label "work" -cousin".
