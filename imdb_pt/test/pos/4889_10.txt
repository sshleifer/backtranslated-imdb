I'm a TV show addict, the live shows and everything they do. And this was the last job they did on TV / movie as 'The League of Gentlemen'. <br /> <br /> If you love the show then you will love the movie. It's a good ending to your TV series. <br /> <br /> He's smart and funny. <br /> <br /> Although it does not focus on some of the most popular characters, it's still great to see all the characters together and with the writers. A must see for any League of Gentlemen fan. <br /> <br /> Watch!
