As with so many modern American films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you let it go, this is a tale with heaps of charm and a gentle heart in a crab shell. <br /> <We are presented with a scene of a city in an economically depressed area, struggling to find something to be happy. The character of Beau Bridges is really up against this with a rising family, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who is sold to a chain of big deals that he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub Beau's nose. . D'Onofrio thinks his Bubba lifestyle on the surface is strained by having to look after his "blessed" brother, Joey, and is eager to escape the shackles of that dead city. His boss's business is closing (much against his will) because of the lack of new clients and he is haunted by memories of his father as he builds the tension toward his own self-destructive attempt. <br /> <br /> Joey, who seemed to embody the curse of their lives, is lost at sea - believed to have drowned - in a strange accident. Their miraculous restoration to them by the Portuguese traffickers, whose boat they have just built and launched (perhaps symbolic of an angelic crew), is the signal they have been waiting for and they all decide to give life a final release of the dice. There is a beautiful humor in all this work that stood out in keeping our attention as bright as 'The Shipping News'. There are other parallels with later work, which lead one to suspect a touch of remake. I like 'Signs of Life' for its simpler, less-invented story and performances of actors who work in their craft rather than being noticed as stars.
