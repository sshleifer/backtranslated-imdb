I also found "Oppenheimer" a brilliant series and one of the best offers from American PBS. David Suchet was particularly effective as Edward Teller, as I recall, and the overall design was spectacularly good. The only reason the series does not rate a full 10/10 is for low budget production figures in some areas. The current content is absolutely top notch in my memories. <br /> <br /> The Oppenheimer miniseries will be released in the United Kingdom on July 31! It will be a 2 Region / PAL set, but it looks like a 1 / NTSC Region set should be soon in the future. <br /> <br /> If you have a universal player in the USA, you can order the series now from Amazon UK. <br /> <br /> http://tinyurl.com/znyyq <br /> <br /> Huzzah !!
