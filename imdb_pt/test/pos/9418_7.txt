I watched two very different Holmes adventures this morning, but you'd be surprised at the similarities. <br /> <br /> It was presumably the first collaboration between Basil Rathbone (If I Were King, Romeo and Juliet) and Nigel Bruce, and director Roy William Neill. It was not Sherlock Holmes' first adventure, as they did a couple of years before that. <br /> <br /> The team has made a great team, but I prefer the Hammer version, which I'll talk about later. Holmes relies on many guises to do his job, and I constantly enjoy the mannerisms exhibited when they discover something. They always seem to run when they find a new clue. <br /> <br /> The story itself about keeping a bombing spot from the Germans in World War II was interesting and kept you focused on the mystery.
