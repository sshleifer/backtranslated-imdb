The story of TV for movie adaptation is filled with freaks that almost prove that tradition should never have started in the first place. There are, however, some examples that can only do this. Rising Damp would at first be the last sitcom suitable for the treatment of the big screen, since this hilarious series was based on the tiny limits of a bed of the north. Also the writer, Eric Chappell, was not getting paid enough to spend time creating an entirely original script, so he reaped a lot of TV episodes and put them together to form the body of the movie. This, by itself, did not necessarily mean that the script would fail. David Croft and Jimmy Perry did the same thing with their script for Dad's Army and it worked superbly. However, the early episodes of Daddy's Army, with their stern rhythm and a dashing storyline, gave the best film adaptation. The episodes of Rising Damp, however, were high energy subjects from the first scene to the climax of the breathless. As a result, when one story is completed and another begins, the scenes within the film disintegrate. Another pitfall for the cinematic version of a TV series are the inevitable comparisons that are made. In this regard, the film pales in comparison to the brilliant series of Rising Damp. Despite all this, Rising Damp the Movie can be fun and occasionally noisy. It is perhaps not surprising that the best moments occur during sequences written especially for the film. This includes a rugby match in which the Rossiter makes a brilliantly timed fall of time. In fact, while the entire cast takes care of their roles perfectly (bar a standard replacement actor for the deceased and really great Beckinsale), it is Leonard Rossiter as Rigsby who shines the most. In fact, Rising Damp should have been made as a film just so that Rossiter could get an Oscar, such is the magnificence of his acting talent. Criminally, he was not even indicated. Ultimately, the film can not keep up with the dizzying heights of the TV series, while it manages to remain a comedy on its own, with some beautifully played moments. Recommended view. <br /> <br /> One last thing: opening and closing music is by far the worst in movie history.
