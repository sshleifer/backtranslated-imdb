Postwar England, the dawn of the "atomic age." However, the worries of a young student yearning to experience his first "kiss" can not be hampered by something as inconsequential as THE BOMB. This was a delightful if not educational look at young love from the point of view of a male adolescent and his 1940s world. Free from political correctness and preaching messages, this film exposes the viewer to the world that only the (and the hormones) a young teenager can create. Wonderful subplots hold the character interest wing "Gregory's Girl", and many well-locked photos help keep the images from this era. This is a very good story for anyone, young or old, who has ever been in love or wants to be. Has he got his wish already? Watch and see.
