I do not know which version of the movie I saw, but it was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I did not know who the "twins" were (Gillian Chung and Charlene Choi) before seeing this movie and I think the English translation of the title is a bit misleading. <br /> <br /> The martial arts are very well done. I especially liked them because there was so much judo / grappling that was filmed very well. Donnie Yen (seeing him in Hero, great performance) as a director is great as he knows how to film these scenes. <br /> <br /> Everything seemed to flow to me except there is a scene where the girls are on the roof struggling with bamboo sticks. It has nothing to do with the plot, but it's still fun. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is one of the best (modern) HK action movies I've seen for some time. Though flamboyant in some ways, it still does. <br /> <br /> Definitely a 9/10
