Okay, I'm a sucker. I loved. I had no expectations and had all fulfilled. It was a terrible movie. I loved. I was able to use an overuse DVD. No one can understand my obsession. I also can not tell the truth. For those who saw the movie, this will not be a surprise, but I asked the clerk at the store if I could buy a copy and I could because there were two in stock and only one had been registered and more than half the time it had been for me. <br /> <br /> Now the movie is terrible. The special effects are terrible. The acting is terrible, but I loved it. The actors are silly, silly storyline, numerous goons - like being able to see through the monsters, "Arachnids" seemed to be made of plastic garbage bags (maybe they were), there was underground light, TNT was not deafening, etc ... <br /> <br /> You really should love B-Movies to take some pleasure out of it ... alcohol helps enormously to others.
