This movie is so cool. He told me to enjoy every moment of life in its fullness. I think Bonnie Hunt (Jerry Maguire) writes well and I'm so happy she gave the aging actors the opportunity to play such important roles in the film. This is really cool, in a society that cultivates wealth, health and youth, it was good to see a movie about normal people. The movie reminded me a lot "while you were sleeping," which I really love. If you do not like this movie, you should work on your sensitivity skills.
