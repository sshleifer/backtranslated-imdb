This is a truly wonderful love story. I liked the songs, however, even if you do not like it, you have to love the story. Peter O'Toole is at his best and Petula Clark is fine too. I first saw this when I was about 13 and loved it then. Now in my forties, I still like it, probably even more. It still makes me cry and laugh and feel good. It's a movie to watch only with a new age guy or by yourself, because it's a girl's movie. But what's wrong with that? Need some romance and maybe a little cry, try this movie. <br /> <br />
