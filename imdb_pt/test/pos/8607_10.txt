I am not infuriated by the fact that, now and forever, I will have to identify this film (which I consider to be a masterpiece, and I do not use that word lightly) with the qualifier "It's Not Michael Douglas's Movie!" Not only are the titles the same, but they refer to the same thing - the radioactive fallout that rained on survivors of the first nuclear bombings. In Imamura's film, this is not a cheap metaphor; the whole movie is about the physical and emotional consequences of Hiroshima and the war itself. As the deterioration of a couple and their grown niece grows darker, the ironic image becomes more potent, from the old clock that is redefined each night to the stone gods that gradually pile up outside the door of the heroine . (These, in turn, are carved by a veteran who is forced, in a series of tragicomic episodes, to attack anything with an engine approaching the city.) The very day of the bombardment is shown in fragmented flashbacks that are coldly horrifying However, "Black Rain" ("NtMDm!") Can be watched, until repeatedly, because of Imamura's compassion for his characters. I repeat: a masterpiece.
