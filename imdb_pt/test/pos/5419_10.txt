He just logged on YouTube and finally watched an Oscar-nominated animated short directed by Richard Condie. I had already seen his funny Getting Started there. In this, a couple is playing Scrabble. The wife continues to shake her eyes while her husband has nothing but And by his side. The wife goes out a little to clean the bed and the tub (!) Before picking up the husband looking at her side. Shortly before that, her husband watches a TV show called "Sawing for Teens," with the stars doing something and her husband getting his own saw. This program is interrupted by a special report of a nuclear war going on (the journalist is a skeleton here) while everyone panics, although the husband has fallen asleep during that time and thinks that a parade is happening while he and his wife continue to argue about the game. ... There are many other bizarre things happening before the touching end. Quite hilarious and worth seeing for any animation out there. Can not wait to see Mr. Condie's shorter animation ...
