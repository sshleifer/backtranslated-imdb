Rendition presents a very current issue in the form of a very tense thriller. It's an exciting film and not preaching. Seeing this in an Arab country with a mix of Arab and European audiences gave it an extra level of atmosphere. The audience was totally overwhelmed by the film and gave loud applause afterwards. The story of an Egyptian, married to an American, has suspected links with terrorist organizations and embarked for a friendly Arab country (with the United States) for "advanced interrogations" (as the Meryl Streep character in the film states: "We have no torture in the US ") seems to be the first page of today's news. There is a very clear connection between the various characters that appear in the movie and the rhythm of the movie never falls. The message of the movie seems to be (as it is told by the character of Jake Gyllenhal in the movie that by kidnapping and torturing suspects, you create a lot more terrorists, and the acting is uniformly excellent, with Streep and Reese Witherspoon highlighted.
