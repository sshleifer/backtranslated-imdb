This film is important to those of us interested in Western history because it makes use of authentic techniques in its production. <br /> <br /> The wagon train scenes are particularly authentic; so far as I know, contains the only scenes ever filmed illustrating techniques for crossing rivers on a cliff. Horses and mules should be lowered to river level and wagons lowered by ropes and pulleys. The scene is such that I could watch it again and again just trying to get an idea of ​​what a crossing was like ... and the first travelers did it over and over again as they crossed the country. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the melodrama, this image is as authentic in dress and style as they come and it pays to watch just for that.
