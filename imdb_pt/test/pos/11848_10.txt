I watched and enjoyed the very rich ability of expressions of the leading actress, Julianne Nicholson. I have no words to describe how much I loved it. All the actors and actresses played well. Especially I noticed the solid solid character who has been consistent in predicting the future - Andy Richter, who played Carl. I think the idea of ​​showing a variety of friends and relatives with different opinions, and the various consulting meetings, is like the real world. Jay Mohr, who played Ed, the future husband, also had very real behavior. But, I want to emphasize again the point of repertoire of very rich expressions of which Julianne Nicholson is able and does it of course, was overwhelming for me. In fact, the subject that this film approaches seems to me very important and touches strongly significant thoughts of many people. I've seen this movie several times and I was not bored. Raise again and again in my thoughts.
