I only saw this movie the other day at the Santa Fe Film Festival. I was enchanted by its honesty and humor. It was the most thought-provoking movie I've seen in a long time - I can not get it out of my head for some reason. It may not be for everyone because it makes you think. I do not know if people like to think about movies, which is a shame. The actors who play the Franklins are a great find. I could not imagine interpreting these complicated people so frankly. Although I thought some of the supporting characters were not as good as the Franklins, I can totally forgive them - because this is an important movie in my opinion. I did not expect to like it that much, but as I thought about it for a few days, it's proving to be a very relevant piece of entertainment.
