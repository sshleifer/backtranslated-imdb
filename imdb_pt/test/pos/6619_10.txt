At that time, I was one of the RNs in the First Aid, these skaters occasionally landed. They were not well treated, and some of them were brought in by their social personalities - but we all knew they were a talented group. of "wonderkids" even then. They deserved better service than they did, I'm afraid. They had "attitude" to spare. <br /> <br /> I am so happy to have watched this documentary at IFC tonight - that it will be back by 1:00 AM and I will be watching again! Little attention was paid to them until the rich kid dying was able to convince their parents to drain the pool - and the film really highlights that as the starting point ... it was an incredible time, and deserved to be recorded. Stacy Peralta is owed all the compliments heaped on him, and long time those Z-Boys enjoy their memories and contribution to the actual sport of skateboarding. As for the few "sour grape" reviews contained here, there have always been and there will always be "aspirants" and hangers that never do more than dreaming ... the Z-boys lived, breathed, if it were. Nice to see the vintage movies and even the lonely girl, "Peggy," who was so talked about as the only woman to earn their respect. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the IFC for actually taking the occasional head trip from my drug-free youth and reliving heart beating with excitement again.
