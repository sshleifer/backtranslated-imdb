Great movie from the late 1970s. It tells a lot about corporate corruption at the expense of the average person, so the powerful can earn huge profits and disregard the environment and the safety of others. <br /> <br /> Almost 30 years later, this movie is compelling about power. of certain corporate entities that since the launch of the film have gained ten times more in their ability to control; This shows the need for regulation of the public against powerful business interests whose primary purpose is profit. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon is brilliant - while Jane Fonda and Micheal Douglas are equally compelling in their roles. The frivolous 70's where much damned, this movie rescues the decade. <br /> <br /> A movie that becomes better after each one watching.
