2001: A Space Odyssey <br /> <br /> Is it a sermon? An account of the history of humanity? An exploration of man's futile attempts to advance technology only for technology to destroy it? Is it about the fragile balance of time and space? A lesson in evolution? Or it's just a spectacular show of effects; a film that Kubrick did just to show us the unlimited possibilities of the film and to present us with the truth that the images are extremely more powerful than the words? <br /> <br /> 2001: A Space Odyssey is all that. One of the most interpretable films ever created, it's almost more fun to dissect and discuss the plot design and ambiguous events of the film than to actually watch. But it is left open to discussion intentionally; if Kubrick had explained the meaning of his wonderful 1968 classic (22nd place on AFI's list of the 100 greatest films ever made, my 21st favorite movie currently?) and nominated for 4 Oscars: Director, Original Screenplay, Direction Art and Visual Effects by which it won) would have lost half of its fascination, all its complexity and much of its cinematographic value. We would only be left with technical ingenuity; which in itself is worth praising. <br /> <br /> Because it pays to take a look at every shot. And a long time ago. 2001 is very elegiac and also coldly distant; detached. Emotional detachment and slow rhythm pay perfect tribute, however, to the unique visual experience; 2001 begins with the ape apes of mankind who upgrade from planet scavengers to hunters and toolmakers after discovering a giant monolith in the middle of their home in the desert, then (in one of the most inspired editions of film history ) thrown into the air and becomes a satellite, advancing a few thousand years in space, where the astronauts discovered a similar object on the Moon, and then the movie following a crew of the space traveler's mission as they follow the monolith's sign through space, accompanied by his unreliable computer HAL, which attempts to sabotage the bus and kill the crew, before finally the only survivor is launched through space and time (in a barrage of drug-induced colors that probably gave the hippies an epileptic shock) , die and be reborn a "son of a star". Ufa. <br /> <br /> This empty, emotional rhythm also contrasts with the movie's more ironic scene; the destruction of HAL. As the team's final explorer shuts the machine, bathed in the sacred aura of red light that Kubrick has always used as a motif of repetition, HAL singing a beautiful tune, it's a strangely emotional experience. And it's all great. Other notable aspects of Kubrick's masterpiece are the memorable voice of HAL (a quiet, somewhat sinister, Douglas Rain), the minimal use of dialogue (Kubrick wisely relied on his images to boost the film, giving only banal and useless lines to its actors, being the most famous "Open the doors of HAL viscera compartment", satellites dancing in orbit of unorthodox music and that first earth-inspiring shot; <br /> <br /> 2001 will always remain a mystery, and will forever be a testament to the strongest point in the cinema: visuals are more powerful than writing , "The Halo Pod", "The Halo Pod", "The Halo Pod", "A Space Odyssey", "A Space Odyssey"
