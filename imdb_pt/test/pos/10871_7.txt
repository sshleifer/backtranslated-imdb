Martino, a young teacher on the island of Elba, was formed by Maestro Fontanelli, an excellent educator, to be his own man and to say what he thinks, something that puts him in trouble in the school where we first meet him because he is teaching revolutionary ideals. The island is in frenzy because of the arrival of one of the most influential men in nineteenth-century European history. Napoleon is coming to his exile, not exactly a high point of his life. <br /> <br /> With surprise, Martino is chosen to accompany Napoleon who is writing his memoirs and needs help for his own project. The young man comes from a merchant sea family. His brother and sister want him to go on a commercial expedition, but Martino decided that his place belongs to Elba because he will try to assassinate Napoleon. Little stops him after his mentor Fontanelli is tried for treason and sentenced to be shot by a firing squad. <br /> Martino finds his comfort with the much older Baroness Emilia, a beautiful woman. In his own interaction with the deposed emperor, a different kind of man arises. Napoleon is seen as a more human person who really enjoys the company of Martino, not suspecting the plans that the young man has for him. Unfortunately, Martino can not put his project into action because Napoleon has other plans in mind. <br /> <br /> Paolo Virzi, director of "Caterina va in citta", shows why his initial promise is still there. Mr. Virzi also collaborated with the script, based on a novel by Ernesto Ferrero. The director shows that he is as good at intimate drama as at this kind of show. Alessandro Pesci, the director of photography, does an excellent job with the images he has achieved. <br /> <br /> Elio Germano, a young Italian actor, is the best of the film. He is playing against more experienced players, but he can convince us that he is the idealist of youth trying to get justice to what he perceives to be a noble cause. The great Daniel Auteuil is a Napoleon more subjugated than one might expect from the interpretation of one of this man greater than life. Monica Belucci is Martino's love interest, but she has little to do. Omero Antonutti plays Fontanelli.
