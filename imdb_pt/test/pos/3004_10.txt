I would give this television series a further 10 if I could. The writers were "full of" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show. These characters were so real. It can be said that of the two main actresses, Mrs. Toussaint and Mrs. Potts, that their relationship with the camera was genuine, it is not over when you hear those familiar words "Cut" at the end of a "take." The program has given me a lot of thought about life for example Historical struggles, tragedies and triumphs, relationships, everyday situations, every home has the same situations, no matter who the members, really summed up to be a wonderful family show that, at the end of each episode, you can simply sit on your couch in the living room and say to yourself "now what I learned from this particular episode." <br /> <br /> I must say that I recorded most of the episodes and I see myself watching them over and over again. /> <br /> Now you know why I gave a 10+ !!
