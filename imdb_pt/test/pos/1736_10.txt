I seriously appreciate Dr. Who. <br /> <br /> Seriously, do not give me just like a "science fiction person" because I'm not normally. I got it because a friend got me when they started watching. It's really very funny and, most often, it's fast. My whole family watches very well and this is a miracle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Ecclestion is very good, but David Tennant is brilliant. I think it's because he made the Doctor so manic and it's cool to have a little eccentricity in a TV character again. <br /> <br /> I do not know what it's about, but everything can work like clockwork. <br /> <br /> All I'll say is just try. One episode (probably best if you do not pick the second half of a two-parter, though).
