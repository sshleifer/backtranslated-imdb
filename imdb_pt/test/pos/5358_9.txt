Wallace and Gromit are the main characters in some of the best cartoons ever created. The excellent mix of visual humor and claymation makes "A Great Day Out," "The Wrong Trousers," and also "A Close Shave," some of the best animated images ever on television. Winning several Oscars and also numerous other awards, Nick Park has become a popular man in the UK, but his impact in the United States has not been great. After the third short of Wallace and Gromit, there was all this speculation about a feature film of Wallace and Gromit, although for years nothing happened. Then in 2000, instead of a feature film by Wallace and Gromit, we have another brilliant claymation film by Nick Park, which was Chicken Run, which was almost nominated for best picture at the Oscars. Perhaps it was the success of this film that finally led Park to finally work on a project by Wallace and Gromit. <br /> <br /> 5 years later (this kind of film takes a lot) and much anticipation, Wallace and Gromit finally reach the big screen. Despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign, this movie is offered in many ways. This movie will be a delight for children and parents. With tons of adult humor hidden under the brilliant animation, Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit is one of the few movies that manages to attract both children and adults alike. This very difficult technique is one that only Pixar has perfected and DreamWorks has had many problems lately. Although the DreamWorks logo has been included in the poster, this film is primarily from the creative team of Aardman Animations. Wallace and Gromit are seen for the first time running a business that protects the city's crops from being ruined by rabbits, which apparently were running around wildly and in large numbers lately. Their business gave them a lot of respect for the others living in the city because a gigantic vegetable contest was fast approaching and the plantations needed protection. Complications arise when Wallace tries to manipulate the rabbits to dislike vegetables and then a large eating machine is unleashed in the area. It is up to Wallace and Gromit to find the gigantic animal and prevent it from eating through gardens and also its approval of the people of the city. To add to this, Wallace wants to impress Lady Tottington, who also drew the attention of a snobby pretender by the name of Victor. Simple plot, yes, but there's more than that, be prepared for some fun surprises along the way, as in the other Wallace and Gromit cartoons. <br /> <br /> In animated films with little dialogue, it is the animation that has to set the pace and mood of the film. Although it takes 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of footage, the payoff is fantastic. There is a huge amount of detail that requires more than one visualization to actually notice. Even more incredible than the detailed and almost perfect animation is the truly unspeakable amount of visual humor put into the film. Whether it's a creatively laid shot or normal labels placed in the most fun possible position, or are the adorable rabbits that are constantly shown in the film, most of the moods of Curse of the Were-Rabbit come strictly from just watching the movie. itself and pick up all the references before it's too late. Imagine the movie Madagascar, except some references to pop culture and less animation. <br /> <br /> The cast was great, although in a film with little dialogue was not so important. Peter Sallis, once again, does a wonderful job as Wallace, although in this film there were no citations that could be used at any time (The Wrong Trousers: "They are the wrong Gromit pants, and they went wrong!"). Ralph Fiennes does a superb job, as villain Victor and also Helena Bonham Carter (known as the female lead in the hit "Fight Club") lends her beautiful voice while she plays Wallace's love interest. Although nothing could overcome the final chase in "The Wrong Trousers," Curse of the Ware-Rabbit had many action scenes, including a fantastically made chase scene between Gromit and Victor's evil dog. Last but not least, rabbits actually steal the show in a few moments. Whether it's their cute expressions, their funny moves, or their howls, the rabbits in the movie still take away some of the glory of the main stars. The funniest rabbit in the movie is the rabbit himself "cursed", by the end of the movie he made the audience roll. <br /> <br /> In short: Although not as memorable as "The Wrong Trousers," this movie is as good and fun as the Chicken Run. Unlike most movies that will be released this year, The film does not drag, with only 85 minutes of duration, but containing much joy and fun, will leave everyone watching for more. , decent and bland, which yielded a surprising amount of money earlier this year (40-year-old Virgin, Wedding Crashers and Sin City) and for families and those who want harmless. the best animated film to be released this year and among the best we've seen in this decade. Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit: totally harmless fun from the second to the second 5.100.
