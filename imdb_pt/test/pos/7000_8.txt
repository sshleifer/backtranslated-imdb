Let me waste a moment of your time to explain how I approached this film. I dismissed the trailers right away because the movie appeared to be an unprocessed remake of Aliens, which I consider one of the weaker films in the Alien series. Stupidly continuing to dismiss the film after I have heard positive things about him from people whose opinions I trust, I completely lost the theatrical performance. I then got hooked on Farscape, on the 3rd or 4th season at the time, and I found Pitch Black on the cable one night at bedtime - so I said "oh, why not, at least have Claudia Black in it." Soon, I recognized Keith David, and I began to realize that Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, and Cole Hauser could act (why should this surprise me, I do not know). I was captivated. I have now been captivated for four years. I watched the movie for the 3rd or 4th time, and I still love it. <br /> <br /> This is not an art film, not an independent one, and it is not entirely original, but where it fails to break a movie. very new terrain, he manages to provide interesting and realistic characters, hard action in the midst of a compelling yet simple plot, and non-stop entertainment; an absolutely gorgeous environment with tasteful special effects. It sounds too good to be true? Do not take my word for it ... see for yourself. <br /> <br /> The film also highlighted the charisma of the now somewhat iconoclastic Vin Diesel, introducing Richard Riddick's character. Diesel would continue to star in the Riddick-ulous Chronicles (which I also liked, though recognizing its huge flaws) and is now kind of a legend. Diesel is so charismatic, so great and so interesting to see that it is easy to ignore the fact that he is not only a talented but also intelligent actor. Checking out the DVD version of Pitch Black, with audio commentary, can wipe you out. <br /> <br /> The movie is about the crew of a inter-system transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after an accident. landing where his captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced but brilliant and heroic (Mitchell), but she is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities - a bounty hunter with secrets (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered to see in the dark (Diesel). That is all? Of course not - the planet is inhabited, and the inhabitants are hungry. <br /> <br /> As simple and improbable as that is, Pitch Black is beautifully filmed, well told and very well executed. Do not expect to learn anything, and do not expect to have to think hard, but expect to have fun with this modern sci-fi action classic.
