Featuring some incredible and wonderful characters, a new mythology, superbly designed and executed scenarios, Nightbreed is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the lack of a well-known lead actor led the film to find obscurity. Perhaps the director's homosexuality has also led the film to be unconsciously censored by the white audience the film criticizes. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film is a treasure of the monster / superhero genre. A sequence with Highlander style flashbacks for different times in history would be interesting. <br /> <br /> Another idea would be the basis of the new Midian. Maybe in Texas somewhere or in the Louisiana marshes with crocodile men and a traveling traveling circus.
