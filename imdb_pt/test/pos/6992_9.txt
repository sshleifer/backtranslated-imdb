People who thought it was more sucked than the black hole that swallowed EVENT HORIZON probably did not see the movie that spawned Vin Diesel's skinhead killer, and probably have no intention of doing so. Too bad, because BLACK PITCH actually kicks ass big. Directed by veteran genius David Twohy, (WARLOCK and the excellent but underrated BELOW) and written by brothers Jim and Ken Wheat (LIES, SILENT SCREAM), PITCH BLACK begins with a prologue 'ALIEN'. When a cargo freighter / combination passenger is badly damaged by a meteor shower (in which the captain is also killed), co-pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell of SILENT HILL) has an important decision to make: cargo or passengers? Close to picking ore over the occupants, the forced landing deflects its final course of action. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, because the catastrophic landing was done on a rock that once portends a mining colony. Among the survivors are two settlers, Shazza (Claudia Black of FARSCAPE) and Zeke (John Moore); an Imam (Keith David) and his young followers (can you say "red shirts" boys and girls?); an antique dealer named Paris Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald); a "little boy" named Jack (Rhianna Griffith), and the group's most controversial members: a Marshall named Johns (the lush Cole Hauser) and his prisoner ... a dangerous killer named Riddick (Diesel). <br /> <br /> As group dynamics unfold, it does much of the dramatic tension, especially with concerns about Riddick and how many people he can slice and play if he runs away. But no one here comes out alive, as the saying goes, and the greatest twists have less to do with how they are given, than how they will survive when they discover the unthinkable. They are not alone on the planetoid. Things that are hungry, clawing, and fast are sneaking right where they can not be seen, living in the dark where they can survive and thrive. They want the meat of the newcomers to quench their appetite, but they can not go out into the daylight to seek food. <br /> <br /> Does the phrase "total eclipse" make things a little more interesting? ? You bet. Hence the title more than appropriate. <br /> <br /> Vin, more monosyllabic than Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry on his dirtiest day, dripping more testosterone than sweat, has a picnic here with a character who really seems to be worth it. a sequel or two, and Hauser, exuding the threat and bile is as good as his father, Wings, was in villainy on the screen. Surprisingly, though, Mitchell stands and can be as strong and understanding as Fry. You would expect nothing less than a strong demonstration of Black, She Who Once 'Aeryn Sun', and she does not disappoint. (Too bad her role was not bigger, but that's all I'm going to say about it). And David makes his indelible impression as the holy man whose faith will be truly tested in the very well of Hell. <br /> The rhythm moves faster than Riddick sliding behind his prey with a rod in his teeth, and once the darkness descends, terror and tension never diminish, as in other classic science fiction films / terror that it imitates. But if imitation is really the sincerest form of flattery, Dave Twohy and the Wheats deserve great backslaps to hit this one with revenge, and for giving us an end that is anti-Hollywood to the fullest. <br /> <br /> I do not want to ruin the surprises, so I will not say much more, except that if you see CHRONICLES first and do not be too happy, give PITCH BLACK a try. And if you have not seen any of them, definitely start with this one. <br /> <br /> I do not know what Vin is doing right now, but he certainly could do worse than give those guys a chance again. I would love to see what they would dream next ...
