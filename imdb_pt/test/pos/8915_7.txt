Why do I give this 1974 porn movie 7 points? Because I watched. And I found it hilarious! Aliens, your strange spacecraft, your strange helmets ... God, that was a vision. And all these desperate alien women need is semen from Earth. <br /> <br /> And where do they look for it? In Upper Bavaria, Germany. And that's where the main fun comes from: in Europe (and even more so in the German-speaking countries), Bavaria is seen as a traditional, backward region. And so the actors are so helpless with the alien women. Well, there have been movies about people being unable to deal with women like the "American Pie" series. <br /> <br /> But what this movie achieved is a true and funny strangeness. You constantly wonder how they created these crazy ideas. But it was in 1974, and looking back 35 years fills one with a kind of nostalgia. You've never seen a movie like that. <br /> <br /> And if you do not mind seeing casual pubic hair and hairs, watch it once. It's essentially a comedy, not a porn movie.
