The tomb robber is sitting in his cell, waiting for the execution to be visited by a monk who wishes to knock down his last words to posterity and as a warning to others of the horrible life he leads. At first reluctant, but with the tongue unleashed by the drink, the young grave robber is soon telling his story, which is full of dead, undead and things that come at night. New New York City horror film (filmed partly on Staten Island, which undoubtedly brought the spirit of Andy Milligan on the prowl) is one of the best horror comedies that have surfaced for a while. This is an often very funny movie that just spins its story in every way. The cast is first rate. Dominic Monaghan plays Arthur Blake the tomb robber telling his story. Ron Perlman is Father Duffy, the monk who takes the statement and perhaps gets too involved in the story. Both men are clearly having a great time and this shows. The rest of the cast is equally good. The music of Jeff Grace is excellent. The effects are perfect for this kind of macabre nonsense. The movie is a lot of fun. If there is any problem with the movie, then maybe it throws some of your network so that the result has a lot going on. I do not want to give too much, but I did not think we needed the alien body in the mix. Still, this is a lot of fun and it's great that I'm going to revisit IFC in theaters where I first saw it, and later I'm sure I'll get the DVD. <Br/> <br /> It's worth a look.
