I always thought that Batman Returns was a great sequel to Batman. The story was interesting and Danny Devito, Christopher Walken and Micheal Keaton gave great performances. Also, let's face it, Tim Burton was a genius and made the comic character more justice than Joel Screwmacher ever did. Oswald Cobblepot also known as The Penguin (played by Danny Devito) is abandoned by his parents as a child for being deformed. He uses it as an excuse to mask a sinister plot to kidnap Gotham-born children with the help of his Red Triangle Gang and a very somber tycoon, Max Shreck. Max Shreck later makes Penguin the mayor of Gotham. Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is pushed out the window by Max Shreck and is revived by cats. Later, she develops cat qualities and seeks to destroy Max Shreck and Batman. His reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained. <br /> <br /> Opinion: Batman Returns is a classic. It has a darker feel in terms of atmosphere. Tim Burton has always had a way of making dark plans look attractive. Micheal Keaton is still keen as Batman. Danny Devito steals the show as Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin. When you think about it, he would have made a better Violator for the movie Spawn than John Leguizamo. Michelle Pfeiffer gave Catwoman more personality than Halle Berry ever got. Max Shreck is one of the best roles of Christopher Walken. The main reason I like Batman Returns is that it's fun. It's not just creative, but it's also fun. Something very large budget movies these days lack a lot. The Batman series goes to the dogs after Tim Burton has decided to do nothing else. You do not believe me, look at Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Thank God Christopher Nolan gave life back to the series with Batman Begins.
