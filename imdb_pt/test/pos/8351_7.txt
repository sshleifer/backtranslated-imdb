* smaller spoilers * You know, it's getting to the point where Walt Disney Television Animation could also be called Walt Disney Sequel Animation. These sequences range from excellent ("Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas" and the fantastic "Lion King II: The Pride of Simba") to the horrible ("The Return of Jafar"). (This is, of course, my personal opinion.) Now Disney brings us its latest sequel. "Adventure Scamp" and although it is flawed, it is still fun. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is not up to Disney Feature Animation; Still, the animators do a good job of bringing the characters to life. Lady and Tramp has not aged a day since 1955. Trusty still talks about her nose and "Ol 'Trusted," and Jock still gives her grief about it. There's a legal fight between Tramp and a huge dog in the dog's pound, and once again we're presented with a spaghetti dinner with the two romantic tracks (although it's highly doubtful that this becomes a classic scene like its predecessor). /> <br /> I really do not care about most of the songs (although Roger Bart and Susan Egan - the singing voices of Scamp and Angel - sing very well). Melissa Manchester and Norman Gimbel have done a much better job in the past. Danny Troob's score is good, but nothing memorable. And part of the junkyard gang looks like an excess of luggage; that is, they really do not do much. <br /> <br /> Voice work, on the other hand, is very good. While I do not like Jeff Bennett as the dogcatcher, he is very good as Tramp. Chazz Palminteri does a good job as Buster, the junkyard gang leader, and Alyssa Milano gives what may be her best performance as Angel. Then there is the Scamp (which is the image of his father). He is voiced for PERFECTION by Scott Wolf. Wolf does a great job of showing the wild side of Scamp and his soft side. <br /> <br /> In short, while the "Scamp Adventure" is flawed, it's still quite a fun sight. It is my hope, however, that Walt Disney Television Animation turns its attention to the most original material for its future releases. <br /> <br />
