Haruhi Suzumiya's melancholy is based on a little of now Japanese school drama anime pat formula. The formula goes something like this: 1. The main protagonist comes from the outside world of normal society and has superpowers. <br /> <br /> 2. There is a very beautiful and sexy girl in a supporting role. <br /> <br /> 3. A normal character is there, who shares the leading role in the story. <br /> <br /> 4. Unusual things happen in usual social environments. <br /> <br /> 5. Sometimes the story is about the main protagonist and the normal character that connects to the existence or destruction of the world. <br /> <br /> 6. Absolutely no effort is expended by anyone to gain all the magical powers. They just have it. <br /> <br /> 7. Normally, people outside this rigid group are not aware of their superpowers, and carry on with their daily lives. <br /> <br /> So you have it. Suzumiya Haruhi's Melancholy is made along these lines that have become the success formula for comics and anime in Japan. Despite following a pat formula, the series is superbly crafted and the episodes are always placed in an interesting retreat within the social settings normal, which always turn into unusual circumstances around Haruhi Suzumiya. Each player in the story brings an unusual view of everyday life that we do not normally know. The philosophical twist of his insights is what makes this series more fun. The visuals are top notch and done beautifully. <br /> <br /> The crazy ideas that Haruhi always seems to have, along with complicated scenarios in the story, can cause headaches from time to time. It is further complicated by the fact that the episodes are thrown out of sequence, which further increases the confusion. When I watched the episodes in chronological order, some of the plot finally made sense. I recommend you do the same. It's much more fun to watch the series that way.

And oh, you can notice the headache while you're watching it like I did. Let me know if you had too.
