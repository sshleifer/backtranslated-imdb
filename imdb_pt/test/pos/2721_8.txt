After Mrs. E of Mr. Iyer, this is another very good film made by Aparna sen (mostly in English). In the previous film, she dealt with a contemporary political environment and its effects on individuals. In this film is the impact of the family member with mental disability and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub-theme, it deals with a philosophical concept about "reality." It's a film that leads to thinking after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Mithee's younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, daughter of Aparna Sen) is suffering from schizophrenia being cared for by the ruling older sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi). Mithee after her marriage to Jojo and his separation believes that she is still with JOJO and her five children at 15 Park Avenue in Kolkotta (there is no such address in Kolkotta, it seems there is one in New York) and she is intense in her belief. It's almost like an intense religious belief. Ultimately, what is reality? In one scene, she tells Anjali "if I say you are not a teacher, but imagine you are a teacher." The open ending reflects this reality. On a quest supposedly for his house on Park Avenue, Mithee is lost. The penultimate scene is Mithee looking at a group of five children playing and she looking at them with joy of returning to her family and then she is lost. On this concept of reality, I remember another fifty-year-old film called HARRY with James Stewart. The protagonist believes that a large rabbit (?), Called Harry, is always with him and is always talking to him. In the end, even the doctor thinks there might be Harry. What's the reality, is what the protagonist believes or what others believe that Shabhna Azmi dominates the film with her excellent performance as the strong older sister with a tendency of frustration. Konkana Sen Sharma offers performance equally worthy of schizophrenia. <br /> <br /> However, the film is not as strict as Mrs. And Mr. Iyer. There seem to be some loose ends. And maybe there are many characters. Those who want a closed end may not appreciate the open end here. But the end coexists with the theme of the film. <br /> <br /> Another good film by Aparana sen.
