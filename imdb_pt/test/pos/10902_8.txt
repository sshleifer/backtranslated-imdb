After reading the comment made about this movie, and currently watching it, I can understand how the person felt about it. The decisions made were after hearing common sense. When the movie came out, I had heard the information on how it happened. The plot was made from a real event. During an awards show, an actor, thanking people, awarded the prize to a former school teacher, unexpectedly handing over the person. <br /> <br /> Of course many people come out of the closet most every day. Each ride is different for each person. In real life, the outcome of any individual will also be different. And the willingness to accept who they are is the most important thing in life to achieve personal happiness. For those around you, joy and honest acceptance can make life much more complete. For the film, the result of how Howard is overcome is far more comical than real life. And community acceptance showed others that Howard was himself and nothing more. <br /> <br /> Overall, the performances were crazy. Memorable quotes and the use of music increase the stereotypes in the world, but with tongue and cheek humor. It's a movie. Sit down, watch with an open mind and laugh at your head.
