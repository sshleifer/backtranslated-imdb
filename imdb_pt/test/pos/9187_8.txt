This movie was not about stereotypes, or dance moves, or catchment lines, actually. This movie was about the vulnerability of people's hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play a convincing role, that Will Smith could satisfy without action, and that such a banal genre of cinema could succeed in such a way. I do not intend to sound very affectionate with this movie - it was not "groundbreaking" anyway - but it was a movie worth seeing. Was it believable? No. New York could not be so simple and there was no human being in the history of mankind who had Hitch's "hutzpah." Of course, there are bar-studs, but not those that can have any girl at any time - excluding those with seven digits, of course. The thing that worked best for this movie was its true focus on the dramatic side of things, not just comedy. It was two funny hours, no doubt. But it was also two hours that made you sit in your seat, get immersed in the characters and smile.
