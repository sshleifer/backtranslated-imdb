Someone interested in how the black cinema was in the 70s, watch this movie. Some of the dialogue in this movie is so funny ie the summary of my presentation. Also watch out for the boom microphone appear in some scenes as well as some of the best karate actions of all time. Do not take this movie seriously or you will be disappointed, enter with an open mind and enter the world of one of the craziest in the world Dolemite !!! The wise edition is set up as if it had been cut with a razor but again this movie is so much more than what you see in the movie that influenced the black community in ways you can not understand !!!
