I rarely participate in films about smart teenagers who have problems with authority, but "Toy Soldiers" has grown in me with repeated views. This is both a movie about Billy Tepper growing up and becoming an adult as much as anything else, and I credit Sean Astin and writer / director Daniel Petrie Jr. that they do not do much of that, but let that happen unfold and move in you. The camaraderie of Tepper's friends, his sadness over Joey's death and his joy at survival, are all genuinely moving. And I have to admit, I take some patriotic (and perhaps slightly reptilian) joy when the US Army guys finally move and rightly kick some narco-terrorist ass. Ooh-rah, General Kramer! And the heroic score of Robert Folk is the cherry on top. I'm sure I could find a hundred reasons for not liking "Toy Soldiers," but as long as we do not take it seriously, I see no need. This is one of the most fun "bad" movies in my pantheon.
