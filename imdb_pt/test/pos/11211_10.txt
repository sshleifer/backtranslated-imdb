I am very grateful that the small university town of Abingdon, Va.- near Bristol, TN. and home to the famous Barter Theater where Gregory Peck once performed - got an art film festival to gather and show this film there. Abingdon is two hours and one hour from where I live, but the trip was worth it in every sense of the word. UZAK / DISTANT is an incredible, brilliant, shocking, emotional and captivating film. As a Turk-American, this film was not just a testament to what life is like in Turkey; but on a larger scale he tells the world what it's like to be Turkish, whether in Istanbul, Berlin, Montreal, New York or Omaha. It can take two hours instead of five minutes, but that's actually our Bob Marley song. There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie. It is very difficult to choose just a few random ones. But for me, a revealing scene happens in a cinema in Beyoglu (central Istanbul). The title character, played by Mehmet Emin Toprak, who unfortunately died in a car accident shortly after the film's conclusion, follows a very attractive young woman down a ladder to the main auditorium of the cinema. She enters "Vanilla Sky". As the image of Tom Cruise is reflected from a glass, we feel that Turkish men are competing with Tom Cruise for the affections of their own women, even if Tom Cruise is nowhere in Beyoglu. The scenes filmed on the banks of the Bosphorus are also quite revealing because they symbolize the beauty, but the empty and desperate gulfs, which are a painful fact of life in Turkey. In this film, the gulf separates lovers and families. A simple empty package of Samsun (Turkish brand) cigarettes and a dying mouse jump off the screen like the seagulls did in 1982 in the film Serif Goren-Yilmaz Guney "Yol." Many of Guney's films, including "Yol", "Suru-the-Herd" (1978- completed by Zeki Okten) and "Baba-O Pai" (1971) were considered by many to be the best Turkish films ever made. Without Guney's often exaggerated social-political rage (especially in his last film, the 1983 presidential drama "Duvar-The Wall"), "Distance" captures the essence of Turkish life remarkably. This is a great feat for a director who, in my view, can already be proclaimed as the Turkish equivalent to directors like Tarkovsky, Bresson and Ozu. I can not wait to see your other movies!
