This is the middle drawing of the three (between Rabbit and Duck! Rabbit, Duck!) And it's the weakest of the three, although it's still pretty funny. It just depends on a joke for a lot of the action. It's still a good cartoon. I feel a definite sympathy for Daffy, who is rare to me. Daffy is so overcome that it almost becomes painful to watch at times. Good cartoon in a great series. Recommended.
