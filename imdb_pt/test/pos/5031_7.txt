Although this movie does not stand out particularly from the movie crowd, it's still a very good movie to sit on and watch with your feet up! There are perhaps one or two strange mistakes you notice, and the movies are a bit sloppy, the movie itself is very nice and has a wonderful atmosphere. The music contributes a lot to the mood of the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is nevertheless impressive (especially the dog he is!), with John Travolta taking over the lead of the entertaining Michael. Other characters feel very genuine and do very well in the film. <br /> <br /> So, after a long day of work, put "Michael" at night with an ice cream and enjoy a quality movie. own right :)
