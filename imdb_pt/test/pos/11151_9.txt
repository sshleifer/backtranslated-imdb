From a bare description of the main elements of THE TOLL GATE plot, one might think that it is a revisionist Western from the 60s or 70s. Our hero is a thief, murderer and arsonist; <br /> <br /> * love interest is a single mother whose husband without turns abandoned her and her child; <br /> <br /> * Twice our criminal hero is "unofficially" released by the authorities in exchange for some good deed, and this is presented as a commendable act; <br /> <br /> * The only acts that are presented as truly evil are the betrayal of one's own family and the betrayal of an associated criminal; <br /> <br /> * The hero tries to go straight, but turns to a life of crime after he does not get a job. ; <br /> <br /> * the hero is running from the power of a sheriff and a criminal gang; <br /> <br /> * The hero's ultimate redemption is accomplished by strangling a man with his own hands and throwing his body on a cliff; and the "good bad man" ends the movie by sending the young mother and her son back to civilization and leaving alone for the Mexican desert, never (presumably) to pay for their life of crime. <br /> <br /> It just goes to show you that there is nothing new under the sun. <br /> <br /> Of course THE TOLL GATE does not exhibit the cynicism or moral nihilism of its successors: the hero's redemption is established when he surrenders to the pack after reading a passage from the Bible. I can not imagine Clint Eastwood doing that. The DEMONSTRATION GATE is an excellent movie of any standard, and Hart was a great actor, not given to the great histrionics that are used to convey emotion these days. before the sound. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
