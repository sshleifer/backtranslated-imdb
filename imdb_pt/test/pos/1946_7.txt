Although I expected me to like it a little more, this was still certainly an impressive movie. There were great performances from all the protagonists, and the story, although not what I would call chill, was still effective and kept me interested. For me, the best part of this film was the image's appearance, as it always seemed cool and damp and seemed to really fit the movie well. I also thought the low budget suited this film, because I do not think a clear image and a clear sound would have worked so well in such a dark film. All things considered, it fell a little short of my expectations, but I'm still very happy to finally have sat down to watch this movie.
