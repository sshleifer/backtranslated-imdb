DRIVING LESSONS is a little movie that infiltrates you. What at first seems to be a bit of fluffy and meaningless comedy The British style is at the base of a very good story about the arrival of age and the significant friendship needs of young and old. Writer Jeremy Brock ("Mrs. Brown," "Charlotte Gray," "The Last King of Scotland") directs his own script and the result is a cohesive and progressive tale, filled with fascinating and diverse characters played by famous actors. . Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint, standing alone as a developing actor in the Harry Potter series) is a quiet, simple little poet of 17 who lives with his father-bird Father Vicar (Nicholas Farrell) and his obsessive compulsive and rigid evangelical mother (Laura Linney) in a house where "needy people," such as Mr. Fincham's (Jim Norton) transvestite killer, take precedence over family matters: the mother is having an affair with Father Peter Oliver Milburn), using Ben as the cover! Sad Ben is among other things trying to learn how to drive a car. Your mother is a poor teacher and you decide that you need professional classes and you need to get a job to help pay for poor Mr. Fincham's needs. Ben follows an advertisement and meets Dame Eve Walton (Julie Walters), an elderly actress who is as crazy as any character ever created. She hires Ben and the fireworks begin. Through a series of incidents, including a camping trip that Evie demands, the two learn the missing life lessons in each other's nature: Ben learns self-esteem and self-confidence and Evie finds a true friend who will allow him to leave his fa√ßade and be the dear human being she has hidden. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters, always offering the best abilities to act on all the characters she creates, finds a role like no other here: she is strangely savage and lovable. Rupert Grint is exactly the right choice for Ben's challenged maturing. The chemistry between the two is as tender as that of the classic movie 'Harold and Maude'. Laura Linney is, as always, an excellent actress who plays a very different role from her usual repertoire. And the supporting cast is a picture of refined characterizations. This film is a delightful surprise and is sure to warm the heart and entertain those who love good writing and direction and acting - and message! Grady Harp
