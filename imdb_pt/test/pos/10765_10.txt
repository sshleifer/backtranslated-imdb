I was lucky enough to see this at this Tribeca film festival. I was shocked at how well done and fun this wonderful little movie was. Director Griffin Dunne has done a great job putting together this movie that has several characters and several story lines that blend so smoothly and seamlessly. The main story involves the family and is a very thought-provoking and entertaining story that engulfed the viewer in every scene. The film as a whole has credibility and integrity, but it still has that commercial advantage - an indie movie for the masses if you want. The performances of the cast are excellent, but it is Diane Lane who shines the most. Diane Lane is simply sensational in this wonderful film and must be nominated for an Oscar. Early days I know, but Lane acts his socks here.
