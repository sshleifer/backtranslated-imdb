I consider this a breathtaking film, but misleading because it seems so simple and straightforward: a survivor from Vietnam tells his harrowing story and part of the story is reenacted on the spot. Reviewers sometimes even claim that Herzog's presence in the film is minimal, but how are they wrong. We know that all documentaries are "mediated" to some degree and this has Herzog's subtle hand everywhere, especially in the dizzying music, the incredibly specialized selection of archive images and the management of cascading images. The evocative power of this film is startling, beginning with its title, opening letter from the book of "Revelation," and the opening narration. This is a movie that you can watch over and over again with increasing admiration, not just a commodity that is swallowed up with someone's favorite drink on the way to the evening news. This is one of those movies that may resonate with you for a lifetime.
