Joe (Wes) and Jim (Adam) tell us the beauty, the isolation (psychological and physical) and the absolute terror of "killing most birds" in southwest Navajo. Characterizations, configurations and plot construct continuously. even if sometimes personal aspects leave us wanting "more" ... with some interesting alternative alternatives to "who did it?" Flashbacks (eg, Peter Fonda ... good to see you) provide clues but they do not go where you think. The comedic asides (for example, the preacher) are gentle and appropriate. Where "Skinwalkers" and "Coyote Waits" begin to drag ... "Thief" involves the clutch and the four wheels at the next bend, not sure what is there. I disagree with Joe Leaphorn's manic commentary on Jim Chee to "slow down" the holes. Wrong ... there are no holes in the plot, just tracks to follow. For the next episode! Great photography (as always), cute characters and more to explore!
