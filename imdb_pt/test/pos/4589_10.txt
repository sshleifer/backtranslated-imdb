Most people do not know that this movie exists. Fox, who paid the judge to do it, kept it in the tin for a long time and then spent nothing to promote it. I think a lot of people thought it was one of the junk movies being released in late summer. Well, I'm here to tell you that this is a funny and rather scary look at a future that is not so hard to believe. Basically, the judge presents the notion that stupid people are outdoing the smart ones by a wide margin. So these stupid people are getting more stupid, basically spending all the time watching TV and having sex, which produces more stupid people. Around 2,500, a person of average intelligence today, will look like a genius, who speaks "every pet." Seriously, this is really hard to believe. Oh, of course, this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid, but still plausible. Luke Wilson is great as the time-traveling guy, desperately trying to get back to a more comfortable time. Where this story will gain its worship status is with countless funny remarks such as "we may be familiar with it" and "hey guy, I'm waiting" here! "This is a funny movie and a very clear social commentary on an American society that seems to be passionate about pleasure, comfort and stupidity, and I guarantee that I will buy it on DVD the first day it appears and watch it. .
