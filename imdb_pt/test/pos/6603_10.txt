My son, an avid skater, sat me down and made me watch this with him. Since I love documentaries, it did not take a lot of pressure from him. All the incredible story of all this - a bunch of poor land boys come together and end up creating something revolutionary in the air - well, more wood, wheels and lack of waves to surf - that only impressed me. Still do. I did not think I would like the way I liked it, nor did I think I would stop watching Stacey Peralta cry over Jay Adams' fate. And just watching Jay Adams himself ... the pure genius of the child skating and shrugging the adult memory. I watched again last night for what has to be the tenth time and I still shiver seeing him fly downhill with Jimi Hendrix's "Freedom" ringing in the background. And I cried again. Not many movies have the same impact on me after several shows. Bright.
