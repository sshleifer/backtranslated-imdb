The food always makes a good topic in the movies, as "Chocolat" showed. "Babette's Feast" is the same sort of thing. Babette Harsant (Stephane Audran) is a French cook who escapes from her homeland after the repression of 1871. She moves to a very religious Danish village. The people in this village simply have no use for joy. That is, until Babette prepares one of their delicious meals. <br /> <br /> It's not just because this movie is about bringing fun to a place you've never met. Like other Scandinavian films (and non-Hollywood movies in general), this shows that a film can capture your interest without the use of explosions, car chases, etc. This is a movie you can not miss. <Br /> <br /> One more thing. Do you think the Danish word for "party" sounds a bit like "palate"?
