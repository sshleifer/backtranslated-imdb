In 2004, I wrote the following statements on a IMDb message board when a user wondered if the Best Years of Our Lives was a forgotten movie: <br /> <br /> For me, watching this movie is like opening a capsule of time. I think in many ways "The Best Years of Our Lives" is probably one of the most fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the US in the mid-1940s after World War II. I believe that "Coming Home" and "The Deer Hunter," both released in 1978, were the most recent films that were the closest to capturing the countless war-returning military issues that were created in "The Best Years of Our Lives" . What really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when I was in college around 1980-81 and many, if not all, college students applauded at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie still packs and I'm very happy to read in other posts other users feeling about a movie that will definitely stand the test of time. ***** <br/> <br/> I am very happy to see the movie rated close to the top 100 films of IMDb and AFI. In addition, although it was in competition with what eventually became a Christmas classic, it's a wonderful life, no doubt, the Oscars of the Best Years of Our Life, including that of Best Picture, were well-deserved. <br /> <br /> I just saw the movie again in 2005 and, after nearly 60 years, the Best Years of Our Life are still a powerful, beautifully rendered and well-crafted film.
