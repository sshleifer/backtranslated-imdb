I just saw Monster Man yesterday. It was a long wait and after much anticipation and development, I am happy to say that it came and met my expectations on all levels. True, you really can not expect much from listening to the rundown of the plot, but after reading some of the comments to it, I was ecstatic. I mean, what the junk fan would not want to see a bloody movie about a blood-sucking madman driving people crazy with his makeshift monster truck? I expected a cross between Road Trip and The Hills Have Eyes and got much more. This was a horror comedy that really worked. The filmmakers got it right when it comes to making you squirm and make you howl at the same time. Many compliments to Michael Davis for doing everything with the blood and pushing the envelope with the sickly humor. Let me list just a few reasons why I love this film so much: first, it's the story. It was made to death in so many other films. A college student learns that his childhood passion is getting married. He, being the 25-year-old virgin he is, jumps on his Vista Cruiser and decides to make the journey to confess his love, hoping that she will fall headlong into hills and all the best. Hidden in the backseat of his truck is good friend Harley. Harley is the ex-friend who laughs and talks like Jack Black in High Fidelity. You can not help but like the guy, but if he was your friend in real life, you would have to keep a whiffle ball stick at hand (laugh as much as you want but have you ever been hit by one?) To keep him in check So he's a bit on the nasty side, to say the least, but you can tell he's a loyal friend, deep down ... Anyway, they're on the road and when they stop at a bar, they aggravate the places . Now they are being chased by a leather clone in a monster truck. That's it. Yeah, along the way they get a gorgeous ride, but I'm too lazy and hangover to get into it now ... so just watch the damn movie. <br /> <br /> The second thing I love was humor. This had some of the sickest laughs of any movie since Cabin Fever. How spoiled is that? Well, I'm not even going to get into the whole cat scene and as for the "burrito corpse," I'll leave it to your virgin eyes as well. The bar full of amputees was a little disturbing and that guy who looked like John Turturro also bothered me. Harley, despite being a totally frivolous type of fraternity boys, can actually take off the linings. Love the clogs, by the way. I need a new pair .. <br /> <br /> O GORE. This pours over heavy. As the first hour unfolds like a demented road comedy, the last third is all about blood and courage. If the film did not keep such a light tone, it would be a little disturbing, but seeing how everything was played for laughter, there's no way you'd bother with it. If you're still in place by the time you get there, you'll probably see the humor as well, but seriously, there were buckets and buckets of red stuff. There was a big plot that I did not see coming and when the credits rolled, I was completely satisfied. I had gotten exactly what I came in and I am so glad that I bought it. Much like Cabin Fever, it will take a lot of replay. <br /> <br /> The look of the movie was excellent. There was a deliberately cheap look that made the whole thing scream in the late 80's and I loved the exaggerated colors. It's obvious that Monster Man was made on a relatively low budget, but very much like the Cabin Fever (sorry, I keep comparing the two), it really works in favor of the movie. Cabin Fever was an ode to the great musicians of the 70's, this was the response of the 80's to that. So take this for what it's worth. No CGI here. That's what we all needed. I do not know exactly why a theatrical version was not released, because that's all the Jeepers Creepers should have been. Thank God for the Lions Gate.
