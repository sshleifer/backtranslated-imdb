I'll start by saying that I've always been Bonnie Hunt's fan ... She always adds life to any character she plays, and she did a wonderful job of directing. <br /> <br /> I have to admit this is a girls' movie ... But having this in mind, it's a wonderful story that touches on many emotions and causes all kinds of reactions. <br /> <br /> This movie portrays real life as people with real life. such as situations. (I have to delete the coincidence that is the main part of the movie) <br /> <br /> It's a love story .. not just a man and a woman, but the love of family, friends and loved past. (Even pets). <br /> <br /> I really liked it. It is worth the rent or the purchase.
