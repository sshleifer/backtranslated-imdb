This is the classic Disney in his best live action cartoon! Clumsy college student Dexter Riley (Kurt Russell) develops a mysterious net invisibility formula that really makes objects disappear and helps him save his college with no money. Later experiments reveal that it works incredibly well on humans too! Riley's surprising discovery brings some hilarious twists when a gang of thugs led by the notorious A.J. Arno (Cesar Romero) steals the formula and tries to use it for his less legal activities. Breathtaking special effects and a fast-paced story make this film a classic case of college comedy! I love this movie! This film has always filled me with a sense of wonder and joy. A nice little comedy that the whole family can enjoy. There is not much violence or sex and absolutely no swear words, it makes this a movie that parents can watch with their children. Merely one of a series of Kurt Russell films at Medvale College. A nice little series set in a healthy America before the terrorists, when people valued integrity more than money! I recommend this movie!
