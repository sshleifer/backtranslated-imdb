I saw this movie a few years ago and bought the soundtrack because it was just great. Bacharach's music is captivating and should receive the recognition it deserves. The cinematography is incredible. Critics hated this, but they also hated ALONEIO AT HOME. I did not find it in the video, but I welcome anyone who can find a copy.
