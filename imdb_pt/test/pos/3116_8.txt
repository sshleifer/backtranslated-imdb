The performances of the male protagonists make this long and difficult journey in the West interesting throughout. The soundtrack of the Sons of the Pioneers is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard. The journey itself is somewhat episodic, and Joanne Dru is ill-suited. Overall, this is a very moving and sincere western.
