Oh my God what a story! This movie is very good and it had to be God who had it happen! You did a great job. The acting was very good, you chose the right actors for sure. This movie is so good that I'm really glad you did it because if you had not, I would never have known this story because I'm not a big fan of golf and I think it's kind of annoying, so thank you. I really liked it and that's why I gave the film a 10 \ 10. I liked Shia Labouf also he was perfect for the Fransis Quimet roll. I hope most of the things you put there are also true. Oh, and some parts were funny and some I was very happy.
