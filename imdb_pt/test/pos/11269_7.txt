if you're dating a girl who's in wicca! <br /> <br /> Many parts of this movie were killer and the feeling that you have of this movie while watching and right after that is enough to get lonely with it, but some things really bothered me about this movie that I can not really put the finger on ... <br /> <br /> I definitely think this movie is one that any art student or student of photography should see b / c of the camera style and granulation I've never seen, but that's just it ... it seems like an art student did this and the plot if there is any one is so nervous you really need to be in a lot of drugs to get exactly what's going on
