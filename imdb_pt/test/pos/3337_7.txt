Excellent entry into the RKO Saint series with well written original script, good camera work and transitions, good direction to deal with some plot twists, good editing to keep the flow steady and good acting. George Sanders is gentle and witty. Jonathan Hale is simply Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he can not stand the pressure. It will return in a later entry in the series. The story begins on a transatlantic to the US, where the Saint meets but can not connect with Wendie Barrie. She eventually succumbs to the saint's charms, but she breaks her heart in the end. The Saint helps Inspector Fernack wipe his name from a frame. Some bodies fall along the way. Good entertainment and above average for this type of movie. Watch.
