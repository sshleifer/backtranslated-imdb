I really felt that the film was ahead of its time. The only potential daughter-in-law was a strong, career-oriented woman. She knew what she wanted and was diplomatic, but firm, with her mother-in-law overworked. The role of the mother was played very well (you just loved to hate her). His need to control his son's life was neurotically evil. If you have ever been in a relationship where you have been tried and found to be lacking (and everyone involved knew this) this can hit very close to home. It's been years since I've seen this movie and I remember thinking that this plot and dialogue would work on a 50- or 60-year-old film. It is difficult to watch because of the dynamics of the mother and the children, but I would love to watch again. I keep hoping to find it on one of the old movie channels, but so far no luck. Attempts to buy it were also futile (I can not believe it's on tape or DVD).
