A Western little known and unfamiliar with the colors of the mind (probably the same material used in "Johnny Guitar", I think "Trucolor" or something, causes blood drops to look like shiny rubies), almost surreal scenes with action and characters. Something different, far from being a masterpiece, but more attention should be paid to this little gem in the western encyclopedias.
