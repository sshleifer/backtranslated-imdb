I am a big fan of the $ 5.50 DVD at the local WalMart. I hope you have one at your local branch. You can find a lot of movies, a lot of junk and an occasional surprise. This movie is one of the surprises. My friend recently bought a gift, and thinking it would be another turmoil of laughing kung-fu, I was genuinely surprised at how good it was. I watch a lot of movies and as a result, I can almost always call it like a movie will end; and if there is a plot twist, that will be. Not this movie! The direction is brilliant, the plot is incredible and the fight is incredibly inventive. If you see this sitting somewhere for a cheap price, buy it! If you see it at full price, I would still recommend it.
