A truly accurate and glamorous look in modern life. It could be set in any UK city. <br /> <br /> I live in a housing estate in Glasgow and can relate very well to this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, situations and characters are very realistic, but not predictable. <br /> <br /> The actors are frighteningly believable, I felt like I was spying on my neighbors. It was an intimate dive into the lives of fragile and hopeless people. I was very thrilled with some scenes. <br /> <br /> I loved the way this movie was shot. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a must see.
