Before seeing this photo I was quite skeptical, I do not like movies with an agenda nor do I like to be afraid to think like the writer. I also feared that this was like the two-part "10.4" miniseries, which had an absurd concept, little relation to the real world and a very poor execution. At first it is said: "This film is fiction, but the events portrayed and information on UK emergency planning are based on extensive research"; and the general feeling is that you are not being sold on an idea, but that you are being taught a civil awareness lesson. The message being conveyed is obvious from the start: it's coming and we're not ready. The use of real places and a scenario that not only could happen - There are plans for when this happens - all this increases the disturbing effect that the film will have, even the most cynical viewers. The perspective of the film is that of society and is far from personal moments of heart-breaking, which do not convey the message, then none of Romeu-Juliet's dramas that we are accustomed to.
