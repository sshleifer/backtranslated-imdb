This is another movie in which cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. That would be great if the movie were a travel diary, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematographic art, that is not good enough. The theme of respect and interspecific cooperation timidly ventures into the forbidden world of love between species, but its approach is stereotyped, indicating a lack of understanding of the motives of behavior of both species. As with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative writer. Unfortunately, we'll probably never know.
