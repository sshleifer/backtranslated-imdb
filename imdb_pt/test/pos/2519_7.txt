As much as "The Beginning" showed that we are still going to get x "classic" files, Drive showed that X-Files would explore a new territory. They start by giving us an exclusive teaser for Drive, with footage from the news camera. It was an interesting transition from TV to real events. I would have liked it even more if they had kept that news camera all over the teaser and not cut in the car. Watching this episode in 1998, I was thinking, "Am I on the right channel?" That first autopsy of Scully flooded me with big words that I do not understand. I think she learned the lesson of ALWAYS wearing a mask before doing an autopsy. Silly Scully! What is the problem with the lighting in the autopsy lab? It's as dark as a grave there! How should they see what they are doing there? Assistant Director Kersh gets his first lines in this episode. I have no love lost for this man. He is the third recurring character that you love to hate, with the first two being Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender. I think the producers felt there was a lot of love for Mulder, Scully and Skinner. So they needed to add some characters to give our favorite actors a little pain and incite our anger as fans. I love the quarantine suits worn by Scully and her team with the cool helmet lamps. Boy. It is actually smoky or foggy in the dry northern Nevada at night. Can we say the word "effect"? Drive is a cool episode, but looking at route 36 in my American atlas, Mulder could not have kept a speed of 70-100 MPH on that road. If he was on I-80, the road, maybe. But there is no road on a state road with so many curves. All the footage inside the car looked very authentic. Great work from Rob Bowman. It does not look anything like the old days of the obvious blue screen or the landscape that passes outside the window of a car on the stage. This was a fun episode, but some of the inaccuracies prevent it from being a great episode. It keeps you on the tip of your seat, so hold on!
