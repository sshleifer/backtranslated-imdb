This film is a good example of why the Shaw brothers are among the best directors (probably the best in the Kung Fu category). The film is very rhythmic, the story is excellent and intriguing, and although the humor is not in your face, it is nested in the interactions of the characters. Once the story accumulates, and the characters begin to assess the situation, the entire tower collapses into one of the best fighting scenes (Tiger, Crane and Hung Gar Crab are very present). There is even a scene that mocks Western social events of the eighteenth century and ends with a clever and fun fight. The movie ends with a sudden and rude moment, but if you're a fan of the Shaw brothers, you'll understand that cheese is just a filling, not the movie's main course.
