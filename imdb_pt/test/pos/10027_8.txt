If you keep a strict historical perspective, this movie is really a lot of fun. He has action, adventure and romance, and one of the main casting encounters of the time with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead roles. As is evident from this picture, the picture does not fit with the purists who seek a hundred percent accuracy in storytelling. To go further, just leave the history book aside and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. I know, I know, it's hard to do when you consider Custer's Last Stand at the Little Big Horn and is prominent in the history of the post-American Civil War. So, I think there is an unresolved dilemma with the image, no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> There is much to be had here, though for the image of two hours more execution time. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first scratching head, riding as he does in full military outfit. The practical joke of Sharp (Arthur Kennedy), putting him in Major's headquarters, probably should have had them both in trouble. <br /> <br /> Ironically, many scenes in this military film play for comedy, as in Custer's movie. first meeting with Libby Bacon and subsequent meetings that include the tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I had not noticed this before in other movies, but McDaniel reminded me of a bunch of other actor from my favorite 1940s character, Mantan Moreland. So much so that in one scene, it looked like it might have been Moreland in a dress. With that in mind, the owl scene was also a joke. <br /> <br /> As for Flynn, it is interesting to note that a year earlier he played J.E.B. Stuart agrees with Ronald Reagan's portrayal of General Custer on the "Santa Fe Trail," both of which fought the attention of none other than Olivia de Havilland. In that film, Reagan did not put anything of the arrogance and exuberance in the character of Custer that the history recalls, whereas in the picture of Flynn here is more than evident. But it does not come close to Richard Mulligan's about the military hero in 1970's "Little Big Man." Let's just say one was a bit overdone. <br /> <br /> The best way to get the picture for me was the way Custer persevered in keeping his good name and not betting on a risky business. risk. This is his loyalty to the men he led in the battle along with the discipline he has developed throughout history. Most poignant was the final confrontation with arch-rival Sharp shortly before entering the Little Big Horn, in which he declared that hell or glory depended entirely on one's point of view. Earlier, a similar remark might have given us the best insight into Custer's character when he stated, "You will boast with you when it is your time to go."
