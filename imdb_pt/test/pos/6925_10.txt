Although the plot of this film is a little overdone, it is worth seeing just for the performances of Michaels Caine and Gambon. The latter offers a truly wonderful Dublin accent. Caine believes ... that's exactly what the character he's playing should do. Fun and fun, this is an hour and a half of easy observation.
