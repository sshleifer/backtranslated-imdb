For the Estonians, Finland sometimes looks like a land of dreams. A land where many of us want to go to work there or start a business. Find love, start a new life, etc. But ... Aku Louhimies made this brilliant piece that shows that everything is not so good in Finland either. That Finland can be just like Paha maa (the bad land) than any other country. This shows that the people there can be as miserable in their lives as anywhere else. That sometimes there is nothing good. This film shows well why Finland is one of the leading suicide nations. It is not easy to live in the north. The cold weather changes us. I have become increasingly attracted to Finnish films and this is very good. The acting is also great. Jasper Pääkkönnen has become one of the leading Finnish stars. Beware of the sex scene (if you have small children) and a little depression that may come after the movie! 8/10
