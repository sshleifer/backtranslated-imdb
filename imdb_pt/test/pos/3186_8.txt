This is a great TV movie with a good story and many comedic moments thanks to the excellent cast. <br /> <br /> The only problem that this movie has is that it did not stand the test of time as well as it could. Despite this, it's definitely worth seeing, especially if you're a fan of Alan Alda or Ruth Gordon.
