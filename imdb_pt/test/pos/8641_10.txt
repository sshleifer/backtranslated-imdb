Spoiler Alert - despite being a plot almost as difficult to spoil as it is to fully explain. "Mulholland Drive" is by far the most successful expression of film style and David Lynch's vision since season one. of his TV series 'Twin Peaks'. As Lynch enthusiasts know, does your style and vision blend uniquely with noir movies, horror movies, surrealism, and parapsychology? with a healthy dose of postmodern self-consciousness and black humor thrown in for good measure. Are all these elements richly working on 'Mulholland Drive', creating a fascinating, sweeping and highly satisfying cinematic experience? especially if one does not become overly obsessed with trying to get all the pieces into a logical, mystery-revealing whole. <br /> <br /> The film features marvelous performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring in the leading roles of young women whose lives intersect in many ways amidst a Hollywood setting that is itself a hallucinations of contemporary reality, the retro nostalgia of the 1950s and satirical self-aggrandizement. Their seemingly random initial meeting takes place after the opening scene of the movie, in which the character of Harring escapes an attempt in his life thanks to a car accident, not to mention horrible. Climbing down the hillside of Mulholland Drive to Sunset Boulevard (the two most archetypal of the Hollywood streets), she finds her way to the apartment Betty (Naomi Watts) is about to sublet from her aunt Ruth, a supposedly successful actress . is out of Canada to start a new movie. As we learned later, Betty came from Deep River, Ontario, shortly after winning a jitterbug competition. <br /> <br /> A highly energetic and stylized flashback to the contest forms one of two pre-credit prologue sequences that frame Betty's descent from the bright-eyed innocence of the stela clich√© to the mocking madness of a rejected lover and going nowhere actress. Unable to remember his own name, Harring's character adopts the name 'Rita' from a movie poster for the classic noir film 'Gilda' that adorns Aunt Ruth's apartment. (Actually, Aunt Ruth has been dead for a long time, and in whose apartment we are really a good question to be solved in future visions.) Anyway, Betty decides to help Rita find out what happened and find out the source of the problem . rolls of money and a mysterious blue key that women find in Rita's purse. The two women begin to join together clues that seem to lead to Rita's true identity. They, too, by the way, become lovers, to the point that they radiate such incendiary chemistry that I can not remember their equality in the traditional treatments of lesbian love affairs (if a Lynch movie can be termed "mainstream"). At the local Winkies restaurant (a recurring place steeped in dreamlike meaning behind its realistic and dirty facade), Rita's attention is captured by a label named after a waitress named "Diane." This brings her to a memory of someone called "Diane Selwyn," whose apartment the two women soon visit and, at Betty's insistence, break in. I will not reveal what they find within themselves, but suffice it to say that the scene is interpreted with Lynch's old chills. Later, Rita wakes up from night sweats speaking Spanish and taking Betty to a magic show called Silence, where the arts of illusion and lip / instrumentation are practiced with manic intensity and where the Lady with Blue Hairs, as she is noted in final credits, reigns as the muse president. Framed by the Silencio Theater, with blue curtains and red curtains, the blue haired woman occupies the last scene of the film, perhaps a symbol for control of the artistic imagination? more or less as Steven's "man with the blue guitar", filtered by the surrealism of drugs. <br /> <br /> During the Silence sequence, and as Rebekah Del Rio appeared, he synchronized his own Spanish version of Roy Orbison. '), a breaking epiphany occurs when Betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in Rita's purse. Even if we do not delve deeply into the Freudian sexual symbolism of scholarships, the timing is singularly Hitchcockian, as the correspondence between the key and the case leads to a complete reversal of what we thought we knew and a whole new set. relationships of character and meanings. No less important of these inversions is the discovery that Betty is the one sought by Diane Selwyn and the rejected lover of Camilla Rhodes (that is, Rita). Camilla, on the other hand, is a Latin movie star femme fatale to whom Diane is indebted for the few smaller roles she has secured, and more significantly, to whom she is emotionally subdued. <br /> <br /> After these and other discoveries in the last third of the film, the problem of accounting for the first two-thirds of the film is not as straightforwardly resolved as in 'Vertigo'. While pieces of images and dialogues suggest that much, if not all of the earlier material is projected and displaced from Diane's own feverish subconscious, other parts suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters who are directly inspired by 'Twin Peaks', including Michael J. Anderson reprising his supernatural anomic powers and a variant of Bob that lies behind Winkies and is the final repository for the Blue Box and its identity associations. <br /> <br /> One fits the pieces, however, the whole 'Mulholland Drive' is much larger? and more mysterious ?? than the sum of its parts. Lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive, provocative and enjoyable mental journey. In addition, the cinematography of the film is impressive, the soundtrack full of evocative atmospheres, superb performance and masterful direction / editing. This may well have been the unrecognized Best Picture of 2001 among the top American releases.
