At first glance, The Bothersome Man looks like several other films / books in one. The Trial of Kafka, Bartleby, Melville, The Fall and Ascension of Reginald Perrin and Groundhog Day instantly come to mind. A man, Andreas, arrives in an unnamed city where he immediately gets a job in an office and finds a beautiful new girlfriend. However, there is a catch: his colleagues are all friendly, bland and totally characterless, and everyone he knows, including his girlfriend, seems to have only one topic of conversation - interior design. Welcome to the hell of modern consumerism, where people throw themselves into buildings and no one raises an eyebrow, or spends his days reading furniture catalogs and eating foods that have no taste. <br /> Andreas quickly realizes his situation. and spends the rest of the movie trying to escape in many ways. Suicide ends up not being an option, and when he finds a new girlfriend she is as devoid of feelings as the old one - there is a wonderful scene in a restaurant where he asks her to live with him and all she can say is , 'I dont care'. <br /> <br /> In fact, much of what the Inconvenient Man has to say has already been said before, and after 45 minutes you begin to feel that you are really going through a certain sense of déjà vu. However, his point is one that is probably worth repeatedly repeating: an unexamined life is one that is not worth living. Added to this, it provides a decidedly modern take on the perennial theme of how capitalism is destroying our souls. More than one character reminded me of people I met, especially his furniture-obsessed girlfriend, and if at the end of the film the filmmakers are out of ideas, maybe that's the point - there will be no end unless you can Find others who share your sense of alienation.
