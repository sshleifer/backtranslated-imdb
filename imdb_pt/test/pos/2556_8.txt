A friend brought me this movie and at first I was hesitant, the pace in the movie was so slow that it was admittedly annoying at first. But the scenes of life were attractive, it is like observing than observing. <br /> <br /> It turned out to be simply stunning throughout the film, the way the director dealt with the scenes of life to reflect reality was confusing but somehow also overwhelming. It's like understanding the real life of an animated person than watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Mr. Alejandro Polanco and Miss Isamar Gonzales have played their roles so well that it is more like telling their own stories. In fact, they used their real names in the movie.
