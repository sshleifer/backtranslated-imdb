"Are you in the house alone?" belongs to pre-cable TV days, when networks were eager to offer an alternative to popular TV shows. It's a well-made thriller with a talented cast and credible situations. Kathleen Beller plays a high school student who receives a series of threatening letters. Everyone seems to think it's nothing more than a joke, but Beller is really scared. Tony Bill and Blythe Danner play Beller's parents, Ellen Travolta (John's sister) is the Director of High School and Dennis Quaid has one of his first roles as an arrogant and wealthy boy. It is a competent chiller with a social message still relevant. Beller is lovely - if you are 30 or older, you will remember that she was very popular with young people. Blythe Danner, whom I normally do not like, gives a really exciting performance. Good little movie.
