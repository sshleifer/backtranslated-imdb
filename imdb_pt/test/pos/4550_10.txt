I've watched this movie regularly for most of my life, and it never gets old. For all the malicious comments and insults (especially from David Spade), "Tommy Boy" has a giant heart. And that's what keeps this movie funny after all these years. Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley) is the son of Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy), an auto parts dealer, and has taken full advantage of his work. life. But after his death died on his wedding day, Tommy discovers that the company is in debt and about to be bought by Ray Zalinsky (Dan Akroyd), owner of a huge auto parts company. So to save the company, Tommy needs to go to the road to sell the company's new brake pads. Along for the ride, though not by choice, is Richard Hayden (David Spade) a former classmate of Tommy, who was the right arm of Big Tom. The film is based on the chemistry between the two stars SNL. (and real life best friends) Chris Farley and David Spade. The duo has enough comedic energy between them to feed the world. It's the big, stupid guy against the smart little boy. It works and some of his scenes are unforgettably funny. Farley and Spade are also decent acting actors. Although the film is basically a comedy, it has its share of drama, but Spade and especially Farley are as good as when they are making the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> Forgive me, but I have to talk about Chris Farley a little more. I read his biography ("The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts" for who cares), and understanding who Chris was in real life made this movie more special to me. Chris Farley was a genuinely good person who fought and ultimately failed to conquer his addictions. Although this was the first film in which he played a major role, it is his best film. This really showed who he was and how much talent he had. Knowing the story of Chris adds another layer to this movie, although not less funny. <br /> <br /> Farley and Spade are combined with a good cast on the screen. Rob Lowe is adequately slimy as Tommy's "new brother", and Bo Derek is solid as his stepmother. Brian Dennehy is great as Big Tom. Dennehy makes it easy to believe that they are father to son. Big Tom is as crazy as his son, although he is smarter and more mature. Dan Akroyd gives one of his best performances as Zalinsky, giving Tommy the harsh truth behind the publicity. Julie Warner is also good as Tommy's love interest, Michelle. <br /> <br /> For me, Peter Segal is one of the great comedy directors. He keeps up the pace fast and energetic, but more importantly, he knows how to make funny comedy. He does not believe in jokes and understands that funny actors know what they're doing and lets them do it. But Segal goes a step further. He gives Tommy Boy a friendly, almost nostalgic tone that pulls the heart strings (genuinely) and tickles on the funny. <br /> <br /> Critics did not like "Tommy Boy." Shame on them. A movie need not be super sophisticated or subversively intellectual to be funny (God forbid Farley and Spade were forced to make comedy muted to "The Office"). This is a great movie and one of my all time favorites.
