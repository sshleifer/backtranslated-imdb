"Pharaoh's Army" defies formula. Instead of selling cliches and big stars, it depends entirely on the excellent performance of a strong cast, the strength of a well-written script, and a fascinating and bitter story. The result is a raw, realistic film that moves quickly, with a heavy emotional current. One of the best I've ever seen about the Civil War, and I think this owes to the pleasure of being an independent movie (if you like this movie, try to see the equally brilliant indie Civil War movie "Wicked Spring" <br /> < "Pharaoh" simply tells the true story of a small expedition / foraging team of Union men who go to a confederate farm to take action, but they get stuck there because of an accident of one of the men. and relationships are made and broken.Nothing happens the way Hollywood would write.This movie comes from the mind of someone who really cares about the quality movie and the story.Moving dialogue and plot exposure move throughout a movie who seems highly professional, but often does not seem like you're watching a movie, more along the lines of listening to a story. <br /> <br /> The film boasts an incredible performance by Chris Cooper, who most an incredible versatility in the exploration of its role. It transforms itself but is always at the peak of credibility and is easy to relate emotionally. Patricia Clarkson is so stellar and realistic in a role that many actresses crumble. She shares an interesting chemistry with Cooper's character and where she is the most severe of the characters, is still so easy to identify. The rest of the cast is quite capable and fills their roles well. <br /> <br /> The artistic design and setting are wonderful and personally I love cinematography. Everything has the feel of a photograph from the Civil War period with the camera showing strong colors and contrasting shadows and a tin-shaped metallic hue, yet always retaining the naturalistic look of the rustic scenery. They seem to have used natural lighting, but whatever they use works beautifully. Everything seems to belong where it is, it seems period, something I find rare in American period films. Actors act in the nineteenth century, not like twentieth-century people in old clothes. <br /> <br /> Above all, this movie is very personal. I think, as an indie, you can afford it. The film is almost impeccable, with an excellent script that creates and effortlessly explores the relationships and personalities of these characters and lets them grow in a situation as bad as it is. He does not fail to show his point of view, and makes him point out without the usual and overused techniques that are used in all war films today. He's brave. He draws on his characters, a fantastic script, human emotion and the fact that the Civil War was not all CGI, big stars and bow skirts.
