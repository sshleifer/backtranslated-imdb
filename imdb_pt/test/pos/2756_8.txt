This is a "magazine" presentation by Riverdance, staged at Radio City Music Hall in New York. Of the three Irish "dance" musicals I watched from the mid to late 90s (which includes the first "Riverdance" and "Lord of the Dance"), I enjoyed it more. <br /> <br /> I found it better than the original, made in Dublin, Ireland because it adds segments that are mostly good, has a more varied and colorful stage scenery and eliminated each of them from the original that did not was good to begin with. This is just a very solid show with few weaknesses. To be sure, there are some songs / dances that are just "fair", but none that are bad, which is incredible considering there are 20 numbers in total. <br /> <br /> The cast is similar to the first Riverdance with the main exception of Colin Dunne replacing Michael Flatley as the outstanding dancer. Both are extremely talented. The main difference may be in his appearance with Dunne a guy with thick black hair, while Flatley is the shaved blonde. I prefer Dunne because Flatley's ego is so big that it gets annoying at times. The female leader, Jean Butler, fortunately, is still there and is great to see: what a graceful beauty and talent! Butler and the rest of these women have the best legs I've ever seen in dancers. I also enjoyed the dance of Maria Pages, a Spanish flamenco artist, and two guys: Daniel B. Wooten and Ivan Thomas. A number - with those two paired against Dunne and two other dancers - 0 is called "Trading Taps" and is a lot of fun to watch, perhaps the highlight of the whole show. I also have no complaints about the violinist Eileen Ivers. <br /> <br /> The Irish songs "fast" here attracted me more. I appreciated the audience did not disrupt performance with screams and screams as women do in the video "Lord Of The Dance".
