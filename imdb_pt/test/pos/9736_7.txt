I was a kid when I saw this series, shortly after seeing Buck Rogers, both characters played by the same Buster Crabbe, and I must admit that these movies have always been part of the best entertainment I've ever had. The fight against Emperor Ming was one thing, but I was more interested to know about the ultimate fate of the Flash love triangle with Dale and Aura. Barin arrived and persuaded Aura to forget Flash, an innocent conclusion to his obsession with beautiful Flash. The series has no offensive and really violent scenes and can be watched by all audiences. Another thing is that I learned floating in the water looking the way Crabbe did when he fought shark men. The soundtrack was also cool, although it was previously used in another Boris Karloff Frankenstein movie. It would be nice to have the DVD of this series since it comes with subtitles in Spanish (not yet available).
