Aparna Sen, the creator of Mr & Mrs Iyer, directs this film about a young woman's struggle to deal with her debilitating condition. <br /> <br /> Meethi (Konkona Sen) has been a distant boy since childhood and has shown signs of illusion, no one knows why. The dormant trend, however, comes out of control when the assignment of the job takes her to neighboring Bihar, where she is raped by some political henchmen. The resulting trauma also leads to episodes of manic-depressive psychosis in addition to his schizophrenia. She gets out of control over the years, worsening progressively and sinking deeper into her private 'world'. <br /> <br /> The juxtaposition of an 'unstable' (divorced) older sister and how her dominating ways make matters worse is worse, it is indicative of a thin line between abnormal and seemingly normal. Ms Sen also makes an excellent commentary on the social alienation of such individuals. Social rehabilitation is the standard therapy along with all the deadly mind altering drugs. But what about the poor and the destitute, who are always left to defend themselves and usually fall into oblivion? <br /> <br /> The romantic connection between Dr. Kunal and Anu was unnecessary. Also the dining scene where Dr. Kunal explains to Anu how their world is real was redundant. Anu should know all this already. The dialogue in English is a little odd at times, although the acting compensates for it. Konkona and Shabana prove their reputation is worth it. Waheeda, Rahul and Shefali play their limited roles very well. <br /> <br /> Extensive research seems to have been made about this disease, it is very evident. But it is unclear whether MDP can coexist with schizophrenia in the same patient, side by side. Also at the beginning, Dr. Kunal recommends shock therapy (ECT), while invalidating the fact that it does not work for schizophrenics, only for the extreme MDP with suicidal tendencies and other forms of bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> The end of the remarkable story is suggestive of an unknown solution (perhaps no solution). The film could have ended on a more enjoyable note, since throughout the world the mentally ill can and do lead balanced and fruitful leadership if not very gratifying, living under good medical care. <br /> <br /> However, it is an excellent film made with extreme sensitivity to the subject. HATS OFF for Ms Sen! No one in India could have done better.
