With the obvious exception of Fools & Horses, this was, in my opinion, the best David Jason series. <br /> <br /> These 13 episodes revealed mastery over "Do not Adjust Your Set!" comic timing not seen since the old days of silent movies. In comparison, Porridge, Open All Hours and that horrible series 'Lucky Man' did not come close. <br /> <br /> I believe that Jason has banned the series being repeated because she showed that he was more raw. What a shame for him. A new generation deserves to enjoy this. The series really failed in ratings, but this is more likely because it was screened against 'The Brothers', which aired on the BBC at the same time, before VCRs were common. <br /> <br /> BTW, I just noticed that his long suffering assistant, Spencer, was played by Mark Eden; Alan Bradley, on Coronation Street. I'm surprised he did not try to murder Edgar Briggs !!!!
