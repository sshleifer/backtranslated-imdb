In the era of the Farrelly Brothers and the Jackass series, having a movie made and performed by Americans is very rhythmic and full of charm, just as the hilarity is almost miraculous. This set has been behind some other efforts, most recently "A Mighty Wind," which was so subtle that it seemed to be a real documentary without the overlapping entertainment, but "Best in Show" hits all the cylinders. It is superbly released with some of America's best current actors, Parker Posey, who exudes energy even when she stands still, Eugene Levy as a tolerant man who is not anyone's doormat, even when he seems to be (or perhaps, 'indomitable doormat' ). ). The brilliant style of Fred Willard, the understated performance of so many others, is a feature not usually associated with American or American actors. One of the few humorous movies I can watch again and again.
