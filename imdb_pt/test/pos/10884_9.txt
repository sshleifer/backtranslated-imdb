What can be said about one of the biggest N64 games of all time? That action is fast enough to keep even an experienced FPS veteran sweating bullets literally? That the graphics are great, even the explosions that everyone loves to see? That nothing is as fun as playing in multiplayer mode, and shooting your friends and brothers in the back with machine guns? <br /> <br /> Very few hits Goldeneye 007. About the only thing missing was dubbing, and a little more intelligence in the enemy soldiers. If you have an N64, and like to photograph people and cross-eyed things, get a copy of it.
