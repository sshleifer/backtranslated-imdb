I really loved watching this movie. I think it's a brilliant, underrated Alfred Hitchcock movie. Everyone is familiar with the famous Statue of Liberty scene, but there is a great movie before that. Robert Cummings is great at what I consider to be his biggest role, and beautiful Priscilla Lane shows that she has a lot of talent too. But I think Norman Lloyd gives the best performance. Your character, Fry, is so mean and dishonest. Even if he's not in it for long, the movie would not be the same without him. <br /> <br /> "Saboteur" is a great movie that every Hitchcock fan should see. I give 10 out of 10 !!
