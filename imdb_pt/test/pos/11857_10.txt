Why this movie was only released in 4 states is beyond me. I thought this movie was a divine story. The name says it all: See other people. This movie has more logic than laughter, which I suppose is why it works so well. Common sense also appears in what appears to be another puerile sexual comedy. Alice is getting her feet frozen in the cold when she feels irrational about how she can introduce herself to her fianc√©, not just sexually, but as a partner, friend, and so on. This starts what appears to be an almost archetypal journey for both of them. One adventure after another leads to trouble, as if it was not a bad idea from the start. Witty dialogues and comic book montages make it funny! Nicholson and Mohr set the tone for the film from the beginning and deliver on the promise they anticipate. Other highlights include Lauren Graham, Andy Richter and Helen Slater (in their first theatrical film in 10 years!). Climax begins to take an insane turn, but a simple ending makes this film much more enjoyable than most current films. Mohr fans will see something different in their character Ed, and Helen Slater fans will enjoy their brilliant moments of a fast but excellent comeback. Any Richter takes home the prize for the greatest moralistic character. Romantic and funny, or just plain fun. Seeing other people is a gem, which needs to be noticed.
