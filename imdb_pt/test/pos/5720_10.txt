After seeing this routine of John Leguizamo, I finally realize why he is so talented. I like great stage work, and this is the stage work at its best. I can not label it as a stand-up routine, because Leguizamo is so intense when interpreting the different characters. The only time he breaks the character is when it is necessary for him to complete his part in which he does so coldly, that you can not help but enjoy your talents. I was not sure how I felt about him as an actor, but Freak solidified my appreciation for him. For those who have not yet had the opportunity to see this show, I feel for you. Definitely check it out. It's one of the nest routines I've seen. Ranks with Eddie Murphy, Bill Cosby and Chris Rock. Four stars and more.
