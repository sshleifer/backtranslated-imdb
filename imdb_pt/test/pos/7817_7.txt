There are a number of comments that comment the cast of this movie. Suffice it to say that Alex Cordel has a strong lead over Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy. What worries me is that many of you may not be aware of the (at least) two existing versions of this movie. In the North American version, Clay McCord obtains amnesty from the governor Lem Carter and later leaves the city rescued. I agree that the ending is less than satisfactory. However, in the original Italian cut, Clay McCord leaves town (unarmed as he handed his guns to the governor) and is attacked by bounty hunters who are slowly depopulating the town of Escondido. The Bounty Killers are excited about the prospect of dividing the $ 10,000 reward, but they are disappointed to find McCord's amnesty deal in the pocket of the corpses. As they walk away, one hears comment: "If this amnesty continues, I will start hunting buffaloes!" . It only takes a minute to pray ... A Second To Die and puts in a field of play even with movies like Keoma and The Big Gundown. As the final credits in the Italian court say "FINE".
