The Psychopath (1973) A journey by the road of memory. I saw this movie many years ago in an old black and white t.v. The presenter of a children's series, Mr. Rabbey, avenges the brutal abuse that parents inflict on their children's fans. Mr. Rabbey (who seems to be always on the verge of losing him) finally breaks up and decides to go on a hunting trip. Beware of bad parents because Mr. Rabbey is on the prowl! What happens next is invaluable. However, trying to find this movie will be a difficult task. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie remarkable was the fact that Joe "Maniac" Spinell made a small promo reel for a movie based on this one. In his unfinished film, he plays Mr. Robbie, a clown t.v. (who looks like a chubby out of shape Edward James Olmos), who avenges the abuse of his young fans by going after his parents. Unfortunately, Mr. Spinell was never able to find the funds to complete the project. The movie would be titled Maniac II: "Mr. Robbie". Rabbey or Robbie, the similarities are very close to the comfort. Rather violent for a P.G. movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
