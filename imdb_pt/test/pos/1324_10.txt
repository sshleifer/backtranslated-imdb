One would think that a film based on the life of Japanese author Yukio Mishima would be a daunting task, if not impossible. However, Paul Schrader made a film "about" Mishima which is superb and complex. Although not a literal biography, Schrader and his co-writer Leonard Scharder (his brother) took several incidents of his life, including his success, and worked out what can best be described as incidental pictures that are visually sparse and impressive. Mishima's homosexuality is barely there due to legal threats from his widow, but despite that, the film is still fantastic, and one of the best films I saw in 1985. I should also mention the important contribution of Philip Glass who did that. the scoreboard, which adds an additional texture to the film, and is superior to what he did for Scorsese's Kundun. Also noteworthy is John Bailey's very colorful cinematography and Eiko Ishioka's design and costumes, which made the costumes memorable for Coppola's Dracula, for which she received a well-deserved Oscar. I hope this movie is soon available on DVD.
