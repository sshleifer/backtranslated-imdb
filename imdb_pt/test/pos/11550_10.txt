Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera faces in the world, so it is not surprising that Pola X is a near-perfect filming of the most painful story of all time. Seriously. If I could have figured out a way to get on my video monitor, I would have beaten Pierre an inch out of his life. No one has the right to be so absorbed and so stupid, both at the same time, except maybe Heathcliff on Emily Bronte's Howling Wind Hill. After spending 134 minutes with Pierre, I need a big glass of cognac. I've never been so mad at a main character. Okay, having said that, Pola X is an incredible movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes I've seen in any movie ... which means another brilliant piece of footage ... and I'm talking about graphics here, by the way. Pola X will hit the hell out of you, so make sure you're ready for this if you decide to watch it.
