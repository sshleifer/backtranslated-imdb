This was the best movie I saw in the year 2000. The Cohen brothers never let me down, and they certainly did not. <br /> <br /> It's one of those rare movies these days - it's witty, clever and very fun. I left the theater with a warmth in my heart. Of course, there are many things Cohen there - strange characters and peculiar gadgets, well-developed plot and magical camera work. But no Cohen movie is like any other Cohen movie if you ignore their overall quality, of course. <br /> <br /> The big surprise for me was that Clooney is so good. But the true master performance in this film comes from Tim Blake-Nelson. But the rest of the cast is superb too. <br /> <br /> A film that is light comedy with a musical twist that evolves its history around rednecks and old country music country - with humor and intelligence. This is a very unlikely combination. But that's exactly what this picture is.
