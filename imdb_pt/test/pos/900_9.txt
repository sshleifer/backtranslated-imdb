Gen-Y Cops ... since hearing about the movie being released, I wanted to see it because I loved Gen-X Cops. I was a bit disappointed that A) Nicholas Tse did not return and B) a lot of antics. However, I liked the sequel because it may not be as good as the first movie, but it's good in its own way. <br /> <br /> Stephen Fung returns as the ultracool ladies' man Match, who has a firm girl in Oli (Note: Where's Haze?) And Sam Lee returns as the insane Alien (this time flaunting a Mohawk and talking very English !!!!). The real star of the movie is the newcomer Edison Chen. He makes a great replacement for Nicholas Tse as ... Edison. I also liked Agent Curtis' Paul Rudd performance ... he seems to be the toughest nail ever, the FBI agent you love to hate ... but soon, you'd like his character. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are a lot better on this one ... even if they're few, but they're great courtesy of Jackie Chan's stuntman, Nicky Li. <br /> <br /> Look for an entry special of Ron Smoorenburg. a cage fighter who has a little fight with Match. Smoorenburg is also Rudd's stunt double. <br /> <br /> If you liked GEN-X COPS ... you'll love GEN-Y COPS !!!
