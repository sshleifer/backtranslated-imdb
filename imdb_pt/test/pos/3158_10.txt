I like movies that show real "American" people and tell the truth. The movie is simple and seems to be the best. He played here in Norway (Amazon says it's USA / Canda, but the box says "All Regions.") I have to say that it's not for American viewers.He played here at World Raw Views, a theater. I'm sorry, Bush fans, but this movie is driving you crazy because it makes sense, get angry and hate everything in it, but it's all about it. I, on the one hand, is not for empty minds, is long and difficult to keep up with, but on the second, it makes more sense, I loved Owen's words and the poem made me cry.
