I just got it and it's a great movie !! I loved! Although Jane Brightons voice at first is so annoying because of her device she does not open her mouth ... but you have to watch because it is a great movie! the things he says here are so funny and extremely cute !! and I'm sure Aaron would probably say some of the stuff in real life because I do not know, it looks like it is !! ha ha there's a part in the movie that's really funny ... it's wen Jane's little sister finds it ... but I can not tell you what happens because barely just have to let you see for yourself! I went to see Aaron n concert and it was so much fun !! n he smelled so good ha ha ... I still can not believe I have to meet him !!! I have photos, if anyone wants to see them !! Steph
