This film flopped miserably in the UK, and it did not deserve it. The trailer for this movie is a bit misleading, and I think it fooled the critics and the public into thinking it was "Atonement: Part 2". Although the film was marketed in this way to capitalize on the previous success of Joe Wright's BAFTA-winning film, the tone is quite different. He focuses on an imagination of the types of life of the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas during World War II as the writer of propaganda films for the war effort, and his subsequent return to Wales. Director John Maybury quickly introduces Dylan's childhood sweetheart (Matthew Ryhs), Vera Phillips, played by Keira Knightley. She was Dylan's first love in her homeland, but the moment passed and the singer Vera just wants it as a beautiful souvenir. Or her? Vera unexpectedly establishes a close bond with the other woman in Dylan's life, "Queen of Ireland, love of my life, mother of my son," Caitlin Thomas (Sienna Miller). The three form a sort of menage a trois in London, but Vera then falls in love with a bold soldier, William Killick (Cillian Murphy). They quickly marry, with Killick leaving for the war. A frightened Vera convinces Thomas to return with her to Wales, but the three are faced with the realism of Vera's son's birth, William's jealousy and shock after returning home, and Caitlin realizing that she can not share Dylan with your best friend Filmed on a low budget, this is more of a humor thing than anything else. It works best as a perception that some memories and feelings need to be valued but not renewed. Sienna Miller's performance is particularly excreting (unfortunately the paparazzi's absurdity lessens the fact that she's a great talent), and Knightley and Murphy are once again very good. The disillusionment is Rhys like Dylan, who, although the Welsh poet himself was not a sea of ​​roses, lacks charisma and makes us think about what these women see in Dylan. The writing is very unstable, some beautiful moments interspersed with sloppiness. Certainly worth watching, though.
