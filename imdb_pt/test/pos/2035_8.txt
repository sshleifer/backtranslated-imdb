ROCK STAR is a well-told version of the Hollywood tale based on the fact based on how Ripper became the substitute for Rob Halford for Judas Priest. Mark Wahlberg showed his charming charm and presented himself with admirable admirability, something he's known since the launch of BOOGIE NIGHTS. <br /> <br /> Stephen Herek, who is no stranger to movies with musical themes, takes the audience through the wonders of the dizzying lifestyle of an extinct species, the God of Rock Hair-Metal. Wahlberg's "Izzy" acts as the host of the film that plays the average man who can see his desire come true. His friendly character quickly wins the heart of the viewer, who wants to see him succeed and has the chance to give him the sign of "Metal" goat horn several times. <br /> <br /> The only real complaint with the story is that the support cast, ie the other members of the band, were not developed, or even introduced, correctly. More interaction with these lifelong rock musicians would have amplified and solidified Izzy's new environment. <br /> <br /> Of course, the ROCK STAR is full of good music. Rabin's soundtrack, Steel Dragon's original work and many 1980s-style Metal hits make this soundtrack a must-have! Let's all hope that films like ROCK STAR not only lend credibility to a style of music that helped define a generation, but also triggered a much needed rebirth.
