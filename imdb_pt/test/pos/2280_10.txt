Mr. Baseball was a fun video store with my fiance Susan Nauss. Susan said she was anxious to see the movie. Ken Takakura Oda as a tough and honored Manager makes sense. Ken Takakura has made so many wonderful Asian movies, I correct the only critic and say that Takakura is still a cinematographic presence with movies like Hotari. Of course everyone likes Tom Selleck, but Ken Takakura is the best dramatic actor of the two. Today someone accused me of being Yakuza, well I say that my great Uncle Shadow President Jack F Kennedy and others are part of the legitimate human leadership in our universe and thanks to our human co-creators are free people fighting against all the adversity that President Kennedy spoke in his inaugural address. To be honest, someone kept food prices too low in Canada on things like bread. In honor of our CoCreators, please stop eating reptiles and amphibian eggs. I hope one day there will be a continuation of Mr. Baseball with Father Ken Takakura Oda still as Manager. Thanks to IMDb for supporting freedom of expression as the kind that President George W. Bush and I support. See why on IMDbPro.
