I watched this movie with my family during a long Thanksgiving holiday weekend. I'm grateful that someone insisted that we watch it, though I did not pay much attention until the end of the movie when a head shearing looks promised, but unfortunately, it does not happen. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I watched this film a few years later and loved its vivacity, absurdity, brilliance and pure fun. I think the film has a feminine tone. Women are not exploited, though I'm sure someone might think the film is pure exploitation. I think the movie plays with the period tropes. <br /> <br /> I keep thinking that someone should redo it. And elaborate some of the implications of the original.
