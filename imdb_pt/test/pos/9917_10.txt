The assassinations at Opera are not real murders, but symbols of past events and parts of Betty's own fractured personality. In fact, Betty is the same person (a man) that Suzy Bannion is in Suspiria, only a decade later in life (Suzy was a ten year old boy who befriended another ten year old boy with a lighter version of his own history). <br /> This helps to think of Betty's luxury apartment as a military barracks bay; she spends most of her time in her bed room next to her stereo, and other parts of her apartment seem strange to her in some way, as if other people lived in those other rooms. <br /> <br /> Dario Argento films synchronize with a wide variety of Rock music, as well as Funk (Dario starts the synchronizations early in his films, the eye flash in Opera and the beginning of a drums in Suspiria). There are also standard movies Opera (and Suspiria) synchronize. For example, Opera synchronizes with an album recorded by Judas Priest called Priest ... Live (as well as Suspiria), and Suspiria synchronizes very well with a recorded album of Kiss, Kiss Kiss II. Films like Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, The Image, and The Vampire's Event are synopsis movies that Argento uses that deal with the same subject as the Argento films. These synchronizations, along with many others reveal that Betty is a man who has suffered sexual torture in the hands of her father since birth (even in the womb, according to a certain Anne Rice novel entitled Lasher). <br /> <br /> Big budget films are hidden works that transmit information from spying collected by hidden means, all in a synchronized symbolic / alchemical way. Typically, the point of synchronization in a movie is the beginning of the soundtrack, or it is the first image of the film beyond any lead-in of the film company. Sometimes he's more creative. The heavy metal music used in Opera and Phenomena are simply synchronizations of songs that have been deciphered from other films that Argento films synchronize, a kind of intellectual game among the elite within the industry. <br /> <br /> So Betty does not normally respond to the murders she witnesses because she never witnessed the murder of a real person. "She herself" simply suffers the murder of the soul; she witnesses her own "murder"; his father nearly knocked him down at an abandoned mine in the Arizon, at age four, in 1970; he was about to fall from a wooden plank in which his father balanced it before his father changed his mind and grabbed him and pulled him away; the boy did not feel anything consciously. Memories of sexual torture are lost to this individual through extreme sexual repression, and the vague memories that remain are from the large, square, and deep hole in the desert and no meaning is placed in this memory because of the lack of conscious trauma (the " of the trauma, "also a buried trait," is portrayed in the 1975 film The Image.These sausages in the attic in Suspiria are individual memories of the first three or more years of life (Toys In The Attic). /> The reason why Betty (or Suzy) is a female character is because the individual character mirrors of Christina Marsillach is a man who has been trained in a female role type from birth (all Simpsons cartoon DVDs synchronize with Suspiria), with its nature being shaped along the lines of "Queen" Episodes-Files synchronize with the Opera.) This even altered her body to be "beautiful" in the same way as a woman . Behavior changes genetics. A more recent film entitled Death Proof deals with the same ideas and the same individual. <br /> <br /> Virtually the whole life of that person is mirrored in big budget films, record albums and books made since 1966, and father before 1966 and after. The Scorpions album, titled Virgin Killer, is an album by Suspiria Sync, with the cover of the original album acting as a symbolic mirror image of the fall through the skylight.
