"The Dresser" is a small but absolutely wonderful film, brilliantly portrayed by Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay. As the world this tiny movie attracted enough attention to get five Oscar nominations in 1983 is a mystery to me, but it's good to know that the Academy can be guilty of a tasteful show from time to time (of course). , they gave the prize that year for "Terms of Endearment" - after all, they do not want to be accused of showing DEOU too much). <br /> <br /> Albert Finney is a Shakespearean actor drunk on a production of "King Lear"; Tom Courtenay is the man who works double behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the spotlights. It is hilarious and unfortunate to see the character of Courtenay taking care of Finney with attention and affection, only to see his efforts totally devalued and discarded, until the very bitter end. Finney and Courtenay do wonders together, and although Finney has the most impressive moments (he manages to recite Shakespeare after all), Courtenay is the heart and soul of the film. <br /> <br /> Note: A
