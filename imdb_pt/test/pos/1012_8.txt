Despite some really scenic locations in the East and some energetically sporadic songs by Franco Micalizzi, this film does not reach the level of Joe D'Amato's similar efforts, though it is practically so vulgar. The author of the original book "Emmanuelle: The Joys of a Woman," Emmanuelle Arsan, directed and played a small role in this film, which mainly shows a very young Annie Belle as she gets into a variety of eccentric sexual situations. Her boyfriend, played by ZOMBIE's Al Cliver, actually approves that she is sleeping and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two are married! Orso Maria Guerrini appears as a teacher who is normally married to two women, one of whom is interpreted by Arsan herself. Although it does get promising and have some hilarious lines of dialogue like "can you see me with the naked eye?" ... "I can see you better naked!", The movie collapses dull to the less spectacular end. Like EMANUELLE and D'Amato's LATEST CANIBALS, the main characters are in search of some lost tribe, but do not wait, there's no violence in this movie, and not much sex either. Just a lot of nudity and dumb dialogue. I could not help but find some appreciation for this little film, even if only by the complete logic of the film go by.
