This film is one of my favorite movies of all time and is what made me a fan of Nicolas Cage throughout his life. In the mid 80's I recorded this movie (when the VCR was impossible to do !!) and watched several times. Nicolas Cage is simply brilliant here. And, it looks wonderful and does not affect "acting-isms" (see "Peggy Sue Got Married" to know what I mean about it !!). I measured all his performances against this. He was as perfect as the cool punk guy with nervous friends. The music was great. The Plimsouls! Psychedelic furs! Modern English! Man at work! Whenever I hear "Melt With You", I'm taken back to the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> What happened to your cute costarinha, Deborah Foreman? And your hysterical friend, Cameron Dye? It certainly took a different tack than Nicolas! Curiously, the sneaky friend (Elizabeth Daily) ended up being the voice of Rugrats' Tommy (she's billed as E.G. Daily for that horrible show)! Bizarre! <br /> <br /> If you want to make a great trip back to the 80's, watch this movie. It's definitely a classic. How totally!
