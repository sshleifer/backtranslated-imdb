Ghost Walks is a cool little mystery with a big twist, agile dialogue, and best of all, a perfect love played twittery by actor Johnny Arthur, who never demeanes or denigrates his character. Mr. Arthur is great in his role as Homer Erskine bringing great comic relief as the secretary of Broadway producer Herman Wood, played by another great actor Richard Carle. <br /> <br /> They perform superbly. Although the acceptable words of time are used to describe Homer's character, this is never stingy, witty or intentional, and is not spoken by the film males, but by his employer, that the dismisses and repeals it in all other scenes and demonstrates an almost exasperated affection for his devoted servant. <br /> <br /> There is a big scene in which Homer tells his boss that he has dedicated the best years of his life. his life to him and has been anything but a mother to him. <br /> <br /> The mysterious angle of the movie is a lot of fun, and the twist in the end can leave you in points. <br /> For a picture of poverty and low budget, this film has superb decoration and great clothing. Director Frank Strayer cleverly deals with his cast and this film joins much better than some of his other low-budget mystery attempts, but he had a great script to work with and some wonderful actors to accomplish it. <br /> <br /> This film is a must see for devotees of poverty films, ancient mysteries of dark houses (they actually managed to work on the lines "It was a dark and stormy night") and has the added advantage of being a the initial representation of a gay character in the movies where nothing bad happens to them in the end. This movie is available for download in the public domain movies section of the Internet Archive on archive.org.
