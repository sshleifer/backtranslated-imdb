I just can not emphasize enough what a lovely movie is. Just <br /> <br /> The memory of this movie now enchants me. If you want to see a sweeping epic of a movie, with wonderful actors in a vivid setting, with a great dialogue, reminding you of the early America. it might have been like [what the world could have been like to come back to <br /> <br /> then] ... well ... I highly recommend this movie. Especially during a time of war and conflict in Iraq ... when our American image is not in <br /> <br /> everything that used to be ... this movie takes you back until the moment we were just getting started. When being an American really meant getting up by your bootstraps and getting going. When the world was such an indomitable and unfamiliar place. Well, this movie has it ... and more. Appreciate.
