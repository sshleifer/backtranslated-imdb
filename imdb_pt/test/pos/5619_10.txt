For many years, Samuel Goldwin tried to bring his friend Jascha Heifetz to the canvas. One night when Goldwyn and his wife Frances were having dinner with Heifetz and his wife, the silent screen star Florence Vidor, Goldwyn proposed that Heifetz star in a movie. After some persuasion, Heifetz agreed, on the condition that his performance was kept to a minimum. And the film, originally titled "School of Music" was born. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite popular: a street boy (Gene Reynolds, who is best known as the producer of "M * A * S *" H "), runs away from home and ends up a school of financially troubled music directed by Professor Lawson (Walter Brennan) .In trying to raise funds for school, the boy and a few other children pass through Heifetz at Carnegie Hall.After a lot of noise, Heifetz ends up appearing at the school concert and sponsoring the school. <br /> <br /> The story, though predictable, is surprisingly well written, although the film contains several small gaffes in which different scenes have been gathered, the most obvious being the young cellist who is sent out of the room of the orchestra and is seen sitting in the orchestra a few seconds later. <br /> <br /> What is not surprising is how good the performance is. <br /> <br /> As usual in the studios, the studio surrounded the inexperienced star with veteran talent: Brennan , Joel McCrea, Andrea Leeds, Hall of Porter, Marjorie Main (after Ma and Pa Kettle), Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey and Who's Who. Actress Diana Lynn and actress Kaye Connor made their debut (uncredited) in this film, as well as Nelson Eddy's long-time partner, Gale Sherwood (as Jacqueline Nash). Veteran children actors Reynolds, Walter Tetley and Terry Kilburn also appear. <br /> <br /> Goldwyn hired Peter Meremblum Symphony, a highly regarded young orchestra from the Los Angeles area, to appear in the film. Most of the children in the orchestra were not actors, but they were excellent musicians and professionals (what many of them would later be). Many of the orchestra's children went on to notable careers: Kaye Connor and Diana Lynn starred in theater and movies, Richard Berres was producer and director, Mitchell Lurie founded a well-known music supply company, Elliott Rapaport became a prominent cardiologist, Lewis Elias was a band leader, Thomas Facey a conductor with different symphonies, Channing Robbins a prominent instructor at Julliard School, his sister Joyce Robbins an instructor with SUNY Stonybrook, and many of the boys in the orchestra pursued music careers with great symphony orchestras. <br /> <br /> Although Heifetz's performance was kept to a minimum, his salary was not. He commanded $ 70,000 for seven weeks. When some scenes had to be re-filmed at a later date, he received an additional $ 50,000 for another four weeks. What was fortunately not kept to a minimum was his musical production. The composer Alfred Neumann (who once was conductor of the Orchestra of Meremblum) dealt with the scoreboard. Heifetz plays "Introductionne and Rondo Capriccioso" by Camille Saint-Saens, his own arrangement of "Estrellita" by Manuel Ponce (with Teddy Saidenberg), Dinicu's "Staccato" (from a Vitaphone recording with Emanuel Bay on piano) , an excerpt from Tchaikovsky's "Melody," an excerpt arranged for violin solo by Tchaikovsky's "Adante Cantabile," his 11-opus string quartet (played during opening credits at the beginning of the film), and the movement final of the E-Violin Concerto by Felix Mendelssohn-Barthody. During all these presentations, there are many close-ups of Heifetz, including some scenes very close to his fingering and inclinations, something that would be of value to violinists who wish to study his technique. The Meremblum orchestra also shines here, performing Verdi's "Dear Name" arias and Bellini's "Casta Diva" (both with Sherwood singing), an arrangement of the opening of "Barber of Seville" by Rossini, a short excerpt from Mozart's "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik" and the previously mentioned Mendelssohn concert (with Heifetz). Diana Lynn can be heard at the bottom of a scene, as part of Nocturne de Chopin in B minor, and one Five-year-old Mary Ruth plays Chopin's popular "Minute" Waltz. In all, this is an excellent film. AMC has shown this regularly until the beginning of 1992. I have not seen it on television in But if you have the chance, I recommend you watch the movie.
