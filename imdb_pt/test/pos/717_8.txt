The movie is not for everyone. Some may think that acting is bad when it is actually underestimated and natural. There are obviously no evil deeds and no beautiful moments. There is a lot of indecision, many conflicting feelings. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie has a very honest view of a very complex subject, Sex with Minors. It's complex because the characters are trying to deal with love and sex when the body and hormones are still developing and their minds and personalities are still developing. Complex also because society has very simplistic views of sex with smaller and complex because the characters do not know if society is right or if their instincts are right. <br /> <br /> Some will not like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions. Questions such as who was really in charge of the relationship, who was damaged, got away from it, was the art, which was more damaged, made some of the problems with their relationship arising from being banned by society, did some problems stemming from their own immaturity, and probably most importantly, was this really a crime? <br /> <br /> The film is decidedly neutral in all of this, and it is this neutrality that is its strength. It is the reason for the discreet acting, the simple sets, the lack of background music, the soft lighting and the overall "flat" presentation. The message is clear. We do not really understand that kind of relationship today, and quick judgments tend to be superficial.
