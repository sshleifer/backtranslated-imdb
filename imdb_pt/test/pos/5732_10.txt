My local PBS station WHYY Philadelphia recently showed "The Elegant Universe". After three hours of watching, besides hurting my brain, I learned all about wormholes, quantum mechanics, and parallel realities and alternate universes. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the show was about "String Theory" Physics, a semi-new branch of physics that makes many of the ideas of science fiction not only possible, but TRUE. With "String Theory" sounds like wormholes, alternate realities and alternate timelines are possible and may only be a matter of time until we get the knowledge to use them. <br /> <br /> Although I may not have given new information to someone familiar with the subject, I find the show very interesting and informative. It was very understandable to anyone who is just being introduced to this subject.
