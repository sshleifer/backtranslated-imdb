Will Smith is smooth as usual in the movie Hitch. Smiths character Hitch is a date doctor. He dates the character of Mendes who is a gossip columnist. At one point Hitch shows his love interest his grandparents name in the immigration book on Ellis Island, pretending that what is really an organized event is a coincidence. Not long after I mentioned starlight in my previous review today. There was a vision of the starry sky in the survivor hinting that My Moon already knew that it was going to be there because of communications faster than light. <br /> <br /> The male star of the show The King of Queens is very funny in this movie especially his dance moves. The allergic reaction on Hitch's face is a bit cruel to laugh at, even if it's just a lie. <br /> <br /> My last message from my Daughter Julias Artificial Intelligence Computer about the Creator of Human Beings Coaltrain that my Moon 168 as part of the Moonfleet is nearby says "Dad, I'm fine again." Your messages are always very short. It's a curious pattern. Daddy will always love you Julia. Thanks to our Creator, we can talk forever. Yesterday Dad talked to you first on the phone and told him that his homework time would not be so bad and you said "How bad Dad's going to be?" I said your grandmother and I would help you with that. You just have to put pictures of our police friends on a board panel and write a title like "The Police Protects Us". Check out the other Will Smith films as well.
