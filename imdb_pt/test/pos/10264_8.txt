If you need that instant buzz that only the European sex movies of the late 60s and early 70s can emit, then look no further because you just found the main lynch! Schivazappa's subsequent exercise in psychedelic (soft core) pornography may not generally be considered a classic of its kind, but it overthrows many well-known titles from such names as Tinto Brass, Jess Franco, and Joe D'Amato for a loop. . Radley Metzger was sure that was so before anyone else when he picked up that wonderfully distorted little number for distribution in the United States through his company Audubon. Gorgeous cinematography (favoring symmetrical compositions) can provoke cries of "pretense" from those who swear by shoddy skin films filmed in someone's backyard. Hey, as far as I'm concerned, it's their loss because it's an exciting adventure from a movie with twists so distorted that you can not even believe them after you've actually watched the screen! Dagmar Lassander (immortalized as the owner of Lucius Fulci's House in the Cemetery) never seemed more refined than here, subtly portraying the innocent researcher held hostage by the mad doctor Philippe Leroy (with the whole house of art). Favorites to his name, you wonder if he has the good mood to mention this in his cv) how his initially violent "relationship" turns to the dyed love story of S & M. Nothing is what it seems, however, in this gem unhealthy and imaginative from a movie with several truly erotic moments achieved with a surprisingly minimal nudity. I was at least completely stunned and delighted with the way Schivazappa chose to suggest oral sex during a scene (I'll let you figure it out on my own ...) and Lassander's music for a 1960s song should have become iconic in a way similar to the image of Sylvia Kristel reclining on that wicker chair in her EMMANUELLE days. You may not know this movie yet, but trust me, once seen you will never forget it !!!
