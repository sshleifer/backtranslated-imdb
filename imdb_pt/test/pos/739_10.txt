Although not mentioned very often, "Do not Look in the Basement" is a very interesting film and definitely worth seeing. The story follows a young nurse, Charlotte Beale, who is hired by Stephen's Sanitarium to replace Dr. Stephens after he is murdered by a patient. Many patients begin to torment Ms. Beale, and your boss, Dr. Geraldine Masters, acts as if you were hiding something ... <br /> <br /> This movie has many attractive characters that you really care about, and you have sympathy for during the climax , which does not happen very often in horror films. The musical score is great and reminiscent of "Dark Shadows", the performance of Rosie Holotik, Rhea McAdams and Bill McGhee are all great, the story is very intriguing with a great end of twist. This movie has an exaggerated atmosphere around it that no other movie I've ever seen was able to capture. Many horror fans have never seen or heard of this movie, which is really unfortunate because it could have been a horror classic. "Do not Look in the Basement" definitely worth watching for all the fans of the drive-in movies of the 1970s.
