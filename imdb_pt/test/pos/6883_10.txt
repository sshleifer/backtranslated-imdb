It is quite simple that those who call this movie something below "decent" do not know their cinema. "The Master Doll" creates a sense of fear and suspense rarely seen in films outside of Asia. <br /> <br /> Think of a mix of "Manga" and "Ringu" into one and that's what it's about. First rate performance, first rate sense, first rate games and effects. This is right up there with the best of Asian horror cinema; Ringu, Dark Water and A Tale of Two Sisters. <br /> An absolute necessity. <br /> <br /> Accept a guy who knows your movies.
