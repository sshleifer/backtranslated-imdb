This super scary Southern gothic melodrama starring Clint Eastwood as a Confederate officer wounded in the Civil War, who is taken over by a school of rural girls and nursed back to health. A strange clash of genres arises, with the supposedly "dangerous" male being the victim of a series of seemingly harmless women, who prove themselves as brutal as the men who wage war on each other's fronts. This is a classic spider and the history of flies, but here there is a solitary fly and a lot of spiders. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page plays the school principal and performs sensationally. Page was trained as a stage actress and appears in all of her performances. No matter what role she played, she was always 100% committed to it, and she never let herself go. So it's here, with this lethal spinster, that takes his sexual repression to this helpless man. Each of the other girls also responds to him in his own way. The two most prominent are the bastard girl who can barely wait to throw herself at him, and the virginal one (played by who else, except the educated Elizabeth Hartman?), Who acts as if she fainted if someone did. as much as he said the word "penis" to her. The schematic Madonna and the prostitute plot would seem cruel if the film did not keep it so unbalanced and so completely unsure of what would happen next. <br /> <br /> The most memorable scene in the movie. film for me occurred when the group of women performed an amputation of Eastwood's leg, which became infected with gangrene. Again, the allusion of the spider / fly is clear: they maneuver it so that it is much harder for it to escape its web. <br /> <br /> A classic cooler. Not a great movie, but a morbid fun. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
