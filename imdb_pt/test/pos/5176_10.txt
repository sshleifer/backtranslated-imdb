The great news is that this movie is now available on DVD from http://treasureflix.com for all those who wish to own it as well as in the video. This is good news as it is one of my favorite movies! <Br /> <br /> I watched this movie for the first time in the 80's and it's a compulsory holiday vision. Living in the picturesque little market town Tewkesbury with its own traditions, recreations and traditions, we are also a welcoming and reserved community. We are now also confronted with large housing estates that threaten to destroy the community and you can see why I love this movie First of all - and most importantly, there are SNOW SLOTS !!!! Then there is the lovely Christmas Tree legend as well as the Christian denouement, while the whole community pays the money to help the poor farmer save his farm and remain in the community. The evil developers - only after the money is sent, the whole city promises its money to help protect what they have, which is very special. I love the way the whole community sends their message to Santa Claus through the mail that is misunderstood by the hero. He and his daughter have a long journey to do after the death of the wife and mother of the family. (There is a likely candidate for this) - even a sleigh ride and most reassuring of all is that the taxi driver whose engine is broken is mysteriously given a new one on Christmas morning and no one had designed it! There's a lovely moment when Denver sings a lullaby and an exciting quest. Great gentle movie for all that Christmas is really about.
