Well, I can safely say I'm human, Wong. And I did not vomit. I laughed. And he laughed. If this movie made you vomit, something's wrong with you. But this movie is incredible. I bought it four days ago and I've seen it five times. Cruelty to animals has my heart, but not enough to be blamed. The movie is shocking, disgusting and vulgar. The acting is horrible. What more do you want from a movie? I am a maniac of obstinate cult films. Pink Flamingos is amazing. It makes Rocky Horror, as someone said, looks like the teletubbies.
