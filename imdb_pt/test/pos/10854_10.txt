As a lesbian, am I sick and tired of being portrayed in the movies and on television as a sad person, always wavering between suicide and murder, but never meant to find happiness? <br /> <br /> If, like me, you're fed up with Hollywood's anti-lesbian propaganda, you'll sigh relieved by this wonderful offer from the BBC. Nan Astley is the daughter of an oyster owner who "wonders why she can not feel what she should for Freddy" (one of the local boys who has her eyes fixed on her). Does she fall ?? and falls hard ?? to Kitty Butler, a male imitator with a visiting theater troupe. Nan accompanies Kitty to London as her dresser? <br /> <br /> Not everything that happens to Nan is nice in this story, and some of the things she does are also not completely clean - but she will conquer your heart, and your triumphant love story will leave you. If you're a macho who hates a lesbian or a homophobic housewife, or some kind of religious fundamentalist who believes homosexuals should die and go to hell, this series is not for you. But if you have a heart and believe in love, you will cry in the end as much as I do!
