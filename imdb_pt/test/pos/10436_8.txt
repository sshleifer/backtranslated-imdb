I saw this movie for the first time when I was 12 years old. It has been one of my favorites since ... It's so perfect in all its full glory with incredible soundtrack, cheese dialogue, and it was both hilarious and terribly sad. The first movie I really had an attack at the end ... I'm not going to ruin everything for you, but it's a weeping boy ... I just remember feeling so sorry for Gary! What a bunch of cool characters in this movie is great !!! They're all so great, even the nerdy girl Gary does not like ... (she had a nice little body). I can not believe all the girls go to Rick, he's such a sloppy ball with the scarf tied around his neck !!! ha ha ha ... While watching this movie, get ready for many full sex jokes with sexually transmitted diseases (almost). But a love story at heart with real issues, ranging from insecurity to life, altering decisions that make you think and feel genuine sorrow for the cast. I love this movie !!! If you like Valley Girl another classic all time you too!
