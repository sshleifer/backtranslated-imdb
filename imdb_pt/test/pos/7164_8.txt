I originally saw this movie as a Blockbuster VHS rental. That was some time ago, but I still remembered. Blockbuster does not have it anymore. Netflix did not have and there were not many copies on the web - just a few VHS copies. Recently I finally found it available in DVD format on eBay for a reasonable price (in PAL format, but our DVD player will play PAL discs on our NTSC TV). <br /> <br /> The wife and I love it. The style of the film is a bit strong, and many, if not most parts, are heavily played as if the amateurs were doing it (especially the kids), but it's not uncomfortable. The contrasts of societies are accentuated in exaggeration. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of political preaching in saying that young people in Russia should not try to escape their not-so-great life, but they should at least try to improve things first. But this is not dominant. He is humorous most of the time. An underestimation of the West commented on by other people is by no means IMO as a commentary on the expectations of the Russian characters. At least when taken from my Western point of view. Maybe it's a western downplay from the Russian point of view (which is literally by the characters saying it). <br /> <br /> I can not say how literally true to the movie the English subtitles are, but I can say that the captions were done very well, full of English expressions as if they were made by a native English speaker - complete with "colorful" language.
