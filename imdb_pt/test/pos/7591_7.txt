Canthony is sure that this short summary is just an excuse to listen to a young Judy Garland (fourteen years old!) Singing with Deanna Durbin, a little older (a year). But I must disagree with everything he or she said, including the run time - which is only about ten minutes, not twenty (a single roll). <br /> <br /> Music is not the best of it, obviously; but it is enjoyable and definitely worth the ten minutes to watch on the Turner. The duet with Durbin is quite interesting: two conflicting styles that, however, fit reasonably well. <br /> <br /> Short is just a disposable, but it does not even come close to being as bad as the other reviewer did. Honestly, I liked it. <br /> <br /> Dafydd ab Hugh
