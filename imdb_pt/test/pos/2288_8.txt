This has always been one of my favorite movies. I owned a copy on VHS, and a few months ago I found a DVD release that is also part of my video collection. I'm also a big baseball fan, and as part of my off-season reading, I picked up a copy of Robert Whiting's excellent book, "You Gotta Have WA," which shows the details of Japanese baseball and the challenges. that foreign players found playing in Japan. When I started reading yesterday, it made me think of this movie because it seems the script was based almost verbatim on this book. The parallels are strange. The character Jack Elliot very much resembles Bob Horner, an MLB slugger whose best days were behind him. Horner's teammate Leon Lee is also represented in the character Max "Hammer" Dubois, a veteran of the Japanese league who has made peace with the frustrations of Japanese football and helps maintain his teammate. The character of Elliot goes through the same sequence of Horner encounters, from big signatures to fanfare, early success that feeds an already voracious sports media and the ensuing crisis that encourages frustration, alienation of teammates, fans and media, and resulting disappointment a desire to return home to the US. The only difference is that the movie adds touches of Hollywood as a love interest and a happy ending. Speaking of love interests, I'm sure many viewers came to this site (like me) to look for the actress who played "Hiroko" (the beautiful Aya Takanashi), and what other work she did. Just list this movie. It turns out that based on an article I read, the brief love scene she has with Tom Selleck (a stranger) in this film (gentle to our standards - basically they kiss while he is in the bath and is wearing a towel) indignation on the part of the Japanese public (men in particular) who never offered him another role of any kind, in films or television - essentially banned by the Japanese film industry. It's a pity, since she's a pretty talented actress in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you liked this film so much for the elements of baseball and cultural differences as I did - find a copy of Robert Whiting's "You Gotta Have WA." A good read and a great companion book for this movie.
