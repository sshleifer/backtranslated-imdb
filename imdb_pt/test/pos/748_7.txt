The incredibly sexy Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale, a new nurse at one of these nursing homes, where the doctor in charge has her own unorthodox ways of treating the inmates. Reluctantly bringing her on board is offensive Dr. Masters (Anne MacAdams, a.k.a Annabelle Weenick). The detainees do not take kindly to Charlotte. <br /> <br /> Part mystery, part horror, this initial effort of BF Film Director BrownFr has an overwhelming feeling. These colorful psychotics, including a nymphomaniac without self-esteem, a gentle giant who already had a lobotomy and a supposed "judge" who speaks in legal jargon, dominate the screen with his unnerving presence. <br /> <br /> It's an image that works very well, setting the mood dark and gloomy from the start. Some brief bursts of graphic violence also help to give this good old exploitative quality. <br /> <br /> It builds in intensity as the endangered heroine struggles to maintain her own sanity by offering one surreal encounter after another. Particularly effective is poetry, quoting old Mrs. Callingham. <br /> <br /> For the cheap cheese of the 1970s, it is quite effective, with a particularly unpleasant climax. I had a good time seeing this. <br /> <br /> 7/10
