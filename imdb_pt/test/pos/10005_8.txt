Maybe I'm reading a lot about it, but I wonder how much of a hand Hongsheng had in developing the movie. I mean, when a story is told as the main character of it, I think it would be a heavy hand writing, documenting, etc. and this would make it a bit biased. <br /> <br /> But. ... your family and friends may also have had a hand in getting the real details about Hongsheng life. I think the best view would have been told from the perspectives of Hongsheng's family and friends. They saw his transformation and were not so confused with drugs that they remember everything. <br /> <br /> As long as Hongsheng is full of himself, the consistencies of Jesus Christ's pose make him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life (metaphorically, of course, he is obviously still alive as he was himself) to the happiness of his family. Huh? <br /> <br /> The viewer sees him at his lowest points and still maintains a superiority complex. He lays down on the grass descending from (by?) A tall man by himself and with his father, he contemplates life and has visions of dragons in his window, he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle while stretching his arms, his head tilted to the side. <br /> <br /> It's fabulous that he's drug-free now, but he's not a hero. He went from a high point in his career to acting at his most vulnerable spot while using drugs to get back somewhere in the middle. <br /> <br /> This same device is used in Ted Demme's "Blow," where audiences empathize with the main character who is shown as a flawed hero. <br /> <br /> However, "Quitting" ("Zuotian") is a film that is recommended, mainly for its astonishing soundtrack, superb acting and landscapes. But the best part is the feeling one has when what we presume to be Jia Hongsheng's house is actually a stage for a play. It makes the viewer feel as if Hongsheng's life is just one piece told in many difficult parts.
