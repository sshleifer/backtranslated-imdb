The sequences are very capricious, with most not close to the stature of the original. Sometimes you find a sequel that is considered better than the original, some critics (like John Charles) have stated that Project A2 is better than the original, I disagree a little, but this movie is still worth watching and if fits well into the production of Hong Kong's brilliant action film in the 1980s, as well as Jackie's own work. I wonder how with such an incredible release of great movies that his later films were not so good. He only directed two films in the 1990s and none past, but he has had a lot of influence on many of the films in which he is not officially the director. <br /> <br /> In early 1987, Jackie had surgery on the brain after a movie. disastrous fall in the filming of Armor of God. This encouraged him to work on his next film close to home. That did not encourage him to stop risking his life and his stunt team for our enjoyment. The result is a big success at home that eclipsed the original at the box office ($ 31 million from Hong Kong, compared with $ 19 million from the original). <br /> <br /> Jackie Chan is once again the extraordinary police officer Dragon Ma and he is ordered to work with Super Warden Chun (Lam Wai, Royal Warriors) of "Three Wan", who is the only Chinese police officer authorized to have a gun, but is believed to be holding prisons to look better and ignore the crimes of a triad. called Tiger Au (Michael Chan Wai-Man, Lord of the Dragon). Apparently, Chun has a lot of power to be knocked over directly, but he is relieved from the district of Sai Wan (now he is "Two Wan") that Dragon Ma assumes. This inefficient and corrupt office will soon have a makeover and there is a big scene in which three officers, who do not know who they are dealing with, try to assault their mother to teach her a lesson about complaining about cops. Soon it has the shape of the ship of the district and the Tiger Au is taken care of. The fight choreography and stunts with Tiger and his men are incredible. My favorite trick was a brutal fall from the second floor into a large pot and this pot did not appear to be soft. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a couple of subplots are happening. There are pirates who survived the first movie they are looking for revenge and food. Then there are revolutionaries, including Maggie (Maggie Cheung in the mood for love) and (Rosamund Kwan, Casino Raiders) who are trying to raise funds for Dr. Sun Yat-sen to overthrow the Qing government as well as government agents who are trying to find these rebels. Add a mix of corrupt cops from Hong Kong and Great Britain as well as the legitimate ones, and you have a stew that's getting too many ingredients, but it still seems to coalesce. This works well when there is a scene influenced by the Marx brothers (the Marx brothers did this kind of scene sometimes, with The Cocoanuts (1929) being the first) at Maggie's house, where everyone is looking for someone hiding from someone else. Many weeks have been spent on this scene and the effort certainly shows. <br /> <br /> There are several flaws in the film. Is there a certain didactic nature that creeps into the movie that seems a bit out of place? especially a short speech at the end that Jackie gives in dealing with the revolutionaries of the Continent and the extremely easy conversion of the pirates who survived the first film. The female characters are once again underused and underestimated, especially Maggie Cheung. I was not as pleased with the continuation of the plot as much as the first movie as well. The individual scenes dominate my feelings for the film instead of thinking of this film as a cohesive whole. I did not criticize the film for not having Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao as the first (I heard the main reason behind this was that those two were filming Eastern Condors but I wonder if Jackie could have waited a little while to do they run it, they would work together the last time the following year on Dragons Forever), but they are lost. <br /> <br /> I found this very enjoyable and successful. made film and is rightly regarded as one of the best comic action movies of the 1980s. This movie is also very good in some unexpected places. The art direction is superb (Eddie Ma Poon-chiu), the costumes are exquisite, cinematography is good and the film looks quite authentic. But acrobatics, comedy and action is what I remember from this movie. There is a chase involving Dragon and Chun handcuffed which is superb (part of the ax pitch scene would be used in Shanghai Noon). The last twenty minutes are full of inspirational hits, falls, peppers like an apple (Jackie writes in his autobiography about how he used real peppers in this scene; you can see him with a lot of pain in the mouth during the outtakes at the end) and it's a worthy conclusion for this movie. The most famous feat of this sequence is its homage to Buster Keaton, of Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928), with the exception of that there is no hole and only a weak section where its head appears. <br /> <br /> Jackie fans and / or Hong Kong action movie makers should consider this a must own and watch. I certainly do.
