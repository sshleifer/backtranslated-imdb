I've never been forced to write a comment about anything, but seeing such bad reviews about such an innovative show made me say something. First, people only need to overcome the fact that voices are different. Once you watch an episode, it never comes back to mind. The humor is original and while, yes, some jokes pass from the film, they are delivered again. Some of them resemble Shrek - self-referential humor. Many of these jokes seem aimed at teenagers or original fans of the film as much as young and younger. Patrick Warburton and Eartha Kitt are both hilarious when they reprise their roles as Kronk and Yzma and their indications to the Annie Award were well guaranteed. <br /> <br /> This show takes some time to love, to really get into the groove. If you ignore the horrible theme song (which really should not justify as much as you judge a show, since it's only 30 seconds of the total product), this show is fun and does not lose any of the spirits from the New Groove of the Emperor.
