Garlin did a great job. Good concept well executed and well produced. It came forward as a very sincere story. As a fan of Curb Your Enthusiasm, where Jeff was practically the straight, I was delighted with the depth he brought to this role in a simple but effective portrait. Much of the humor was subtle and subtle and attracted to pungency, which I really liked, rather than being clowned or super explained. And there were some little surprises and twists. The convenience store vignettes were a delight. <br /> <br /> When I say it's a wonderful "small" movie, I do not mean budget or quality. It is simple, intimate and handmade. He tells a highly believable everyday story. Relax and go see. Let it pass you by and you will feel good for doing it.
