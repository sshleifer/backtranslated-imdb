BLACK WATER is a thriller that completely transcends its limitations (it's an indie film) continuously subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience. In the tradition of all good animal-centric thrillers such as Jaws, The Edge, the original Cat People, directors know that restraint and what is not shown are the best ways to punch . The performances are real and exciting, the crocdodile is extremely well done, in fact, if the Black Water site is to believe it is because they used real crocodiles and the location of the swamp is fabulous. <br /> <br /> If you're after a b-grade gore croc fest play forget Black Water, but if you want a smart ride, suspense you're dreading the water and wondering what the hell would I do if I were up to the tree, so it's a must see.
