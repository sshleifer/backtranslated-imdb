Duchess is a very white cat that lives with its three kittens in the mansion of its rich owner in Paris. When the butler of evil hears that the old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats in the first place, the butler is angry because he wants to have everything first. Then he puts them to sleep and leaves them at the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start a long journey home. A wise street cat named Thomas O'Malley meets with them and offers to help them. When Edgar sees them coming home, he gets furious and starts sending them to Timbucktu. But Thomas's friends arrive to help save the day. The rich lady decides to leave her house for every street cat in Paris. <br /> <br /> This is a lovely movie. The songs, including "Everybody Wants to Be a Cat", are lively and lively. The voice cast is excellent, with Eva Gabor (who would later play Miss Bianca in Disney films THE TRIENDERS) as Duchess, Phil Harris (Baloo in THE JUNGLE BOOK, Little John in Robbin House) as Thomas, giving interesting personalities to their characters. Supposedly Walt Disney, before dying in 1966, gave the go-ahead for this movie. Recommended for Disney fans or cat lovers everywhere! 10/10.
