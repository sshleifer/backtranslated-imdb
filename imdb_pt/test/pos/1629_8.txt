Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called to Rome to help decipher the mystery behind the Illuminati before a new scientific experiment explodes the city. The Da Vinci Code broke records in 2006, but for the vast majority of Dan Brown's followers did not do their award-winning book justice, and although they ran for a good two and a half hours, they seemed to be bored <br /> <br /> After reading the book, I was perhaps one of the few that Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou tried to solve the mystery of the murder in the Louvre, but for Angels and Demons the scale was once again raised as the main star and the director returned. Having asked, most people seem to prefer Angels and Demons to the Da Vinci Code for a fun read and it seems that critics and fans, though not yet fully justified, prefer this latest adaptation to the release of 2006. This photo of Howard certainly a more clinical energy and exercise for him, unlike Da Vinci, Robert Langdon and Tom Hanks as just one night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten Illuminati in the Vatican and because of the limitations of time, action and despair increase the parade and provide an excitement that certainly surpasses Da Vinci's code, but also generates many twists and stunning murder sequences. <br /> <br /> The interesting factor of this 2009 release is that the constant elements are justified by the murders. Earth, wind, water and fire are included in drastic and powerful sequences to express a feeling of general power over the situation. <br /> <br /> This really justifies the thriller tag with constant tension and sharp drama with questions and beliefs once again have given a thorough job. <br /> <br /> As well as 3 years ago, there are many debates and discoveries of symbols that were believed to be lost forever and Langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light within and between the controversy of other pressing circumstances . <br /> <br /> It's fair to say that Dan Brown is a complex writer; he certainly likes to cram issues and dramas between his actions and thrilling sequences. In addition to trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scene of the election of a new pope, the deal with a new scientific experiment and the power of religion is again present. All interesting to discover and listen to if occasionally the debates and dialogues tend to send their mind adrift, but as there is so much in the novel, this has always been likely. <br /> <br /> Ron Howard, who maintained a straightforward type of directional rolling in Da Vinci, returns, perhaps, in the worst possible way. His ever-moving camera style does nothing to keep up the pressure, and we can never fully accept what's happening onscreen thanks to this frankly very portrayed style. He certainly is not Paul Greengrass and this is not Bourne. <br /> <br /> Slick and stylized, this is faster and more interesting than Da Vinci.
