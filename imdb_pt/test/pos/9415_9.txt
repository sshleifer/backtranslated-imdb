One hilarious thing I'm going to say is that I'm not the biggest fan of Seisun Suzuki. I actually saw a good number of his works (thanks to a retrospective that the film festival had) and I found his films just a little bit also directed by Yakuza for my taste. So I went to Princess Raccoon for fear of what I would see. Boy! I was knocked out! "Raccoon" is Suzuki's attempt at a musical, using elements of Japanese opera mixed with many modern elements (Audial and Visual), Raccoon is a treat from start to finish. The lead actor, Joe Ogdari, proves that he is one of the hottest actors in Japan currently in this role. I have to admire that younger Japanese actors still take roles that take place in feudal times of Japan, dressing up in Samurai equipment to full effect. The story itself is a little confusing, if you do not follow it closely, but even if not, get ready for the treasures that Princess Racoon has.
