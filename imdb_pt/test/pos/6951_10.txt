I was really surprised when I came across this movie on cable TV a few years ago. History is a wonderful example of how our earth keeps changing and the struggle to hold it and use it according to need. Conflicting desires of the "people" and government. The actors were fantastic in their performances and I absolutely fell in love with Tantoo Cardinal - she's so believable and was such an important character in this movie as well as Rip Torn. The story was also a love story about the earth, the past and between the two main characters. I tried to buy this movie and could not locate it, but I sure would love to own it.
