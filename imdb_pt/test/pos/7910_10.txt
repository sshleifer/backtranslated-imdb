Finally I discovered what I thought I remembered to be four years old. After seeing the 1960s color version on VHS, I kept saying I remembered seeing her in black and white twice before. Now IMDb helped me know the truth, which was broadcast twice (two productions) in black and white in two successful years, 1955 and 56. These are the ones I remember most when I was four years old. I did not know that the transmission of 56 was not the same as 55. In 1960, I was 9 and the color production did not do that for me. The black and white version was wonderful with the same admiration and wonder impact that today's high-tech movies, even without any computer effect. You had to be there! Please comment if you have had a similar reaction to the black and white version.
