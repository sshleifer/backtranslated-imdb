So let's get started!))) The movie itself is as original as Cronenberg's movies used to appear ... <br /> <br /> My intention to see was certainly JJL being one of my favorite actresses. She's as beautiful as usual, this cute! <br /> <br /> I would not say it was my favorite movie of hers. It's still quite interesting and fun to follow. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is not extremely impressive, but it's not a star-studded sort of thing. ;) <br /> <br /> Recommend with confidence!))))
