Good God ... How this ended up on our DVD player I'll never know ... my wife thought it was a new release that she lost somehow ... Nevermind is a couple of years and in Danish (I think) .. She continued to search for the English soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> On the whole ... the film was not bad ... Good production values, better performances and a clever story that does not do not stay very far of yourself, make a clean and good-humored food on the other side of the sea! The ending will make you laugh ... in fact, the whole movie will. Incredibly strange characters who grow genuinely interested in making a movie that can be worth it ... Without spoiling the plot, the title of the film and the cover of the DVD give you a good idea of ​​where it's happening!
