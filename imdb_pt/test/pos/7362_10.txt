Wow!! My mom bought me this movie because it was for sale really cheap at some store in my town, and she knows I love horror movies. First I looked at the cover and sighed, thinking it was some ordinary B movie trying to be scary. I was so wrong! I made the big mistake of watching alone, my parents and my brother were sleeping and it was too late. After I saw the movie I was so scared that I was shaking ... I did not even dare to go up and take the videotape from the VCR! I slept with the lights on ... <br /> <br /> This main story of movies is about some teenagers getting off the road and having to spend the night in the forest telling scary stories ... The first story is really scary, and makes you hug a really hard pillow if you watch by yourself. The second story is scary too, but not in the same way as the first. The third story (my favorite) is very, very scary. This scared me more than all the stories. It's about a guy who is driving across the country on a motorcycle. One night, when there is a storm out there, he goes to the nearest house and knocks on the door. A girl opens up, and she's mute. I do not want to tell you more, but you'll get chills when you watch (I can add that my heart rate was really abnormal when I watched it). The main story of "Campfire Tales" has a really interesting and surprising ending. I know some guys said it sucks, but I, my boyfriend and my friends love it, and it's been a long time since we've been scared. Rating: 10/10, oh, by the way, it's not like Urban Legend at all is much more scary.
