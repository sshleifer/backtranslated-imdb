There was so much about Little Vera that it was strange to me. After all, I liked this movie, but a lot of the way the characters behaved was not what I was used to. For example, the environment in which Vera's family lived was very tense. Almost every time the family was together, they were drinking, fighting or screaming, and it was often a combination of the three. After seeing the film, I felt tense because of all the confrontation that happened during the film. However, I was very interested in watching the story if this middle class Russian family. Throughout the film, we are reminded of the industrialized state of Russia because of the repeated taking of a train passing by the screen. It gave the viewer a sense of life lived mechanically. The characters seemed to be focused on living their lives through work and drinking after work. There was no feeling of happiness throughout the film. The only time a character was not screaming was when Vera first fell in love with her fianc√©, Sergei. This was very short because the viewer discovers later (after Sergei locks Vera's father in a bathroom and Vera lets him leave after which the father proceeds to stab Sergei) that he is abusive. Again, Vera is informed that the only reason she was born was so that the family could get a bigger apartment. It is very interesting to see how both Vera and the family were able to cope with each other's behavior. The film was definitely worth seeing because of its description of how life could be in areas of Russia.
