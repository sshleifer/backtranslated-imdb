That's ten times better than "Who wants to be a super model" on Bravo I think it's truer for the business. Tyra is strong and sensitive at the same time and is able to get the most out of each aspiration model. The photos seek depth in each of the models, in personality and beauty, strength and demure attributes, and the ability to support and work for what they want. I like to see Tyra's personal experience brought to the photo shoots and the catwalk. I do not always agree with the judges' decision or with Tyra's comments and at least one of the winners, I feel I did not deserve to win. But this is just a show and every girl there is very lucky to have that chance.
