Andreas arrives in a strange and inhuman place, where everything seems perfect. He did a good job, everyone is kind to him and everyone, and he does not really bother to find a beautiful girlfriend. But in this unnamed city, Andreas soon discovers that a perfect business-like world is not really a paradise. Really one of the best movies I've seen this year. The attractive plot is perfectly supported by a clever direction where each component (cold desaturated photography, cold symmetrical design, emotionless acting, slow and highly controlled camera movements) helps in the construction of a unique strange atmosphere that will keep the public suspended until the end . A sarcastic, ironic and bitter comedy that made me laugh and think, as only the best films are capable of doing. Nothing new, probably in the analysis of modern dehumanizing civilization, but really a clever work with great astonishing ideas that will hardly be forgotten of those who were fortunate enough to see it. Simply beautiful the incredible scene on the underground subway.
