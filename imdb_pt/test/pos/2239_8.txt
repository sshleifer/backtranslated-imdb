I was just looking at the bottom 100 movies according to IMDb users seeing if there was anything to review that I still did not have and I found this little gem of the screen. One such occasion when you see a movie rated as one of the worst and you just have to be one of the few that really like. Damn, well, I guess I'll be ridiculed and spit here, but to me that was a good movie when I saw it. It's been a while since I remember that I used to come on HBO late at night and I watched it two or three times and I have not seen it since then and I would love to watch it again now knowing Jolie was in it. The story follows a cyborg and a guy trying to escape the clutches of this corporation and some bounty hunters after them. I think it's basically all there is to it, releasing some scenes with Jack Palance and we have our movie. Some good action here and there, and a little blood and violence as well. There is also a love story at stake, as well as the female cyborg and the guy who trained her to fight sort of fall in love with each other. The dialogue sometimes gets pretty bad at times and it is not by far a top quality movie, but for a b movie it's really good. I do not know if it was a theatrical version because it does not seem to be high enough for that, but it's one of the best straightforward videos, if it were one of them.
