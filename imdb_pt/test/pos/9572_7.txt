I love the mockumentary format that Chris Guest and staff have developed over the years. I really like it and "Waiting for Guffman" better than "Spinal Tap", which was the first of the group (and made by Rob Reiner, but starring Guest and several others of his regular documentaries). This mood is not for everyone. It's a bit subtle and not very physical so some people may not relate. However, as a dog lover (and dog fan), I loved this movie. There are so many funny lines in it! My daughter and I often quote each other. I think it's amazing that these people can improvise a lot of funny material for each movie! What a fun group they should be. I recommend this to people who prefer their mood on the brain side.
