I loved the movie. I loved Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whaley. The film had many different locations. I really liked it when Ann Hampton realized she could not make Rhett love her. And when Scarlett and Ann, where together and Ann apologize for taking Rhett and Scarlett, they just told her not to worry, she'd get him back. There was a great story told. You simply can not compare it to GWTW. There are only so many great scenes. I love both SCARLETT AND GWTW! Of course do not forget to have a handkerchief in hand.
