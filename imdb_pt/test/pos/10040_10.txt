Although "they died with their boots on" is not entirely accurate historically it is a very fun western. Not only is Flynn the perfect Custer, the character actors are superb. In addition to the action part of the film, the love scenes of Flynn and DeHavilland are very touching and believable (Flynn and DeHavilland were very fond of each other in real life). Flynn has always been so tormented that he was not taken seriously if he knew there were few actors who could play the characters he played and play them well!
