I watched this movie for lack of anything else at the time. Quickly the film caught me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars. <br /> <br /> I will not give any spoiler to the plot or result, but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value. Until the last minute I did not know what it would be like. Often you can take the formula and predict the direction of the story. I could not do this with this movie. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this as one of the most refined films of this genre.
