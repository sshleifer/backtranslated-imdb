So glad I got HBO now. I did not plan to watch a movie today, but when I got home and saw that the next movie on HBO was the one I decided (based on the description) to at least give it a try. I'm so glad I decided to watch this movie! Maybe this movie surprised me at a vulnerable time (I'm a bit stressed, I did a great test to study), but it definitely gave me a good perspective of friendship, not to mention that it taught me a valuable lesson about empathy. I'm currently a year away from graduating from pharmacy school and the whole scene involving the doctor and nurse was definitely a learning point for me! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I just wanted to post to let the world know This is an amazing movie and should not be missed. There is definitely something for everyone in this movie!
