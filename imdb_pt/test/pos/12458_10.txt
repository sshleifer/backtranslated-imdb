Before reviewing this film, I must make a confession which is rather a bold statement to become a film critic. Anyone who has ever read any of my previous reviews may know that I have always been controversial in a low-key sense, giving high ratings for such failures as "Captain America" ​​and "Creature" 1985 and featuring classic films like Alistar Sim "A Christmas Carol" and "Shakespeare in Love". With that in mind, this confession may come as no surprise: The simple fact is that Christopher Lambert is probably one of my favorite actors. Wow, now, do not start to get mad at me yet. Let me explain: I do not think he's the greatest actor in the world. I clearly confess that it is not. He's certainly not Morgan Freeman or Anthony Hopkins, but I'd say his acting ability is probably somewhere with at least Bruce Willis. What I admire in him, however, are the human qualities he brings to his action heroes. He is just an ordinary guy who laughs and cries and bleeds, who is a hero because he has to be, not necessarily because he wants to be. It takes a lot, in my view, to be able to highlight these qualities in a character (especially in the films in which he worked), and Lambert's heroes are a far cry from those of Schwartzennegger or Stallone. Frankly, Lambert's characters are easier for me to relate to. So he's not the greatest actor in the world ... He's just a personal favorite. <br /> <br /> I can not say the same, however, for your movies. As much as I deepen his acting, it would be foolish not to confess that his choice of films leaves something to be desired. Most of them are, frankly, terrible, and whatever ridicule he has gained over the years is not due to his acting but rather his poor choice in scripts. With that in mind, I can say that his debut film, "Tarzan," is one of his best films and probably his best performance. As I mentioned, it is effective because of the humanism it brings to the role, and by how seriously the director, writers and actors deal with the material. This is a distant leap from the action adventures of movie B with Johnny Weismeller of the 1940s. Actually, I would hesitate to call it action movie. Instead, it's a serious drama that takes seriously all of E.R. Burrough's material, showing Tarzan's quest to discover his true family in Scotland after realizing that he does not fit like a "white monkey." He is torn between his old family and his new family, which includes a wonderful Sir Ralph Richardson in his final role. In an attempt to adapt to humans, his ape instincts also come into play, and he can not decide what he loves the most: his royal family, or the one he has always known. All in all, it's a wonderful comment on society, and a wonderful study of the character. <br /> <br /> If not, he launched Lambert in international stardom, which continued in the 1980s with such films as "Highlander" and "Sicilian He". Unfortunately, it did not last. But wait a bit ... His latest career moves, such as "Gideon" and "Resurrection", proved that although he still has a long way to go, he is an actor competent enough to be able to ... ahem .... return if he will only choose his roles better. <br /> <br /> For now, however, here's the verdict on your first movie: <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
