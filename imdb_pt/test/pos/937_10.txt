I feel lost, so brilliant is this movie. Kieslowski is a writer, philosopher; and as an excellent filmmaker, his greatness lies in his writing; and "Red" is his paradigm. This film is a metafictional study of the artist's judgment in creating his fictional world; how an artist can try to remake life - even his - through his art, even though he can not escape the knowledge that no matter how he gets involved in his story, it is still fiction and he is still out of his world reworked, still overwhelmed with its unreality and the reality of life that he attempted to artistically remake. And magically, all this is not to the slightest degree, at the cost of a wonderful story about the mysteries of love and destiny and the characters who live this story, this destiny destiny. If I had to choose, I could name this the biggest movie ever made.
