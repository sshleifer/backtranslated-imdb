This wonderful short will hit home with everyone who, as a child, specifically asked something because it was cool or cool, just to get something that would mark you for life with your peers and have your mother or father tell you (or both) that it did not matter, as you sincerely began considering enlisting in a Witness Protection Program in order to avoid ridicule. For US residents who do not get horror because you do not follow hockey, you're like a Dallas Cowboy fan getting a Washington Redskins jersey or a Yankee fan winning a Red Sox shirt. It's not pretty. For our European friends, think of two big rival football clubs (football for us) and imagine a fan of one winning one's shirt on the other. There !!! C's NFB got over here! <br /> <br /> Une hommage du Maurice "Rocket" Richard, merci, M. Richard.
