Critics claim that this movie is one of the worst films of all time. Observers also claim the same. But there is another side to this coin. They are wrong, very wrong. It's the smartest movie I've ever seen ... From beginning to end, you see a story that is unrealistic. A story that reflects the real world. This movie is like a mirror. You see yourself in another way that people see you. To really understand the directors point of view, you have to see this on another occasion ... <br /> <br /> When you see this movie ... Try to understand the story (and watch the background) ... Listen to the lyrics of the song ... And smell the industrial complexes ... <br /> <br /> This movie is unique. You'll hate it (most people do), or you'll love it (and understand it completely). <br /> <br /> Ernest Hemmingway once said: 'The world is a great place, and it's worth it. worth fighting for '. I agree with the second part.
