Writers and directors, by the nature of their craft, take away a picture of the action in their work to show insights about characters and situations. Here, Huston and Joyce retreated an even larger picture to show us the ultimate vision of what it means to be human. By the end of the movie, the movie seems to have nothing more, the kind of typical circumstances that fill daily life. It is not until the end of the final scene that we realize that it is, in fact, about everything. <br /> <br /> You can not watch this final scene without at the same time feeling pity and also deep affection for yourself and the rest of the other beings.
