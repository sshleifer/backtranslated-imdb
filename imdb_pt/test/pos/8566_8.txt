This has to be my guilty pleasure. I'm a big fan of 80's movies that were designed to entertain and they do not mind if they offend someone. This movement has no flesh, no substance, no deep scenes of provocation. Simply old college students having fun and if some breasts have to be shown, then so be it! This movie is for when you just want to relax and not think. Live the nudity!
