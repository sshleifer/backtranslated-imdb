It is hard to imagine that "The Battle of Elderbush Gulch", directed by the legendary D.W. Griffith, was made in 1914. It is a showcase for Griffith's emerging style. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a group of settlers named Cameron Brothers and their families, who include a young waif (Mae Marsh) sent from the east to live with his uncles and a young wife (Lillian Gish) who has just given birth. A group of Indians tries to capture the abandoned dogs' pet dogs and are expelled by the men. During the confrontation, the Indian chief's son (Henry B. Wathall) is killed. The Indian chief plotts his revenge and launches an attack on the small community of Elderbush Gulch. <br /> <br /> It is this attack, which is quite brutal and graphic for this or any other moment, which forms the core of the world. scenario. The Indians massacre the townsfolk, women, and children and drive them out of the city toward the Cameron estate. The newborn baby separates from his mother and all hell breaks loose. Someone asks for help and comes back in time with the ordeal. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes contain some graphic violence. For example, we see a woman being scalped alive and there is also a sequence in which we see a horse being slaughtered. I've never seen an animal being killed so convincingly on the screen. Mr.Griffith was becoming a master at staging large-scale battle scenes, a talent he would use extensively in his epic Civil War drama, "The Birth of a Nation," released the following year. <br /> <br /> Even though he has scarce 29 minutes, "The Battle of Elderbush Gulch" is nevertheless an exciting and historical film. See if you can see Lionel Barrymore and Harry Carey in small parts.
