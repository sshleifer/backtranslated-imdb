I just watched this movie two days ago. A very interesting look for people and our world through the world of wine. I have no special interest in wine, and yet I found this very enlightening. The director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people how they are. While it exposes a lot of things that are below the surface, it manages not to take a stand and leave it to the viewer. He shows a lot of compassion for people (and dogs) and sympathy and lets people tell their story and at the same time expose what they do not want to tell. <br /> <br /> The movie shows us where our world goes, what the benefits are and what the high price we pay. It's a film about love of wine and love to make it great, personal and global, character and formula. <br /> <br /> The real people's stars to me are the older winemakers, with their disillusioned looks. It takes some time to get accustomed to the camera moves and editing, but it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
