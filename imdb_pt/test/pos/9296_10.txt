For comedy to work, there are many factors involved: 1. Do not be afraid to take risks. 2. If someone or something deserves to be ridiculed, do so and continue to do so, but most of all: 3. BE FUNNY !!!! <br /> <br /> "The hunter's war on everything" happens in all three of these things. In fact, the program proved to be so popular and so funny that, months after the first episode, a DVD of the first season was released. I caught it within a few days of being released and fell to the ground laughing and had so many tears in my eyes - It feels so good! <br /> <br /> In short and to save me chattering about the show, watch, buy, do podcast, what will make you watch the best show in the world !!!!! <br /> <br /> Go to the CHASER !!!!
