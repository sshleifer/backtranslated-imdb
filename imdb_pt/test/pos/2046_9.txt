I think Shane Black is one of the greatest writers of all time! He gave us the impressive (at the time) Lethal Weapon, shooting Mel Gibson for super stardom. Then followed with the second best movie Bruce Willis has ever been in (The Last Boyscout). He stumbled a bit with The Last Action Hero, but redeemed himself with this, The Long Kiss Goodnight. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of action movies, this has it all ... Action, Comedy, Emotions, then tops with more action, comedy and excitement. Geena Davies is great, Samual L Jackson is even bigger. Do not miss it! <br /> <br /> 9/10
