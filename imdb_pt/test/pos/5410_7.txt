It's hard to judge 'Imaginary Heroes' without referring to the fact that director and screenwriter Dan Harris is only 25 years old. You can hardly believe in seeing this movie, which is not only a mature, professional and profound work, but also with some of the shortcomings of the specific routine of the older directors. <br /> <br /> The setting is the American suburb, too familiar with 'American Beauty' or 'Desperate Housewives'. As in 'American Beauty' the film revolves around a suicide, but here it happens at the beginning of the movie, and we are watching a middle-class family dealing with the death of the talented sportsman brother and son. Emile Hirsch plays the younger brother, Sigourney Weaver is the mother, both are excellent at dealing with the loss, to find the reason and motivation to survive. Harris directs his actors with a safe hand, and the first two sections of the film (there are four in total, like the seasons) build a wonderful tension with reliable dilemmas and real issues. It's the second part of the movie that's a bit disappointing, looks too tired and conventional, and I suspect the producers may have interfered with the young writer's and director's work, trying to get him closer to the Hollywood convention. This is how this film is not a somber version of 'American Beauty' with a different focus. I am sure, however, that we will hear a lot about Dan Harris in the next few years.
