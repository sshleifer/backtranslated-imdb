I must have seen this movie about four or five times, and it gets better with each showing. Suffice to say: this is the best movie I have ever seen. And I think I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> But I've always wondered why this movie was so avoided in some reviews or ratings. For example, get the Top 250 IMDb. Why is it ranked only at number 216 (as of today)? Certainly, the answer is not in the film itself (because that's nothing but perfect), but at its reception. The film caused controversy in his portrayal of compassion for a convicted murderer and his anti-death penalty attitude. And so, obviously, the most conservative user probably did not like the movie (as you can see from some of the other reviews). So, DEAD MAN WALKING has a rating that is nothing short of ridiculous about its quality. Those people did not understand what the movie meant, and perhaps they did not want to understand, being for the death penalty. So now I understand: it's all political. You're a death penalty - you do not like (and therefore do not want to hear) than the movie has to say. <br /> <br /> I really am sorry that there are still many people out there who simply ignore when a new perspective questions their beliefs. <br /> <br /> Robbins, the problem of your movie divides people's opinions. Some have reconsidered their point of view, some have simply not heard, but you have made a very important point. His film will probably never appear on any "TOP 100 MOVIES" list, but will be remembered long after films like Braveheart or Babe or Apollo 13 (all of which were unfairly preferred over his Oscar film). 1996) are forgotten. Congratulations, Mr. Robbins, and thank you for this important piece of footage.
