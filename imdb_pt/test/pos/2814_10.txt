At first thought, the concept of this show seemed to be a joke and a joke, just for Stan Lee's amusement. I expected nothing more than a voracious and lively version of Barb Wire with low production values, much like those short crap that you see in Adult Swim for short-term fun, but it can never be taken too seriously. Boy, was I wrong! <br /> <br /> Stripperella has even better production values ​​than Marvel Toons. The animation is very good and it seems that they took this series very seriously and gave it a total effort to make it a possible professional production. <br /> <br /> Humor is good too, on the sexy side, suggestive and despicable. It's very similar if not quite like the style of the Simpsons. You can find cliches and lots of predictable humor, but it's still fun. If this were happening today, I would certainly see it regularly. It is surprisingly one of the best toons ever made.
