My kids, DD 7 and DS 10, liked the movie so much they were squirming in their seats. It was good, old fashioned, Rated G, family fun. This movie was made for kids ... someone really understands them. It was fun to see Julia Roberts, Brice Willis, Garth Brooks and the other stars make their appearances. As one who lives in the fictitious "Big Texas" was modeled afterwards, I can say that they made an honest and accurate picture. The kids looked like kids, not like superstars. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone supports this movie to send the message to Hollywood that we need more movies like this. Go and see, then spread the word!
