We went to see Manna from Heaven, my husband, two friends, and I and we all enjoyed the movie. The characters are funny, the story is fun and very much like real life. I think it's what I liked the most, just see something believable, no killings, no science fiction, just good fun and clean. It is something that you can take your children or elderly parents to and not to worry about. How many of these are out there !!
