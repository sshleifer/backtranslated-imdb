See no evil with Kane. The film has a great plot But it was not just a horror movie, I thought it would be the movie that watched WWE Superstars on Monday Night Raw when the movie hit theaters. I liked the movie, although I loved the story that unfolded. <br /> <br /> GREAT EXCELLENT MOVIE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PART 2 <br /> <br /> It does not matter if Kane is murdered in The end <br /> <br /> Or they did not kill other terror stars in all the movies <br /> <br /> They left and still return for more Then a part 2 would be <br /> <br /> Be very interesting.
