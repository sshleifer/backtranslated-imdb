I watched Princess of the Nile for the first time when I was about 10 years old. I'm 63 now and I've never forgotten the movie. I have also not overcome my fascination with Egypt. I searched the internet trying to buy the movie but could not find it. It makes me wonder if this is one of the movies lost in Hollywood. I loved Debra Padget and Jeffrey Hunter together. They have this charisma together. If you asked me anything about the movie, I could not say anything other than who was in it. I vaguely remember a Nile scene with Debra Padget, a lot of other women. I always wanted to see it again. I never thought of it as an escape movie back then, but I can see now where that was probably the case. I hope they put it on DVD and I can see it again before I die. It was a wonderful film.
