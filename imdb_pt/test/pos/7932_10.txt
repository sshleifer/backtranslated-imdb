I learned a lot from previous reactions from viewers. Is there one that does not mention 'propaganda'? Very simplistic. 'Perception is dependent on the concept'. I love Fred Astaire's musicals, the great and great songs and the unparalleled grace of Fred. But comrades, if you see rich, brainless parasites and rich dancing over the oppressed and unemployed, this is a valid critique of "capitalist propaganda." Is any film immersed in the values ​​of its time and place, not to mention those who fund it? the pipers who call the melody. Great art transcends everything, as does "Nevsky" as "All Quiet on the Western front". I confess. I saw this 40 years ago. But the images are burned in my brain. It's the biggest battle scene that will probably be filmed. And that makes you terrified to be thrilled. 'Plastic ice' did anyone say? This is the actual death you are watching. Real extras died doing it. 'Real looking' is now defined special effects. Equally 'too long' - for an age of shrunken attention? Did Mozart have "many notes"? Propaganda, Catholic Church defamed? The Vatican was still there when they asked for old favors to get the German Christian Democrat governor. to recognize Croatia in the 1990s? Remember the chaos and genocides? Forget the props, has Nevsky's illumination painted the medieval world? like a Breughel. There is one in the Hampton Court Palace showing a massacre. Cruel Dutch nationalist propaganda maybe, but it rips in the heart. Stylized performance? So what is Henry V (Olivier's movie)? Naturalism? Does anyone believe that the medieval English knight-killers spoke like that? As said, Prokofiev's music is magnificent. Only Ken Russell & Eisenstein had the balls and the genius to match sound and image at this 100 octane level. OK, you want the snaffle & bit. I'll risk the twisted nervously each time. Eisenstein did not copy the Wehrmacht helmets, on the contrary, his model seems to have been those buckets used by the "Teutonic knights" in Nazi contests of the 1930s. Eisenstein was a genius, but unlike the Hollywood directors, he had time and unlimited (non-commercial) funding. Modern Russian directors are free from political fetters, but they have no money. Even Kurasawa had to make a great film in communist Russia. He was revered but not funded in his own country (much like Russell). How much propaganda is in the eyes of the beholder? Imagine healthy people from another world who love peace. How would they react to Nevsky? Would battle or mourning for the dead dominate their cognitions? If we did not know about the gas chambers and SS, what about "Triumph of the Will"? Where can I get a cheap Nevsky DVD?
