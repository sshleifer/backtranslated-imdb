After repeatedly saying how bright are so many episodes of Columbus, it's time to honor an episode with the maximum of points. "Etude In Black" is not 100% perfect, but it certainly is over 90% ... maybe 96 or 97! <br /> <br /> Last week I reviewed "Just Married" and compared unfavorably to "Meet The Parents". Well, here's one of the parents, Blythe Danner, in a much earlier role as the wife of the famous orchestral conductor Alex Benedict, played by the legend that is John Cassavetes. Alex has had an affair with Jennifer Wells, an orchestra girl (not her first case, it is suspected). She is blackmailing Alex to leave his wife, but since his wife's mother holds the strings of the orchestra, Alex does not think it would be such a clever move to destroy his career and his marriage overnight. Instead, he creates a plan to leave the concert hall before a performance and murder his young mistress while making it look like a suicide. <br /> <br /> Enter Columbus and guess what? It takes about two seconds to realize that homicide is more likely than suicide. It does not take much longer for Columbo to connect Alex with the victim, and he follows him no matter where he goes. Even if Columbo is certain that Alex is his man, it does take some time and some false leads (none of which Columbus actually swallows) before he has the vital evidence. <br /> <br /> There are some extra high-level characters from Jennifer Wells's young precocious neighbor to the English mechanic who sounds like he's more at home on Coronation Street than the dirty brass player see prepared for the murder (he was also seeing Jennifer Wells, the busy girl!). And there is even a brief participation of Commander Lassard in the films of the Police Academy. As with Leslie Nielsen in "Lady In Waiting," it's impossible to take him seriously (I bet you're thinking of that speech he made on the podium, is not it?) <br /> <br /> But it's Blythe Danner, John Cassavetes and Peter Falk, who steal the show here. Blythe is absolutely divine as is Mrs. Benedict. From the moment she sees Alex dialing Jennifer Wells' number from memory, she feels deeply disturbed by exactly what their relationship was. It's a masterful performance as she struggles to trust Alex, though her intuition tells her that something is very, very wrong. Columbus does not help at all by interrupting his tennis game to ask naughty questions about Alex's relations with members of his orchestra. <br /> <br /> As for John Cassavetes, well, it's a shame he did not do any repetition. appearances as Columbo's villains because he could have been up there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the show's greatest ever. But this performance is excellent! He is another who falls into the category "highly irritated," losing all patience with Columbus, instead of pleasing and satisfying. Nevertheless, when the game finally ends, he grudgingly recognizes Columbo's genius. <br /> <br /> Well, it's a really fantastic show. He loses two very small points for his rather evil view of classical music, as highlighted by many of the posters here, but none of them has any influence on the logic of history or characterizations. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting! <br /> <br /> Finally, if you do not come across this, there's an absolutely incredible clip from John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on Dick Cavett's show from the early '70s. I'm totally convinced that Steve Coogan watched this clip and based Alan Partridge on it. Everything about the clip resembles "Knowing Me Knowing You," from the incredible introduction to Cavett's total humiliation by his guests. Even the orchestra comes into play, playing circus music while Falk, Cassavetes and his friend Ben Gazzara play and ridicule the host. <br /> <br /> It may not be strictly relevant to this criticism, but the Cavett clip show gives a good insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes. It is clear to see from the quality of "Etude In Black" how well the pair worked together!
