Tired of current filmmaking, particularly from American cinema, I've been struggling to see Oscar-winning foreign films. That's when I came across this gem. Slow to start, it picks up well when war is declared. Basically, a story of an old-fashioned girl - wait for a boy to come back from the war, the performances, the cinematography make it so much more than that. Why Tatyana Samojlova as the young woman did not become an international star after that being beyond me (though she has continued to succeed in her own country). You take the journey with her: young, defiant and impetuous young woman who, through the devastation of war, becomes a very sober and somber woman who holds a glimmer of hope (her final scene is devastating). We love it as much as the camera does. And camera work! Was this the pioneer in manual camera work? This really adds an immediacy to the story. And the beauty of it (as when Tatyana's character is climbing the stairs and next to a slatted fence). I am humbled and grateful to see this movie.
