I thought this was the most interesting movie that JCVD ​​did in a long time. I loved your character and the whole thing with the rabbit set a different tone for this movie. IMHO, JCDV may actually be on something going forward. A little more lighthearted, some obvious homage to other films, mixed with some great fights ... I would like to see more of this style of making his films. One of the other posters thought the bar scene was a Desperado. I immediately saw the connection of R. Rodriguez as well, but I thought it was very clever and made me want to see the movie again to look for more subtle clues from other films. JCVD rocks !! <br /> <br /> Other things after reading other comments: <br /> <br /> No music in the dungeon fight? At first I did not like it, but then I found it interesting because it got me a bit unbalanced giving us something we did not expect. I made it seem more real. <br /> <br /> I also always laugh when directors cry like 2 year olds that their movie was "stolen" from the studio. Directors are paid to do a job. The studio is the boss and they want the product they want. Very few directors have an absolute final cut in a movie. In this case, the JCVD ​​is the talent and the only reason someone is watching this movie. I'm sure he got a movie that he was happy about. I have a relative who works at a post office who knew a little of the story. PRESUMPELY, the director worked and handed out his film cutout. Everyone who saw the movie said it was a disaster ... so JCVD ​​and the studio reviewed the movie. This happens all the time. He also saw the final cut (which he claims he did not) and his ego "delicate genius" was severely injured because he hated the cut delivered. If this director was clever, he should have received credit for this, since it would have been his best.
