I was skeptical before going to this because of the horribly mounted trailer, which made it look like an equally awful movie. I was very surprised how much I did not waste my money. I believe the success of the movie comes from how scary it really is and how the ambiance of the house is. Small things, like sensor lights, create a real sense of discomfort. The shadows and the sinisterly cold feel of the house make it easy to say that no matter how much you know about horror movies, anything can happen in the movie. The acting is not perfect, nor is it bad. The main character is convincing, even given the annoying teenage dramas surrounding her. In the end, I was completely impressed with the film in most ways. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a movie that I would recommend.
