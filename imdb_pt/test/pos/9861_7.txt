OK, if you judged the movie now, it would not fit right. If you watched FI now, the stage and everything was too much cheese (I agree) But there were not all the movies in the 80s so (Gilligan, Wonderwoman, aso). But also people born in the early to mid 70's or earlier, have a cult status. Evertime the plane was in approach Tattoo would run until the tower ring the bell and with its accent would scream "From Plane Plane BOSS" and you would wonder what would everyone's desire. People who are born in the mid-80's or later I would not understand the hippie because if you watched it now. He does not have an animation FX from Harry Potter, Jurassic Park computer. It was just a phase where you could probably even see the wire stuck to a guy who wanted so much power to fly. But for us during that time it was a ISLAND OF FANTASY.
