This movie is truly an 80's classic! A must have in any collection of 80's movies! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS !!!! <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie ever. Tons of non-stop action! <br /> <br /> And continuing with the 80's classic "bad guy vs. good guy", this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson knocking down bad guys and CREEPS with a 30 caliber Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY DUTY MACHINE GUN TO CREATE! When Charlie runs out of ammunition for the heavy machine gun, he runs back to the crib and takes up arms with his long-range high-caliber pistol! This pistol can stop a freakin 'ELEPHANT and Charlie is putting hole-sized holes in thugs with him! And if that's not enough, Charlie is also packing an anti-tank grenade launcher, which, by the way, is only good if he manages to put the CREEPS together. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is "ha ha" great and a lot of actors off the wall (mostly playing CREEPS) appear throughout the movie! The movie is loaded with memorable scenes and scenes! Heck, my favorite scene / scene is where the CREEP leader confronts Broson in prison and calmly explains to him: "Say what I'm going to do ... I'm going to kill an old lady ... just for you! news from six. "<br /> <br /> Is this movie violent? Of course yes! But, you will laugh and shrink all the way !!!!
