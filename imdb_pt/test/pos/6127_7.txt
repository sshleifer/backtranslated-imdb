A very strange, disturbing but intriguing film. I do not think I've ever needed to see what a human being can do with his ass, and I doubt I ever want to see him again. That being said, there is plenty to have fun with, such as Divine's interpretation of Jayne Mansfield's classic ride in "A Girl Can not Help" and putting pieces of meat between her legs in a grocery store. A brave one looks a lot like a Russ Meyer movie. Usually bad acting, with the notable exception of the Divine.
