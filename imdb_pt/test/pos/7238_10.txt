This movie is truly unique. It really captures the spirit of the play, but makes it fun for the modern generation. The romance between Tromeu and Julieta was believable and erotic, not attracted by many adaptations. It's also so funny that I was almost crying from laughing. <br /> <br /> As most of Troma is in his face, taboos, gore and sex matters, and still add some very good acting and a Shakespeare plot. You really have to see this movie to believe it! <br /> <br /> There are a few hillarious jokes in the credits (the best credits I've seen since Hot Shots), mounds of Troma in jokes as well as general satire and shakespeare. refs. And Lemhead from the House of Motorhead narrates. I loaned this film to a friend and I had an almost impossible job to get it back. Troma at its best, this movie is really a gem, and goes in my top 5 favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Although it's not the kind of movie you watch with your mother, and it may offend some people. For anyone bored with running the mill cinema, with a crazy sense of humor you MUST SEE THIS MOVIE.
