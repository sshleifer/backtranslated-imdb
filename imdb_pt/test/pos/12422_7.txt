Two guys from the city are driving through Hicksville, USA, when a rusty monster truck suddenly appears and repeatedly tries to get them off the road. Having picked up a mysterious blond hitchhiker, they stop in a truck full of amputee hicklains, one of them warning them of the 'demon out there'. But they do not listen. Big mistake! "Monster Man" by Michael Davis, mixes comedy and horror surprisingly well. The film borrows heavily from "Duel", "The Blair Witch Project", "Jeepers Creepers" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". ". The story is very silly but there is nore enough and violence to keep the freaks happy. I especially liked the performance of Justin Urich who offers the film his comedy relief.Still the complete lack of suspense is hard to forgive. This is a chance, if you have some time to waste. 7 out of 10. Did I mention that Aimee Brooks is sexy?
