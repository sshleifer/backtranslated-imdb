Greystoke is arguably the best tarzan movie I have ever seen. Christopher Lambert portrays a very believable man trying to return to the world of humanity alongside the fantastic Ian Holm. John's struggle to leave the jungle and the monkeys that created him is quite exciting. Some very memorable scenes, including where Lambert makes the noises of the jungle for romantic interest, and the scene in which he witnesses the death of the ape-like father. Tarzan's feelings for both worlds are well developed and really make you feel for him. <br /> <br /> An excellent and underrated film.
