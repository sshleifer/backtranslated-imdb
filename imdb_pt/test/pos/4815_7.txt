*** SPOILERS *** Well done and interesting movie about the alienated youth of America in the 1950s. At that time, many parents were struggling to make big money and live on high forget that their children, especially teenagers, needed a lot more than a car and a large sum to feel part of the family. They also needed love and attention for their growth problems, which is what Hal Ditmar, 16, James MacArthur never had of his successful film-making father, Mr. Tom Ditmar, James Daly. <br /> <br /> Never really connecting with his father Hal grows ever further from him and his loving mother Helen Ditmar, Kim Hunter, as well as from society. After his father put Hal on him wanting to lend his luxury sedan sedan, he and his friend Jerry, Jeffery Silver, direct Hal's beating and 1930s ceviche to the local handler to pick up the latest movie west. <br /> <br /> Feeling like attacking the world Hal acts like a true first-class idiot sticking his stinking feet almost into the face of a couple, Eddie Ryder and Jean Corbett, seated in front of him and Jerry trying to watch the movie. This leads Hal, as well as his friend Jerry, not only to be expelled from the theater, but with him surrounding theater manager, Mr. Grebbs, Whit Bissell. It turned out that at least Hal was willing to leave the theater, even without having his money back, but when Grebbs tried to grab him, Hal swiveled and girded him well into the kisser. <br /> <br /> Hal now in real hot water, he is accused of assault and battery, put on his act "James Dean" at the local police station, making him either very cool or just plain stupid to realize what he has done; almost overthrew Mr. Grebbs. It's when Sgt.Shipley, James Gergory, tells Hal that his father is going to pick him up when he finally gets sober with the fact of what he did. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie has Hal trying to straighten up, but is unable to do so because the low regard his father has for him. Begging his father to understand that what he did by singing Mr. Grebbs was in self-defense, Hal's father acts as if he were there in the theater, and saw the whole incident with his son Hal acting like a thug street instead of. It is not excusable what Hal did, in planning Mr. Grebbs, he was actually willing to admit his vandal behavior, but he wanted both Mr. Grebbs and Mr. Halbbs. his father at least treat him with a shred of consideration; Gebbs in the fact that he provoked Hal and Mr. Ditmas into not bothering to hear it! Feeling like a wanted criminal with no one but his mother, to really turn around too much Hal slowly loses only to later have both the sergeant. Shipley and Grabbs agree to give up the charge of assault. You'd think Hal had finally learned his lesson, but the real lesson, more than a stretch behind the bars, that Hal so desperately needed was a lesson his father totally ignored! Being there when his son needed him most and Mr. Ditmar failed in bright colors. Things really work out for everyone in the movie only after Grebbs is surrounded, ending with a Butte of a Shiner, again by Hal, who, returning to Grebbs' theater, tries to convince him to call his father and tell him that Hal was only defending himself when he, for the first time, did not defeat him for the second time. In the end, Hal learned a real lesson in getting along with people and not letting their problems become other people's problems. But most of all, Hal's father, Mr. Ditmar, learned the most valuable lesson of all on how to understand his frustrated and alienated son and act like a father toward him instead of a combination of jailer and daddy. As the song says "All you need is love" to put things on the right track and was both love and understanding to his son Hal that Mr. Ditmar, by the end of the movie, did not have much experience.
