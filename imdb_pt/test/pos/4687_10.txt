I watched this series on PBS in the 80s and I still watch the old tapes every two years or so. Very atmospheric and scary at times. This is a very good show because the characters are well defined and acted. You are drawn to the plot and come to take care of these people. The villains are almost ridiculously bad, especially the sheriff of Nottingham. Dude, I'd love to wipe out the grumpy little bastard. Nicholas Grace does a great job and must have had a lot of fun being the Sheriff. Your boy whipped, Sir Guy, is equally sarcastic, but he's pathetic, too. Lots of murders and chaos in this series, along with tons of black magic and devil worship and stuff like that. I noticed you won a prize for children's television, which is amazing. If I had children, I would not let them watch it. Great use of venues in this show too. It's now on DVD, so go out and buy it.
