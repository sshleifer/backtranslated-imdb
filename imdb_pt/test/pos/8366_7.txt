Shuai is a young and burly Beijinger with a punk haircut, who makes a living selling cheap books from a tent in an internal market. He did not seem to have anything in common with Zhang, the so-called middle-aged, lean intellectual - and yet the two end up together in a restaurant discussing the pros and cons of murder (the Chinese title may be better translated as' Talk It Over '). If that makes it look like a pedestrian, do not be fooled: this movie is profusely inventive in its plot, and most often runs at breakneck speed (though the pace ticks quite a bit to the end). <br /> <br /> If you only know Zhang Yimou's worthy historical dramas like Raise The Red Lantern and Shanghai Triad, or his latest martial arts epics, Hero and House Of Flying Daggers, you'll be surprised; In fact, any of your other films you've seen, you'll be surprised, pleasantly surprised - this is by far your most original, quirkier, more experimental work. It was filmed within a few weeks on a minimal budget, almost entirely in Beijing (and making use of many ordinary citizens in the smallest supporting roles - there is even a brief involvement of the director himself), and especially with a little hand. held the camera in a hyperkinetic style that is a million miles from the elegant formalism of his best-known films. <br /> <br /> OK, I live in Beijing, so I find an additional pleasure in all the little bizarre details of everyday life that I'm beginning to recognize and appreciate (even if it was filmed in 97, and things are changing so quickly here), but I really think this movie can be enjoyed by anyone. I have seen, as I have so many other Chinese "comedies," in a movie club that exhibits subtitled versions of recent Chinese films for an almost exclusively expatriate audience; and it's the only one I can remember where the audience was laughing loudly. Some non-Chinese audiences may find this a bit strange, sometimes a bit uncomfortable, as it includes some violence, and, after opening as a bizarre and unusual romantic comedy, it becomes something much darker in the second half. It is, however, very, very funny. <br /> <br /> He is also superbly represented on both tracks, especially Zhang Yimou's long-time collaborator Jiang Wen, who is probably the most important movie star in mainland China. screen presence reminiscent of a young Depardieu or De Niro. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie - to prove that the Chinese have a sense of humor that CAN translate to other cultures, to prove that Zhang Yimou is far, far more than a one-trick pony .. And for a long time.
