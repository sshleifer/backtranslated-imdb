'The Big Snit' came into my life completely and left an indelible mark on my soul. A scar of love, destruction and uselessness that will forever be a part of my life. This is the tale of beautiful futility. We are helpless without the other. We are powerless against the mistakes made by the government. We are helpless about the choices we all try to make when we are in love. Deaf to the murmurings and events of a world outside the window. Blinded to an inevitable apocalypse. I mute the hatred and greedy opinions of an overindulgent society. This is a tale of personal commitment and triumphant love defeating the ideologies of war. His petty quarrel is a sublime observation of human nature and of how love comes with its pains and darkness. Everyone has some annoying aspect in their personality and this is observed by the creators in the most simplistic and fantastic way. We travel only a short distance away with the two main characters, but we are left wanting to complete our own journeys with a little of their simple, loving and honest philosophy in tow. I am very happy to exist in this 'our time'. Another 20 years on either side of my date of birth, and I would not have seen and felt .... .... The Big Snit. William White. Sheffield.
