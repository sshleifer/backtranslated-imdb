Seeing that this movie was on the IMDB Bottom 20, I simply had to rent it. <br /> <br /> SURPRISE! SURPRISED! I do not regret seeing this movie. In fact, I really enjoyed it. There is a camp level in this movie that puts shame on the cult classics of the '80s. Is that stupid? yes, but Jim Wynorski proves that stupidity is not necessarily bad at all. <br /> <br /> Rent for a laugh that seems unintentional, but that is actually to be funny. Wynorski is a genius. I hope he directs the next ninja turtle movie
