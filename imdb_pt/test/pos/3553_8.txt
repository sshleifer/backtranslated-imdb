Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa was actually stolen once and disappeared for almost two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's "La Gioconda" (better known as Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a thief (and former employee of the Louvre) who allegedly attempted to return the world's most famous work of art to his native Italy. His actions after the robbery make it appear more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal gain. (Of course he had no hope of finding a buyer.) The Mona Lisa returned quietly to the Louvre on the last day of 1913, remaining there ever since, except for occasional loans. When "Arsène Lupine" was released in 1932 (twenty years after the robbery), most viewers would have remembered the crime of 1911, and their knowledge would have lent some plausibility to this film. "Arsène Lupine" is quite nice, with the usual MGM production standards and the usual efficient direction of Jack Conway. This film does not lack for pleasure; what is lacking is plausibility. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is the master criminal of the title: he is expert in perpetrating "impossible" crimes, which makes it even harder to warn them in advance ... but of course he always commits the crime and deceives the gendarmes. Tully Marshall has a good scene as one of Barrymore's victims. Lupine has a crush on elaborate costumes, which allows Barrymore (a US class A ham) to satisfy his penchant for foolishness. John's older brother, Lionel Barrymore, is Guerchard, the detective Surete sworn to capture Lupine. Karen Morley was an extremely beautiful actress whose private life was full of populist political activities; on the screen, she was more impressive in working-class roles that fit her own political beliefs (such as her great performance in 'Our Daily Bread'). In "Arséne Lupine," Morley's naturally dark hair is bleached in a horrible blond tone, and she's all decked out in fancy dress that makes her look uncomfortable rather than sexy. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS. Eventually, Lupine decides to steal the Mona Lisa from the Louvre. He cuts the painting from its frame, wraps the canvas, and then arranges it in a basket of flowers. We see John Barrymore casually brandishing a well-rolled piece of cloth that is supposed to be the greatest work of art in all of humankind's history. I had to laugh at the filmmakers mistake. In real life (but not in this film), da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa on a wooden poplar board, so a thief would have a hard time lifting it! <br /> <br /> Eventually, Guerchard catches Lupine and pulls him. for Le Calaboose. The scene between John and Lionel Barrymore in the police car is pure joy, as the genuine affection they feel for each other overflows in the dialogue of their characters. I would have found this scene implausible with any other two actors. As it is, I can not imagine anyone but the Barrymore brothers playing these roles. Well, maybe Dennis and Randy Quaid, but only for little. <br /> <br /> Do not look for a good plot here, but "Arsène Lupine" is a delightful example of making old movies. I will rate this movie 8 points out of 10.
