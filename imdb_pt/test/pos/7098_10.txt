Despite all comparisons with House of Frankenstein, this film surpasses its predecessor and is one of the funniest monsters in the Universal Monsters series, and unfortunately the latter. It's ok. so it does not exactly compare to something like the Bride of Frankenstein as a classic to be revered by fans of all the movies, but with a cast of Dracula, The Wolf Man and the Frankenstein monster (What? No Mom?) you can 't help, but enjoy this schlock fest! And unlike the House of Frankenstein, the monsters in this movie interact much more. But this film also offers some unique story lines for Dracula and the Wolf Man, who both go to Dr. Adleman to heal their afflictions. While the Werewolf actually finds a cure, Dracula injects his blood into the doctor and that's where the real fun begins! I highly recommend this movie to fans of classic horror movies. But remember, I never said it was good, just fun.
