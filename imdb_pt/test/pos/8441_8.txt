Large Corporations Vs. Conscious Do good. We seem to witness events (both in real life and life in drums) of this kind all the time and most often greed wins by employing all the necessary (dirty) means and the truth is suppressed. At least in this film Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) has his views and pays dearly. We have seen several other such films being made in recent years, of which the most memorable was "The Insider," where Russell Crowe portrayed a tobacco industry scientist who tried to report allegations that the industry added more nicotine to cigarettes. make smokers addicted. There was also that reporter-protagonist angle in which the reporter is looking for the hole of his dreams and the protagonist is faced with this moral dilemma in which he / she must choose between uprightness and his livelihood and sometimes his life. Jane Fonda interpreted reporters Kimberly's wells to perfection. She plays a reporter who wants to give serious news, while her bosses value her more as an "Eye-Candy." She and her crew (post-'Coma 'cameraman Michael Douglas, who is also the producer of the film) witness an accident at a nuclear power plant while on a visit. Cameraman Michael Douglas sneakily / illegally gets footage of this event on tape, despite being a non-photography zone and smuggling out of the station. The station refuses to air it and informs the corporation that owns the nuclear station. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, chief engineer Jack Godell launches an investigation on his own and discovers many irregularities in the equipment being used for the reactor. This starts the whole dirty policy of corruption and greed. <br /> <br /> This is a good thriller and managed to create a lot of tension in the audience until the end, and the funny thing is that there was no background score. to suggest all the scary moments. Now this is great and unusual in movies. Performances were all good and I love Jack Lemmon. We know him mainly for his comic roles, but he is equally good at dramatic roles. I give this movie an 8/10.
