Help the best movie by far. Very funny, very surreal. If Bunuel made a movie starring Buster Keaton as Krusty the Clown, it would look like this. <br /> <br /> Brilliant cast presentations that we already know from other Schneider films, especially Helmut KÃ¶rschgen as the companion of 00Schneider. (Andreas Kunze, who again plays the wife, is a bit annoying). And of course Helge himself as Nihil Baxter is absolutely incredible. Q: If this movie had adequate merchandising, I'd really like to buy a replica of that painting "Holz ist."
