All the people who voted as thin 1 in this movie, that's all I have to say: you have not matured enough to enjoy this kind of movie. It takes a certain amount of dedication to reach that level of appreciation. And that's the segment of people this movie was directed to. You're not an average movie goer by any chance! . Back to the movie. This was a definite treasure and definitely an inclusion in the Bollywood Hall of Fame. I would give a rating of all time, surpassed only by the legendary Gunda of Kanti Shah. This film had an impeccable plot and created a beautiful blend of fantasy and science fiction. Pan's labyrinth would, in fact, be ashamed of the balance created between parallel histories. And now I really need to mention the stellar cast and even the stellar performances (that's a NOW word) from them (a special mention goes to Mr. Nigam for the best premiere of all the Earth's movies). All the actors in this film were chosen very carefully and the role was tailor made for them (and also for their age, I might add). Manisha Koirala still seems like she's 18 and wow man, with that figure I would have raped her too. Are you wondering where this rape thing came from all of a sudden? Yes, a rape is what the premises of this movie are based on. And that's not like your kind of Bollywood movies. If you are an atheist or an agnostic by accident, this movie is again a must for you. Because this movie can heal your faith. I do not think it would be too far to say that this movie can cure cancer. Only the people who need it most fail to appreciate its power, charm, and immortal beauty. Tchch, so unhappy! <br /> <br /> Just fail in this movie: In your dreams, baby! That was flawless. <br /> <br /> Just a small complaint: the director also failed to star Mithun Da. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin anything else for you. Just go and watch. TODAY. And if you like, here are some more recommendations from me. Gunda, Desh Drohi, Aparichit, the old horror films of the brothers Ramsay, Loha, Indra, the Tiger and Sivaji.
