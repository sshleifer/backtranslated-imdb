Tim Robbins did a masterful job directing this movie. I say this because he avoided conventions and clich√©s. He also oversaw superb performances by Susan Sarandon (who won an Oscar for her role) and Sean Penn. Even more surprising, Robbins does not patronize. He just tells the story and lets the events touch the viewer's mind. This is so effective because it allows the viewer to form their own opinions on the death penalty, one of the most controversial subjects of our time, without being unfairly manipulated in any direction. I can not recommend this movie enough, 9/10.
