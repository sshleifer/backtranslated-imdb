I saw this movie last night and I thought it was decent. There are moments, I think you would say. Some of the scenes with the special forces were cool, and some of the sites were very authentic. I will not be putting this movie in my DVD collection, but it's fair enough to recommend it for rent. I think nothing has defined the film on another level compared to others of the same genre. The action is good, the acting is decent, women are extremely seductive and exotic, and the story is very interesting. Dec 7
