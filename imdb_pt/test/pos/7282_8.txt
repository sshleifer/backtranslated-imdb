I was pleasantly surprised to find a very nice film that kept my attention. I'm a horror fan and I see almost everything in this genre, but Dead Line could scar me. The pace is very smart and Andr√©s Bagg performs well as a desperate man. What's underneath the main plot? A trip to madness. How can you end up like this? Martin Sanders asks himself as he sees a homeless man talking alone, alone in the street. Near the end of the movie, the character of Aaron Mandel asks the same question while watching another homeless doing the same thing; not knowing, yet, that this homeless is Martin Sanders, answering the question of the beginning of the film. The broken glasses in two are a clear symbol of breakage and division ... of personality. The end is jaw-dropping and you just know that a sequel would have to be made.
