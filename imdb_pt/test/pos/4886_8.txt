Having seen only five episodes of the show before that, (I've been watching replays on BBC Two) I did not really have much experience of the League, but as a novice fan as well as a big fan of British comedy, I can say that this movie is hilarious. Seeing Herr Lipp, (which I had not seen on screen before the movie), Briss and Geoff on the big screen was a great comedy experience. Being on the screen is something that the League takes advantage of, with heads exploding, (it will be a surprise who it is) and terrible murders with random battles in the Middle Ages style until the end. <br /> <br /> Geoff is easily the funniest character of the three protagonists of this film because he has the best liners and general behavior as well as the series. One of my only disappointments with the film was not to hear Geoff yell "Well, now I have this gun", even once, (even if there is an accumulation in a part of the film). , to use the phrase that everyone does, Pythonesque and reminiscent of films like "Life of Brian". The appearances of Tubbs and Edward were welcome, but Papa Lazarou's "Hello Daves" speech left me more than anything said by them (Lazarou is probably my favorite character of Vasey after Tubbs and Edward). character being killed and I can only hope this is not the last Vasey on the screen. With Gatiss mentioning the possibility of another series or movie, I am now very excited. This is a movie I will see again, partly because the projector died in the end, leaving out about 10 minutes of the movie, but mainly because it is creative and hilarious. I'm not really bothered if it's not as good as the TV series because I loved it. <br /> <br /> One thing, if you've never seen the League, you'll still love it, but Dave knows what you're going to think about the people who invent these things. As Tubbs or Edward might say, it's a local movie, for local people, and a precious thing in that. <br /> <br /> **** out of ***** (4/5)
