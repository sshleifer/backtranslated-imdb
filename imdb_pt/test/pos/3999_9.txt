What movie! I've always liked the Asian style of filming, and this movie does not disappoint at all! The photograph is breathtaking, ranging from incredible landscapes to swirls of color. The lead actor is really realistic when representing the painter (whose paintings are amazing). The ending is also very well chosen, very poetic. The only observation is that they may have shown a little more deeply the connection between their inspiration and their abuse of alcohol and women. But overall, this is a great movie!
