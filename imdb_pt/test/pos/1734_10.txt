I get a kick out of the new Who fans, who call it great. They are entitled to that opinion, but the new series has not yet gotten there, it's getting there. It's definitely good. <br /> <br /> First things good. The special effects are obviously better almost 20 years later since the last episode of Doctor Who "Battlefield" aired. <br /> <br /> One thing the BBC has always liked is Doctor Who (except when they tried to cancel in the 70s and 80s). However, anticipation and pressure were great, but I think the new series passed the test, it's good, it's still not great, because it has flaws. Some of the "Dalek" stories were very poor. I suppose it was written in a few minutes by some idiot who never bothered to redo the Dalek character or never bothered to watch the old series. "Aliens in London" was by far the best episode. So far, a new Aliens story has begun that has lasted several episodes, including "Boomtown." <br /> <br /> Now, the other bad things, partner Rose, Billie Piper, are not great. She's actually very annoying, but since she's Dr. Who, a young bopper had to be eventually picked and she got the part. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is well respected, he started picking up his niche. He tried to play the character, direct and funny, always missing the right punchline, but he took it much more seriously and it shows. <br /> Continuity wise there are still some problems that were not solved well, Paul McGannn was still the doctor before that, but he was not put back. <br /> <br /> In addition, although the series in general is very good, I did not miss an episode and never get annoying, so I recommend any fan of Doctor Who to check and see the new series Doctor Who.
