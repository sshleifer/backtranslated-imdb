Following the lines of the classic formula to the point of giving another leap of material, the remake of The Thing becomes one of the coolest remakes of his time. John Carpenter shapes what must have been a rather vague script about certain things (or perhaps very descriptive, who knows), bringing incredibly infamous, puppets and bright animatronics from Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the hostile and discouraged environment that Carpenter establishes with his characters. The film tells the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle of an arctic climate, set against a malevolent force that takes the forms of others. You are given a full life by choosing Carpenter's tones and surprises. For someone who follows in the footsteps of Howard Hawks, the filmmaker here has much more confidence and talent in performing the material than most who have had the chance to have another old movie. With the effects, people working full force - amidst what would probably follow the Backdraft as containing the highest number of shots per scene (could become overkill, but everything fits into the suspense afterwards of a time) - the actors act as a great ensemble. Unlike the Predator squadron, these are mostly just men who work regularly, with the coming leader of Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (a very good role for his style, excellent indeed). Juicy support papers are available to people like Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it's refreshing to see how the absurd kind of what's going on in the movie (an alien that starts with the dogs and then moves on to others in a bloody, transforming and demented way) is a pit against a timing tone like this with everyone . I have loved the long silences from time to time, with the strange and curious music of Ennio Morricone in the background (and this bottom line is worthwhile in itself). <br /> <br /> It's like at least delivering what strives for your genre / cult audience. He's still one of Carpenter's best; a rare breed of horror films where the story is told clearly and precisely through the position of the camera, the dialogue and the time with the scenes. This is not to say that the film is not full of violence, it is, and in fact sometimes it's almost funny. But since this goes back to what is ridiculously akin to a bygone era, the creatures / make-up, along with the stable, well-calculated script, were made completely without the CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real and atmospheric for a T.
