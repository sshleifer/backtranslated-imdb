This film travels more than 8 shots, 2 kisses and 100 cliches of what should be possible. However, it still works. Bright. <br /> <br /> As I was driving home from the theater, I tried to figure out how he escaped with movie clips like the pages of a handwriting novel blowing on a beach or the impossible series of random coincidences without all the public being raising and shouting, "I've seen it a million times before! And you've gone beyond the edge of credibility!" But the actors were so charming and the screen so full of credible extras that I forgot to care. A friend who saw me said that he transported him to Paris so perfectly that he was disappointed when we left the theater and realized that we were still in Indiana. <br /> <br /> Overall, a romantic comedy thriller with subtle wit and elan.
