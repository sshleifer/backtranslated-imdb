I have reason to love the great users of a camera; the fluid direction of the action lends itself to a fast-paced adventure narrative and comedy; but such a skill, in the hands of a Vidor King or an Anthony Mann, can also be applied to work at the level of idea. This is the masterpiece of Paul Wendkos. Your storyline can be sold in a single pair of phrases. General Hector Cordoba is establishing himself as an almost emperor in northern Mexico and steals an enormous cannon from General Blackjack Pershing. He sends his split, apprehensive but determined crack mission unit, led by George Peppard, to get the cannon back and bring back Cordoba alive, to put an end to the rebellion. The charismatic Raf Vallone plays CÃ³rdoba; the ladies of the play are Giovanna Ralli and Francine York; with the team even more composed by Nico Minardos, Peter Deuel and Don Gordon. Other class supporters include John Larch and John Russell. They also dwell on an operation that is already dangerously dangerous: Miss Ralli and the stubborn Mexican Lieutenant (Gabriela Tinti) whose regiment was betrayed when Cordova set up on its own. The danger multiplies when Gordon's brother as an advanced spy is captured and tortured to death while he has to watch ... and he decides he needs to kill Peppard. The attack that captures the cannon, when Peppard's orders are not obeyed by a regular army type, is one of the most electrifying visual and staging achievements in film history; the penetration of the Cordoba fortress, the revelations discovered there, and the actions that win the team's mission a chance of victory - or almost victory - are presented without fail. This is a beautiful colorful adventure film with costumes, lighting, art direction scenarios and songs by Elmer Bernstein. Stephen Kandel's script is probably the best of all for a feature film. This is probably the most important of the Western underestimated at the moment, but I have always enjoyed their heroes as a result - getting hardworking workers. But as Peppard reminds his group on the way home, "The problem of being a" hero "- it's the next morning." To find out why he says this, you will have to see "Cannon For Cordoba".
