An incredible performance! This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I know this is being said a lot but I bet you will not regret watching this movie. It's great from the beginning to the last second. The acting (especially of the mother - played by Judith Light) is so compelling, there are not many other films I've seen that could compare to her, and it seems impossible to feel nothing for the people in this drama. There are many and many movies made every year, but if you have to choose just to see a few in your life - do one of them.
