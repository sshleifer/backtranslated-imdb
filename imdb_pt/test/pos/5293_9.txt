Ponyo is a beautiful animated film with some dark tones. It presents a boy-sized story of homesickness and love with ecological implications, but it's not preaching. Hayao Miyazaki merged the Little Mermaid of Andersen with the native myths of Japan and his trademark on the steam punk flights, and the result is very gratifying. There are some scary moments of ocean storms and floods, but they are exciting, not horrible. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wanted to run the waves along the coast, ride in a jellyfish like an elevator, completely transform yourself, or make a friend for life, Ponyo is a fable for you.
