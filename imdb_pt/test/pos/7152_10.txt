I saw this movie and totally loved the characters are great. It's definitely my kind of movie that you do not get bored with in this movie. I love independent films they are so much more rewarding. my husband and I really enjoyed Jay's style. If you're an open-minded person who loves to provoke provocative movies and loves to talk after they're done, you'll love this movie. definitely the movie will trigger some fingers, but who cares about these people probably will not see this movie. It's amazing to see the characters evolve. Jay Floyd has really conquered both sides of the table. Clap applause Jay I hope you're working on another movie.
