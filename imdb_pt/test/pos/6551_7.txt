To be honest, I thought this movie would be a Japanese drama. I was completely wrong. This movie is based on the popular Japanese anime novel of the same name. It tells the story of a city that is cursed by Uzumaki or The Spiral in English. Little by little city dwellers begin to become dangerously and violently obsessed with anything to do with spirals and some of the residents begin to turn into living things that actually have some sort of spiral inside them, like a snail. <br /> <br /> The film was a giant, random, acid journey, twisted with romance and drama. More or less like a "twisted" drama. What makes this movie disturbing is the way some people are obsessed with The Spiral. For example: one parent has a garage full of household objects with built-in spirals, a girl took her extremely long hair and played with an incredibly huge spiral style, a child slowly transformed into a human snail, a man could twist his body into spiral form, a woman tried to open the ear to get the cochlea inside and a teenager ran over so he could be twisted around a car tire and a child was filled in a washing machine so he could become a spiral. Another disturbing aspect of this syndicated good is the atmospheric tone and style in which this film was filmed. The camera angles add to the psychotic and distorted story, in other words, a very good cinematography. The overall coloring of this image makes a rather insane story. The coloring is a mixture of lime green, yellow and a little orange and the special effects with some of the spirals are impressive. <br /> <br /> However, like many Japanese movies, this one has a tone of forbidden love and romance between a girl and a boy. However, with all the spirals and strange happenings happening in the city, it is difficult to keep up with the relationship of the two teenagers. But somehow it's very irrelevant, more like a second-hand story that has nothing to do with the real history of the city obsessed with the spiral. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes vastly different and bizarre foreign films. It's just madness and insanity enough, it touched me.
