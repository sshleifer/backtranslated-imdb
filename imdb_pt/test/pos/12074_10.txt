Ann-Margret did the best job she ever did in her movie making history. I felt like she was Mrs. Frey. There may be one or two Ann-Margret movies that I have not seen since her movie debut in "Pocket full of Miracles" with Betty Davis in 1961. I feel she was totally underestimated in the industry. Although she was nominated for an Emmy Award for this role in "Who's Gonna Love My Children," she was forgotten. As she was nominated for an Oscar for her roles in "Carnal Knowledge" and "Tommy," she was snubbed. Most of all, I think everyone did a great acting job, including all the kids in "Who Will Love My Children". Yes, it's a sad movie (as may be true stories), but it was worth it. Thank you.
