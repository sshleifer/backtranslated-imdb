Filmed less than a year after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the subject was fresh in the minds of the cast, director and audience. Most of the cast is made up of soldiers and officers who have just returned from the war. The Soviet army cooperated a lot during the filming, which is strange. <br /> <br /> The intervention of Afghanistan was a bloody and senseless war, in which even the generals had forgotten the reasons for the bloodshed. This film shows the tension and cruelty of military life, the emotional atrophy experienced by the troops and the pain that convulsed a small nation torn by war and civil war. <br /> <br /> There is no shortage of powerful scenes. . One of the first is the filming of steel coffins being loaded onto a transport bound for the USSR. The solders carry out their work while an officer calmly selects the destinations: Moscow, Rostov, Donetsk, the Baltic. <br /> <br /> An earlier review describes the last scene with Major Bandura as illogical. It is perfectly logical and in the spirit of the film: the only human relationship that Bandura maintained was with the Afghan family he accidentally kills in the attack. Having lost his only buffer against the folly of war, Bandura turns his back on the boy (and his weapon) in resignation to his fate. <br /> I particularly liked the last scene: a bunch of MI-28s going up through the mountains as a pilot's voice shouts: "Uhodim! Uhodim rebyata!" (We're leaving! Boys, we're leaving!) In a tone of sincere relief. <br /> <br /> Afhanskii Izlom is an excellent film - brutally honest and as absurd as they come.
