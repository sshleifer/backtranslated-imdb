Rush in Rio is simply an incredible DVD. This concert is one of the peak moments in Rush's history and they deliver their music brilliantly and with more power than ever before. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to actually be in this concert, and not just that, I was in the first row taking the gate that separated the audience from the stage !! It's the first and only time I've seen a live Rush show and it was a dream come true for me. I have no words to accurately describe this experience, but I can say that it is one of the highlights of my life. <br /> <br /> Some people complain about the sound of this DVD saying it is not very clear and polished, but the sound you hear is real, true to what happened on the show. It is raw, powerful and so authentic that every time I watch it, I come back and relive this beautiful moment. Many artists record live shows and make many adjustments, so the end product is far from what the show really was. Of course you can achieve a very sophisticated and polished sound this way, but you can not get the real thing. This is not the case at Rush in Rio, this is the real deal !! I admit that I appreciate the concert DVDs, I love music and the sound is a very important aspect, but it is refreshing to listen to a show that is so honest. You hear Rush the way they sound in a live performance with no tricks, no adjustments. This is a real live concert on DVD. <br /> <br /> I recommend Rush in Rio, the set-list is fantastic and the performances of Geddy, Alex and Neil are amazing. Not to mention the crowd, you can see how much they love Rush and sing along to every song, even YYZ, which is an instrument! I actually seem to sing twice; in Tom Sawyer I sing "always hopeful but displeased" and in Earthshine I sing "I only reflect". It's only a few seconds, but I just could not believe my eyes when I saw myself on a DVD! Impressive!! I hope you enjoy this magnificent concert of the greatest band on Earth.
