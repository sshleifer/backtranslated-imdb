While on vacation in Northern Australia, Gracie (Diana Glenn), her husband Adam (Andy Rodoreda) and younger sister Lee (Maeve Dermody) decide to tour the Blackwater Barry in the swamp to fish. His guide Jim (Ben Oxenbould) uses a small motor boat and takes the tourist along the river to a remote spot. When they stop, they are attacked by a huge crocodile that captures their boat and immediately kills Jim. The three survivors climb into a tree and when they realize that help will never come to rescue them, they decide to try to find a way out to the sheltered place. However, in muddy water, the boat is turned over and the crocodile lurks the trio under the water. <br /> <br /> "Black Water" is a tense, realistic and dramatic low budget film and according to the warning in the beginning, based on a true event. The acting of the unknown Diana Glenn, Maeve Dermody and Andy Rodoreda is top-notch, lending credence to this simple but frightening story. There are many similarities between this film and "Prey", but in different environments. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Deep Fear" ("Deep Fear")
