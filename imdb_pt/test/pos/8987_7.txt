This movie starts out as a T'n'A college movie, but looks pretty ugly after the main character's sister is raped by a gang of bikers driving a van. He has a good pace, and James Van Patten does a good job in this Cannon note film. This was the first movie I saw on Parkway Drive-in, here in Toronto. The main feature was "Alphabet City," and "Young Warriors was the added feature." Of the two films, "Young Warriors" was a lot more fun and memorable.If you're a fan of blow 'em up, overly violent movies, this would be a great addition to any collection.
