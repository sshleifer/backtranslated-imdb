Just exactly how director John Madden came to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the role of an Italian officer and a Greek villager in an honorable story: Captain Correl's Mandolin, has just escaped me! Witness: Cage's hesitant and inconsistent accent amid a horrendous over-acting, with Cruz - more properly scaled up as a spoiled Latino alongside Johnny Depp in "Blow" - basically as a repeat performance under the pretext of a Greek nurse ... yes, it was painful. But there were saving graces. <br /> <br /> The story itself is thrilling and tragic, and Cage has a musical ability (redeeming, that is!). Then there was an excellent performance by Oscar Callibre's John Hurt (father of Cruz, the village doctor), as well as by Irene Papas, each as the elders of the village, as well as by Christian Bale (son of Popes) freedom of the village. , go far to counterbalance awkward performances (especially in the beginning) by Cross and Cage. Well, the last two seem to grow in their respective roles as the movie progresses, but it's gnashing from the beginning. Finally, the scenery itself and the photograph could garner a technical award, and this provides pleasant distractions when needed most. <br /> <br /> John Hurt already has two Oscar nominations and that would be a third; I hope he achieves this as his performance, as the Doctor makes this movie worth it. The true test of a supporting actor / actress is whether or not the film would be the same without the character in question, and in this case, it certainly would not ... not even close. <br /> <br /> Entertainment value but for the aforementioned positive factors that help raise the level. See if you have not. Rating = 3.5 stars (out of five).
