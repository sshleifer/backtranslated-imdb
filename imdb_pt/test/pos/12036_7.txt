Ok, when it comes to plotting, this movie is far from believable and also a little silly. However, despite its many shortcomings, the movie manages to function - as long as you turn off your brain and simply let yourself enjoy the zaniness of it all. If you can not then you probably will not like this movie very much. <br /> <br /> In one of the strangest plots of the 1930s, Robert Montgomery plays a guy who lives near the Arctic Circle in a wireless station. How exactly he reached such a remote outpost is uncertain, but in this very, very lonely and isolated existence, comes a constant chain of guests - even though it has been years since he had seen no one but Eskimos. <br /> <br /> First, Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy arrive when their plane crashes. They are supposed to be on their way to Montreal - how they got THAT away from the course is unbelievable! Reginald is a boring, monotonous guy who is really worried about Montgomery since Robert has not seen a woman for a long time and Owen seems to be in constant fear that Montgomery is out to steal Loy for himself. As for Montgomery, that's exactly what your plans are! For a long time, you never really understand why Loy is engaged to Owen - since he is as attractive as a soggy loaf. <br /> <br /> Soon, Loy and Montgomery fall in love, but that's all in vain when out of the blue AGAIN, the old Montgomery fiancee arrives to announce that she's there to marry him !! Considering that for more than two years she never wrote and refused to follow him, Montgomery naturally assumed that the relationship was over-but the sudden arrival of the annoying and annoying bride is enough to destroy the plans that Loy and Montgomery were making. <br /> <br /> How all this is solved is something you can see for yourself. As for the movie, the plot is very silly and artificial - I can not argue that. BUT, it's also pretty funny and charming and I see this movie as a crazy comedy that is only one or two steps below contemporary films like BRINGING UP BABY. Bobo, light but also very charming. Worth seeing, though not particularly credible.
