I have to admit that I had low expectations for this movie. But I was surprised to find it fun, interesting and funny. It's a fun thriller and not a horror movie. There were moments that made my hair stand! Even better, though, were the very funny, sometimes hysterical, comic moments in the movie (you'll know who I'm talking about). There are also some great special effects (and humor and special effects are not necessarily separate). <br /> <br /> The acting, on the whole, is very good - far better than a typical low budget. Horror Movie. Lead (Jackie) in particular, and many of the smaller supporting roles (such as the lawyer, the couple who live next door, the pizza joint) are well represented. If they had not been, the film would not have kept my interest and I would have lost my belief in the story. This is a good, interesting low budget thriller and definitely worth a rental!
