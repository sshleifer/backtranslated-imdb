The Messiah was a compulsive vision from beginning to end. The story centered on seemingly random murders of men in London in various horrible ways. The DCI Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) has to find the truth that, to his surprise, is a little closer to home than he could imagine. <br /> <br /> The thrilling drama and Ken Stott was brilliant. I hope we have not seen the latest DCI Red Metcalfe.
