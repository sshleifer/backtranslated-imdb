An incredible movie, I just saw it and I want to see it again. I had never heard of Derek Jarman before seeing this movie, but now I am, I can not wait to see your others. The film has a whole new perspective on Shakespeare's The Tempest, I'm sure he would have appreciated Jarman's use of the play's themes of love, magic, darkness, and atmospheric tension. OK, OK, there may have been a bit of nudity in the movie that I had not really anticipated, but it did not offend me, it just surprised me and made the film more unpredictable. One Spoiler (For those of a nervous disposition: Quickly advance the flashback scene with Sycorax & Caliban and Ariel as your slave, your handsome graphic.) Overall, if you're beginning to find Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare performances flaccid and monotonous, then you need to see it Fantastic and surreal, this is going to stop you, but only if you allow it. Have an open mind - and then let this movie work, it's magic for you.
