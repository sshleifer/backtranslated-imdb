This short film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gay, straight, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American gun culture, divorce and marriage; yet you can be sensitive to the issues surrounding each. Kathy Bates is "Incredible," Grace Beasley, and as a far-reaching actress, she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual movie as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedic talents like Dan Akroid as Max, her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is just intriguing enough to entertain. Jonathan Price plays Victor Fox, a gay singer murdered by a crossbow killer in Chicago. His valued Dirk Simpson, played by the magnificent Rupert Everett, must surpass Victor's brothers, including Lynn Redgrave, who wants to turn his house into a homage museum, and joins Bates and his daughter-in-law, Maudy Beasley. to find the killer among the Chicago homeless. <br /> <br /> The entire cast sings at various points in the chase and is excellent, esp. the talented Price and Bates. This implausible plot, both funny and bizarre, is one of the most decentralized films. Cameos by Julie Andrews, Barry Manlow and Sally Jesse Raphael should tell you how bizarre this movie really is. Strange, funny and off-center, but with a good perspective on people with all kinds of difference.
