I've been strangely drawn to this movie since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 1980s. I say oddly because it's a little ridiculous, a genre I'm not particularly interested in. The dialogue is pompous and absurdly philosophical (making sense, of course, only for Franco-Italian producers) and completely strange plot. What he gets is a wonderfully hypnotic and completely enjoyable climate. The setting (the beautiful Philippines), the soft focus nudity and the wonderful soundtrack all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a kind of film rarely seen today. It is truly one of my great "guilty pleasures." I was lucky enough to find it on an old record and watched more often than I think it is healthy. A temperament is worth it.
