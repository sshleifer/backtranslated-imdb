This is one of the best non-English series I've ever seen. He weaves simple and double crime-solving episodes together with a personal aspect that you simply can not get on the CSI. All individual characters have personal lives that blend well with daily work and occasionally interfere. In addition, all characters can evolve naturally throughout the episodes. <br /> <br /> The casting is superb and was recorded throughout Denmark, giving a good example of the highlights that the majestic country has to offer. Unfortunately, only 32 episodes have been made, however, they are high-level television. Here's hoping they'll consider doing a few more episodes of the same caliber.
