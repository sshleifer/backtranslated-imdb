IT'S OK. Whoever invented this film hates humanity and wants to see them all cutting their throats. This "film" was absolute and absolute. What the hell was with those strange old eyes? Seriously, she was having some kind of horrible drug and then she just likes to think she could control people? She was running with her evil evil eye and it was like what? Do I have a booger coming out of my nose? What are you looking at? Are you like the sea witch or something? All and all though I found the graphics were top notch. That's the only reason I would give a ten. But just cover your ears when you're watching. The pure and complete evil that comes from this movie will make your ears bleed and your eyelids fall. Who knows? You can even knot the small intestine. You better watch out for fools.
