A highly politically charged drama that, although biased, is extremely well treated and one of the most intelligent films ever made. It contains almost no preaching but follows a naive TV reporter who gradually realizes the threat posed by nuclear power plants, not because of an inherent danger but because providers are more interested in the bottom line than in the safety of those Many people hated the film because they saw it as a political pamphlet made by ultra-liberals like Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas, but if you see it simply as a drama, it's exciting, exciting, complete. of distinct and well-developed characters, and finally a truly suspenseful contemporary suspense that comes close to home. <br /> <br /> Historical Note: For some, especially for those who work in the energy industry and subway residents of Harrisburg, PA. perhaps less than a week after launching the film, a devastating explosion occurred at the Three Mile Island nuclear facility. <br /> <br /> Update, 04/08/2007: In almost a decade since I wrote this review for the first time, I have heard many comments about the film. One thing I really need to note is that this film is not the "ultraliberal" anti-nuclear speech that is often labeled as being. While creators and stars are (or were) notable liberals of the "Hollywood establishment," what this movie is about is not the very idea of ​​nuclear power, but rather the idea of ​​greed , corruption, and human fallibility by questioning the potential risks of something that nature has already made dangerous. <br /> <br /> No one who accepts reality can argue that human exposure to nuclear radiation is at least quite likely to be fatal. My close friends who worked at a nuclear power plant for several years even told me about their employer's official policy on the "safe" maximum exposure levels their employees could handle. <br /> <br /> You do not need to believe that corporations are inherently evil in order to accept that individuals, in search of wealth and power, are greedy and often corrupt. And even if you refute that statement, you can not dispute that all humans are prone to make mistakes. When it comes to exposing innocent people to nuclear radiation, we can not afford to make mistakes, and that, more than anything, is the argument that this film seeks to make. <br /> <br /> Condemn him if need be, but try to have a small perspective. We are currently engaged in a war whose actual results are very different from those originally planned, an incredibly costly war with no end in sight. And if you think that war was necessary to combat global terrorism, you can not challenge the reality that the duration, the financial cost and, more important, the loss of human lives far exceeded the levels that the "experts" ensured. We back in 2003. So even if no one involved is greedy or corrupt, "mistakes were made," and mistakes of a rather serious magnitude, to top it all off. The same kind of serious mistakes, if allowed to emerge in the nuclear industry, could make much of the Earth's surface uninhabitable.
