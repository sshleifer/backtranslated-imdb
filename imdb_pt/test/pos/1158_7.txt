This is a perfectly watchable adventure movie to watch, with a great cast and a good story based on real facts. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the story of the film is based on real events. It's mostly an adventure story, with all the usual ingredients you'd expect from an adventure film set in an Arab world. So much sword fighting, good old fashioned honor, religion and a proud proud country. But the film is also full of humor, to make the film light and enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> The constant back and forth movement between the plot of Morocco involving Sean Connery and Candice Berger and the American plot. involving Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) was not the best approach possible in my opinion. The two things have totally different steps, totally different characters, they are just totally different worlds! Of course, both lines of the story are connected and focused on the same thing, but the contrast between the two worlds is too great to let it work. He does not always make the film look connected and a little disjointed. The American plot is most often more political, while the Moroccan plot is purely adventurous and full of action. In the end, you could even imagine what would be the main point or Roosevelt in that movie. It seems that John Milius is just a big fan of him. The American plot often took most of the rhythm from the most interesting and action-packed Moroccan plot in Morocco. After all, John Milius has always been at his best as an action director. <br /> <br /> It is not until half the half of the movie that the movie goes online. The biggest and highest staggered action of the movie then comes on the scene. Especially the final big battle does not disappoint. I wanted the whole movie to be like this. That way, this movie would also be better known, no doubt. <br /> <br /> The film has a great musical track of Jerry Goldsmith, who is perhaps better known than the film itself. The film is also beautiful and has a great design of production and action and nice battle sequences. Apparently, the movie costs only $ 4,000,000 to make, but this is really hard to believe considering the settings and size of the movie. I mean John Milius, his best known film "Conan the Barbarian" cost about $ 20,000,000 to make, but it was much more exaggerated and was less impressive on its scale. Very funny to see an Arab speak in a big fat Scottish accent, but hey, it's Sean Connery so you just tend to accept that. It serves your role well. So does Candice Bergen. It's always hard for a female character to look believable and work on a movie like this, but she can. Also John Huston plays a big part in this movie! <br /> <br /> A perfectly good watchable film! <br /> <br /> 7/10
