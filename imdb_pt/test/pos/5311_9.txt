only a few can understand the character of Leland, and to do that you're probably innate to see the two sides of life, and facing that reality is very difficult and can lead some to evil deeds (like Leland's character), but because and real reasons that their intentions were good, in the sense that the intention to save another from physical or mental pain (in this case) over time. and it's really sad how most people in this movie make mistakes, but the only character to make one through good intentions is killed by it. The lesson of this film is for the unique person to see, perceive, face and correct the real-life situation you see and hit, or inspire someone who can hit a wrong situation. but before that ... you have to see both sides of something and rationalize it for the sake of a long peace and tranquility of all human life.aka-Don't BE IGNORANT
