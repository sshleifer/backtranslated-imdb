It's true that this is not John Sayles's best film (Brother From Another Planet), but it's also not entirely forgettable, if not for any reason other than his message. Like Batman, Wild Thing's parents were murdered in front of him, leaving him to defend himself in The Zone, a corrupt section of a nameless city where greed and violence reign supreme. Instead of getting involved with the likes of Chopper (Robert David), Wild Thing fights for justice, using his Tai Chi powers and strange impressions of cats, occasionally lighting up in flames. He becomes a kind of urban legend, a modern Robin Hood and a hero for ages. 1987 at its best, WILD LIVES
