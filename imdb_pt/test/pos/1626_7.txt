I have not yet read a single book by Dan Brown, but I have watched all the adaptations of his films. I will not fall into the game to evaluate this with the previous because the scope is not really the same: in fact, this is a thriller, a race against time full of puzzles. <br /> <br /> Plot is very twisted, imaginative and the cast is excellent: I've never been a big fan of Hanks, but he delivers well. I noticed your jeans shirt (the one that shed blood) because I look for one so in vain! The Italian researcher is a brilliant newcomer to me, but I really applauded the portrait of Ewan MacGregor: his inner faith and calm are truly impressive. <br /> <br /> I really like the debate between science and religion. The action at the Vatican seemed like a vacation. Finally, I'm not sure if this helps add new converts to Christianity. With all the presence of gold and man displayed, anyone would ask what charity means and why women are so dismissed from church life, while representing half or more of believers.
