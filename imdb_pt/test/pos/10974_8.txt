No bullets, no secret agents, a fun, funny and believable story. Met some of the producers / actors of this movie in the theater. They seemed as personal as their characters on screen. You may not hear about this movie on TV with high-value ads, but it's definitely worth checking out. I spent $ 8 for a movie ticket on many other movies that were not so much fun. Looking forward to future projects by this production company.
