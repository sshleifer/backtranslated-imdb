Van Damme has made some great movies over the years and this hits a big ten in my books. From the Mexican scene to the five-star fight scenes, this movie was incredible. The film is about border patrol officers protecting the territory that is the border of Mexico. Former Navy Seals are smuggling drugs from Mexico to the United States, Van Damme and Scott Atkins give impressive performances as the cop and the villain. Although this film was not as good as death, but still gave the action, acting and the film a five-star look. I always look forward to these action movies and they are getting better. keep them coming van damme. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you liked movies like - Till Death, The Hard Body and the Second in Command.
