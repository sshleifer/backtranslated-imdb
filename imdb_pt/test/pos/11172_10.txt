Michael Kehoe has done a great job, especially considering it's just his second start as a writer, producer and director. Usually the "newbies" have no vision and direction when driving a major production, but "Dominion" proves that Kehoe is going to Hollywood! With beautiful landscapes, Dominion has experienced cast members (especially Thomson & James) who communicate Kehoe's vast vision with exceptional clarity. Few films can blend the slasher / horror genre with a genuine sense of action / adventure, but Dominion did it completely. This film certainly qualifies as one of the first-line movies in both categories. If you're looking for quick action with more than a little suspense, look no further. I am looking forward to Kehoe's future projects with great enthusiasm. Well done!!!
