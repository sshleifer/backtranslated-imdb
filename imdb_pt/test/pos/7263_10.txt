Usually I hate vintage movies. Living in England is a nightmare at the moment if you have an allergy to period dramas - which I do. However this is the best. Do not take yourself seriously and Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are great together, the good of Liv Tyler, even though their English accent is dubious !! <br /> <br /> The movie has it all for someone who just wants to go to the movies to have fun. Has action, adventure, drama and comedy. I'm not sure how the jokes will translate into the ocean, but I hope that happens. It would be a shame for the American public to lose this movie. This shows that English filmmakers can produce something that does not involve constant swearing and sex. Both feature this, but in a balanced format. Iain Robertson's portrait of the well-made gentleman is brilliant and the two brothers who are also part of the upper class are hilarious! <br /> <br /> As the trailer for 'The Spy who Shagged Me' is say .... "If you see another movie" .... this spring make it Plunkett and Macleane. It's fun, action and of course Jonny Lee Miller with an English accent for a change!
