Since playing for the first time in 1998, GoldenEye has been one of my favorite video games. In fact, I recently bought an N64 purely so I could own it and play it more often! The game is almost perfect: the single-player mode does a fantastic job of immersing yourself in Bond's shoes, with varied mission objectives, compelling weapons and excellent level design. Even though the enemy's artificial intelligence is fairly basic by current standards, this only adds to GoldenEye's appeal. The method of getting cheats (complete levels within a strict time limit) was also groundbreaking when the title was released, and so far I have not yet been able to decipher some of them! <br /> <br /> The game comes with a wonderful multiplayer mode for up to four players, and while this is not as advanced as the Combat Simulator in the continuation of the game "Perfect Dark", it is still incredibly rewarding to blow up your opponents in small pieces with a fire damper RC-P90! ;-)
