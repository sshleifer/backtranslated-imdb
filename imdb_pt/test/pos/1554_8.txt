I also saw this movie at a film festival, but unlike the previous poster, I found it interesting and original. In a sea of ​​terrible features, shorts are usually twice as bad as small budgets and poor acting. However, it is a small tense thriller that refers to "The Outer Limits". The performances are solid, not expected otherwise by Morse or McGinley, and the direction is clear and in the money. I personally find it difficult to reconcile the comments from the previous poster with the movie I saw. A.WO.L is very appropriately written by Shane Black, who, as is usually the case, plays with the genre honoring the pulp stories, while blinking at the audience and never taking himself too seriously. All in all A.W.O.L proves to be an extremely well executed and entertaining film.
