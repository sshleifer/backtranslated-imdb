I have to tell you that I've been a Star Trek TNG fan since I was a kid. <br /> <br /> Well some time ago I gave a friend my DS9 episodes and I asked him <br /> <br /> "Hey man, what have you been watching lately, because I'm done to watch every episode of TNG, "he said. "Well, I have these episodes of Farscape." I said, "Okay, let me try" I was sure at the time I did not like it, because I was just watching TNG and found it great. "I had 3 episodes, seen but the show did not impress me much, I initially found it childish and I thought it was just another TV show, good but regular adventures but the music was a bit different, special effects and I had the vague impression that the actors did not fully enter the skin of the characters. <br /> <br /> I watched 3 other episodes thinking that 3 eps were not enough to decide whether I liked it or not since then the show began to I got a good understanding of the action and wanted to see what happened next to poor Crichton ... the rest is history. I think I like the freedom of the characters in the context of the action, unlike Star Trek where everyone slept when they should do and a lot of high tech bullshit. <br /> <br /> The show got better every episode, very interesting story line ..... what can I say, this movie is like poetry. <br /> <br /> I recommend !!!
