This concert is the kind of concert that happens only every twenty years or so, Confessions of Madonna in a time of dance will certainly be remembered as one of the highlights of her career. She is 48 years old and looks just divine, she accompanies dancers who are almost twenty years younger than her. I'm also very happy to report that all the songs were sung live, which is good because it actually sounds better live. Each song was so unique, the visuals were impressive. The performance of "Live to tell" was fantastic and left me speechless, "Isaac" was exotic and beautiful and was rich in political symbolism, the Arabian horn, the American eagle released. I particularly enjoyed the rockin 'performance of' I Love New York ', I almost got up in my living room and cheered when she told her critics to suck George Bushes ****. And again, I was impressed by the inspired music of the '70s (hell remix). This spectacular Decedent Concert made a fan out of me. <br /> <br /> Verdict: Highly Recommended with a Capital H.
