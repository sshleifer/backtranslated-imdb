Now I'm a little biased since I'm a big late-night television fan. I've been a loyal fan of Jay Leno for about 6 or 7 years, and I think he's one of the funniest and most talented comedians out there. And David Letterman is also a great comedian, though I only watch his show (unless Jay repeats it) during the commercials or when he has a better guest than Jay on the show. Daniel Roebuck and John Michael Higgins are both good actors and they look a lot like Jay and Dave, but do they disappear in the characters? No. Roebuck can barely play Jay's voice and expression, grunting in a loud tone, like a castrati Marlon Brando. Higgins preaches David's facial expressions (for example, his trademark squirms), but he does not preach Dave's voice. Those who are not big late night TV fans may be less biased. There are some comedians who can do imitations of Jay. Why could not they have selected one of them for the role? And so does Dave. I'd rather they had Norm McDonald playing the role. Norm does not look too much like Dave, but he did a great deal of it on SNL. "Hey ... do you have any chewing gum?" That was so hilarious! <br /> <br /> However, I learned a lot about the wars of the dawn that I had very little knowledge in the beginning. I never watched "The Tonight Show" before Jay Leno hosted, so I did not know about the fight to finally replace Johnny Carson and the countless negotiations that finally convinced Dave to switch to CBS. I knew very little about what happened behind the scenes and found the film very enlightening. And Kathy Bates gives a knockout performance as the former executive producer of "The Tonight Show." She basically steals the movie. My score: 7 (out of 10) <br /> <br />
