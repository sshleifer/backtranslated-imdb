Not being a movie buff, I'm not familiar with the names of top directors, screenwriters, producers and the like, but I can tell a great movie when I see one. <br /> <br /> The creators of this great film could well be now at the top of their fields, or can get there very soon. I know the actors are already there. <br /> <br /> It takes a talent closer to the genius to show as realism as a national tragedy as Vietnam has impacted the daily lives of a typically American family and made us see why there are so many homeless veterans of Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Without getting into free scenes of blood and bloodshed, this makes us understand why so many youg men had flashbacks of what had happened. /> <br /> The dialogue is particularly exciting, and gives us an idea of ​​what happened in so many families after Vietnam. <br /> <br /> I wish there were more good films like this, not just about Vietnam, but also about other social conditions.
