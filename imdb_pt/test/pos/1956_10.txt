I really have no complaints about this movie except for the disturbing scenes with the body. I fell on him as I switched to the TV one night. The acting was really amazing, I did not expect it to be any better than it looked! I found that Keanu's acting (which seems to be SAME since 1986, which is a very good thing, hehe) was really * great *, and Crispin played his character perfectly! This movie is a hidden gem! It's a new twist on reality for the '80s, compared to the other teen films made by the brat pack (even though I really like those moives too). All in all, I give you the thumbs!
