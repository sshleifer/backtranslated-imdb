RENDITION is a film not to be missed with the solid writing of Kelley Sane and with the direction of Gavin Hood, which leads us to a story that is a journey through a man's journey through hell. Once again, Meryl Streep in a compelling CIA role today and great performances from a cast of superlative actors in Reese Witherspoon, Jake Gyllenhall and Alan Arkin, along with actors of Middle Eastern descent who contribute to the reality of the story. <br /> <br /> In RENDITION, you see how "terrorism can create terrorism" and, as the film progresses, tying history to what is occurring in the Middle East, reality is brought to the screen. External shots increase the intensity of the story and Peter Sarsgaard does a brilliant job of playing an Assistant in the "ass kiss" mode of how American politics is conducted. Too bad that there has not been a larger audience for this film, since along with THE VALLEY OF ELAH and LIONS FOR LAMBS, RENDITION plays an important role in showing the public how the struggle and protection of democracy can be seriously lost.
