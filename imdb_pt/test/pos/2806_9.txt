I have to say that this movie was excellently produced and is at the top of the ratings as a typical science fiction movie! I liked it .. it's a science fiction movie if you want a thriller watching another channel .. This is what scifi lovers want. Excellently produced by one of the best Sci-Fi producers, Scot Vandiver! OK, the special effects were not great, but what a great cast! A little more money could have been used for purposes, but again, what science fiction has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change channels if you do not like this kind of movie. Movies like Mission Impossible and Braveheart are great, but they are not science fiction movies. Sci fi produces excellent films such as Sabretooth, Alien Hunters etc. done .. keep them producing!
