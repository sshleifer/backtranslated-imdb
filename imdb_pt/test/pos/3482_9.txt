I usually do not comment on movies, since I'm in the movie distribution business, but I must say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no extravagant speeches or exploitation of people with disabilities to try to make this movie more "Hollywood". James McAvoy is such an exceptional actor that I could not look away from him if he tried. I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well. I can not believe this is your first real movie. Brenda Fricker plays a small role but, as usual, she is excellent. This is a movie for everyone to see how lucky we all are. If you like to wake up and mask, you will enjoy this story. You owe it to yourself to check out this movie.
